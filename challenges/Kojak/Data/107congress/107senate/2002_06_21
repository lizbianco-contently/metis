We know You well enough to know that You do \nnot need the assurance of our gratitude. Surely, the need for \nthanksgiving must have something to do with our spiritual health. The \npsalmist said, ``O Lord my God, I will give thanks to You forever.''--\nPsalm 30:12. In this life and in heaven, forever is a long time. Paul \nsaid, ``In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God for \nyou.''--1 Thess. 5:18.\n  In everything, Lord? Suddenly we know the secret. Thanksgiving is the \nmemory of the heart. We have great memories of Your faithfulness. They \nbecome cherished memories as we tell You how grateful we are, not only \nfor Your blessings, but, for You. We say with Joyce Kilmer, ``Thank God \nfor God!''\n  Most important of all, we know that when we thank You for all Your \ngood gifts, the growth of false pride is stunted. And when we can thank \nYou even for the rough and tough things in life, we really can let go \nof our control and trust You to bring good out of the most distressing \nthings. And so, we give thanks! And we praise You for the Senators here \nwho will be casting their votes today. Thank You for the privilege of \nliving in this democracy. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5881-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Debbie Stabenow led the Pledge of Allegiance, as \nfollows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5881-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am sure everybody is aware that this is \nthe last vote of the day. I know our colleagues, both Senator Levin and \nSenator Warner, are interested, however, in continuing debate on the \nbill throughout the day and on Monday. We will be in session. We will \nbe in a position to entertain amendments and to bring them to closure.\n  My hope is we can use these 2 days. I am inclined to press for a \nfinite list, but we will not do that today. Senators should be aware \nthat next week is going to be a very busy week. Those who want to wait \nuntil Tuesday or Wednesday should not count on having a lot of time to \ndebate their amendments. We have 2 great days--today and Monday--to \noffer amendments. I hope Senators will do so.\n  There will be a vote Monday night--at least one and maybe more. So \nSenators should be prepared to vote on Monday after 5 o'clock. We will \nannounce a time certain after consultation with the Republican leader, \nand Senators should be prepared to come back and vote on Monday so that \nwe can begin a full day of work on the bill on Tuesday and, hopefully, \ncomplete our work Wednesday or Thursday.\n  I know the distinguished Republican leader has some comments and \nquestions. I will yield the floor to him at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Daschle for his comments and \nyielding so I can engage in a colloquy with him.\n  First, regarding the schedule and the majority leader's intent to \nmove forward, I certainly support what he is trying to do. I think good \nprogress has been made this week on the Defense authorization bill. I \nthink we have disposed of two or three issues that could have been very \ncontentious. It took a little time, but we got them done without much \ndifficulty. I assume that next week we will have not more than 4\\1/2\\ \ndays to finish this bill and maybe some other actions in addition to \nthat.\n  I join the majority leader in urging Members, if they have a serious \namendment, to identify it to the managers. This is aimed at both sides. \nLet's not make up this fictitious list of grand designs where Senators \nsay ``I have 10 amendments'' when everybody knows he or she has one or \nnone.\n  Also, it seems to me, as I recall from studying the list, that there \nare about four other amendments that could take some time and could be \nsomewhat controversial and require some votes. But there should not be \na long list. I hope our managers will not have to sit here all day \nMonday begging Senators to offer amendments and nobody showing up, and \nthen whine on Thursday if the majority leader has to file a cloture and \nsay: I got cut out.\n  These managers are excellent and experienced and they are going to \ntry to move forward. There has been good cooperation and we need to \ncontinue that. Hopefully, we can do effective work on Monday and get a \nlist that we are really going to have to do, and avoid forcing the \nmajority leader to have to file cloture, as he clearly will have to do \nTuesday afternoon if we don't have some idea of how we are going to \nproceed. I used to get into that position, too. It is not always the \nmajority leader's choice.\n  I want to press the point that this is serious legislation. The \ncountry needs it, our military men and women need it. The majority \nleader did the right thing in moving to it. He has a right to expect us \nto work in good faith in bringing up amendments that are serious and \nneed to be debated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was going to advise the leadership that \nthe distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, is prepared to \naddress the Senate on his amendment. That could start between 4 and \n4:30 and perhaps meet the hour designated with the leadership for a \nvote.\n  I also wish to request, respectfully, of the leaders to repeat the \nstatements made yesterday by both leaders to the effect that the \ncriteria to be established by the distinguished chairman and myself is \nthat the amendments must be relevant. Would the leader be kind enough \nto repeat that for the record so all can hear.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me reiterate what we did say \nyesterday for the record. Under the agreement we have now entered into, \namendments have to be relevant--not necessarily germane, in the \ndefinition of Senate parlance, but certainly relevant. We leave it to \nthe two managers to determine that--not the Parliamentarians but the \nmanagers. They will be the arbiters of relevancy. They are fair and \nthey are respected on both sides of the aisle. I respect their judgment \nand will stand behind the decisions they make.\n  Having said that, I hope we are limiting ourselves to relevant \namendments, that Senators at least come forward with some understanding \nof what the amendments--relevant amendments--are. While we don't need a \nfinite list today, it would be helpful to know what relevant amendments \nSenators are intending to offer so that we have some ability to \nschedule for the remainder of the week.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Republican leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, I thank the majority leader and the Republican \nleader for their continuing efforts to move this bill along. Senator \nWarner pointed out that Senator Smith will be ready on Monday afternoon \nwith his amendment. I understand Senator Dayton, who is a cosponsor of \nthat amendment, will also be available. We think we have confirmed that \nas well. We could proceed perhaps at 4 o'clock. We expect a rollcall \nvote on that amendment. Perhaps we can get a time agreement on that \namendment today, which will also help facilitate this matter.\n  Both Senator Warner and I will be here this morning at least, we will \nbe here on Monday, and we hope Senators who have relevant amendments \nwill inform us of that. We also are going to be able to clear some \namendments in the next few hours, we hope, and either take care of \nthose today or Monday.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to make a couple of other \npoints. We also need to move some nominations in the next week. Senator \nDaschle and I are trying to find a way to get that process moving. A \nlot of these are not controversial. They are Republican and Democrat, \npeople such as Congressman Tony Hall, who is awaiting confirmation to \nbe Ambassador for the United Nations Agency for Food and Agriculture. A \nnumber of these are U.S. attorneys and U.S. marshals.\n  I urge the majority leader to consider beginning to do packages as we \ngo along so we do not have them all stacked up at the end on Thursday \nor Friday where one objection, unrelated to the nominations, could deny \nall these people who have been waiting, some of them a good while, an \nopportunity to be considered.\n\n[[Page S5883]]\n\n  Also, I am concerned that--I don't know--11 or 12 judges are on the \ncalendar. I think most of them are noncontroversial. But if we have to \nhave a recorded vote, that could run into a lot of time and could \nreally delay some of our work next week.\n  I wanted to make that point to the majority leader and urge him to \nsee if we can begin work together to develop a list, large or small, \nalong the way, rather than just one huge package at the end next week.\n  I yield the floor so Senator Daschle can respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I share the concern for the growing list \nof executive nominations. I say to my colleagues that the distinguished \nRepublican leader and I and our staffs have been discussing this matter \nat length over the course of the last couple of weeks.\n  There have been meetings as late as yesterday with the White House \nwith regard to an understanding about how we might go forward. I have \nnot had the opportunity to talk with my staff this morning as to the \nprogress made on those discussions, but I have every reason to believe \nwe have made substantial progress and that we ought to be in a position \nto begin moving all of those nominations on the calendar next week. I \nalso share his view that when that happens, we do not want to leave \nthem to the end.\n  We may dual track next week to the extent that it is possible with \nthe Defense bill so we can complete work on the Defense bill on \nschedule but chip away at that Executive Calendar list throughout the \nweek. Certainly, if negotiations have been completed and we have all \ncome to some agreement, it would be my intention to do it perhaps as \nearly as Monday.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can get the floor back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican Leader.\n\n\n                       Yucca Mountain Resolution\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to raise one other issue. By law, the \nSenate must consider a joint resolution regarding the Yucca Mountain \nfacility which has passed the House and has been reported out of the \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. We are quickly \napproaching a deadline for that legislation, which is also written in \nthe law. It is my hope we can get an indication as to when that \nresolution will be scheduled as provided under the statute.\n  I remind my colleagues that the law provides an expedited process for \nthat measure, and it will only take 10 hours or less if Members decide \nnot to use all the time, of course. We have offered--in fact, I think \nboth sides have offered--suggestions as to how we might proceed. We do \nhave a suggestion for consent that I have sent over to Senator Daschle \nas to how to proceed on the resolution so Members will know exactly how \nwe will go forward and what time, when we might actually get to it.\n  It is unclear if that will be accepted, but I just want our \ncolleagues to know we are trying to get some clarification of exactly \nwhen we will go to this very important joint resolution dealing with \nthe Yucca Mountain site for nuclear waste disposal.\n  I add that the majority leader had previously stated his intent to \nproceed to a number of other important issues in July. We have a lot of \nimportant work that needs to be done and only 4 weeks in that time. \nGiven the busy schedule, including the prospect of appropriations \nbills, it would be my hope that the Senate could consider this \nresolution even next week. I realize that would be contingent upon \ncompleting the Defense authorization bill, but I have a good feeling \nabout how the Defense authorization bill may proceed next week. Maybe I \nam dreaming on this first day of summer to think we could actually \nfinish it a little early, but I am hoping for the very best, and this \nresolution could possibly even be brought up next week.\n  If not then, we do need to get some indication of when we will \nproceed. It is governed by law. I ask the leader to consider scheduling \nthis measure and giving advice to colleagues as to when he anticipates \nthis matter will be considered.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Daschle for a response he wants to give.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have no intention at this point to \nbring it up certainly this coming week. As the distinguished Republican \nleader knows, I have made no secret of my opposition to the resolution, \nand I know that sentiment is shared by a large percentage of our \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle.\n  It is, of course, within the right of any Senator without debate to \nmove to the resolution under the law. This is not a Senate rule. This \nis a law promulgated in 1982. Any Senator can move to it, and when that \noccurs, the motion to proceed is voted upon, and then a 10-hour debate, \nwherein no amendments are authorized to ensue, with a vote to follow at \nthe expiration of that 10 hours.\n  Every Senator has the confidence that if he or she chooses to make \nthat position, it supplants whatever is on the floor at the time. That \nis the prerogative, unfortunately in my view, of any Senator given the \nlaw. It supersedes all Senate rules. I hope we will not avail ourselves \nof these expeditious moves in the future. Senate procedure ought to be \nrespected, but I can do nothing about the current circumstances.\n  As the Senator knows, clearly that is within his right or the rights \nof other colleagues interested in moving legislation. I would oppose it \nwhen or if it is offered, but that is certainly the right of a \ncolleague to consider.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Daschle for his comments. I understand this \nissue is privileged. It is like conference reports. It does not \ndisplace anything; it just temporarily interrupts it, and we can go \nright back to the pending business. That is why I raise the subject.\n  I want everybody to understand that nobody is trying to shove this in \nan unfair way. There is a lot of consultation involved on both sides. \nWe want to make sure Members understand how it can proceed and what the \nissue is and also give Senators who have concerns in opposition full \nknowledge of what time and how this will come up. That is why I bring \nit up at this point.\n  I understand and appreciate Senator Daschle's position and the \nstatement he just gave our colleagues.\n\n\n                      Congressional Baseball Game\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on a final happy note, I observe there was a \nbaseball game last night, really outstanding game to retire the trophy. \nI am pleased to say the Romping Elephants were able to bring home the \nvictory and retire the trophy. The score was 9 to 2.\n  Why would I bring that up in the Senate since usually it is the \nyounger and more inexperienced House Members who play on these baseball \nteams? In fact, one of the stars of the game was the Senator from \nNevada, John Ensign, who played a sterling game at shortstop and \nactually got a walk, a hit, scored a run, and I think snagged about \neight balls.\n  So it just goes to show that Senators not only are older and more \nexperienced but also perhaps more talented.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. With that glowing conclusion, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield before he leaves, I will say a \nword in response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. On a less serious note, the Senator from Mississippi got \nabout as many hits as I did last night; right?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator did about as well as I did in the baseball \ngame, which is not very well. We did not play.\n  I have sat silently listening to the colloquy between the two leaders \non an issue of importance to me, and that is the nuclear waste issue. \nThere are many of us--and I have spoken at great length with the \nmajority leader--who believe the law that was passed stands Senate \nprecedent on its head and there will be a concerted effort by a number \nof Republicans and a significant number of Democrats, with the majority \nleader, saying it sets such a bad precedent that the motion to proceed \nshould not, of course, go forward.\n  While the two leaders are present, I wanted to make sure everyone \nunderstood this is not a slam dunk, that the motion to proceed or \nwhatever we want to call this unique aspect of law that passed is \ncertainly not assured of going forward.\n\n[[Page S5884]]\n\n  Whenever a Republican decides to bring it up, there will be a vote on \nthis so-called motion to proceed, and I am hopeful and cautiously \noptimistic that it will not prevail. I wanted to make sure everyone \nunderstood that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am sorry the Republican leader had to \nbring up the score of the game last night. He could have quietly and \ngraciously noted that the Republicans won, but it is his right to \nnotice publicly that we got trounced last night. But there is another \nday. I graciously admit defeat in this case. We did have some star \nplayers, and I congratulate Senator Ensign on his valiant performance. \nBut there is another day, another game, and we are going to try to \nlevel the playing field next year. In the meantime, we will try to do \nthe best we can to win our victories on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. REID. If the leader will allow me to say this: We do appreciate \nvery much that the Republicans did not bring on Hall of Famer Jim \nBunning to pitch against the Democrats.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues the development on the Yucca Mountain resolution, \nspecifically what it means, and share a few realistic observations on \njust what we are talking about as we reflect on our obligation to \naddress the waste in this country.\n  In the past 2 days, I have come to the Senate floor to speak in \nmorning business on S.J. Res. 34. I have spoken generally on the need \nto move this resolution and the procedure under which the resolution \nwill move. I was pleased to see that the two leaders had an opportunity \nto discuss this earlier in the day. I think it is fair to say that, \nclearly, we are left with the appropriate procedure, which simply \nmandates that any Member may bring this up upon recognition of the \nChair at any time. So it is quite appropriate that the leaders related \nthe parliamentary procedure.\n  I want to speak specifically about what the resolution does and does \nnot do. This seems to be a point of contention in the minds of some. \nThe resolution merely reaffirms the present recommendation of Yucca \nMountain as a suitable site for this Nation's permanent geologic \nrepository. That is simply all there is to it. It does not license the \nrepository. It does not build a repository. It does not start the \ntransportation of spent fuel from reactors tomorrow or the next day. It \ndoes not start transportation of high-level nuclear waste from the \nDepartment of Energy weapon sites. It does none of those things.\n  The resolution gives the Department of Energy the go ahead to begin \nthe licensing process with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and that \nis simply all there is to it.\n  Now, I have already given, in a series of presentations, a little \nbackground of the fact that we have collected some $17 billion from \nratepayers in this country, and that the Federal Government signed a \nsolemn contractual commitment to take the waste in 1998. The Federal \nGovernment has breached the sanctity of that contract. It is estimated \nthat the damages and suits against the Federal Government are somewhere \nin the area of $40 billion to $70 billion. That is an obligation to the \nU.S. taxpayers because the Congress of the United States has not \nforced, if you will, compliance of that contractual commitment.\n  A lot of people simply dismiss this as something we can put off. You \ncan put it off all right, but you are going to do it at the expense of \nthe taxpayers. This was a contract. The ratepayers that use nuclear \nenergy paid into a fund. The Federal Government has held that money to \ntake the waste in 1998. The Federal Government is in violation of that \ncontract. It is just that simple.\n  We have an opportunity and obligation to move. The House has moved, \nthe Senate has not because the licensing process is a first of its \nkind. No one anticipates it is going to move quickly or smoothly. Both \nthe DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission indicated a great deal of \nwork needs to be done before any repository is licensed to construct. \nThe resolution is no real guarantee that Yucca will be built, but it \ncertainly moves the process along. I know that is what some don't want \nto hear. I certainly hope it is not the case, but the reality is that \nwe have no guarantee that the Department of Energy will be able to meet \nthe licensing requirements imposed by the NRC.\n\n  We have an obligation to move this process along under the structure \nthat was agreed to many years ago. Now, it is true the NRC has issued a \nsufficiency letter that indicates the Commission believes the DOE will, \nat the appropriate time, have sufficient information to apply for and \nreceive the license, but only time and additional work will tell. \nOpponents of Yucca Mountain have indicated, for instance, that we \nshould not pass this resolution because there are a number of \nunresolved technical issues. As a matter of fact, there are issues that \nboth DOE and NRC have agreed will be resolved in the licensing process.\n  There are a number of other issues that should have been raised, such \nas transportation, that cannot and should not be resolved prior to \nmaking the decision regarding licensing of Yucca Mountain. \nTransportation to and from Yucca will be resolved in the licensing \nprocess. To use it now is as a scare tactic--which some have \nsuggested--or a reason to vote no on the resolution is irresponsible.\n  I want to point out that, for the past 30 years, the United States \nhas seen close to 3,000 shipments of spent fuel and high-level waste go \nacross the surface of our country--the railroads and the highways--and \nnot one of these shipments has resulted in a harmful release of \nradiation. We are doing this now and we are doing it safely. These are \nthe existing transportation routes on this chart--the interstate \nhighways from the State of Washington through Idaho. It goes from \nHanford, and you pick up the National Laboratories, you pick up Rocky \nFlats, Los Alamos, and the Livermore Lab in San Francisco. This is the \nroute of movement of waste. It moves over to South Carolina and up and \ndown the east coast. It\n\n[[Page S5887]]\n\nmoves to Savannah. It moves to the Waste Isolation Plant, WIPP, where \nmost of this is concentrated, but certainly not all of them.\n  The point is, the waste has been moving around the country--military \nwaste--for a long period of time. There are no demonstrations, there \nare no particularly extraordinary methods.\n  In this photo, you can see the truck hauling the waste. It is in \ncanisters that can withstand fire. At one time, we had the capability \nof designing a cask that could stand a free fall of 30,000 feet and it \nwould not penetrate the interior. So we have built these casks \nadequately and safely.\n  Some have indicated that these waste shipments are only a few. I \nthink it is to the contrary. This chart shows spent fuel shipments \nregulated by the NRC from 1964 through the year 2000. We have had \nalmost 3,000 shipments. We shipped over 1.7 million miles and we have \nhad zero radiation releases. For low-level radiant waste shipments to \nWIPP from 1997 to 2001, we have had 896 shipments, and we shipped about \n900,000 miles. So we have a total of 3,800 shipments total, 2.6 million \nmiles, with no harmful radiation releases.\n  We have the technology and, obviously, if we can build reactors to \ngenerate power, we certainly have the capability to transfer and \ntransport the energy, the rods that go in the reactors. Nobody seems to \nsay anything or have any great concern about the reactor fueling \nprocess itself or how the fuel is shipped across the country. But we \nhave this hue and cry that somehow it is dangerous to move this waste \non our highways and railroads. We have that capability. We have \nresponsible people--scientists, engineers--who are competent to move \nthis. Some suggest we should resolve this in a town hall meeting \natmosphere. We need experts, engineers, technicians. They are staking \ntheir reputation--just as those who develop the nuclear energy industry \nin this country--on their capability to move this safely.\n  My point is that it has been done. It is proven. This is military \nwaste, but now we are talking about private waste from our reactors. \nSome have also said this is a decision being made in haste; that we \nought to put it off for more resolve. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. We have spent 20 years in this process. We have expended over $4 \nbillion at Yucca drilling into the mountain--I have been there; I have \ngone in--to determine whether the site is scientifically and \ntechnically suitable for development of the repository. This is not a \ndecision that was made in haste. This is a decision that has been made \nactually over 24 years of extensive study by the world's best \nscientists.\n  As a consequence, I am confident in the work done to date by the \nDepartment of Energy. But this work will not cease with this \nrecommendation on the resolution. On the contrary, scientific \ninvestigation and analysis will continue for the life of the \nrepository. In sum, I cannot think of any reason except perhaps plain \nold opposition, which we have a little bit of here, to the fact of the \nrepository itself and the realization of putting off a vote on the \nresolution, which is the business at hand.\n  The science is going to continue through the licensing process and \nwell beyond. Transportation matters will be addressed thoroughly in the \nlicensing process by the appropriate agencies. Plus, we already have an \nexcellent record in that area upon which to build. The decision is not \nbeing rushed. It is something that has been in the works for over two \ndecades.\n  As we look at the competence of our nuclear program development, \nwhether it be military, whether it be nuclear submarines that are on \npatrol constantly, whether it be under our agreement to reduce our \nnuclear capability by cutting up some of the old submarines, by \nremoving, if you will, the reactors, we have competent people in charge \nof this operation. Anything less that would suggest we cannot move this \nwaste is simply an excuse for inaction.\n  Every Member has to reflect on an obligation that after we set up a \nprocedure to take the waste in 1998, certainly the Federal Government \nshould honor the terms and conditions of that contract, and Members \nshould not look for an excuse to simply punt on this issue.\n  The bottom line is, let's face it, I say to my colleagues, and the \nsimple reality is, nobody wants this waste. Politically, it is \ndynamite. We have waste stored in Hanford, the State of Washington, \nSavannah, we have waste stored up and down the east coast. Do we want \nto leave it there, where it is unprotected, or do we want to move it to \none place on which we can agree? Let's recognize the reality. We have \nexpended the funds. We made the commitments. Now it is time to move. We \ncannot dodge this for another Congress.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for recognition and wish him a good \nday. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is Friday. The weekend starts for most \npeople today. It looks as if it is going to be a great weekend whether \nat the Delaware beaches or the New Jersey shore. Next weekend might \nstart a little early for a lot of people in this country, for hundreds \nof thousands, maybe millions of commuters from Trenton, NJ, to New \nYork, Connecticut, Philadelphia, Wilmington, Baltimore, Washington, \nChicago, and out on the west coast, L.A., and a lot of other places as \nwell because right now it looks as if, starting in the latter part of \nnext week, Amtrak will begin an orderly shutdown of its operations, and \nthere will be a cascading effect that will also lead to disruption of \ncommuter operations in all those cities and many others I did not \nmention.\n  Amtrak is running out of operating funds for this fiscal year. They \nexpect to run out of operating funds sometime in early July. The new \npresident of Amtrak has announced his intention to try to negotiate a \nloan for Amtrak from a consortium of commercial banks, which Amtrak has \ndone any number of times in the past, for operating moneys to bridge a \nperiod of time until the new Federal grant comes through or to \nnegotiate money for capital improvements to Amtrak.\n  Those negotiations were underway in earnest early this week. I \nunderstand the auditors for Amtrak were not able to say with conviction \nthat Amtrak was a going concern because, in part, of the announcement \nof the administration yesterday for the Amtrak restructuring plan, \nwhich is really, in my judgment, an Amtrak dismantling plan.\n  Rather than Amtrak being able to negotiate the bridge loan with \nprivate lenders to carry them through the end of the year when our new \nappropriation might be available, Amtrak faces a cutoff of its \noperations, again, the impending effect on commuters throughout this \ncountry late next week.\n  The Presiding Officer and I have discussed this situation any number \nof times in the year and a half we have been here, and we have \ndiscussed it more earnestly in the last week or two. I am mindful of \nthe efforts he is making to avert what could be a disaster. They are \nefforts that are supported by any number of our colleagues.\n  A week or so ago, 52 of us finished putting our signatures on a \nletter to the ranking members of the Senate Appropriations Committee \nvoicing our support for a $1.2 billion appropriation for Amtrak in the \nnext fiscal year. A week or so prior to that, the Senate voted to \naccept a provision included in the Senate appropriations bill for \nanother $55 million as part of an emergency supplemental to enable \nrepair work to begin on Amtrak locomotives, passenger cars, and \nsleeping cars that had been damaged in wrecks around the country, \nwrecks, frankly, not caused by Amtrak or Amtrak's neglect, but because \nof trucks that were on the tracks in some places and because of \nproblems with track bed outside the Northeast corridor that led to a \nderailing.\n  That money is in the emergency appropriations bill passed by the \nSenate and is one of the items at issue in the conference. I have been \nled to believe the President has threatened to veto even those moneys \nas part of the emergency supplemental if they remain in the bill.\n\n[[Page S5888]]\n\n  We are looking at a train wreck. It seems to me we look at a train \nwreck about every year close to this time.\n  I wish to take a moment this morning to look back over time. I would \nlike for us to go back to 1970. That was when Amtrak was created. \nAmtrak was created because our Nation's private railroads did not want \nto continue to carry passengers. They could not make money doing that. \nThey wanted out of the business. Then-President Richard Nixon signed \ninto law legislation creating Amtrak.\n\n  The deal was the private railroads would pony up some money to buy \nAmtrak stock. They agreed to turn over all of their old locomotives, \ntheir old passenger cars, their old dining cars, their old sleeper \ncars. They agreed to turn over their old track bed in the Northeast \ncorridor between Washington and Boston, old overhead wires, old \nsignaling systems, old repair shops around the country, old train \nstations, and give all that to Amtrak.\n  Somehow Amtrak, with a little seed money, was to make a go of, and \nbegin turning a profit from, operations that the private sector could \nnot make profitable. It did not happen. We should not be surprised that \nit did not happen because it has not happened in other countries \neither.\n  For those Americans who this summer are going to be traveling to \nplaces in Europe--England, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, up into \nScandinavia--throughout Europe, they are going to ride on trains that \nwill almost take their breath away, beautiful trains, trains that run \nat speeds of close to 200 miles an hour, trains where one can sit with \na cup of coffee or a cup of tea on the table and it does not even \nrattle or vibrate.\n  Americans are going to be traveling to places in Asia this summer, \nand they will ride trains in Japan and other countries that provide a \nsimilar high-quality, fast, dependable service. In those countries, the \nprivate sector does not operate that train service. The national \ngovernments of those nations have decided it is in their naked self-\ninterest to invest their taxpayers' dollars in national passenger rail \nservice. They do not do it out of some sense of altruism. They do it \nbecause they realize that in order to relieve congestion on their \nhighways and in their airports, passenger rail can make a big \ncontribution toward reducing that congestion.\n  Those countries, those governments, realize that in order to reduce \ntheir dependence on foreign oil and to reduce their trade deficits, \npassenger rail service can make a real contribution.\n  They have problems with clean air in those countries as well, and \nthey realize, compared to the emissions that come out of their cars, \ntrucks, and vans, that the emissions emitted by passenger trains are \nfar less.\n  We have similar kinds of concerns in this country. We have congestion \naround our airports and on our Nation's highways worse by far than we \ndid in 1970. We have problems with air pollution that are as bad, or \nmaybe worse, than the problems we faced in 1970, certainly with respect \nto global warming and carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. We have a trade \ndeficit in this country that makes our trade deficit woes of 1970 pale \nby comparison. Over half of our oil is imported, and that number is \ngrowing. In the 1970s, not even a third of our oil was imported.\n  National passenger rail service will not solve all of these problems \nfor the United States, but it will help us to reduce the size of those \nproblems. We can take a lesson from our neighbors, our sister nations \nin Europe and in Asia, and we ought to do that.\n  There are a whole series of things that need to happen this year and \nnext. I want to mention those, and then I will close. We need to pass \nan emergency appropriations bill that includes at least $55 million so \nthe work can begin on repairing wrecked trains in order to provide \nservice to people, especially the Auto Train south of Washington to \nOrlando, FL, where Amtrak actually makes money. We need to keep that \nmoney in the supplemental appropriation. It would be great to grow it, \nbut we at least need to keep that money.\n  The White House has, in my judgment, a moral responsibility. Having \nacted this week in a way that I believe disrupts Amtrak's ability to \nnegotiate a private sector loan from a consortium of banks for $200 \nmillion to carry them through the end of this fiscal year, the \nadministration should use their discretion, authorized under law, as I \nunderstand, through the FRA, to provide a loan guarantee so that Amtrak \ncan obtain the money it needs to avoid the kind of disruption we are \ngoing to begin witnessing by next weekend if nothing is done.\n  We need to take up in the Senate the Amtrak reauthorization bill, \nwhich has cleared the Committee on Energy and Commerce by a vote, I \nthink, of 21 to 3. Senator Hollings has been a champion for passenger \nrail service. He has authored very good legislation. Many of us have \ncosponsored it. We need to take it up, and we need to pass a motion to \nproceed and debate it.\n  If people want to offer amendments to it, that is all well and good. \nWe debate amendments, vote them up or down, and then move on to the \nbill. Fifty-two of our colleagues in the Senate have said: We believe \nAmtrak ought to be funded at $1.2 billion next fiscal year, and we need \nto go forward. As we take up the appropriations bill, we need to \nprovide that money through the appropriations process in the Senate and \nwork with our colleagues in the House and in the administration.\n  Finally, we need a good, healthy debate on what the future of \npassenger rail service should be in this country. I realize that the \nheydays of passenger rail of the 1800s and the early 1900s are behind \nus, but there is still a huge need for the good that passenger rail \nservice can provide us with respect to congestion, air congestion, \nhighway congestion, with respect to reducing the emissions into our \nair, and with respect to reducing our reliance on foreign oil and \ntrying to curtail, at least a little, our trade deficit.\n  What should the future passenger rail service be in this country? In \nmy judgment, it ought to include making the Northeast corridor world \nclass. As to the beautiful Acela Express train service that is now \navailable, we are not able to harness the full potential of those \ntrains from Washington to Boston because of the work that can and \nshould be done to the track bed, to the overhead wires, to the \nsignaling system, to enable the trains to go 150 or 160 miles an hour, \nwhich is faster than in many places they can now go.\n\n  We need to begin developing high-speed rail corridors in other parts \nof this country, the southeastern United States and Florida, in and out \nof Atlanta. The Northeast corridor finally should be extended at least \ninto Virginia, maybe as far as Richmond. I know there are people in \nNorth Carolina who would like to see the Northeast corridor extended \ninto North Carolina where they are investing in passenger rail service \non their own.\n  There are any number of densely populated corridors such as out of \nChicago, Chicago/St. Louis, Chicago/Milwaukee, Chicago/Indianapolis, \nChicago/Detroit, where it makes a lot more sense for people to travel \non high-speed trains instead of on commuter airlines that are going \nless than 300 miles.\n  On the west coast, whether it is L.A. to San Diego or maybe L.A. to \nLas Vegas, L.A. to San Francisco, Portland, Spokane, Seattle, Portland-\nSeattle, Seattle-Vancouver, those are areas that are just ripe for \nhigh-speed passenger rail. The challenge for us is how to raise the \nmoney to put in place the infrastructure, the high-speed rail \ncapability, the track bed, the overhead wires, the signaling, to be \nable to provide the service where it would be used.\n  The former chairman of the Amtrak board of directors who succeeded me \non the Amtrak board, and preceded me on the Amtrak board, is former \nWisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, now Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. He and I believe, as do many others, including many in this \nbody, there needs to be a dedicated source of capital for passenger \nrail service in this country to make world class the Northeast \ncorridor, to begin developing, in conjunction and coordination with the \nright-of-way of freight railroads, the high-speed corridors in these \ndensely populated areas of America.\n  I was struck to learn a couple of years ago that 75 percent of the \npeople in America today live within 50 miles of one of our coasts. \nThink about that. As time goes by, the density of our population, \nespecially in those coastal\n\n[[Page S5889]]\n\nareas, will not diminish, it will increase. The potential good that \npassenger rail service can provide for us will increase as well.\n  Not everybody wants to ride a train from one end of the country to \nthe other. Some people do, but a lot of people could benefit by riding \na train in a densely populated corridor. A lot of people every day ride \nthe longest train in the world, and that is the Auto Train that leaves \njust south of Washington, DC, down to near Orlando, FL, and back every \nday.\n  There are people who ride trains that go through spectacular parts of \nAmerica. They go along the northern part of America, the Northwest, and \nthe Coast Starlight from the west coast from one end of California up \nto the Canadian border. People are willing to pay good money to ride \nthose trains.\n  I think one of the big questions we face is, What do we do with the \nother long-distance trains where Amtrak is unable to provide service \nand out of the farebox pay for the full cost of the service? I was \nalways frustrated as Governor that when Delaware received Federal \ntransportation monies, we did not have the discretion to use any of \nthat money to help pay for passenger rail service in our State, which \ndid not make sense.\n  For example, we could use our Federal congestion mitigation money in \nmy State--other Governors could in their States --for freight \nrailroads. We could use it for roads and highways. We could use that \nFederal congestion mitigation money for bicycle paths. We could not use \nit for passenger rail service, even if it made sense for our States. \nThat is foolish. That ought to change. This Senate has tried to change \nit any number of times. We have not gotten the support we need from the \nother body. Sometimes we have not gotten the support we need from the \nadministration. We should give Governors and mayors the discretion to \nuse a portion of their money to help underwrite the cost of long-\ndistance trains that are not fully sustainable.\n\n  A number of years ago when I was on the Amtrak board, we started an \nexperiment to see if Amtrak might partner with the freight railroads, \nwhen operating outside the Northeast corridor, to carry things other \nthan people, such as mail, express packages, but also to carry other \ncommodities, even perishable commodities, that are highly time \nsensitive in terms of getting where they are needed.\n  A lot of times, shippers will use trucks because they believe there \nis a greater reliance in terms of on-time performance, and especially \nin shorter distances, but a greater ability than trucking to provide \non-time performance, and we started an experiment to see if maybe we \ncould carry not only people but commodities as well, and specially \ndesigned cars attached to Amtrak trains. If Amtrak were able to make \nmoney carrying these commodities on the track bed of a freight \nrailroad, Amtrak would share the profits with the freight railroads. \nAmtrak would have a way to supplement its costs and to underwrite its \ncosts of the long-distance trains which, frankly, do not make money.\n  Amtrak has entered into an agreement with, I believe it is the \nBurlington Northern-Santa Fe Railroad, to be able to do that kind of \nthing, and it has attempted to negotiate with other freight railroads. \nThat could be part of a solution as well. I am not sure there is \nconsensus in this body as to what the long-term passenger rail system \nshould be in this country. I am not sure we know.\n\n  We do know if we do not do something, if the administration does not \ndo something, by next weekend we are going to have a train wreck. Not a \nliteral train wreck but a figurative train wreck. A lot of people who \nwill want to go to work next Thursday or Friday are not going to get to \nwork or they will end up in traffic jams in and around their cities and \ncommunities, the likes of which they have not seen for a long time. \nMaybe on the brighter side, some people who didn't want to go to work \nnext Thursday or Friday will get a long weekend. For them, maybe that \nis good. For our Nation, this is not good.\n  We need to address this issue. We need to address it today. The \nadministration has that capability of addressing it today. The \nadministration should use discretion as provided to the Federal \nRailroad Administration to use the loan guarantee to enable Amtrak to \ngo forward for us to have an orderly debate over this fiscal year to \ndetermine the long-term course for passenger rail service in America.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the comments \nmade yesterday morning by the Secretary of Transportation in regards to \nAmtrak.\n  Frankly, I am puzzled by his remarks yesterday, puzzled because many \nof us in this body have been calling for the administration to take a \nposition on Amtrak's future since last July, when a group of us met \nwith Secretary Mineta and Federal Railroad Administrator Rutter. \nEarlier this year, when the Commerce Committee prepared to mark-up the \nNational Defense Rail Act, we again sought the administration's input. \nThe administration did not raise any significant objection, and the \nbill was reported favorably by the committee by an overwhelming margin.\n  Indeed, the only thing we knew of the administration's feelings \ntoward Amtrak was that the Office of Management and Budget refused to \nrelease the $100 million in funding that the Congress appropriated late \nlast year for improved security on trains and in stations.\n  After a full year of being AWOL on this issue, the administration \nsuddenly announced that it would like to see massive, but vaguely \ndefined, structural changes at Amtrak. And Secretary Mineta has said \nthat without these big changes, whatever they may be, the \nadministration will oppose Congressional attempts to increase funding \nfor Amtrak. The Senate should not be cowed by this kind of bullying. \nThe administration could have been a full partner in this process by \nraising these concerns last year, or even before the committee \nconsidered the National Rail Defense Act.\n  Instead, the administration has chosen to take a position that is \ndiametrically opposed to the goals of the National Defense Rail Act, \nwhich now has 35 cosponsors. Rather than give Amtrak the resources it \nneeds to run a forward-looking, national rail system, it seeks to tear \ndown our national rail system and replace it with a model similar to \nthe failed British model of rail privatization. The administration \nwould like to have a regional passenger rail system, based on a model \nthat is universally derided for its inefficiency and its lack of \nsafety. The British experience has shown us that safe, efficient, \nreliable service cannot be done on the cheap. But that kind of short-\nsighted penny-pinching is exactly what the President has in mind. This \nstrategy could strip countless communities, including several in \nMassachusetts, of train service, further reducing transportation \nalternatives in those parts of our country.\n  Much as the administration would like to score philosophical points \nwith conservative think tanks, the issue here is not who actually runs \nthe trains and maintains the tracks. The fact is that the most \nimportant issue for Amtrak is funding, and whether we want to dedicate \nthe sort of funds that will be necessary to maintain and enhance a \nnational passenger rail network, and whether we want to try to build \nhigh-speed rail corridors into that network.\n  In his remarks yesterday, Secretary Mineta said ``The country can ill \nafford to throw billions of Federal dollars at Amtrak and just hope its \nproblems disappear.'' He is right about one thing: We cannot wish away \nAmtrak's problems. But Amtrak's biggest problem is that, for 30 years, \nwe have given it just enough funding to get by, but never enough to be \ntruly viable. In his most recent review of the company's finances, the \nDepartment of Transportation's Inspector General mused, ``It's amazing \nthat Amtrak has gotten this far.'' While Amtrak has limped along on \ninsufficient funding, our highways have become choked and our skyways \nwill soon be once again strained beyond their capacity.\n  Now we hear that Amtrak is prepared to shut down as soon as next week \nunless it receives immediate financial assistance. This will leave 22.5 \nmillion riders without train transportation. Let's be clear: The \nadministration, by virtue of its non-involvement in this issue, will \nbear the responsibility for this unprecedented blow to our national \ntransportation network. I would\n\n[[Page S5890]]\n\nlike to know how the administration will handle the immediate extra \nburden placed on other transportation modes. Rather than put $200 \nmillion into Amtrak, it appears they would prefer to continue to spend \nbillions more on already-clogged highways and skyways.\n  We must remember that this Nation has spent less than 4 percent of \nour Nation's transportation budget on inter-city passenger rail over \nthe life of Amtrak. We've spent more than $300 billion spent on \nhighways, nearly $200 billion on airports and just $35 billion on \ninter-city passenger rail in 32 years.\n  As Amtrak's ridership has increased despite its financial condition, \nthat is not good enough anymore.\n  I would also add that Amtrak's place in the $2-trillion Federal \nbudget is tiny. We spend $150 billion per year on debt service alone, \nbut just $521 million on inter-city passenger rail. The Commerce \nCommittee's bill, authorizes full funding for Amtrak's security, \noperating and capital needs. For the first time in its 30-year history, \nwe would appropriately fund passenger rail.\n  I think a lot of criticisms frequently raised about Amtrak are indeed \nwarranted. Its management structure is top-heavy and unwieldy. The \ncompany's new president has already announced plans to restructure \nmanagement. That is a positive step, but we can and should reserve \njudgment on the success of that restructuring until it is fully \nimplemented.\n  Amtrak is not sufficiently insulated from political pressures. That \nis also a legitimate concern, and one that must be addressed. Language \ninserted in the National Rail Defense Act would take a step toward \nensuring that decisions about route terminations are made based on \nobjective financial criteria. Still, we must do more to ensure that \nCongress provides oversight of the company, without unduly burdening \nit.\n  Clearly, the company's fiscal problems have been exacerbated by the \nCongress's unrealistic requirement that Amtrak meet an ``operational \nself-sufficiency.'' As a result, Amtrak explored a wide variety of \nrevenue options, with varying degrees of success. The new CEO, David \nGunn, has expressed a desire to return Amtrak to its fundamental \nmission of moving people.\n  As these changes in the company are implemented, I believe it would \nbe a grave mistake to allow the termination of Amtrak. And make no \nmistake, that is the road we are headed down. So I urge my colleagues \nto work toward an appropriation that will allow Amtrak to stand on \nsolid financial ground in the short term, and toward passage of \nreauthorization legislation that allows our country to develop high-\nspeed rail corridors without sacrificing traditional rail service. \nUnfortunately, the administration's plan does neither of those things.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5890-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5890-S5891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE TO REDUCE AIDS TRANSMISSION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Wednesday I was asked by a member of the \npress about the President's announcement of an initiative to spend $500 \nmillion, including $200 million Congress has already approved for the \ncurrent fiscal year, to fight the global AIDS pandemic by targeting the \ntransmission of the disease from mothers to infants.\n  I applauded the President and his decision. His participation in the \nbipartisan campaign to combat this international health crisis is \nwelcome and significant.\n  It is important to understand, however, that the President does not \npledge any new resources until 2004. And the overall amount of \nresources he does commit to, while important, isn't enough.\n  The human toll this health crisis has already inflicted on this \ncountry and the world is staggering.\n  Every twelve seconds, one person dies due to complications from AIDS. \nEvery minute, one of those people is an infant.\n  Each day brings 14,000 new infections, with half of those infected \nunder the age of 25.\n  There are currently 30 million people with HIV in Africa, and the \nNational Intelligence Council estimates that number could double in the \nnext five years.\n  And, as if these numbers are not tragic enough, there is one more \nstaggering statistic: by the end of this decade forty-four million \nchildren will have lost their parents to AIDS.\n  It is also important to understand that, as these statistics \ndemonstrate, the international community doesn't have the luxury of \ntime in reversing the spread of AIDS worldwide. Good intentions must be \nmatched by commensurate resources if we are to reverse current trends.\n  Earlier this month, against the backdrop of those horrific--and \nmounting--numbers, the Senate debated its version of the FY2002 \nemergency supplemental appropriations bill. Prior to the Senate's \nconsideration of this important legislation, a bipartisan group of \nSenators urged the Appropriations Committee to provide additional \nresources in this bill to combat AIDS so that funds to address this \nproblem could be released right away.\n  The committee responded by including $100 million to fight AIDS and \nother diseases in the supplemental. And before the Senate could take up \nthe committee's work, a group of senators--Democratic and Republican--\nproposed that this bill not leave the Senate floor with less than $500 \nmillion for this purpose.\n  Regrettably, according to news stories, the White House feels $500 \nmillion is too much for AIDS this year.\n  Under pressure from the White House, several Republican Senators \nwithdrew their support for adding $500 million for AIDS this year, and \nthe effort failed. The Senate was forced to settle for $200 million.\n  Just $200 million to fight a deadly disease that already infects 40 \nmillion people and is projected to infect millions more.\n  So, while I find Wednesday's announcement an encouraging indication \nof a growing awareness within the administration of the need to engage \nin the battle against the international AIDS crisis, the resources it \nis willing to commit to this challenge still fall far short of what is \nneeded. And far short of what I believe this great nation is capable of \nand should be doing.\n  As for availability, the President's initiative sets aside $300 \nmillion in fiscal year 2004, 16 months from now.\n  Based on UN estimates, over those next 16 months, more than 1.1 \nmillion babies could contract HIV. The President's plan aims to prevent \njust 146,000 infections in 5 years.\n  Again, these resources are welcome, but I cannot help but feel that \nwe have just missed a tremendous opportunity. When we wait to dedicate \nthe resources necessary to fight this battle, we make our eventual \nvictory against this threat harder--and more costly.\n  Does the administration truly believe that this $300 million could \nnot be spent wisely and well now? If not, why?\n  So I come to the floor this afternoon to offer to work with the \nPresident and my colleagues to do two things with regard to the new \ninitiative.\n  First, because the transmission of HIV from mother to child is an \narea where we know we can reduce the spread of HIV, it is vital that we \nincrease funding in the area of mother-to-child transmission. But it is \nnot enough to keep children from being infected with HIV in utero. We \nshould commit to a major effort to treat the mothers and other family \nmembers already infected with the deadly virus so that children, free \nfrom the virus at birth, will grow up not as orphans, but with the \nsupport of their families.\n  Second, I do not believe we should wait until 2004 to put this \ninitiative fully into action. We should include the full $200 million \nin this year's supplemental, and we must find significant, additional \nresources in the next fiscal year.\n  On a bipartisan basis during the last two years, Congress has \nsignificantly increased the amount of resources the President has \nsought for the global HIV/AIDS battle. And we must do so again.\n  In announcing Wednesday's initiative, President Bush said, ``The \nwasted\n\n[[Page S5891]]\n\nhuman lives that lie behind the numbers are a call to action for every \nperson on the planet and for every government.''\n  He is right.\n  Our nation has begun to heed that call, but our commitment to beating \nback this disease and our compassion for the millions who now suffer--\ncompel us to do much, much more.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the distinguished leader for the \nassistance he has given, together with the Republican leader, in moving \nthis bill forward.

Madam President, periodically I have addressed the Senate \non my concerns regarding the tragic strife in the Middle East. I did so \non May 2 of this year and in the Record of that day are my comments \nwith regard to the situation as of that date. Regrettably, the \nsituation has continued to worsen.\n  Our President is actively engaged with the Secretary of State and the \nSecretary of Defense. I have had the opportunity to speak to all of \nthem about this situation and express my views.\n  I know of no conflict of recent times that is more serious, in terms \nof how its tentacles are far reaching throughout the world. It is \naffecting, in some way, our ability to pursue terrorism worldwide. It \nis affecting our ability to take further actions to bring about our \ngoals in Afghanistan. It is affecting the planning that this Nation \nmust make from time to time--not referring to war plans, but just \nplanning--as to how we deal with Iraq. Iraq is continuing, under the \nleadership of Saddam Hussein, to manufacture and warehouse weapons of \nmass destruction. I think the facts are irrefutable.\n  At the core of all of this decision making is this continuing \nconflict in the Middle East. I have said and I will say again today \nthat I urge those in positions of authority--whether in this country, \nin Israel, or in the Palestinian Authority--to look at this daily loss \nof life on both sides and do all they can to bring about a cessation of \nthis tragic conflict.\n  Eventually the two sides will sit down and try to work out some \nagreement for a lasting and permanent peace. A number of us had the \nopportunity to visit with President Mubarak when he came to Washington \na few weeks ago. Likewise, a number of us had the opportunity to visit \nwith President Sharon when he recently visited. I recognize the \nPresiding Officer was involved in those consultations. However, it \nseems to this Senator that President Mubarak and President Sharon are \nmiles apart in their views as to how to bring about a resolution of \nthis conflict.\n\n  I read today that certain persons in our Government are trying to \nimpress upon several nations, which have been actively involved in \ntrying to bring about peace in the Middle East, to become more active--\nspecifically with Arafat, to impress upon him the need to exercise his \nauthority to stop this tragic killing.\n  At the same time, there are certain elements within the Israeli \nGovernment that want nothing to do with Arafat. So on the one hand, \npeople are going to Arafat to try to get him to do something and, on \nthe other hand, people are saying we would not deal with him even if he \nwere to do something.\n  Much of his infrastructure has been eroded in this conflict. We know \nnot, at least this country does not, what exactly is the political \nstructure among the Palestinian people and their ability to convey \nthrough Arafat, or another leader, their views towards a cessation of \nhostilities.\n  But this brings me to the question regarding NATO and the admission \nof new countries. Yesterday I had the distinct privilege, along with \nother Senators, to welcome in the Senate all 19 Ambassadors from the \nNATO nations who have convened here in Washington for a series of \nmeetings with our Government. It is a very interesting group.\n  I said to them, in all candor: I am now in my 24th year in the Senate \nand I am a strong supporter of NATO. I said that they are the trustees \nof the NATO of the future. That alliance has been the most successful \nmilitary alliance in the contemporary history of mankind. It has \nachieved its goals.\n  On the 50th anniversary of NATO, the leaders of NATO convened here in \nWashington. At that time they added a provision to their charter which \nclarifies any doubt that NATO has the authority, subject to the \nconcurrence of the member nations, to engage in this war on terrorism \nand to selectively go into areas of dispute to perform crisis response \noperations.\n  I said to them, quite candidly, that they should entertain the \nthought that, should NATO be invited by the Government of Israel, and \nsuch spokesmen or government as may exist amongst the Palestinians, to \ncome in and provide a peacekeeping force, that they should seriously \nentertain whether or not NATO could carry out that mission.\n  NATO has done it with professional excellence in the Balkans, both in \nBosnia and Kosovo. It is quite interesting that among the beneficiaries \nof those peacekeeping operations have been a significant proportion of \nthe Muslim population. So NATO has clearly established in Kosovo and \nBosnia, an opportunity for the people in those countries to come \ntogether and begin to form a government that will improve their quality \nof life, certainly an improvement from what I witnessed when I first \nwent there in the fall of 1991 and saw of the ravages of war.\n  I explained this yesterday to those Ambassadors. I also said the \nfollowing.\n  I can remember the days right in this Chamber when there were heated \ndebates, particularly after the dramatic fall of the Berlin Wall. That \nwall came down. Ronald Reagan is to be credited in history for being \ninstrumental in getting that wall to come down, ending the cold war and \nhastening the demise of the Soviet Union.\n  I can remember the people of the United States through their elected \nrepresentatives saying, Should we not now lessen our contributions to \nNATO? And they are very significant dollar contributions, and \nleadership, manpower, and equipment.\n  In this bill that we are on right now is $200 million and a fraction \nof new taxpayer money--$205 million for the military budget of NATO. \nThat follows approximately $50 million in assistance authorized and \nappropriated by this Chamber several months ago in the context of the \nFreedom Consolidation Act.\n  In this one fiscal year alone--it may be two, and I will have to \ncheck that--roughly $255 million. That is a significant contribution by \nour taxpayers. And, that doesn't even begin to capture the costs the \nAmerican taxpayers bear in keeping over 100,000 military personnel \npermanently stationed in the European theater.\n  I said to those Ambassadors that this year there will be strong \nsupport for the NATO budget, as there should be. NATO is doing a \nremarkable job in the Balkans and elsewhere. We are strong supporters.\n  But also in the Senate yesterday, history was made. The Senate is \nroughly 214 years old. It was the first time that in one hearing room--\nthe Armed Services Committee where I was present--under the advise and \nconsent procedure, we were hearing from a prominent four-star officer \nnominated to become commander in chief of the Northern Command--a new \ncommand established primarily for the purpose of protecting the \ncitizens of our 50 States, and coordinating the use of our U.S. \nmilitary to protect our States. Stop to\n\n[[Page S5892]]\n\nthink. This Nation has felt itself secure behind two great oceans for \nthose 214 years of our Senate--secure because of the strong \nrelationships we have to the north with Canada, and to the south with \nMexico and our Central and South American neighbors. But our President \nhas wisely concluded--and I commend and support him--we must set up a \nseparate military command for the purposes of protecting the citizens \nof our 50 States.\n  In another hearing room was a distinguished civilian witness--\nGovernor Tom Ridge, the President's Homeland Security Adviser--\nintroducing a proposed Department of Homeland Security, the head of \nwhich will have the responsibility of marshaling the assets of this \nNation's military, intelligence, police, National Guard, and all types \nof coordination required, again to protect citizens in their homes, in \ntheir towns, in their villages, and in the cities of the United States \nof America.\n  That was a profound day yesterday--a very profound crossroads in the \nhistory of this country.\n  As I talked with the NATO Ambassadors, I felt compelled to make the \npoint that our country is placing additional burdens upon its taxpayers \nto protect us here at home with this new military command and this new \nCabinet position, an entirely new entity of the Federal Government.\n  It is to be an amalgamation of some 150 different entities, and that \nwill change as we debate its ultimate composition. But the bottom line \nis, our people are properly looking to this Government under our able \nPresident to begin in earnest to marshal all of our assets, as we have \nbeen doing for some months now since 9-11--but begin in earnest to \nestablish a military command and a Cabinet position, adding great \nexpenditures to our national defense needs.\n\n  Our President, the Congress and the American people know homeland \nsecurity is our most urgent priority. We pray that the steps we are \ntaking to prevent further attacks will be successful. But, if there are \nfurther attacks, our people will look inward more and more to their \ndefensive needs here at home.\n  What are these threats that are requiring establishment of a new \nmilitary command, and a new Cabinet department? These threats are the \nmanifestation of a centuries-old ethnic and religious differences, \nincluding small elements of radical, fundamentalist Muslims whose \nmessage of hatred and intolerance for the United States and the West \nhas found resonance amongst discouraged Middle Eastern youth. The \nunending cycle of violence in the Middle East fuels this sense of \ndespair.\n  We should leave no stone untouched to determine the roots of this \nhatred. Are there steps we can take to demonstrate to the discouraged \nresidents of the Middle East that we are a peaceful nation that fights \nfor democracy, freedom and individual rights? Never in the history \nsince the formation of our Republic have our troops marched beyond the \nshores of this Nation to acquire and take the lands of others. To the \ncontrary, each and every time they have marched, they have marched in \nthe cause of freedom to end tyranny and aggression and restore rights \nto oppressed peoples.\n  That is what this Nation stands for. We respect those who pursue the \nMuslim faith, as we respect the right of all to pursue their faith \nwithout fear of persecution. We are fortunate in this Nation to have \nhundreds and hundreds of thousands of persons who have emigrated from \nthe Muslim nations of the world to follow the Muslim faith, to come to \nour United States and take up citizenship and to participate with equal \nvigor and enthusiasm in our way of life and the goals of this Nation. \nWe are very proud to have them here.\n  I think we have to begin to send a message to that part of the world \nin every way we possibly can. There exists a very skillfully set up \nmeans of communication, primarily through one television station that \nis followed every day by many in the Arab world which portrays and \nmisrepresents this Nation to the Arab world. It exploits the sense of \ndiscouragement that exists in the region and engenders more and more \nferment, which is then directed at Israel and the West, but most \nspecifically, at our Nation.\n  The conflict in the Middle East between Israel and the Palestinian \npeople generates--I cannot quantify it, but that seemingly unending \nconflict generates hatred that grows and multiplies in the Arab world \nand is ultimately directed towards this country. That is why I think we \nshould look at every single resource available to us to try to bring \nabout the cessation of those hostilities, while simultaneously \nencouraging governments in the region to bring truth, democracy and \nopportunity to their nations. I believe it would lessen some measure of \nthe hatred being directed to this country--hatred which results in \ndaily and weekly threats and warnings to the American people.\n  I believe NATO should examine for itself whether or not it could play \na role, if it were invited by both sides to come in, and provide a \npeacekeeping role to enable the two warring factions to sit down over a \nperiod of time--in relative peace, secured by capable NATO peacekeepers \nwho are credible to both sides and engender cooperation--and, \nhopefully, resolve their differences and have a lasting peace \nagreement.\n  I said that very clearly to these Ambassadors yesterday. I have said \nit on the floor of this Senate. I will continue to say it on the floor \nof the Senate. Because as we approach this issue of the new nations \njoining NATO--and I have been active in the past, and I will be active \nin the future--those nations I think primarily are focused on what NATO \ncan do for them to give them protection within their own specific \ngeographic areas.\n  I am not entirely sure what the threats are that most concern these \nnations aspiring to NATO membership. Europe basically is peaceful \ntoday, but they look to NATO to ensure their protection as sovereign \nnations. That they should do. But, are they equally prepared to \ncontribute to the military organizations in NATO.\n  The Senate, for that purpose, authorized $55 million to help the \naspirant nations improve their militaries to meet the standards \nestablished by NATO for new members. That is a very important process.\n  I have always believed in the past that perhaps we moved too quickly \nin inviting new nations to join NATO, but I will put that aside for the \nmoment. But I do ask those aspirant nations to begin to focus on the \ntrouble spots in Europe, the trouble spots in the Middle East, and say \nto themselves, if NATO were to become involved: Are we willing to \nshoulder our proportionate part of the responsibilities which could \ninvolve our troops becoming peacekeepers in the Middle East? Stop to \nthink about that.\n  I believe, in the course of the deliberations on NATO enlargement, \nthose questions should be put specifically to the aspirant nations \ndesiring to join. I commend our Ambassador, Ambassador Burns, U.S. \nAmbassador to NATO. He is extraordinarily well schooled, a highly \nprincipled professional, devoting his life to diplomacy. He is the \nright man at the right time in that particular job.\n  So, Mr. President, I feel very strongly about this. I know my views \nare not shared at the moment. Perhaps the President will take \ncognizance of this proposal as he is preparing his very important \nmessage on the Middle East. However, I just think there is no corner of \nthis problem that should not be fully explored before it is summarily \nrejected.\n  We are making a very significant contribution to NATO. It is \nimportant. Hopefully, we will do it again next year. But in the ensuing \nyear, as we begin to prepare ourselves here at home, all of the dollars \nof our budget then become under greater scrutiny.\n  I think it would be important for NATO to at least consider--on the \nassumption that it is invited--a peacekeeping role in the Middle East. \nHowever, it cannot be forced upon the people of Israel; they are very \nproud of their ability to defend themselves. However, I think it is \nimportant that this proposal be considered by NATO and that the nations \nindicating a desire to join NATO are likewise consulted as to their \nviews.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have been sparing in my comments the \nlast several months about the Yucca Mountain situation. Everyone \nacknowledges that a Republican will bring this up in the next several \nweeks. We have had a series of people coming to the floor talking about \nnuclear waste. The Republican leader talked about it today. We have had \nSenator Craig and Senator Murkowski speak about it several times this \nweek.\n  My colleague from Alaska, for example, this morning discussed the \nissue of nuclear waste and transportation. I can remember Senator Bryan \nand I, when we had the pleasure of serving together in the Senate, \ntraveled to St. Louis. The whole purpose of our trip was to meet with \nlocal officials about the transportation of nuclear waste. We did.\n  We went to the governing body of St. Louis. We talked to them. We had \na very nice visit. We visited an editorial board. We were on a radio \nstation or two there.\n  As a result, the people who run the city of St. Louis passed a \nresolution saying: We don't want nuclear waste transported through St. \nLouis.\n  If you can explain the issue to people, they recognize quickly it is \nnot a good idea. So that is why I want to respond to some of the points \nraised by my friend from Alaska. He discussed, for example, the \nshipments of waste to the WIPP facility, the waste isolation project in \nNew Mexico. Comparing those shipments to the proposed spent fuel \nshipment at Yucca is like comparing a squirt gun to the most modern \ntank in America. They are just completely different substances. The \nitems being shipped to WIPP are things such as rags, tools, and \nlaboratory equipment. These are not spent fuel rods, which would give \nyou a lethal dose of radiation in less than 3 minutes if you stood near \nthem. You could be exposed to it for a matter of seconds and get sick.\n  With the news of terrorists pursuing radioactive materials and \nweapons of mass destruction, now more than ever we need to be vigilant \nin protecting the welfare of the American people. The decision to \napprove or reject the Yucca Mountain site is the most important \ntransportation decision of this new century. This decision could bring \nas much as 100,000 shipments of high-level nuclear waste by truck \nthrough our towns and communities, as many as 20,000 train loads. This \nyear we learned they may ship some of it by barge - the most poisonous \nsubstance known to man -- traveling by our schools, our homes, our \nchurches, our places of business.\n  It doesn't make sense to ship this waste and allow terrorists to use \nany one of these shipments as the ultimate ``dirty'' bomb. A successful \nattack on a spent nuclear fuel shipping cask would be extremely \ndangerous. Each truck cask would contain up to 2 tons of deadly \nmaterial and each rail cask up to 11 tons.\n  These casks are packed full of the most dangerous high-level nuclear \nwaste known to man. They contain Cesium-137, Strontium-90, and \nPlutonium-239. A release of less than 1 percent will affect tens of \nthousands of citizens, resulting in hundreds of long-term cancer \ndeaths. This could shut down an entire city.\n  My friend, Senator Conrad, was told by an expert that a ``dirty'' \nbomb would make Washington, DC, uninhabitable for 400 years.\n  Spent fuel shipments to Yucca Mountain would create a target-rich \nenvironment. DOE would make daily shipments by barge, truck, and train, \nall going to the same place. There would be as many as six to eight \nshipments each day. There are very few targets now. There would be \nhundreds of targets, thousands of targets if we go forward. According \nto the NRC, there have only been at most one or two shipments per week \nin the entire country over the past 10 years. Current shipments are \nharder to attack because they go to many different destinations.\n  For the DOE to say ``we have never had an accident'' isn't true. If \nyou pin them down, they will say we have had no ``reported'' releases. \nAgain, DOE has proposed putting tens of thousands of these casks out on \nthe roads, waterways, and railways without a transportation plan. It \nwould not be as bad if they had a plan they had let the Congress and \nthe American people scrub, and if they had done an environmental impact \nstatement, but they have not even done that. They have not done an \nenvironmental assessment.\n  Don't take my word for it; look at what the Secretary of Energy said \non the subject:\n\n       The DOE is just beginning to formulate its preliminary \n     thoughts about a transportation plan.\n\n  After 9-11, proceeding with Yucca Mountain without a transportation \nplan is reckless and irresponsible. The Congress has the responsibility \nto hold the Department accountable. That can only come from rejecting \nthis reckless resolution.\n  I mentioned on the floor recently that there is a Web site which was \nstarted to educate the American people about these shipments. It is \nwww.mapscience.org. Anybody within the sound of my voice, go to your \ncomputer and try this out. All you have to do is put in your address. \nIt doesn't matter where it is in the United States. You put your \naddress in and it will tell you where the nearest nuclear reactor is \nand where they are going to ship the waste--how close it will come to \nyour home. We know that in at least 43 States, more than 60 million \npeople will be within a mile of the possible routes. Everyone should \ntry this Web site.\n  This Web site is telling the American people what the Department of \nEnergy doesn't want them to know: These proposed shipments will go \nright by their homes, right by the places they work, right by the \nplaces where their kids go to school. There has been a big response \nfrom the American people. This Web site has been up for 10 days, and \nthere have been well over 100,000 hits.\n  There is no rush to move forward. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nChairman has stated that if this Yucca Mountain project did not go \nforward today, it would be no big deal. He said it can be kept safely \non site for decades.\n  More important, Yucca Mountain will never eliminate the waste that is \nstored around the country. Everybody within the sound of my voice \nshould understand the big lie the DOE and the nuclear power industry is \nprojecting. The big lie is that the 131 sites where we have waste now \nwill be reduced to one site. Well, the fact is, that will never happen. \nIt will never happen because there are 46,000 tons there now. They can \nmove 3,000 tons a year, but they produce 2,000 tons a year. So do the \nmath. You will fill Yucca Mountain before it ever opens.\n\n  Remember, when you take out a spent fuel rod, 95 percent of the heat, \nthe radioactivity is still in it. It is so hot the only thing they can \ndo with it is stick it in water for 5 years to cool it off. After 5 \nyears, they can put it into a dry cask storage container. So this \nstatement that they will only have one site is not true. It is a big \nlie. There will always be 131 sites, plus Yucca Mountain, plus all the \ntrucks and trains. So instead of having one site, we are going to have \nhundreds of thousands of sites.\n  So when my friends march down here and say this is nothing, it is \nlike moving the stuff to New Mexico, I repeat my analogy of a squirt \ngun compared to the most modern tank in America; that is the \ncomparison. The American people need to understand that the millions \nand millions of dollars spent by the nuclear power industry is money \nthat has been spent to deceive and mislead the American people.\n  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will do the right \nthing and vote for the good of their constituents, not for the good of \nthe big lobbying effort that has been conducted in Washington over the \nlast 20 years, and not go the way of the many fundraisers or the way of \nthe vacations that have been paid for by the Nuclear Energy Institute, \nwhere they send people to Las Vegas for a week so they can look at the \nhole in the mountain. I hope they will vote in their constituents' best \ninterests.\n  Jim Hall is a member of the National Academy of Engineering Committee \non Combating Terrorism and was Chairman of the National Transportation\n\n[[Page S5894]]\n\nSafety Board from 1994 to 2001.

This agreement is \nnot widely known, but it is enormously important to our national \nsecurity, and I would like to take this opportunity to call it to the \nattention of the Senate.\n  Under the HEU Agreement, the Russian Federation is converting 500 \nmetric tons of highly enriched uranium from dismantled nuclear weapons \ninto low-enriched uranium fuel for nuclear power plants. The United \nStates then buys the low-enriched uranium for nuclear power plants in \nthis country to use to generate electricity.\n  The benefits of this program, which is sometimes called the \n``megatons to megawatts program,'' are obvious. Nuclear weapons \nscrapped under the program can never be used against us. Weapons-grade \nuranium blended down and consumed in power plants can never fall into \nthe hands of terrorists or rogue states.\n  The United States and Russia entered into the HEU Agreement in 1993. \nThe program will neutralize the equivalent of 20,000 nuclear warheads \nover its 20-year life. More than 150 metric tons of highly enriched \nuranium, the equivalent of nearly 6,000 nuclear warheads, have already \nbeen converted into low-enriched reactor fuel. Another 350 metric tons, \nthe equivalent of 14,000 more warheads, are slated to be converted over \nthe remaining 12 years.\n  Although the Russian HEU Agreement is a government-to-government \nagreement, it is being implemented for the Russian Federation by Tenex \nand for the United States by USEC Inc. USEC was originally established \nby the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to run the Department of Energy's \nuranium enrichment plants as a business. When the Russian HEU Agreement \nwas first executed, USEC was wholly owned by the United States \nGovernment and it was tapped to implement the agreement as the \nGovernment's ``executive agent.'' In 1998, the Government sold USEC to \nprivate investors pursuant to the USEC Privatization Act, but retained \nthe private company as its executive agent for the Russian HEU program.\n  Remarkably, USEC is able to conduct the Russian HEU program without \ncost to the Government. USEC pays the Russians for the uranium, and \nrecovers its costs when it resells the uranium to nuclear utilities. \nThe price paid by USEC was originally set in the HEU Agreement and has \nsince been subject to negotiation between the parties.\n  Some time ago, USEC and Tenex reached an agreement on a new market-\nbased mechanism for determining the price USEC will pay Russia for \nfuture deliveries. Yesterday, the State Department announced that the \nGovernments of the United States and the Russian Federation have \napproved the new pricing mechanism.\n  The new pricing mechanism puts the program on a more commercial \nbasis. It does away with the need for the two governments to \nrenegotiate the price periodically. By basing the price on market \nconditions, the new mechanism provides a more stable and predictable \nprocedure for determining future prices and should help ensure the \nlong-term success of the program.\n  In addition, this past Tuesday, the Department of Energy announced \nthat it had signed an agreement with USEC that resolves a number of \nissues between them. Earlier, there had been talk of the Government \nreplacing USEC as its executive agent under the Russian HEU deal or \nappointing multiple agents. Under the accord announced on Tuesday, the \nDepartment of Energy agreed to recommend that USEC continue to serve as \nthe Government's sole executive agent, and USEC committed to meeting \nthe annual delivery schedules in the Russian HEU agreement over the \nremaining years of the agreement.\n  The Russian HEU Agreement serves us well. Each Russian warhead that \nis dismantled and each ton of weapons-grade uranium that is converted \nto commercial reactor fuel reduces the risk of nuclear proliferation \nand enhances our security. USEC has made great progress implementing \nthe program over the past 8 years. The two announcements made this week \ngive us hope for further progress in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5894-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5894-S5895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I wish to take this opportunity to \nexpress my support for the Colombian people following the Presidential \nelection in Colombia on May 26. I was pleased to cosponsor a resolution \nlast week welcoming the successful completion of democratic elections \nin Colombia. It is a tribute to the Colombian people that despite \nsignificant threats and violence, both international and national \nelection observers found the elections to be free and fair.\n  I am also pleased that the President-elect of Colombia, Alvaro Uribe \nVelez, has been in Washington this week to discuss U.S. support for \ncounternarcotics operations. The United States has already invested \nheavily in a unified effort to reduce the flow of drugs from Colombia, \nwhile simultaneously promoting human rights and economic development \nthroughout the country. It is essential that we build on that \ninvestment during the new administration of President-elect Uribe. \nIndeed, I am pleased that President-elect Uribe has said that he looks \nforward to the day when Colombia is not sending a single kilogram of \ncocaine to the United States. To make that a reality, we must ensure \nthat coca growers in the poor regions of Colombia have access to \nalternative economic opportunities, and that they take advantage of \nthose opportunities to get out of the coca business for good. We must \nalso promote human rights and the rule of law in Colombia; otherwise, \nthe cycle of violence and narco-trafficking that is draining the \nlivelihood of the country will ultimately lead to total state collapse, \nand to even more narco-trafficking and perhaps support for terrorism in \nthe ruins of such a failed state.\n  With the visit to Washington this week of a new President-elect, this \nis an opportune time to reflect on some of the new directions in our \nbilateral relationship with Colombia. In particular, this provides an \nappropriate opportunity to step back and evaluate the effectiveness to \ndate of our various policy objectives in Colombia. We must consider, \nfor example, whether our initiatives have been effective in reducing \nthe levels of violence in the country, in seeking accountability for \ngrave human rights violations, and in cutting off the narco-traffickers \nwho provide both financing and incentives for insurgent forces. We must \nalso ask whether our policy in Colombia provides an effective balance \nof military assistance and well-managed development support. And we \nhave an obligation to the people of Colombia to consider the human and \nenvironmental effects of our ongoing fumigation campaign.\n  In reflecting on the situation in Colombia today, one thing remains \nabsolutely clear: The status quo in Colombia cannot be justified. The \nprolonged civil war, which is fueled by lucrative narco-trafficking, \nhas created a volatile society, with untold suffering and a seemingly \nendless cycle of grave human rights abuses. The narco-traffickers have \nprospered, the guerrillas, and increasingly the paramilitaries, have \noffered the narco-traffickers hired protection, and they, too, are \nprospering from this deadly relationship. It is the people of Colombia, \nthe average farmers and the honest citizens, who must pay the price of \nthe war. That price can be counted in the number of lives lost or \ndisplaced in Colombia. But we must also count the lives lost to drugs \nand violence on our own streets in the United States. Such vast costs \nare wholly unacceptable.\n  So, where do we go from here? First and foremost, we must continue to \nscrutinize the relationship between the\n\n[[Page S5895]]\n\nColombian military and the paramilitary forces in the country. The \nColombian military has been taking steps to sever its ties with the \nparamilitaries, but I am worried that those steps have not translated \ninto meaningful progress on the ground. As the United States considers \nsupporting the counter-insurgency operations of the Colombian military, \nwe must guarantee that Colombia takes seriously its obligation to seek \nout and prosecute the paramilitaries. And we must remember that by most \naccounts, the paramilitaries today are more responsible than any other \nterrorist group for the massive war crimes committed in the country.\n  We must also ensure that the Colombian government commits its \nresources to a more robust investment in its own institutions. We must \nnever substitute our own assets or personnel for an appropriate level \nof investment by Colombia in its own future. This must include domestic \nsupport to institutions of justice, and for the protection of \ncivilians, as well as responsible military support to defend the \ncivilian population from rebel and paramilitary attacks.\n  Finally, we must do more to ensure that communities that have already \nbeen so hard-hit by the conflict have access to development \nopportunities to rebuild their lives. Alternative development must be a \ncornerstone of any effective counter-narcotics campaign. Without \nalternative development, displaced communities will have only one \nrational economic option: to turn to the lucrative but illegal \ncultivation of the coca that drug lords are so eager to buy and \nprotect. Quite simply, we must give battered rural communities a viable \neconomic alternative to coca or poppy cultivation if we are ever to \nbring the wars in Colombia to an end. To date, our investment in such \ndevelopment has been insufficient. And perhaps as a result, we have \nalso made little progress in stemming the flow of drugs. Without more \nof a social investment in alternative development, I fear that the coca \nfumigation program that is being supported by the United States will \nmerely shift drug cultivation into even more remote and ecologically \nsensitive areas of the country.\n  So I rise today to congratulate the people of Colombia on their \nsuccessful Presidential election in May. That democratic institutions \ncontinue to function in the midst of such violence and intimidation is \nan impressive tribute to the Colombian people. But as the United States \nmoves to support our new colleagues in the incoming government in \nColombia, we must continually ask ourselves whether our intervention is \nachieving our policy goals, and whether it is making a difference to \nthe lives of average Colombians.\n  Carefully crafted U.S. support for Colombia can make a difference. \nIndeed, it must make a difference. But we must monitor the effects of \nthat support very closely, because neither the U.S. taxpayer nor the \nvast communities in Colombia that have already been devastated by the \nwar can afford to see such a significant U.S. investment in Colombia \nfail. We cannot and must not abandon Colombia. But at the same time, we \ncannot delude ourselves about the efficacy of our policy thus far. \nCritics of U.S. policy in Colombia, and in many cases I have been among \nthem, raise valid questions about the commitment of the military to the \nrule of law and to protecting civilians. They raise important questions \nabout the consequences of fumigation and the economic prospects for \nfarmers who agree not to plant coca. It is our responsibility to weigh \nthese points and to answer these questions, and where necessary, to \nadjust our policy so that we get it right. For Americans and for \nColombians, the stakes are too high to do otherwise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5895-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nlast year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in January \n1998 in Springfield, IL. A gay man was abducted, tortured, and robbed. \nThe attacker, Thomas Goacher, 27, was charged with a hate crime, \naggravated kidnapping, armed robbery and aggravated battery in \nconnection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5895-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL ASKING SAVES KIDS DAY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, yesterday was the second annual National \nAsking Saves Kids Day or ASK Day. ASK is a national public health \ncampaign that urges parents to ask their neighbors and community \nmembers if they have a gun in the home before sending their child over \nto play. The ASK campaign helps to enable parents to protect their \nchildren from the danger of a gun that is not safety stored. This is a \nsensible step toward preventing gun violence. According to PAX, a non-\npolitical organization that promotes solutions to the problem of gun \nviolence and sponsors the ASK campaign, over 40 percent of American \nhomes with children have guns. Many of these weapons are kept unlocked \nand loaded. Child access to these firearms is one reason why children \nin the U.S. are more likely to die of gun violence than from all \nnatural causes combined. In recognition of National ASK Day, parents, \nchildren, community leaders, and neighbors across the nation planted \nflowers as a symbol of the more than 3,000 children that PAX estimates \ncould be saved through the simple message of the ASK campaign.\n  It is critical that we do all we can to keep children from gaining \nunsupervised access to firearms. That is why I cosponsored Senator \nDurban's Child Access Prevention Act. Under this bill, adults who fail \nto lock up loaded firearms or an unloaded firearm with ammunition could \nbe held liable if a weapon is taken by a child and used to kill or \ninjure him or herself or another person. The bill also increases the \npenalties for selling a gun to a juvenile and creates a gun safety \neducation program that includes parent-teacher organizations, local law \nenforcement and community organizations. This bill is similar to \nlegislation President Bush signed into law as Governor of Texas. I \nsupport this bill and hope the Senate will act on it.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in recognizing National ASK Day, \nand I urge them to support Senator Durban's common sense gun safety \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5895-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5895-S5896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RATIFICATION OF NEW YORK TREATIES AGAINST THE SALE, TRAFFICKING, AND \n   PROSTITUTION OF CHILDREN AND AGAINST THE USE OF CHILDREN IN COMBAT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, it gives me great pleasure to hail the \nratification of the Optional Protocol Against the Sale of Children, \nChild Prostitution, and Child Pornography by the U.S. Senate this week. \nI applaud the strong leadership of Senator Biden, Chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Helms, the Ranking \nMember of that Committee, as well as Senator Boxer in bringing this new \ntreaty to fruition.\n  The use, procuring, or offering of a child for prostitution, for the \nproduction of pornography, or for pornographic purposes is included in \nthe universal definition of the worst forms of child labor in the \nInternational Labor Organization's Convention 182 which this Senate \nratified in 1999 on a 96-0 vote. Therefore, it is altogether fitting \nand proper that we now follow through and adopt this new instrument of \ninternational law to crackdown worldwide against the despicable acts of \ntrafficking and prostituting of children.\n  This Optional Protocol gives special emphasis to the criminalization \nof the sale and trafficking of children as well as child prostitution \nand pornography. It also stresses the importance of improved \ninternational cooperation and coordination to combat the sexual \nexploitation of children everywhere in the world, while also promoting \nheightened awareness, more information\n\n[[Page S5896]]\n\n gathering, and public education campaigns to enhance the protection of \nchildren trapped in one of the worst forms of child labor.\n  For nearly a decade, I have been working hard to end the scourge of \nabusive child labor. It is a tragic and disturbing fact that millions \nof children under 18 years of age currently endure slave-like \nconditions in brothels, back alleys, and hideaways that jeopardize \ntheir basic health, safety and well-being. These children are being \ntricked, lured, and sold outright for purposes of forced labor and \nexploitation in the commercial sex trade of prostitution and \npornography.\n  In the European Union, the International Organization for Migration \nreports a marked increase in the number of unaccompanied minors \ntrafficked for sexual purposes from Central and Eastern Europe, Africa \nand Asia.\n  In India alone, hundreds of thousands of children exist in slavery-\nlike conditions for purposes of forced labor or prostitution, according \nto the U.S. Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights \nPractices.\n  UNICEF estimates that at least 200,000 children every year are \ntrafficked into the Central and West African slave trade for purposes \nof forced labor.\n  In Mexico, a UNICEF study estimates that 16,000 children are victims \nof sexual exploitation--many of them are prostituted in tourist \ndestinations such as Cancun and Acapulco.\n  In the United States, experts within the Department of Justice \nestimate that at least 100,000 children are involved in the sex trade \nin any given year. Approximately 400 cases of Internet child \npornography are prosecuted each year in the Federal courts alone. I am \npleased to report, for example, that a crackdown on Internet child \npornography was launched last year in Des Moines, the capital city of \nmy own home state.\n  A 1999 report issued by the Central Intelligence Agency estimated \nthat up to 50,000 women and children are trafficked into the United \nStates each year.\n  We must not stand by while millions of children are sold for purposes \nof forced labor and consigned to prostitution and pornography in order \nto satisfy adults who profit from their abuse. When presented with the \ndimensions of human trafficking in 2000, I joined 94 of my colleagues \nin the U.S. Senate to express both our outrage over the criminal \nbehavior of child traffickers and our support for the victims of \ntrafficking by passing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.\n  This week we are taking more effective action through ratification of \nthe Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and \nChild Pornography. It is an important victory in our effort to protect \nchildren everywhere. I look forward to continuing this effort with my \ncolleagues in the weeks, months, and years to come. In approving this \nnew stand-alone treaty, we are affirming that the American people \nbelieve that all children, given their vulnerability to adult coercion \nand greed, deserve special protection in international law and practice \nagainst sexual predators and exploiters.\n  I also want to take a moment to say how pleased I am that the Senate \nthis week has ratified the Optional Protocol Against the Use of \nChildren in Armed Conflict.\n  As you know, I worked very hard with Senator Helms, in particular, to \nsecure ratification of the International Labor Organization's (ILO) \nConvention #182 to Prohibit the Worst Forms of Child Labor. Our \nbipartisan efforts paid off when the Senate in November, 1999 ratified \nthat important new human rights treaty on a 96-0 vote.\n  Now included in the universal definition of the worst forms of child \nlabor within ILO Convention #182 is the prohibition of forced or \ncompulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict. \nTherefore, the Senate's action this week on this Optional Protocol \nmeans the U.S. has followed through on our international commitment at \nthe time that ILO Convention #182 was under negotiation and joined the \nworld community in universally condemning and outlawing the recruitment \nand use of child soldiers.\n  It probably seems unthinkable to most Americans that young children \nhave been recruited, trained, and turned into soldiers who are actively \nengaged in combat. The latest research estimates that more than 300,000 \nchildren under 18 years of age are participating in armed conflicts \naround the world. For example, there are an estimated 50,000 child \nsoldiers in Burma alone. Hundreds of thousands more are members of \narmed forces who could be sent into combat at any moment. Although most \nchild recruits are over fifteen years of age, significant recruitment \nstarts at ten years, and the use of even younger children is not \nuncommon.\n  Robbed of their childhood, child combatants are subjected to a cycle \nof violence that they are too young to understand or resist. While many \nof these young recruits may start out as porters or messengers, too \noften they end up on the front lines of combat. Some are used for \nespecially hazardous duty, such as entering mine fields ahead of older \ntroops, or undertaking suicide missions. Some have been forced to \ncommit atrocities against family members or relatives. Inexperienced \nand immature, these children suffer far higher casualty rates than \ntheir adult counterparts. Those who survive are often physically or \npsychologically scarred for life. Typically lacking an education or \ncivilian job skills, their futures are often very bleak.\n  Ninety-three percent of Americans believe that combatants should be \nat least 18 years of age, according to a recent poll conducted by the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross. Accordingly, I want to \nparticularly salute the leadership of my colleagues, Senator Biden, \nChairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Helms, \nthe Ranking Member of that Committee, as well as Senator Wellstone and \nthank them for their tireless work to see this treaty through to \nratification. There is absolutely no justification for the forced or \ncompulsory recruitment of children under 18 for deployment into combat \nanywhere in this world and I am proud that America is doing our part to \nend this egregious abuse of human rights and affront to common decency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5896-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5896-S5897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FIRST RESPONDER TERRORISM PREPAREDNESS ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I rise to urge my \ncolleagues to support the First Responder Terrorism Preparedness Act of \n2002 that I introduced along with the committee chairman, Senator \nJeffords. This legislation is a huge step forward in providing the \nnecessary tools for local and state first responders to prepare to \nrespond to any act of terrorism.\n  We recognize that it is the local emergency responders who are on the \nscene first to rescue and help those who have been caught in a \ndisaster. I visited the Pentagon and Ground Zero less than a week after \nthe attacks and can tell you that these first responders are true \npatriots, and they live and serve us in every town and city across this \ngreat Nation. These local heros, the type of first responders who made \nthe ultimate sacrifice on September 11, are the embodiment of the \nAmerican spirit--brave, selfless, and caring. They save lives and we \nshould focus our resources to help them with their mission.\n  Prior to his confirmation to be the head of FEMA, nearly 9 months \nbefore the terrorists attacks on this Nation, I met with Joe Allbaugh \nto discuss FEMA priorities. Chief among the priorities we discussed was \nthat of terrorism preparedness of our Nation's first responders. Little \ndid we know what this Nation would be facing less than 9 months down \nthe road.\n  Since September 11, I have met with Director Allbaugh and his staff \non several occasions, and the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nof which I am the ranking member, has held a number of hearings on this \nissue.\n  In January, I enthusiastically endorsed President Bush's announcement \nof his first responder plan to be run by FEMA. This bill, the First \nResponder Terrorism Preparedness Act, mirrors the President's proposal \nand represents months of work by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee flushing the President's proposal with the aid of the \nadministration.\n  In brief, this bill will authorize a first responder grant program \nfor 4 years at $3.5 billion per year. Each\n\n[[Page S5897]]\n\nState will receive a minimum of $15 million with the remaining being \ndistributed to States based on criteria set by FEMA but will include \npopulation, vital infrastructure, military installations and proximity \nto international borders. The money will be used for preparedness \nefforts including to purchase equipment, train, develop response plans, \nconduct exercises and provide for communication needs. We ensure that \nthe money does not get tied up in bureaucracy and gets to the first \nresponders.\n  The bill also requires that all the efforts at the State and local \nlevel be part of a broader national preparedness strategy as determined \nby the Office of National Preparedness (ONP). The ONP was put in place \nby the President over a year ago, a move I have been advocating for \nsome time, and the President deserves a great deal of credit for that \naction.\n  This bill takes the additional step of establishing the ONP in \nstatute. The ONP will help to coordinate preparedness efforts at the \nFederal level and be the point Federal office for the State and local \nresponders. It is vital that we do not have thousands of independent \npreparedness plans and efforts--we need a local, state, regional and \nnational strategy.\n  The bill will also enhance the capabilities of FEMA designated Urban \nSearch and Rescue teams. Many of those teams were activated on \nSeptember 11, but have had serious financial difficulties in \nmaintaining adequate levels of preparedness. That certainly should not \nbe the case and we address those needs.\n  We all entered a new world and a new reality on September 11, and we \nmust be prepared for whatever may come our way. The President has done \na tremendous job to dramatically reduce the vulnerabilities of this \nNation and I, once again, applaud his effort to establish a new \nDepartment of Homeland Security. However, regardless of how much we \nwork to prevent further attacks, we must be prepared if the unthinkable \nwere to happen again. This will be an ongoing effort and this bill \ntakes a very large step in providing the resources and direction to \nensure that the effort is productive.\n  I thank the chairman of the EPW Committee for his leadership and for \nworking closely with me on this important and bipartisan issue. It is \nmy hope that our bill will make it to the President's desk in short \norder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5897-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO COL. DAVID R. CHAFFEE\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, today I pay tribute to a U.S. \nAir Force officer, Colonel David R. Chaffee. Colonel Chaffee currently \nserves as the Program Director of the Combat Air Forces Command and \nControl Systems Program office at the Electronic Systems Center on \nHanscom Air Force Base. He will soon retire from the Air Force after 25 \nyears of service. Today, it is my privilege to recognize some of \nColonel Chaffee's accomplishments, and to commend his service to the \nAir Force and our Nation.\n  Colonel Chaffee was born in Rockwood, TN, and began his Air Force \ncareer as a cadet at the U.S. Air Force Academy. Early in his career, \nhe was an Aeronautical Developmental Engineer at Wright Patterson Air \nForce Base, OH, and later returned there as the Program Manager for the \nF100-PW-220 engine. After multiple, high-level acquisition positions at \nHeadquarters in Washington, DC, he spent 2 years at the Ogden Air \nLogistics Center at Hill Air Force Base, UT as a Program Director \nbefore arriving in May 2000 at Hanscom Air Force Base for his current \nassignment.\n  Throughout his career, Colonel Chaffee won numerous awards for \nperformance in the Acquisitions career field, including the General \nO'Malley Memorial Leadership Award in 1987 and the Clements Award in \n1985. Additionally, he was a Distinguished Graduate from Squadron \nOfficers School and Air Command and Staff College. He holds two \nmaster's degrees, one in Aeronautical Engineering from the Air Force \nInstitute of Technology and one in National Resource Strategy from the \nIndustrial College of the Armed Forces.\n  At Hanscom Air Force Base, Colonel Chaffee's leadership contributed \nto the Combat Air Forces Command and Control Systems Program Office \nbeing regarded as a center of excellence for command and control and \nair battle management.

Madam President, during the turbulent social unrest \nof the 1960s in the U.S. and particularly Detroit, Jerry Blocker--a \n``skinny little kid with the big voice''--often dominated the radio and \ntelevision news business. His rise and success in the industry has been \nattributed to an imagination fueled by a strong sense of drama, and his \nability to craft a calm, orderly objectivity out of news ripe with \ndisorder, rawness, and uncertainty.\n  Born on the west side of Detroit on February 14, 1931, Jerry \nBlocker's arrival on Valentine's Day was unheralded during the height \nof the Great Depression. Because of the Depression, Jerry's parents and \nfamily bestowed upon him the only gifts they could afford: an abundance \nof love and pride. Those generous gifts carried dividends the remainder \nof his life.\n  During his early years at Columbian and Sampson elementary schools, \nJerry Blocker thrived while participating in school plays. Later, while \nattending McMichael Intermediate he became interested in all activities \nassociated with radio. By the time he reached Northwestern High School, \nit was recognized that the ``skinny little kid with the big voice'' was \ndestined for a future in the media. At Wayne State University in the \nmid-1950s, Jerry honed his broadcast skills but discovered that \nminorities were not to be found working in the broadcast business. His \ndream would have to wait. In the late 1950s Jerry became a teacher, \nfirst serving at Hampton Institute in Virginia, then with the Detroit \nBoard of Education. His flair for the dramatic became evident as he \nstaged plays, pageants, and festivals to the delight of hundreds of \nchildren.\n  In 1961, Jerry Blocker finally found employment in the radio industry \nwhen WCHD entered the general-format radio market as the first of many \nstations. In 1967, Jerry became the first black television news \nanchorman in the state of Michigan, working for WWJ-TV Channel 4, now \nknown as WDIV-TV. He was hired by Channel 4 after the 1967 Detroit \nriots and anchored weekend newscasts until 1975. After his departure \nfrom WWJ, Jerry Blocker was hired as the television news director of \nChannel 62, the first television station to actively recruit from and \nprogram for Detroit's African-American community. Jerry Blocker won \nseveral awards for his distinguished and accurate broadcast \nprofessionalism.\n  During his 10-year career in television, Jerry Blocker witnessed and \nreported the events which helped shape Detroit and the nation in the \nyears immediately following the advent of U.S. Civil Rights \nlegislation: the assassination of Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., the \nchallenge of the Detroit NAACP and the Detroit Board of Education, \nwhich was eventually settled by the U.S. Supreme Court, and the \ntremendous effect on the tri-county area and on all of Michigan by the \nelection of Coleman A. Young, Detroit's first black mayor.\n  In 1977, Blocker was named executive director of the Detroit branch \nof the\n\n[[Page S5898]]\n\nNAACP while at the same time hosting a popular music show on radio \nstation WQBH. During his spare time, Jerry served as a mentor for \nBlacks in Advertising, Radio, and Television. Blocker was also employed \nas the media spokesperson for the U.S. Census Bureau in Michigan, Ohio, \nand West Virginia.\n  In the 1980s, Jerry Blocker founded a political campaign management \nfirm, Jerry Blocker Enterprises, the oldest minority-owned political-\nconsulting and advertising agency in the Detroit metropolitan area. \nLater, that agency folded into Blocker and Associates, Inc., so that \nJerry could work with and mentor his young daughters, Nicole and \nShannon. Until the time of Jerry Blocker's death on October 31, 2001, \nhe and his beloved daughters worked for public officeholders and \ncandidates in their quests for victory at the polls.\n  The Detroit Metropolitan Chapter of the Society of Professional \nJournalists, SPJ, is honoring Jerry Blocker by presenting him a \nposthumous Lifetime Achievement award to his family and friends. Said \nSPJ Chapter President Jack Kresnak, ``I wish we had honored Jerry \nbefore he died. He did a great job at our banquet a couple of years ago \nspeaking on behalf of Bob Bennett who was getting a lifetime \nachievement award.''\n  I know my Senate colleagues will join me in congratulating Jerry \nBlocker for his tremendous accomplishments and encouraging others to \nfollow his distinguished example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5898-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OREGON HERO OF THE WEEK\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I am pleased to rise \ntoday to honor an outstanding organization located in my home State of \nOregon. I would like to congratulate Guide Dogs for the Blind on its \n60th anniversary of providing exemplary service to the blind and \nvisually impaired community in Oregon and across the country.\n  Guide Dogs for the Blind is a nonprofit, charitable organization that \nprovides guide dogs and training to the visually impaired community \nthroughout the United States and Canada. With approximately 10 million \nAmericans categorized as blind or visually impaired, Guide Dogs for the \nBlind performs an essential service that deserves to be recognized in \nthis body on its 60th anniversary.\n  The services provided by Guide Dogs for the Blind, and organizations \nlike it, will only become more important in the coming decades. \nStatistics show that people 65 years and older are at high risk of \nsuffering from poor vision. On average, 144 Oregonians benefit from \nguide dogs trained by Guide Dogs for the Blind every year, and as our \npopulation continues to grey, the need for guide dogs and organizations \nthat train them will almost certainly grow.\n  The use of guide dogs has been increasingly accepted over the course \nof the last century. Although guide dogs existed prior to World War II, \nmost visually impaired people could not take full advantage of such \nservices due to existing federal and state laws restricting animals \nfrom entering buildings. But only three days after the most devastating \nattack in American history, December 10, 1941, President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt signed a law finally requiring government buildings to admit \nseeing-eye dogs. Today, during these trying times, it is important for \nall of us to note that despite the turbulent political situation he \nfaced after Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt still prioritized the \nneeds of the visually impaired community by signing that law.\n  Sixty years later, the program instituted by Guide Dogs for the Blind \nserved the nation on its darkest day since Pearl Harbor. During the \nhorrific attacks against the United States on September 11, a blind man \nworking on the 78th floor of the World Trade Center was led to safety \nby a guide dog that had graduated from the Guide Dogs for the Blind \nprogram. Guide dogs, now an essential part of so many lives, can be \nremembered along with the selfless firefighters, police officers, and \nrescue workers who sacrificed so much to help others that day.\n  Each and every staff member and volunteer at Guide Dogs for the Blind \nis a hero to their communities and to the people who benefit from their \nservices. I rise to salute those associated with the Guide Dogs for the \nBlind for their dedication and continued service to visually impaired \npeople throughout the country. Even in this era of innovation, the \nblind and visually impaired would not have the same opportunities \nafforded to the rest of us without the commitment of citizens like \nthose associated with Guide Dogs for the Blind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5898-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING JACK JURDEN'S TALENT AND WIT\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I rise today to salute a man who \nhas lampooned me more than anyone else in Delaware throughout my 30 \nyears as a U.S. Senator. He has stuck me in the mud, dirtied by \npolitical campaigns. He has sketched me swimming in an inner tube \nfighting for NATO's involvement in Bosnia. He has put me in my place \nin, an over-sized Chair to characterize my position on the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. He has donned me in a wizard's robe next \nto a giant cooking pot simmering over a fire.\n  Yes, today I rise to salute a man whose signature is a talking frog.\n  Today I rise to salute a man who has made me laugh nearly every \nmorning that I have opened my local newspaper for nearly the past 40 \nyears and flipped to the editorial page.\n  Today I rise to salute long-time News Journal editorial cartoonist \nJack Jurden.\n  After nearly four decades of his whimsical, witty, thought-provoking, \nlight-hearted, good-natured sketches, Jack Jurden is retiring. He is \nnot quite putting his pencils and paper in a drawer permanently. \nFortunately for us in Delaware, he has promised to produce a few \neditorial cartoons a year. But I and so many daily readers of \nDelaware's largest newspaper will miss his black and white sketches \nthat have added so much color and laughter to our lives.\n  Jack joined the News Journal in 1952 as a photo engraver. His real \nlove was drawing, so the News Journal decided to take a chance on him \nas the editorial Cartoonist. In my opinion, that is the best decision \nthat newspaper ever made.\n  Jack's start in the newspaper business started long before his career \nwith the News Journal. Like many of us, as a kid growing up, Jack was a \nnewspaper delivery boy. Fresh out of high school in Allentown, PA, he \nput his artistic talents on hold to serve his country in World War II. \nAs an army soldier, he was stationed in the Philippines and in occupied \nJapan.\n  Over the years, I am very fortunate to have gotten to know Jack well. \nHis love for his craft, his country and his community are surpassed \nonly by his love and loyalty to his family: his wife of 50 years, Faye; \nhis daughter Jenifer and his daughter Jan, who is a Superior Court \nJudge in Delaware. These days Jack's true love is his grandchildren.\n  I realize this is not your typical Senate tribute. But I so admire \nthis man and his talent that I have many of his cartoons lampooning me \nframed in my office and in my home. So I will miss him. And I think I \nspeak for thousands of others in Delaware who have laughed heartily \nevery morning with their coffee, their coworkers and their family as \nthey scan his take on events in our State and our world, always looking \nfor that little talking frog in the corner to offer some words of \nwisdom.\n  My very best wishes to him and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5898-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5898-S5899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNIZING IOWA STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE NATIONAL HISTORY DAY \n                                CONTEST\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY.

Madam President, today I recognize the \nimpressive civic achievements of Roswell, NM. These civic achievements \nhave not only bettered this New Mexico community, but have earned \nRoswell the national honor of receiving an All-American City Award. The \nAll-America City Award is the oldest and most respected community \nrecognition program in the Nation. This award recognizes communities, \nsuch as Roswell, whose citizens work together to identify and address \ncommunity-wide challenges and achieve extraordinary goals. This year \nRoswell not only met, but exceeded the selection criteria of the \ncontest through its enthusiastic public participation, its involvement \nof diverse perspectives in decisions, and its city accomplishments \nwhich have significantly improved community life. Roswell met the \nchallenge of the All-America contest by identifying its largest \ncommunity challenges and displaying how the community has worked \ntogether to make these challenges areas of success. The people of \nRoswell identified their biggest challenges as lack of access to health \ncare and unemployment and then demonstrated how, as a community, they \nhad worked to improve these areas over the past 3 years.\n  The city of Roswell highlighted three admirable projects that \nimpacted their areas of challenge including ``Incidentally Roswell,'' \nthe Youth Dental Initiative and Dress for Success. Through the \n``Incidentally Roswell'' project the community has successfully used \nthe historical extraterrestrial phenomenon of Roswell to better its \neconomy. The people of Roswell have worked to use its historical \nexposure to increase tourism thus creating more jobs and bringing more \nmoney into the community. In their presentation the Roswell \nrepresentatives made light of the situation by cleverly centering their \npresentation around questions asked by E.T. Holmes, a space alien \ndetective. Along with the economy the people of Roswell also rightly \nfocus on bettering the lives of the children in their community. \nThrough the Youth Dental Initiative Roswell is using Medicaid money to \nprovide children with dental care. The program includes a dental clinic \nat which patients can be treated as well as a dental van that goes to \nschools to provide dental services to children. Since 1999 the Youth \nDental Initiative the program has serviced a remarkable 4,000 children \nin Chavez County. Roswell's dedication to the well being of their \nchildren is both impressive and commendable. And finally, Roswell \npresented their Dress for Success program, which aids children and \nadults to dress in an appropriate manner to achieve success in their \nschools and work places. This program has shown especially good results \nin the Roswell school system through providing uniforms to the 86 \npercent of children who are in poverty in the area. Through eliminating \nthe visual clothing differences among the students, Roswell is \nexperiencing improved behavior, and increases in grade point averages, \nattendance and self-esteem. Equally impressive is the fact that this \nprogram is fueled by the generosity and concern of the community for \ntheir children. The Dress for Success program shows Roswell's great \nsupport of their children and their determination to help them succeed.\n  These three projects that strive for civic betterment are only a \nglimpse of the efforts Roswell is making in order to make their city a \nnoteworthy part of the Nation. It is a great honor for Roswell, as well \nas for the entire state of New Mexico, for this community to receive \nthe All-America Award. Through their dedication, patriotism, and hard \nwork the people of Roswell have shown that American citizens can indeed \nmake a difference in their communities. Roswell is a community that has \ntaken great strides to overcome its challenges. I commend the citizens \nof Roswell for striving to achieve a high quality of life and thus \nhelping the State of New Mexico continue to be the land of enchantment. \nI would like to congratulate the city of Roswell on their great \nachievements and the well deserved recognition of their \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5899-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5899-S5900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JUNETEENTH INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, this week people all across the \nnation are engaging in the oldest known celebration of the ending of \nslavery. It was in June of 1865, that the Union soldiers landed in \nGalveston, TX with the news that the war had ended and that slavery \nfinally had come to an end in the United States. This was two and a \nhalf years after the Emancipation Proclamation, which had become \nofficial January 1, 1863. This week and specifically on June 19, we \ncelebrate what is known as ``Juneteenth Independence Day.'' It was on \nthis date, June 19, that slaves in the Southwest finally learned of the \nend of slavery. Although passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in January \n1863, legally abolished slavery, many African Americans remained in \nservitude due to the slow dissemination of this news across the \ncountry.\n  Since that time, over 130 years ago, the descendants of slaves have \nobserved this anniversary of emancipation as a remembrance of one of \nthe most tragic periods of our nation's history. The suffering, \ndegradation and brutality of slavery cannot be repaired, but the memory \ncan serve to ensure that no such inhumanity is ever perpetrated again \non American soil.\n  All across America we also celebrate the many important achievements \nof former slaves and their descendants. We do so because in 1926, Dr. \nCarter G. Woodson, son of former slaves, proposed such a recognition as \na way of preserving the history of African Americans and recognizing \nthe enormous contributions of a people of great strength, dignity, \nfaith and conviction--a people who rendered their achievements for the \nbetterment and advancement of a nation once lacking in humanity towards \nthem. Every February, nationwide, we celebrate African American History \nMonth. And, every year on June 19, we celebrate ``Juneteenth \nIndependence Day.''\n  Lerone Bennett, editor, writer and lecturer has reflected on the life \nand times of Dr. Woodson. Bennett tells us that one of the most \ninspiring and instructive stories in African American history is the \nstory of Woodson's struggle and rise from the coal mines of West \nVirginia to the summit of academic achievement:\n\n       At 17, the young man who was called by history to reveal \n     Black history was an untutored coal miner. At 19, after \n     teaching himself the fundamentals of English and arithmetic, \n     he entered high school and mastered the four-year curriculum \n     in less than two\n\n[[Page S5900]]\n\n     years. At 22, after two-thirds of a year at Berea College [in \n     Kentucky], he returned to the coal mines and studied Latin \n     and Greek between trips to the mine shafts. He then went on \n     to the University of Chicago, where he received bachelor's \n     and master's degrees, and Harvard University, where he became \n     the second Black to receive a doctorate in history. The rest \n     is history--Black history.\n\n  In keeping with the spirit and the vision of Dr. Carter G. Woodson, I \nwould like to pay tribute to two courageous women, claimed by my home \nstate of Michigan, who played significant roles in addressing American \ninjustice and inequality. These are two women of different times who \nwould change the course of history.\n  The contributions of Sojourner Truth, who helped lead our country out \nof the dark days of slavery, and Rosa Parks whose dignified leadership \nsparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the start of the Civil Rights \nmovement are indelibly etched in the chronicle of not only the history \nof this nation. Moreover, they are viewed with distinction and \nadmiration throughout the world.\n  Sojourner Truth, though unable to read or write, was considered one \nof the most eloquent and noted spokespersons of her day on the \ninhumanity and immorality of slavery. She was a leader in the \nabolitionist movement, and a ground breaking speaker on behalf of \nequality for women. Michigan recently honored her with the dedication \nof the Sojourner Truth Memorial Monument, which was unveiled in Battle \nCreek, MI on September 25, 1999.\n  Truth lived in Washington, DC for several years, helping slaves who \nhad fled from the South and appearing at women's suffrage gatherings. \nShe returned to Battle Creek in 1875, and remained there until her \ndeath in 1883. Sojourner Truth spoke from her heart about the most \ntroubling issues of her time. A testament to Truth's convictions is \nthat her words continue to speak to us today.\n  On May 4, 1999, legislation was enacted which authorized the \nPresident of the United States to award the Congressional Gold Medal to \nRosa Parks. I was pleased to coauthor this fitting tribute to Rosa \nParks, the gentle warrior who decided that she would no longer tolerate \nthe humiliation and demoralization of racial segregation on a bus. Her \npersonal bravery and self-sacrifice are remembered with reverence and \nrespect by us all.\n  Forty seven years ago, in Montgomery, AL, the modern civil rights \nmovement began when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat and move to \nthe back of the bus. The strength and spirit of this courageous woman \ncaptured the consciousness of not only the American people, but the \nentire world. The boycott which Rosa Parks began was the beginning of \nan American revolution that elevated the status of African Americans \nnationwide and introduced to the world a young leader who would one day \nhave a national holiday declared in his honor, the Reverend Martin \nLuther King Jr.\n  We have come a long way toward achieving justice and equality for \nall. We still however have work to do. In the names of Rosa Parks, \nSojourner Truth, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, and \nmany others, let us rededicate ourselves to continuing the struggle and \nthe struggle for human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5900-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5900-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5900-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT OF A CONTINUATION WITH THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n            THE WESTERN BALKANS BEYOND JUNE 25, 2002--PM 96\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nNotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend the Peace Corps Act to promote global \nacceptance of the principles of international peace and nonviolent \ncoexistence among peoples of diverse cultures and systems of \ngovernment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Peace Corps \nCharter for the 21st Century Act, a bill which I believe addresses the \nneeds and challenges of the Peace Corps of today, and lays a path \ntoward bringing this celebrated organization into its next 40 years.\n  It was 41 years ago when President Kennedy laid out his vision for \nthe future of American volunteer service. He spoke of a corps of \ncommitted and idealistic young volunteers, the Peace Corps, who would \ntravel all over the world, ``promoting world peace and friendship.'' He \nsaw public service as an ideal to transcend political rhetoric. \nVolunteers were not to reflect particular Republican or Democratic \nideology, but rather their service would be a manifestation of the core \nAmerican values we all share. Their principal objectives in this \nendeavor would be to help in the development and betterment of the \ncountries and communities they serve, to foster a greater understanding \nof American values and culture abroad, and to likewise foster a greater \nappreciation of other peoples and cultures on the part of Americans. \nFour decades later, thousands upon thousands of Americans have \nvolunteered for the Peace Corps and worked with diligence and \ncompassion to achieve these aims.\n  It is always with tremendous fondness and pride that I speak of the \nPeace Corps, as it gives me occasion to recall my own years as a \nvolunteer in the Dominican Republic. I have often spoken of how these \ntwo years changed my life. Indeed, living and working outside of the \nUnited States and seeing the way other nations operated for the first \ntime, I grew to appreciate our Nation more and more, and developed a \nstrong sense of what it means to be an American. I was proud to share \nmy experience as an American citizen with the people I was there to \nhelp. Those two years were invaluable to me, and truly brought home to \nme the value of public service.\n  Of course, my Peace Corps service was from 1966-1968, when it was a \nrelatively new organization. Today, I am proud to note that the peace \nCorps now sends more than 7,000 volunteers to 76 different countries \nevery year. This means that there are 7,000 important American liaisons \nscattered around the world helping people, promoting American values, \nand showing the world the best of America. After all, these volunteers \nare really the heart and soul of the Peace Corps. They are the ones on \nthe front lines, working hard, making one-on-one connections with the \ncitizens of the countries in which they work. For 41 years, they have \nbrought a wealth of practical experience to communities in Africa, \nLatin America, Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and the Pacific. \nIndeed, the enduring success of the Peace Corps is rooted in each \nvolunteer's commitment to leave behind skills that allow people to take \ncharge of their own futures.\n  As remarkable as the success of the Peace Corps has been, and as \nimportant a symbol and example it is of public service, in the \naftermath of the tragic attacks on America of September 11, it has \nbecome something more. It has become a necessity. The terrorist attacks \nof last September have shown us that the world has become a much \nsmaller place. The United States can no longer afford to neglect \ncertain countries, or certain parts of the world. We need to find ways \nto help developing countries meet their basic needs, and we need to do \nso now. We especially need to act in places where the citizens are \nparticularly unfamiliar with or unfriendly to American values. Now, \nmore than ever, Peace Corps volunteers play a pivotal role in helping \nus achieve a greater understanding of America abroad, especially in \npredominantly Muslim countries.\n  If we are to expand the aims of the Peace Corps, to broaden its \nscope, its charter, and to send our volunteers into more countries, \nthen we must provide the Peace Corps with adequate resources to safely \nand effectively pursue these objectives. I believe that the legislation \nproposed in the Peace Corps Charter for the 21st Century Act will go a \nlong way to meeting the Peace Corps' funding needs, as well as charting \na course toward the future of this valuable organization. I would like \nto briefly outline the provisions included in ths bill, and explain to \nmy colleagues why I feel its enactment is so important.\n  First, my bill stresses the importance of maintaining the Peace \nCorps' independence from any political affiliation, party, government \nagency, or particular administration. This independence is critical to \nthe continued success, credibility, and acceptance of the volunteers in \nthe countries in which they serve. We must vigilantly preserve this \nsuccess. Especially if we are to expand the number of countries now \nbeing served, and if we plan to send our volunteers into more countries \nwith significant Muslim populations, we must make sure that the Peace \nCorps goals of friendship, peace, and grassroots development are in no \nway muddled or compromised by political objectives.\n  As you may know, Congress has called for an expansion of the Peace \nCorps to include 10,000 volunteers, and the President has called for a \ndoubling of current numbers over five years. While I applaud the \nenthusiasm inherent in these requests, we must not allow such an \nincrease in quantity to in any way impinge on the quality of the Peace \nCorps experience, either for the volunteers themselves or the \ncommunities they serve. There are currently 7,000 volunteers abroad \nworking under a budget of $275,000,000. Any expansion in staffing must \ninclude a commensurate increase in funding and support resources \navailable to them. In fact, to better address the growing mandate and \nneeds of the Peace Corps, this bill suggests the establishment of an \nOffice of Strategic Planning, as well as a Peace Corps Advisory Council\n\n[[Page S5903]]\n\ncomprised of returned volunteers to coordinate existing programs and \naddress long-term expansion plans.\n  One of the most important parts of this bill, which I have already \ntouched on here today, is the need to place a special emphasis on \nrecruiting volunteers for placement in countries whose governments are \nseeking to foster a greater understanding by and about their citizens. \nThere is to be a special authorization of funds for the purposes of \nthis recruitment, as well as a report due on this subject from the \nPeace Corps Director within 60 days of the enactment of this \nlegislation. This report will outline a strategy for increasing the \nPeace Corps presence in countries with substantial Muslim populations. \nWe must find ways to engage with these countries, and to foster a more \nopen interaction and understanding between our citizens.\n  This bill also sets time line requirements and procedures for new \ninitiatives from the Peace Corps Director. Essentially, this increases \nCongressional oversight of new projects, programs, or directives. It \nalso requests a description from the Director of current loan \nforgiveness programs available to volunteers, and a comparison with \nother government-sponsored loan forgiveness programs.\n  Another important provision in this legislation is the training \nmandated for volunteers in the areas of education, prevention, and \ntreatment of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and \ntuberculosis, so that they may better help fight these diseases in the \ncommunities in which they serve. This training, in cooperation with the \ncenters for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of \nHealth, the World Health Organization, the Pan American Health \nOrganization, and local health officials, will prepare volunteers to \npromote a better grassroots approach to public health, safety, and \ndisease prevention.\n  I also feel strongly, and this is also included in the bill, that we \nmust utilize the insights and experience of returned volunteers to get \nthem more involved in the promotion and support of Peace Corps \nprograms. One way to do this is to provide federal grant monies to \ncertain non-profits in the District of Columbia. These non-profits \nwould be established for the express purpose of using the knowledge, \nexperience, and expertise of returned volunteers to help carry out the \ngoals of the Peace Corps. Returned volunteers are an amazing resource \nfor the Peace Corps. They continue to make a difference here at home \nthrough their enduring community service, and their work to strengthen \nAmerica's appreciation of other cultures. Together they are building a \nlegacy of service for the next generation, and it is my hope that the \nappropriations included in this legislation, for non-profit grant \nmonies, will provide them with yet another outlet for continued \nservice.\n  Finally, let me speak briefly to the funding level increases called \nfor in this legislation. Over the next five years this bill calls for \nappropriations to be made in the following amounts: $465 million for \nfiscal year 2004, $500 million for fiscal year 2005, $560 million for \nfiscal year 2006, and $560 million for fiscal year 2007. In addition, \nand most importantly, this bill allows for additional appropriations to \nbe made to address the specific funding needs of the Peace Corps as it \nseeks to increase volunteer strength. Again, we must not allow \nexpansion to infringe on the quality of the Peace Corps experience. We \nmust ensure that we adequately provide for our volunteers and equip \nthem with sufficient resources to best assist the communities in which \nthey serve.\n  In conclusion, I believe that the Peace Corps Charter for the 21st \nCentury Act will do an excellent job of modifying the Peace Corps Act \nto better meet the needs of both our volunteers and an expanding and \nchanging organization. The Peace Corps is a truly remarkable \ninstitution in America, a symbol of the very best of our ideals of \nservice, sacrifice, and self-reliance. Our volunteers are to be \ncommended again for their enduring commitment to these ideals, and for \nthe way they are able to communicate the message of the Peace Corps \nthroughout the world. They deserve the very best from us. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation and the continued success of the \nPeace Corps. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2667\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Peace Corps Charter for the \n     21st Century Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Peace Corps was established in 1961 to promote \n     world peace and friendship through the service of American \n     volunteers abroad.\n       (2) The three goals codified in the Peace Corps Act which \n     have guided the Peace Corps and its volunteers over the \n     years, can work in concert to promote global acceptance of \n     the principles of international peace and nonviolent \n     coexistence among peoples of diverse cultures and systems of \n     government.\n       (3) The Peace Corps has operated in 135 countries with \n     165,000 Peace Corps volunteers since its establishment.\n       (4) The Peace Corps has sought to fulfill three goals, as \n     follows: to help people in developing nations meet basic \n     needs, to promote understanding of America's values and \n     ideals abroad, and to promote an understanding of other \n     peoples by Americans.\n       (5) After more than 40 years of operation, the Peace Corps \n     remains the world's premier international service \n     organization dedicated to promoting grassroots development.\n       (6) The Peace Corps remains committed to sending well \n     trained and well supported Peace Corps volunteers overseas to \n     promote world peace, friendship, and grassroots development.\n       (7) The Peace Corps is an independent agency, and therefore \n     no Peace Corps personnel or volunteers should have any \n     relationship with any United States intelligence agency or be \n     used to accomplish any other goal than the goals established \n     by the Peace Corps Act.\n       (8) The Crisis Corps has been an effective tool in \n     harnessing the skills and talents for returned Peace Corps \n     volunteers and should be expanded to utilize to the maximum \n     extent the pool of talent from the returned Peace Corps \n     volunteer community.\n       (9) The Peace Corps is currently operating with an annual \n     budget of $275,000,000 in 70 countries with 7,000 Peace Corps \n     volunteers.\n       (10) There is deep misunderstanding and misinformation \n     about American values and ideals in many parts of the world, \n     particularly those with substantial Muslim populations, and a \n     greater Peace Corps presence in such places could foster \n     greater understanding and tolerance of those countries.\n       (11) Congress has declared that the Peace Corps should be \n     expanded to sponsor a minimum of 10,000 Peace Corps \n     volunteers.\n       (12) President George W. Bush has called for the doubling \n     of the number of Peace Corps volunteers in service in a \n     fiscal year to 15,000 volunteers in service by the end of \n     fiscal year 2007.\n       (13) Any expansion of the Peace Corps shall not jeopardize \n     the quality of the Peace Corps volunteer experience, and \n     therefore can only be accomplished by an appropriate increase \n     in field and headquarters support staff.\n       (14) It would be extremely useful for the Peace Corps to \n     establish an office of strategic planning to evaluate \n     existing programs and undertake long-term planning in order \n     to facilitate the orderly expansion of the Peace Corps from \n     its current size to the stated objective of 15,000 volunteers \n     in the field by the end of fiscal year 2007.\n       (15) The Peace Corps would benefit from the advice and \n     council of a streamlined bipartisan National Peace Corps \n     Advisory Council composed of distinguished returned Peace \n     Corps volunteers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to ensure the safety and security of passenger air \ntransportation cargo and all-cargo air transportation; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to close a dangerous loophole in our aviation security \nnetwork. The attacks of September 11 forced us to take a hard look at \nthe way we screen passengers and luggage. Congress responded to the \nchallenge with a comprehensive system to perform these tasks through \nthe new Transportation Security Administration. We have required the \nTSA to check every passenger and every piece of baggage that is placed \nonboard a flight.\n  While I am confident that these measures have improved security, \nCongress has left the back door open to terrorists with plans to \ndisrupt passenger flights. We did not establish a similar regime to \nensure the safety of cargo operations. This issue must be addressed. \nTwenty-two percent of all air cargo in the U.S. is carried on passenger \nflights, but only a tiny percentage of this cargo is inspected. There \nis no point to carefully screening every piece of luggage if the cargo \nplaced aboard the same flight is not inspected.\n  My legislation would also tighten rules for so-called known shippers. \nUnder current procedures, any manufacturer, middleman, or receiver of \ngoods can be classified as a known shipper, which allows the shipment \nto proceed without inspection. This is not sufficient to protect the \npublic. We must be sure that companies claiming known shipper status \nare whom they claim to be and we must improve handling protocols to \nensure that terrorists cannot tamper with shipments while they are in \ntransit. My bill would accomplish these goals.\n  The Air Cargo Security Act would create a comprehensive security \nprocess for shipment of cargo, particularly for shipments traveling on \npassenger flights. It would require that all cargo onboard passenger \nflights, including foreign-based flights heading for the U.S., be \nthoroughly inspected. The bill would also direct TSA to establish a \n``chain of custody'' for air cargo that ensures that merchandise is \nnever out of the control of a known shipper. Under these restrictions, \ncargo could be placed aboard aircraft with confidence that no tampering \nhad occurred in transit.\n  The legislation would direct TSA to formulate a comprehensive system \nfor certifying known shippers and assigning each one a unique encrypted \nidentifier that must be produced to the air carrier before loading the \ncargo and cannot be counterfeited. All shippers, including haulers and \nmiddlemen, must be certified under the new system. If cargo has been \nhandled in any way by an uncertified company, then it will not fly. The \nTSA would have to regularly inspect shipping facilities. To accomplish \nthese tasks, the bill would provide TSA with additional manpower and \nequipment as needed.\n  I know that air cargo security presents a challenge nearly as large \nas passenger security. Forcing shippers and carriers to submit to \ninspection of all cargo would allow only 4 percent of the current \nvolume to be processed. I want to ensure that these inspections do not \nharm airline operations.\n  However, if we fail to enact these reforms, we will leave aviation \nsecurity only half-finished. I fear that we will lose our aviation \nsystem if we suffer another successful attack on a passenger flight. I \ncall upon my colleagues to take these concrete, measurable steps to \nensuring the safety of air passengers and those on the ground.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5905-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5905-S5912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED--JUNE 20, 2002\n\n  SA 3924.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the American Eagle Silver Bullion coin leads the global \n     market, and is the largest and most popular silver coin \n     program in the United States;\n       (2) established in 1986, the American Eagle Silver Bullion \n     Program is the most successful silver bullion program in the \n     world;\n       (3) from fiscal year 1995 through fiscal year 2001, the \n     American Eagle Silver Bullion Program generated--\n       (A) revenues of $264,100,000; and\n       (B) sufficient profits to significantly reduce the national \n     debt;\n       (4) with the depletion of silver reserves in the Defense \n     Logistic Agency's Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpile, \n     it is necessary for the Department of the Treasury to acquire \n     silver from other sources in order to preserve the American \n     Eagle Silver Bullion Program;\n       (5) with the ability to obtain silver from other sources, \n     the United States Mint can continue the highly successful \n     American Eagle Silver Bullion Program, exercising sound \n     business judgment and market acquisition practices in its \n     approach to the silver market, resulting in continuing \n     profitability of the program;\n       (6) in 2001, silver was commercially produced in 12 States, \n     including, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, \n     Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, South Dakota, Utah, \n     and Washington;\n       (7) Nevada is the largest silver producing State in the \n     Nation, producing--\n       (A) 17,500,000 ounces of silver in 2001; and\n       (B) 34 percent of United States silver production in 2000;\n       (8) the mining industry in Idaho is vital to the economy of \n     the State, and the Silver Valley in northern Idaho leads the \n     world in recorded silver production, with over 1,100,000,000 \n     ounces of silver produced between 1884 and 2001;\n       (9) the largest, active silver producing mine in the Nation \n     is the McCoy/Cove Mine in Nevada, which produced more than \n     107,000,000 ounces of silver between 1989 and 2001;\n       (10) the mining industry in Idaho--\n       (A) employs more than 3,000 people;\n       (B) contributes more than $900,000,000 to the Idaho \n     economy; and\n       (C) produces $70,000,000 worth of silver per year;\n       (11) the silver mines of the Comstock lode, the premier \n     silver producing deposit in Nevada, brought people and wealth \n     to the region, paving the way for statehood in 1864, and \n     giving Nevada its nickname as ``the Silver State'';\n       (12) mines in the Silver Valley--\n       (A) represent an important part of the mining history of \n     Idaho and the United States; and\n       (B) have served in the past as key components of the United \n     States war effort; and\n       (13) silver has been mined in Nevada throughout its \n     history, with every significant metal mining camp in Nevada \n     producing some silver.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURCHASE OF SILVER BY THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\n\n       (a) Purchase of Silver.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 5116(b)(2) of title 31, United \n     States Code, is amended by inserting after the second \n     sentence the following: ``At such time as the silver \n     stockpile is depleted, the Secretary shall obtain silver as \n     described in paragraph (1) to mint coins authorized under \n     section 5112(e). If it is not economically feasible to obtain \n     such silver, the Secretary may obtain silver for coins \n     authorized under section 5112(e) from other available \n     sources. The Secretary shall not pay more than the average \n     world price for silver under any circumstances. As used in \n     this paragraph, the term `average world price' means the \n     price determined by a widely recognized commodity exchange at \n     the time the silver is obtained by the Secretary.''.\n       (2) Rulemaking authority.--The Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall issue regulations to implement the amendments made by \n     paragraph (1).\n       (b) Study Required.--\n       (1) Study.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall conduct a \n     study of the impact on the United States silver market of the \n     American Eagle Silver Bullion Program, established under \n     section 5112(e) of title 31, United States Code.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     submit a report of the study conducted under paragraph (1) to \n     the chairman and ranking minority member of--\n       (A) the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of \n     the Senate; and\n       (B) the Committee on Financial Services of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (c) Annual Report.--\n       (1) In general.--The Director of the United States Mint \n     shall prepare and submit to Congress an annual report on the \n     purchases of silver made pursuant to this Act and the \n     amendments made by this Act.\n       (2) Concurrent submission.--The report required by \n     paragraph (1) may be incorporated into the annual report of \n     the Director of the United States Mint on the operations of \n     the mint and assay offices, referred to in section 1329 of \n     title 44, United States Code.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/21/senate-section/article/S5916-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 24, 2002\n\n  Mr. REID.
