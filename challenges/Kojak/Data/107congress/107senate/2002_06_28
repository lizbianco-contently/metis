Madam President, our form of government rests on two \npillars. One is democracy. The other is free enterprise. We are the \nstrongest, most successful nation in the world because we have \nmaintained the strength of both of those pillars.\n  We are the most durable democracy in the world because our system is \nconstantly refreshed by new leaders and new ideas. If leaders fail, \nthey can be voted out of office. If ideas fail, they can be either \ndiscarded or improved.\n  The strength of the system rests on the fact that--while not \nperfect--our Government is open and accountable.\n\n[[Page S6298]]\n\n  We have the strongest economy in the world, because our commitment to \nfree enterprise is strengthened by a system of open markets. Those \nmarkets--fed by free-flowing, reliable financial information--channel \ninvestment into new ideas and new enterprises. Working at its best, our \nfree enterprise system has generated durable economic growth, wealth, \nand opportunity that are the envy of the world.\n  The corruption of one of these pillars threatens the other. The \nweakening of either threatens our Nation.\n  This week's news from MCI WorldCom was the latest in a series of \ndisclosures that have shaken confidence in American business.\n  Recently, we have seen Enron collapse under the weight of inflated \nearnings and hidden debt. We have seen Halliburton face charges of \nimproperly recording revenue. We've seen Tyco accused of falsifying \nmerger information, and its CEO indicted. Arthur Andersen has been \nconvicted of obstructing justice.\n  The list goes on: CMS Energy, Computer Associates, Dynegy, Global \nCrossing, ImClone, Kmart, Lucent, MicroStrategy, Network Associates, \nPNC Financial Services, Qwest, Reliant Resources, and Xerox are all \nfacing serious questions about their business practices.\n  This string of disclosures threatens our economy to its core. They \nundermine investor confidence, scare off foreign investment, and slow \nan already shaky recovery.\n  And the impact is much more than some economic abstraction. Thousands \nof honest, hardworking people have lost their jobs. Millions more have \nseen their savings, their nest eggs, and their retirements gutted.\n  When corporate fraud leads to corporate failure, people get hurt.\n  I am not arguing that the corruption we have seen is systemic. \nAmerica has some of the world's most innovative executives, people of \ntremendous energy, skill, and integrity.\n  They are the vast majority of corporate executives, and they should \nbe the most outraged about the recent news. In my own discussions with \ncorporate leaders, that is actually the case. They are the most \noutraged. They resent the notion that the corruption is systemic, that \nthe deception is pervasive, and that ``everyone is doing it.''\n  I know--and most Americans know--that everyone is not doing it.\n  But the growing list of corporations under question makes clear that \nwe aren't just talking about one or two isolated cases, or rogue \nexecutives.\n  The problem, instead, is a ``climate''--a deregulatory, permissive \natmosphere that has relied too much on corporate America to police \nitself. It is as if the line between right and wrong, legal and \nillegal, acceptable and unacceptable was so little enforced that it \nbecame blurred. Bringing it back into focus--as Enron's collapse did--\nrevealed more than a few businesses standing on the wrong side.\n  The evidence rolling in is now unambiguous. Self-policing is no \nreplacement for a vigilant cop on the beat. It is time to reform and \nstrengthen the system.\n  Unfortunately, the desire for reform is not to be found in the \napproaches taken by the White House, the House, and the SEC.\n  This game of corporate dominoes we are watching is a wake up call. It \nis time to abandon this laissez-faire attitude and take action.\n  For starters, we need to made sure that the laws currently on the \nbooks are enforced. The SEC and Justice Department need to do more to \naggressively and consistently investigate and prosecute cases of \ncorporate fraud.\n  But enforcement alone isn't enough. We are now seeing cases where the \nlaw itself doesn't stand in the way of these egregious actions.\n  It is time for us to reform our system of accounting and do more to \nprotect investors.\n  That is exactly what the Sarbanes bill does. And that is why it will \nbe our first order of business when we return from recess. The Sarbanes \nbill makes six key improvements over our current system.\n  First, it creates an independent audit oversight board with the \nauthority to set standards, conduct investigations, and impose \npunishment if those standards aren't met.\n  Second, it restricts the nonaudit services that an accounting firm \ncan provide to public companies it audits. In other words, it keeps \nauditors out of the business of being a company's consultant or tax \nadvisors in addition to being its auditor--the roles that can lead to \nconflicts of interest.\n  Third, it holds CEOs and CFOs responsible for the accuracy of \noperating and financial reports. If it turns out that an earnings \nreport is deliberately misstated, those executives would forfeit \nprofits and bonuses earned after that information was released.\n  Fourth, if corporate insiders sell stock, those sales must be \nreported to the SEC within 2 days.\n  Fifth, it would make sure that investment banking firms that also \nprovide investment analysis don't mix those two functions. It also \nprotects analysts from retaliation if they make unfavorable stock \nrecommendations.\n  Sixth and finally, this bill includes expanded resources for the SEC. \nThis will help them become more thorough investigators and enforcers. I \nhave called the SEC a toothless tiger. This bill gives the agency some \nteeth.\n  In a message to Congress calling for the creation of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, President Roosevelt said he sought to ``give \nimpetus to honest dealing in securities and thereby bring back public \nconfidence.''\n  It is time for us to again, ``give impetus to honest dealing, and \nbring back public confidence.''\n  That is what this bill does. It strengthens both our democracy and \nour system of free enterprise.\n  Senator Sarbanes has done a masterful job in moving it through \ncommittee with broad bipartisan support.\n  For the sake of America's economy, America's workers, and the two \npillars on which our nation's greatness rests, I look forward to \ndebating it when we return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/28/senate-section/article/S6298-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6298-S6299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PROGRESS IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, from time to time I have come to the \nfloor to discuss our progress since we became the majority as Democrats \nin the Senate. I wanted to talk briefly about the accomplishments \nduring this work period and the list of items we have attempted to \naddress over the course of the now virtually 1 year that we have been \nin the majority. We took over officially during the month of July of \nlast year. Technically, we are not quite there. But for all intents and \npurposes, we have now completed 1 year as a majority in the Senate.\n  We began June with work on the supplemental appropriations bill, a \nkey piece of legislation. That legislation passed in the Senate a \ncouple of weeks ago.\n  We then moved on to terrorism insurance. We passed that bill out of \nthe Senate with an overwhelming vote.\n  We passed legislation which expedites the extradition of terrorist \nsuspects. The antiterrorism legislation passed about 10 days ago.\n  We increased the debt limit on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis.\n  We passed the Defense authorization bill, thanks to the extraordinary \nleadership of our colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin.\n  I might add that all of these issues--the supplemental \nappropriations, the terrorism insurance bill, the antiterrorism bill, \nthe debt limit, and the Defense authorization bill--passed with \noverwhelming bipartisan majorities.\n  I am pleased to be able to announce that because I feel quite \nconfident that is what the American people are expecting--that we \nattempt to work together, and that these priorities which are certainly \ntheir priorities as well be addressed in the way that allows us to \nenact them into law sometime very shortly.\n  I will say, having done as much as we can on a bipartisan basis, that \nI was disappointed by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwhen they objected to the passage of the hate crimes legislation. We \nfailed to achieve the 60 votes necessary to obtain cloture on hate \ncrimes.\n  For the life of me, I am troubled by that. I would think that would \nbe a 100-to-0 vote dealing with hate crimes in this country. It is \nsomething that is pernicious, and it is something that we must address \nin a meaningful legislative way.\n  We will continue to make the effort to assure that 1 day we will pass \nmeaningful hate crimes legislation.\n\n[[Page S6299]]\n\n  I also say there was another matter that was not bipartisan. That \ninvolved the Republicans' attempt to permanently repeal the estate tax.\n  I am very proud of the fact that we did not do that. I think that is \na good fiscal policy. It is good tax policy, and I am confident that \nany effort to repeal the estate tax permanently would fail in the \nfuture.\n  Let me hasten to add that the Democrats certainly support reform of \nthe estate tax. We supported an increase in the overall exemption to $7 \nmillion, and we are very appreciative of the widespread effort within \nour caucus and hopefully within the Congress itself to continue to work \nto reform the estate tax over a period of time. But blocking the \npermanent repeal of the estate tax saves the Treasury $60 billion a \nyear when it is fully implemented, $600 billion over the course of a \n10-year period of time. So we look upon this actually as an \naccomplishment, as we have with all of the other accomplishments during \nthe month of June.\n\n  But I might say, as we look at accomplishments, the list has become \nquite significant over the course of the last 12 months.\n  Right after the Democrats took the majority, we passed a Patients' \nBill of Rights. After the tragedy of September 11, we passed an \nantiterrorism use of force resolution and an immediate $40 billion \nresponse to the terrorist attacks, the Defense and homeland security \nappropriations bill, and the USA Patriot Act to deal with the \nextraordinary challenges we have with regard to law enforcement.\n  We passed increased airport, border, and port security. We passed \nterrorism insurance. We passed additional support for the airline \nindustry, which was really struggling after the tragedy of September \n11. We passed economic stimulus and unemployment insurance legislation. \nWe passed the campaign finance reform bill. We passed an election \nreform bill.\n  We passed 57 judicial confirmations. That is more than any recent \nCongress has passed in the same period of time, either Republican or \nDemocrat, even in those cases when the Senate was of the same party as \nthe President at that particular time.\n  We passed clean water and brownfields revitalization legislation. We \npassed a sweeping comprehensive education reform bill. We passed an \nenergy bill. We passed a farm bill. And as I just noted, we have passed \nthe Defense authorization bill.\n  I would say, as we look at this list of accomplishments, it would be \nhard for anyone to argue we have not accomplished a good deal in our \nfirst 12 months as members of the majority.\n  I look with great satisfaction, with great pride, and am very \ngrateful to all of my colleagues for the extraordinary job they have \ndone in working through the committees--and in most cases all of this \nlegislation has come through committees--to address the needs of \nAmerica in public policy and the tremendous challenges we face as a \nnation.\n  We will continue to add to this growing list of accomplishments over \nthe course of the next several months as we complete our work in the \n107th Congress. Certainly, the 107th Congress has been historic for so \nmany reasons, but I would say that when all is said and done, at the \nend of the session we will be able to look with great satisfaction, \nwith great pride, and, I might say, with a certain degree of confidence \nthat we have done what the American people have expected of us.\n  Passing this legislation is a recognition of what Democrats in the \nmajority can do in the broad array of issues with which we have done \nit.\n  So I thank my colleagues. I thank all of those who are responsible \nfor the work on these bills, especially our legislative leadership, the \nchairs of each committee where these bills have been produced, for the \nwork within the committee, and certainly the management they have \ndemonstrated on the Senate floor as these bills have been passed here \non the floor and sent either to the House or to the President.\n  I see my colleague from Michigan on the floor. I will yield the floor \nat this time. But I again appreciate the work done by our caucus, and, \nI might say, in concert, on many occasions, with our Republican \ncolleagues, to achieve the long list of accomplishments we have listed \nhere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before the majority leader leaves the \nChamber, let me say he is always giving credit to others for the \naccomplishments of this body--which have been many--and what he, in his \ntraditional modesty, of course, does not make any reference to is his \nown leadership and the role of that leadership in these \naccomplishments. But there is not a Member of this body on either side \nof the aisle who does not recognize the extraordinary leadership of \nSenator Daschle. And that list is a tribute to his leadership. It \nobviously involves a lot of other people, as he pointed out. \nNonetheless, it is his leadership that has led the way to a successful \nand long list of achievements so far in this Congress.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am grateful \nfor his kind words. We have always had a tremendous team effort within \nour caucus and within the legislative leadership of the Senate but I \nrecognize that the workhorses are the chairs. And I am speaking to one \nas we stand here this morning.\n  I thank him for his kind words. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/28/senate-section/article/S6299-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6299-S6300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE SHOOTING DEATHS OF DETROIT-AREA CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, children are being killed in our cities in \nrecord numbers. This year, in Los Angeles, 25 have been killed. The \nrates are the same in Houston, New York, Chicago, and in every other \ncity where illegal drugs are plentiful and good jobs are scarce, where \naccess to a better life is hard but access to a gun is easy.\n  Parents put their children to sleep in bathtubs where they might be \nsafer from driveby shootings. Children find guns in homes and on \nplaygrounds, with tragic results. Drug dealers go gunning for each \nother and don't care who gets killed in the crossfire.\n  So far this year, 22 children have been wounded by gunfire in my \nhometown of Detroit, in the metropolitan area. Ten children have been \nshot and killed. Statistics alone cannot convey the extent of this \nongoing tragedy. But here, briefly, are some of the sorrowful and grim \nstories of these children, their families, and their pain.\n  On February 25, Ajanee Pollard, 7 years old, was shot and killed, \nallegedly by a man who was upset that he had just purchased--with two \ncounterfeit $20 bills--a defective radio from a friend of Ajanee's \nuncle. Ajanee, her uncle, her mother, and three siblings were getting \nready to go shopping when one of the three men charged with the murder \nallegedly fired shots from an M1 rifle into the car Ajanee's mother was \ndriving.\n  Ajanee was a second grade student at Thomas Houghten Elementary \nSchool in northwest Detroit. Ajanee had been named Student of the \nMonth, was a midfielder in the local youth soccer league, and enjoyed \ngoing to Bible school at Genesis Evaneglical Lutheran Church.\n  Ajanee's 6-year-old brother Jason had to have his pancreas and part \nof his intestines removed from the wounds he suffered as a result of \nthe shooting. Both of Ajanee's sisters suffered gunshot wounds to the \nlegs, and her mother was treated for injuries as well.\n  On March 23, Destinee Thomas, 3 years old, was shot and killed in her \nhome while watching Mickey Mouse cartoons. A man armed with an AK-47 \nriddled the house with bullets.\n  Two men have been arrested and charged with the murder. According to \npolice and press reports, they had been involved in a ``turf battle'' \nwith two drug dealers from a rival street gang.\n  On March 28, Alesia Robinson, 16 years old and a junior at Kettering \nHigh School, sat on the front porch of her home on Detroit's east side \nwhile her boyfriend played with a gun. According to police, Alesia--who \nwanted to become a pediatrician--asked her boyfriend to put the gun \naway. Instead, he pointed it at her face and pulled the trigger.\n  On April 3, Christopher James, 11 years old, was killed by a single \ngunshot wound to the head. His 12-year-old half-brother has been \ncharged in juvenile court with manslaughter. According to family \nmembers, the two were playing with a .22 caliber revolver they had \nfound on a playground and that the shooting was an accident.\n\n[[Page S6300]]\n\n  On April 10, Brianna Caddell, 8 years old, was shot and killed while \nshe was sleeping in her bed. Brianna, her mother Pamela Martin, and her \ngrandmother Dorothy Caddell were fixtures at Truth Evangelical Lutheran \nChurch.\n  Antoine Foote also involved in drug turf wars, was charged with her \nmurder. According to police, he sprayed more than two dozen rounds at \nthe house with an AK-47.\n  Brianna was a third grader at the John C. Marshall Elementary School. \nOne of Brianna's classmates, Oshinique Mapp, wants to become a \npolicewoman or doctor or teacher so she can ``change the bad people.'' \nAnother classmate, Jeremiah Russell, wants to go to college so he can \nget away from the drug dealers in his neighborhood.\n  On April 19, Irisha Keener, 3 years old, was shot in the head by her \nmother, as the two lay in bed. Her mother then committed suicide.\n  On April 30, Cherrel Thomas, 15 years old, was shot and killed while \nriding in the back seat of a Chrysler Concorde. Cherrel, by the way, \nwas a freshman at McKenzie High School where she played trombone and \nbaritone tuba in the school marching band and jazz ensemble. Terrill \nJohnson and Jesse Freeman were charged with that murder.\n  On May 26, Tiffany Taylor, 15 years old, was fatally shot in the head \nwhile riding in a car in Mt. Clemens with friends coming home from a \nroller skating party at the Great Skate Rink in Roseville. Tiffany was \na freshman at Roseville Junior High School, where she was on the honor \nroll and led afterschool programs. Police believe that someone in an \nabandoned house frequently used by drug dealers and addicts fired five \nrounds from a handgun at Tiffany as she rode by--for no apparent \nreason.\n  On June 2, DeAntoine Trammell, 10 years old, was shot and killed in \nhis grandmother's apartment on Detroit's east side. According to \neyewitnesses, the person who killed him came to the house drunk and \ndistraught, threatened to commit suicide, then fired two shots into the \nkitchen wall instead. The bullets pierced the wall and went into an \nadjacent bedroom. Moments later, Shawn Trammell, DeAntoine's 14-year-\nold brother, carried his bloody body into the kitchen. The boys' mother \ncollapsed in shock. Shawn shouted out, ``Come on, Mama, come on. He's \nbreathing!'' They rushed DeAntoine to a clinic but were turned away \nbecause it is not a trauma center. DeAntoine died a day later at St. \nJohn Hospital.\n\n  DeAntoine was a fifth-grader at Bow Elementary School. His basketball \nteam was scheduled to receive a trophy the day after he died. He loved \nsports, video games, cartoons, and pizza, and often helped out in the \nschool cafeteria.\n  The week before DeAntoine was killed, he had been paired with Keefe \nBrooks, 48, a Bloomfield Hills lawyer, as part of the V.I.P Mentors \nprogram. According to the Detroit Free Press, Brooks wanted to show \nDeAntoine the possibilities life held for him. ``I had hoped to expose \nhim to successful people in the city, to help him build positive images \nand role models,'' Brooks said. ``I cannot bear the thought of my match \nhaving been taken from our world before I even got to know him. I \ncannot bear the thought of more children being slaughtered in our \ncity.''\n  Gun violence is still an epidemic in our cities. A teenager today is \nmore likely to die of a gunshot wound than of all natural causes of \ndisease. Yet we seem incapable of requiring background checks at gun \nshows even though the President said he would support doing so when he \ncampaigned in 2000. We seem incapable of requiring gun manufacturers to \ninclude trigger locks with their products even though we can regulate \njust about every other product under the sun. We need to pass these \ncommon-sense measures to help stanch the flow of guns and blood in our \ncities. But the Attorney General files briefs that undermine the \nenforcement of existing hand gun control laws instead.\n  As a Nation, we hope and pray that 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart will \nbe returned to her home in Salt Lake City safe and sound. But as a \nNation, we overlook the death of Ajanee, and Destinee, and Alesia, and \nChristopher, and Brianna, and Irisha, and Cherrel, and Tiffany, and \nDeAntoine. We haven't seen home videos of them on the evening news, but \nwe should. Their families and friends and communities feel the anguish \nalone.\n  Is it resignation? Worse yet, is it indifference? I hope neither.\n  Some in Detroit have responded to the epidemic. The Detroit Police \nDepartment and the Wayne County Prosecutor have launched Project Safe \nNeighborhoods so that criminals who use guns will be prosecuted in \nfederal courts. They have launched Project Destinee, which is an \nattempt to dismantle the two rival drug gangs whose members have been \nimplicated in that child's murder. The city has Child Death Review \nTeams to learn everything possible about the murders. People are \njoining SOSAD, Save Our Sons And Daughters, an organization Clementine \nBarfield started after her son Derick was killed in 1986, and the \nDetroit chapter of the Million Mom March, which Shikha Hamilton runs. \nOther groups involved include the Neighborhood Service Organization, \nYouth Initiatives Project, and Pioneers for Peace.\n  On Saturday, May 11, a massive community forum on violence was held \nat Second Ebenezer Baptist Church. On May 16, a group of 350 religious \nleaders met at the Northwest Activity Center to kick off their Positive \nYouth Development Initiative, a collaborative effort among government, \nreligious, and community leaders to help at-risk children. On June 11, \nDetroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick announced a six-point program to curb \nthe violence.\n  The funerals for the slain children have become impromptu community \nforums and rallies where people's determination and hope have \ncommingled with their grief and outrage.\n  The Poet Langston Hughes asked:\n\n     What happens to a dream deferred?\n     Does it dry up\n     Like a raisin in the sun?\n     Or fester like a sore--\n     And then run?\n     Does it stink like rotten meat?\n     Or crust and sugar over--\n     like a syrupy sweet?\n     Maybe it just sags\n     like a heavy load.\n     Or does it explode?\n\n  We have learned, sadly, that dreams deferred do explode--in gunfire. \nAnd we have seen, sadly, what happens when people don't even have the \ncapacity or the chance to dream.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/28/senate-section/article/S6300-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6300-S6302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING REFORM AND INVESTOR PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about important \nlegislation that we will be considering as soon as we return from the \nFourth of July recess.\n  In February of this year, the banking committee, of which the Chair \nis a member--and I appreciate the opportunity to serve with him--began \na series of 10 hearings touching at ways to strengthen our accounting \nsystem, protect investors, and make needed reforms at the SEC.\n  We all understand every day the growing need to be able to do that.\n  Our hearings didn't necessarily make the headlines with subpoenas \nsent to Ken Lay of Enron or Andrew Fastow, but the work that we did I \nbelieve was incredibly important, very thorough and very thoughtful.\n  Chairman Sarbanes, our chairman of the committee, is to be commended \nfor his impressive leadership and thoughtfulness and hard work on this \nsubject. At the end of the day, it is due to his commitment to doing \nthis carefully and due to the commitment of my colleagues on the \ncommittee who followed panel after panel of witnesses closely--from \nformer SEC Chairs, to Paul Volcker, to consumer groups, to well-\nrespected academics--that we now have before us a bill that will \nultimately make the biggest difference for investors and for the \nmarkets. We critically need this.\n\n  In March, in the midst of our marathon of hearings, I was very \npleased to join with Senator Dodd and Senator\n\n[[Page S6301]]\n\nCorzine in the introduction of the Investor Confidence in Public \nAccountability Act of 2002. Our bill was, I believe, a good beginning, \nan excellent way to begin to tackle the problems about which we were \nlearning. It was measured. It was strong.\n  I thank Chairman Sarbanes for including many of the provisions of our \nbill in the ultimate bill that has been reported to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  This is an excellent bill. We need only to look at the vote in the \ncommittee. It passed 17 to 4. It has strong bipartisan support. I hope \nthat support will continue on the floor of the Senate as we take up \nthis legislation in the coming weeks.\n  But it also has its detractors. There are some, of course, who do not \nlike the legislation. They make outlandish comments about Government \ntakeovers of the accounting industry. But that is not the bill for \nwhich I voted. It is not the bill for which Chairman Sarbanes voted. \nThat is not the bill for which Senator Enzi, the Senate's very own \naccountant, voted.\n  I would like to explain briefly some of the key components of this \nbill and why they make sense.\n  In this legislation, we create a strong new regulatory public \noversight board to establish and enforce accounting standards, quality \ncontrol, and ethics standards for public companies. The evidence \nindicates it is no longer enough for the industry to police itself. Few \npeople would contest that now.\n  That actually has been in debate over the last several years--two \ndifferent philosophies, one coming in with a new administration in the \nHouse of Representatives back in the mid-1990s. I remember debating \nthis with former Speaker Newt Gingrich and efforts to deregulate our \nindustries and our oversight, with the idea there would be self-\nregulation and oversight.\n  We know now that there needs to be public accountability, \ntransparency, openness. But there needs to be public accountability if \nthere is going do be integrity in these systems and if people are going \nto be willing to invest.\n  The oversight board we have placed in this legislation would be \nindependently funded by fees on public companies, therefore providing \nus insulation from the politics of the time. It would conduct regular \ninspections of accounting firms. The five-member board would have two \npeople with accounting backgrounds and a balanced approach to the \nboard.\n  We also establish new restrictions on the mixing of consulting \nservices and auditing services, which are very important. We have seen, \nunfortunately, specific examples of where the mixing of these two \nservices has created devastating results for people.\n  There has long been a concern that auditors may be tempted to \noverlook some questionable accounting practices in order not to lose \nlucrative consulting contracts from the companies they audit. This bill \nseeks to address that problem without simply banning all consulting \nservices. I think it is an important and reasonable and balanced \napproach.\n  Some services would be banned--bookkeeping, financial systems design, \ninvestment advice, human resources consulting--while others would have \nto be approved by the company's audit committee, such as tax services.\n  Of course, auditing companies would be able to offer any consulting \nservices to a company they were not presently auditing.\n\n  We also ensure auditor independence, which is so critical.\n  Another concern raised in our 10 hearings was that sometimes, over \ntime, auditors develop too cozy a relationship with the companies they \naudit. They become less critical and more accommodating. We addressed \nthis in the bill we reported from committee.\n  The bill before us simply says that accounting firms would be \nrequired to rotate the leading auditor and review partners of an audit \nafter 5 consecutive years of auditing a public company. It does not \nforce companies to find a new auditor, it just simply requires a \nrotation of the auditor. Some have feared that this would be too \nextreme, and the bill is sensitive to those concerns. But we believe it \nis important that we ensure auditor independence.\n  Our bill also sets up an internal corporate whistleblower mechanism. \nThis is one particular component of the bill about which I am \nespecially pleased. The bill includes an amendment I offered regarding \nestablishing corporate whistleblower mechanisms. I want to ensure that \nthe audit committees of public companies establish a way for \nconfidential, anonymous submissions of statements by employees \nregarding questionable accounting procedures.\n  With Enron and other scandals, people in the company knew there were \nproblems but had nowhere to turn. They were trapped in a corporate \nculture which squashed dissent. My amendment guarantees that there will \nbe a designated way to report problems to people who are in a position \nto do something about it, and it seeks to protect those employees who \nare simply acting in the best interests of their companies and their \ncompanies' investors.\n  I am glad to say that not only do I have the support of such people \nas my chairman but others, such as the Financial Services Roundtable, \nhave weighed in to support this very important amendment.\n  Guarantees of new levels of corporate responsibility are also an \nimportant part of this legislation. A key component of the bill I am \npleased to support is the new level of corporate responsibility \nrequired under this bill.\n  Under the bill that will be before us, audit committees must now be \ncompletely independent of management and will be responsible for the \nappointment, compensation, and oversight of the auditors. The bill also \nensures that during a blackout period, when companies are prohibited \nfrom selling stock, corporate leaders will also be barred from trading \nthe stock.\n  Perhaps most significantly of all, this Congress has an opportunity \nto tell CEOs and CFOs that they must certify the accuracy of financial \nreports and will have to forfeit bonuses up to 12 months after an \nearnings misstatement which was brought about by material noncompliance \nwith securities laws.\n  This is essential. We have had too many corporate leaders walk away \nfrom companies they have destroyed, with tens--and sometimes hundreds--\nof millions of dollars in their pocket while their employees find their \npensions drained, their jobs gone, and their dreams destroyed.\n  This is a strong, comprehensive bill. It does not include every \nreform that we need, but I would like to take a moment to highlight \nanother piece of legislation that I hope we will incorporate into the \nbill in its final passage. That is Senator Leahy's Corporate and \nCriminal Fraud Accountability Act.\n  I am proud, also, to be a cosponsor of this important legislation \nbecause I think it is a very sound bill and gets to some of the serious \nreforms that corporate America needs to face. Among other things, it \nmakes it a crime to destroy or conceal records with the intent to \nobstruct or influence a Federal investigation, such as an SEC \nexamination into accounting malfeasance.\n  It also amends our Federal bankruptcy law to make penalties relating \nto the violation of certain Federal and State securities laws \nnondischargeable.\n  I am very happy to say the bill provides legal protections again for \ncorporate whistleblowers, employees who report to regulators or \nCongress or their supervisors. I believe all of these provisions are \nimportant and will improve accountability for our country.\n  Prior to the committee vote on this bill, there was an emerging theme \nin the media that momentum was fading for strong reform. Powerful \nspecial interests, a few congressional opponents of reform were \nwinning, it seemed. But all of that has changed. Unfortunately, the \nscandals we have seen emerging have reminded us once again of the \nimportance to act. We have seen the stunning revelation regarding \nWorldCom and the billions of dollars of earnings misrepresented, the \n17,000 jobs that will be lost; 17,000 people who did nothing wrong--\nthey got up every day, they went to work, they did their jobs, they \nworked hard--now are suffering the consequences of a few people at the \ntop who thought it better to cook the books than to represent their \nemployees and their investors.\n  All of this, of course, came on the heels of Enron and Global \nCrossing and Tyco and Adelphia and Xerox. We need now only to look to \nthe ongoing weaknesses in our capital markets to see why the 17-to-4 \nvote in our committee should not have been so surprising.\n\n[[Page S6302]]\n\n  Investors are concerned. They are angry, and rightfully so. They \nwonder, can I trust the information companies are giving to me? How do \nwe know if our stocks are valued appropriately? Which company is next?\n  What we are doing in the Senate is nothing less than trying to ensure \nthe long-term viability of our capitalist system. We have a system that \nis the strongest and the best in the world, but something is broken. We \nneed to act. A corporate culture of earnings mismanagement and \ngamesmanship, unfortunately, has prevailed in some quarters. It is \ncasting a pall over too many other publicly traded companies. That is \nnot right, and it has to stop.\n  We know the majority of companies have integrity. They are doing the \nright thing. They are providing accurate information. Our corporate \nleaders who are acting responsibly are the most concerned about what is \nhappening. Too many honest, hard-working people at good, solid \ncompanies are indirectly suffering due to the malfeasance of a few \ngreedy people.\n  As we move ahead, I look forward to working with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, and with our Presiding Officer, to make sure \nwhat we did in committee can be done on the floor, and as quickly as \npossible.\n  Republicans such as the Senator from Wyoming, Mike Enzi, have shown \ntrue leadership in joining with the chairman and 15 others on the \ncommittee. This is the first step. We need a strong, good debate on \nthis bill and an overwhelming vote to send a message to investors, to \npension holders, to hard-working employees and companies everywhere, to \nthose corporate executives who are working hard and doing the right \nthing, that we are united and that we are serious about making sure \ntheir interests are protected. We will still have to reconcile this \nwith a much, unfortunately, more modest version passed in the House, \nand we will have to send it to the President.\n  I hope the President will join us in the strongest possible bill. It \nis incredibly important that we help bring back the integrity and \nconfidence so important in our markets. We are the greatest country in \nthe world. We have had the greatest capitalist system, but there are \nserious problems today and serious questions. We have the \nresponsibility to act in a way that will stabilize the economy, give \ninvestors confidence, let employees know that their pensions will be \nprotected and their hard work will be recognized for the future, and \nthat we will do the kinds of things that will allow us to continue the \nstrongest economy in the world.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the last several weeks, a number of \nrevelations have surfaced about how our intelligence agencies failed to \nanalyze and connect the pieces of information that they obtained. \nAccording to these news accounts, while the September 11 attacks were a \nshock to the American people, they may not have been a total surprise \nto the intelligence arms of our Government.\n  While there is no smoking gun to indicate that the FBI, the CIA, or \nanyone else or any other agency knew the totality of the September 11 \nplot before it was carried out, it now seems fairly clear that there \nwere known pieces of information, which, if thoroughly and properly \nanalyzed, could have put our Government on a higher state of alert for \na major terrorist attack upon the United States.\n  President Bush himself has acknowledged that our intelligence \nagencies were not connecting the dots that would have prepared our \nhomeland for a devastating act of terrorism. In partial response, the \nPresident has proposed the creation of a Department of Homeland \nSecurity with a new bureau that is intended to sort through the \nintelligence reports and hopefully connect the dots that are sometimes \noverlooked or unappreciated by the FBI and/or CIA. The proposal has \nsome merit. However, I am troubled with the manner in which this and \nother proposals are being crafted by the administration. Shrouded often \nin ambiguity and cloaked often in deep secrecy, this administration \ncontinues suddenly to sometimes unexpectedly drop its decisions upon \nthe public and Congress, and then expect obedient approval without \nquestion, without debate, and without opposition.\n  The Senate is not like that. We scrutinize, we debate, we ask \nquestions.\n  For months, the President has been sending signals that U.S. efforts \nto topple Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq will involve direct military \naction. In his State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, the \nPresident listed Iraq as a member of an ``axis of evil'' that seeks to \nattack the United States with acts of terrorism and weapons of mass \ndestruction. The President punctuated his bold words with a warning \nthat he ``will not wait on events, while dangers gather,'' and that \n``the United States of America will not permit the world's most \ndangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive \nweapons.''\n  That is saber rattling. This saber rattling prompted many questions \nfor the American public, for Members of Congress, and for our allies. \nThe question being: Will we invade Iraq? When will it happen? Will the \nUnited States go it alone? These are some of the questions.\n  On February 12, 2002, during a Budget Committee hearing, I questioned \nthe Secretary of State about the administration's designs on Iraq. \nUnfortunately, the answers I got were not sufficiently clear to put to \nrest my questions. Secretary of State Powell stated that the President \nhad ``made no decisions about war.''\n  Now, Mr. President, when I was in a two-room school in Algonquin, WV, \nin 1923, I could read through that answer. That should not require the \nmind of a genius to interpret.\n  Secretary Powell stated that the President had ``made no decisions \nabout war.'' So my question remained unanswered.\n  The Secretary, for whom I have a great deal of respect and with whom \nI have been associated for many years in several difficult decisions \nthat have arisen over those years, the Secretary of State also stated \nthat he--meaning the President--``has no plan on his desk right now to \nbegin a war with any nation.''\n  I go back to that two-room schoolhouse in Algonquin in southern West \nVirginia. I can figure that out. That is not answering the question. \nEverybody knew it. The Secretary of State knew it. He did not intend to \nanswer that question. While I have a great deal of respect for \nSecretary Powell, his answers provided more in the way of \nqualifications and confusion than in the pursuance of clarity.\n  Earlier this month, President Bush added another dimension to our \nnational security policy. On June 1, 2002, he addressed the cadets at \nWest Point on the progress of the war on terrorism. In his remarks, the \nPresident argued that deterrence and containment by themselves are not \nenough to fight terrorism. He said, ``In the world we have entered, the \nonly path to safety is the path of action.'' And he urged Americans \n``to be ready for preemptive action when necessary.''\n  In order to be ready for such action, the President said that the \nU.S. military ``must be ready to strike at a moment's notice in any \ndark corner of the world.''\n  According to a Washington Post article on June 10, the National \nSecurity Council is drafting a new defense doctrine to emphasize the \nuse of preemptive attacks against terrorists and rogue nations. \nAccording to this article, the Department of Defense is also now \nstudying how to launch ``no warning'' raids using a ``Joint Stealth \nTask\n\n[[Page S6303]]\n\nForce'' that includes aircraft, ground troops, and submarines.\n  Mr. President, these ``no warning'' raids will be a devastating \napplication of military force from the air, the ground, and the sea.\n  On Sunday, June 16, the Washington Post followed up on its reports \nabout this new national security strategy with an article entitled, \n``President Broadens Anti-Hussein Order.'' According to this article:\n\n       President Bush earlier this year signed an intelligence \n     order directing the CIA to undertake a comprehensive, covert \n     program to topple Saddam Hussein, including authority to use \n     lethal force to capture the Iraqi president, according to \n     informed sources.\n\n  The Post article continued:\n\n       One source said that the CIA covert action should be viewed \n     largely as preparatory to a military strike.\n\n  It then discussed the difficulties involved in carrying out an attack \non Iraq, including the large number of U.S. forces that would be \nrequired, the size of the Iraqi military, and the contentious \nrelationships between Iraqi opposition groups and the United States.\n  So what we have is a lot of dots--a dot here, a dot there--about what \nthe foreign policy of the United States is; a dot here, a dot there \nabout what military action our Government might pursue.\n  I am constrained to ask, Is this a way to run a constitutional \ngovernment? Is this a way to lead in a Republic? I hear so many of our \nSenators talk about this ``democracy.'' This is not a democracy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed at the conclusion of my \nremarks certain excerpts from SA No. 10 and SA No. 14 of the essays by \nJay and Madison and Hamilton, the Federalist essays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Senators for themselves can, once again, if they ever have \nread, read what Madison says about a democracy and what he says about a \nrepublic. In those two essays, Senators will find the distinction \nbetween a democracy and a republic. I believe this should be required \nreading on the part of all Senators and all other public officials, \nessay No. 10 and essay No. 14 by Madison. If Senators want to know the \ndifference between a democracy and a republic, turn to those two \nessays. Madison is quite clear in the difference.\n  Saddam Hussein has now had 11 years since the end of the gulf war to \nrebuild his war machine. New military action against Iraq would be \ncostly in terms of national treasure and blood. It is exactly because \nof these kinds of considerations that the Constitution vests in \nCongress the authority to declare war, and the responsibility to \nfinance military action.\n  We have heard Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle \nexpress their support for military operations against Iraq. The case \nhas yet to be argued, at least in any serious detail, or in open debate \nbefore the people. Bold talk of chasing down evildoers, stirring \npatriotic words, expressions of support for our men and women in \nuniform, these all have an important place in our national life, but \nthe American people deserve to hear why we need to be an aggressor, why \nwe need to risk the lives of their sons and daughters, why we need to \ntake preemptive action against Iraq.\n  Now, perhaps we should do so. I am not saying we should not, but I am \nsaying that Congress needs to know about this, and the American people \nneed to have more than just patriotic expressions with visual backup, \nassemblies and/or words.\n  If it is the President's intent to oust Saddam Hussein, he would be \nwell advised to obtain the support of the American people, and that \nwould involve seeking congressional authorization to use military \nforce.\n\n  I very well understand there are some military actions that we must \ntake on virtually a moment's notice in the interest of protecting this \nNation and its people, and the Commander in Chief has that inherent \nauthority under the Constitution. But there comes a time when the \nCommander in Chief still needs to level with the American people and \nCongress.\n  We saw what happened in the case of the war in Vietnam when the \nsupport of the people back home declined, when the support of the \nAmerican people began to go away from pursuing the Vietnam war. That \nsupport of the American people is necessary, and that support is \nexpressed in many cases by their elected Representatives in both Houses \nof Congress. Yet this administration persists in an unwise and \ndangerous effort to keep the public largely in the dark.\n  I have to repeat to the administration time and time again, the \nlegislative branch is not a subordinate body. It is not a subordinate \ndepartment. It is not subordinate to the executive branch. It is an \nequal branch of the Government. So I think the administration, in \nembracing secrecy so much and so deliberately, is acting unwisely. It \nmakes no sense. It is dangerous.\n  We have all seen the folly of military missions launched and \nmaintained without sufficient support of the people. Time and again \nhistory has demonstrated that in a democratic republic such as the \nUnited States, the sustained support of the people is essential for the \nsuccess of any long-term military mission.\n  I recall all too well the nightmare of Vietnam. I remember all too \nwell how Congress, without sufficient information and debate, approved \nmilitary action in that conflict. I recall all too well the antiwar \nprotests, the demonstrations, the campus riots, the tragic deaths at \nKent State, as well as the resignation of a President and a Vice \nPresident. I remember all too well the gruesome daily body counts in \nVietnam.\n  The United States was a deeply divided country, and I would say we \nbetter read the Constitution more than we read the polls, instead of \nvice versa--reading the polls first and last and the Constitution \nsomewhere in between.\n  I recall all too well the words of Senator Ernest Gruening of Alaska, \nwho was sworn in in the same class which I was sworn, 1958. He was one \nof the two Senators who voted against the Gulf of Tonkin resolution \nthat gave the President the authority to take military action in \nVietnam. Senator Gruening said this:\n\n       By long and established practice, the Executive conducts \n     the Nation's foreign policy. But the Constitution and \n     particularly, by constitutional mandate, the Senate has the \n     right and the duty in these premises to advise and consent. \n     Especially is this true when it is specifically called upon \n     by the Executive . . . for its participation in momentous \n     decisions of foreign policy.\n\n  I recall all too well the words of the other Senator who voted \nagainst the Tonkin Gulf resolution. In urging Congress to investigate \nand hold hearings before endorsing the President's plan, Senator Wayne \nMorse of Oregon expressed his concern that the Pentagon and the \nexecutive branch were perpetrating a ``snow job'' upon Congress and the \nAmerican people. If the Senate approved the Tonkin Gulf resolution, \nSenator Morse warned that ``Senators who vote for it will live to \nregret it.'' I was one of those who voted for it, and thanks to the \ngood Lord, I am still living. I am the last of that class of 1958. I \nregret that vote on the Tonkin Gulf resolution. I wish I had had the \nforesight to vote against it, as did Senators Morse and Gruening.\n\n  I am determined to do everything I can to prevent this country from \nbecoming involved in another Vietnam nightmare. This determination \nbegins with Congress being fully and sufficiently informed on the \nundertakings of our Government, especially if it involves a commitment \nto military action.\n  We have to depend upon the leadership of the Senate and both sides of \nthe aisle to insist that the Senate be informed. We also have to depend \non the leadership of the other body on both sides of the aisle to \ninsist on these things. We represent the American people. They send us \nhere. No President sends me here. No President can send me home. No \nPresident sends the distinguished Senator from Nebraska here. No \nPresident can send him home. He comes here by virtue of the people of \nhis State. They vote to send him, and he is here to represent them. He \nis not here to represent a President.\n  I realize, as our Founding Fathers realized, that in a government of \nseparated powers, one branch of government has to be able to act \nswiftly and unilaterally at times. Of course, that is the executive \nbranch. In this age of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, these \nabilities are needed more than ever. We all know that.\n  But I also realize, as did our Founding Fathers, the need for another\n\n[[Page S6304]]\n\nbranch, this branch, the legislative branch, to be able to put the \nbrakes on the executive branch. Those brakes include investigation, \nhearings, debate, votes, and the power of the purse. That is the \ngreatest raw power, may I say to the pages on both sides of the aisle; \nthe power of the purse is the greatest raw power in this Government--\nthe greatest. Cicero said, ``There is no fortress so strong that money \ncannot take it.'' Remember that. There is a new book out on Cicero; I \nmust get it. I have heard about it. Remember, I say to these bright \nyoung pages--some of them will be Senators one day--Cicero said, \n``There is no fortress so strong that money cannot take it.'' He was \nright.\n  So, I have heard a lot of talk about the need for this country to \nspeak with one voice on matters of war and peace. Debate on such \nimportant issues, say these people, might reveal differences in views \non how we ought to act. Our opponents would revel in our discord and \nthe President would lose credibility as he went toe to toe with our \nenemies. It is as though some think that Congress is an impediment to \nthe interests of this country.\n  I am sure the executive branch believes quite strongly from time to \ntime that Congress is an impediment. But we still have the \nConstitution. Thank God for the Constitution. I hold it in my hand, the \nConstitution of the United States. And also in this little booklet is \nthe Declaration of Independence. I will refer to that a little later. \nHere is that Constitution. Thank God for the Constitution. The \nlegislative branch can always turn to this Constitution. That anchor \nholds. There is an old hymn, ``The Anchor Holds.'' Well, this is the \nanchor, the Constitution which I hold in my hand. This is the anchor. \nIt holds.\n  I don't think debate is a weakness. Debate is our strength. Debate \nshows that we are a nation of laws, not of men. It shows that no man, \nno king--we do not have a king in this country. We have some people who \nare apparently monarchists. I think we have some in this Chamber who \nare sometimes monarchists when it comes to voting. They want to support \nthe executive branch. The executive branch will take care of itself. \nRemember that, may I say to the young pages.\n\n  There are three branches of Government: The judicial branch--it will \nalways uphold the prerogatives of the judicial branch, the executive \nbranch--it will always uphold the prerogatives of the executive branch, \nand grab for more; but it is here in the legislative branch that \nsometimes half, or a large portion, of the membership does not speak \nfor the prerogatives of the legislative branch under this Constitution; \nthey speak for the prerogatives of the executive branch.\n  ``We must support the Commander in Chief,'' they say. ``We must \nsupport the Commander in Chief.'' But, fellow Senators, this Commander \nin Chief is only here for 4 years. I have served with 11 Commanders in \nChief. We have Commanders in Chief, but we do not have to support the \nCommander in Chief. I don't care if he is a Democrat. I don't have to \nsupport the Commander in Chief. And I sometimes don't, even if he is a \nDemocrat.\n  Well, debate shows that we are a nation of laws and that no man--\nneither king nor Commander in Chief--has the right to send us to war by \nvirtue of his decision alone.\n  This Republic--not this democracy; forget it. Read Madison's essays, \nNo. 10 and No. 14--this Republic. There it is, we pledge allegiance to \nthe flag of the United States of America and to the Republic--not ``the \ndemocracy.'' The city-states in the time of Athens could have \ndemocracies. My little town of Sophia, with about 1,180 persons, could \nbe a democracy. It is small enough. All the people could come together \nand they could speak for all the people, but not in this great country \nof 280 million people. This is a republic. We ought to get in the habit \nof speaking of it as a republic.\n  We are a model to the world in this respect. By debating and voting \non issues of war and peace, Congress is able to express the will of the \nAmerican people and galvanize support for what could be a costly \nconflict. Debate and well-meaning disagreement on important issues do \nnot weaken the resolve of the American people. It is secret motives--\nhere is where problems begin--secret motives, clandestine plotting, and \nlack of confidence in the public that are the swift solvent of our \nnational morale.\n  If it is the path that this Nation is to take, President Bush ought \nto present his case to Congress before we must use military force to \noverthrow Saddam Hussein. That is why the Congress must ask important \nquestions. At least there are some leaders in both Houses, in both \nparties, who need to be taken into these secrets.\n  That is why the Congress must ask important questions, including if \nwe are successful in getting rid of the authoritarian who is now in \npower in Iraq, who will take his place? Have we covertly hand picked a \nleader for the future of Iraq? If so, who is he? Once such a military \noperation is undertaken, how will we know when the mission is \naccomplished?\n  Let there be no doubt, from what I now know and understand, I would \nsupport a change in regimes in Iraq. I suppose every Member of this \nbody would probably do that. There is no doubt in my mind about the \nserious and continuing danger that Iraq poses to the stability of the \nPersian Gulf region. Saddam Hussein has sought to build weapons of mass \ndestruction and long-range missiles. His military regularly attempts to \nshoot down our fighter planes that patrol the No Fly Zones over Iraq. \nHe has worked to heighten the conflict between Israel and the \nPalestinians. He has promoted the starvation of Iraqi children so that \nhe and his cabal can live in palaces. Saddam Hussein is a scourge on \nthe people of Iraq and a menace to peace. We know that. I know these \nthings. I wasn't exactly born yesterday. But it is the duty of Congress \nto ask questions. Members of Congress need not be intimidated by polls. \nWe are expected to ask questions.\n\n  It is the duty of Congress to ask questions so that we, the people's \nbranch of government, and as a result, the American people, will know \nwhat we may be getting ourselves into. It may be that the President \nalready has answers to these questions about Iraq, and that we might \nawake one morning to see those answers printed in the morning \nnewspaper. As we learned all too well in Korea, Vietnam, and Somalia, \nit is dangerous to present Congress and the American people with a fait \naccompli--that is a dangerous thing to do, no matter what the polls \nsay. Those polls can drop suddenly--present Congress and the American \npeople with a fait accompli of important matters on foreign affairs.\n  When the Administration is asking the American people to send their \nsons and daughters into harm's way, knowing that some will never \nreturn, it is essential that Congress know more, not less, about the \nAdministration's planned course of action. Congress must not be left to \nconnect dots!\n  All that Congress has been promised so far is that the President \nwould consult with Congress about military action against Iraq. This \npromise falls well short of the mark, particularly because of what the \nAdministration offers in the way of consultation. Like other members of \nthe Senate, I was taken by surprise by the President's sudden \nannouncement of his plan to create a massive new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. I favored such, but it was all hatched in the bowels of the \nWhite House. And according to the press, there were, I think, four \npersons who provided the genius behind the creation. In an unbelievable \ntwist of logic, the Administration maintains that it actually consulted \nwith Congress on the proposal. The administration knows better than \nthat. The President's chief of staff was quoted in The Washington Post \non June 9, 2002, as saying, ``We consulted with agencies and with \nCongress, but they might not have known that we were consulting.'' How \ndo you like that? I have been in Congress 50 years now. I have never \nseen anything like that, where the administration says we have \nconsulted with Congress but they might not have known we were \nconsulting.\n  This does not even deserve to qualify for George Orwell's definition \nof double speak. Such a claim is plain, unmitigated garbage.\n  In the aftermath of the carnage and turmoil of the Vietnam war, \nCongress approved the War Powers Resolution, that provided procedures \nfor Congress and the President to participate in decisions to send U.S. \nArmed Forces into\n\n[[Page S6305]]\n\nhostilities. Section 4(a)(1) required the President to report to \nCongress any introduction of U.S. forces into hostilities or imminent \nhostilities. Section 3 requires that the ``President in every possible \ninstance shall; consult with Congress before introducing'' U.S. Armed \nForces into hostilities or imminent hostilities.\n  In face of this Congressional resolution, this administration refuses \nto consult with anyone outside its own inner circle--well, let its own \ninner circle provide the money when the time comes--anyone outside its \nown inner circle about what appears to be its plan for imminent \nhostilities. This Administration convenes meetings of its trusted few \nin little underground rooms, while sending decoy envoys to meet with \nCongress and members of the press, and the public.\n  I have not seen such Executive arrogance and secrecy since the Nixon \nAdministration, and we all know what happened to that group.\n  I remember too well the Executive arrogance and extreme secrecy that \nlead to the Iran-Contra scandal. Selling weapons to a terrorist nation \nin exchange for hostages, and using that money to finance an illegal \nwar in Central America. What a great plan that was! I guess I can \nunderstand why the Reagan Administration did not want to tell Congress \nabout that foreign policy adventure.\n  I have no doubt that as I speak, there are some within this \nAdministration who are preparing to carry out some sort of attack \nagainst Iraq. Well, that's all right. We have to make plans before we \ndo things. I am not sure who they are, but I am connecting the dots, \nand I am concerned about the picture that is developing.\n  If the President needs to take decisive military action to prevent \nthe imminent loss of American lives, he will receive broad support. But \nif this country is moving methodically and deliberately toward some \nkind of showdown with Iraq, Congress is entitled to good-faith \nconsultations from the executive branch. We must consider and debate \nwhether we should use military force against Saddam Hussein. And, \nbarring the most exceptional of circumstances, Congress must vote to \nauthorize the President to use military force against Iraq prior to the \noutbreak of hostilities if, after appropriate debate and consideration, \nCongress comes to that conclusion.\n  As Senator Gruening pointed out, it is the role of the Senate to \nadvise and consent in foreign policy. And those words did not originate \nwith Senator Gruening. Read the Constitution.\n  As the War Powers Resolution points out, it is the role of Congress \nto be active participants in foreign affairs, and certainly such \nadventures as making war.\n  So, as we proceed, let us connect the dots.\n  As the Constitution demands, it is the role of Congress to declare \nwar. Yes, we have a Commander in Chief. But what Army and what Navy \ndoes he have to command if Congress does not provide the money?\n  When the President is ready to present his case to Congress, I am \nready to listen. But I think we all must be tired of trying to connect \ndots in the dark.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                         The Federalist No. 10\n\n\nJames Madison\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n       From this view of the subject, it may be concluded, that a \n     pure Democracy, by which I mean, a Society, consisting of a \n     small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the \n     Government in person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs \n     of faction. A common passion or interest will, in almost \n     every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a \n     communication and concert results from the form of Government \n     itself; and there is nothing to check the inducements to \n     sacrifice the weaker party, or an obnoxious individual. Hence \n     it is, that such Democracies have ever been spectacles of \n     turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible \n     with personal security, or the rights of property; and have \n     in general been as short in their lives, as they have been \n     violent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have \n     patronized this species of Government, have erroneously \n     supposed, that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in \n     their political rights, they would, at the same time, be \n     perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, \n     their opinions, and their passions.\n       A Republic, by which I mean a Government in which the \n     scheme of representation takes place, opens a different \n     prospect, and promises the cure for which we are seeking. Let \n     us examine the points in which it varies from pure Democracy, \n     and we shall comprehend both the nature of the cure, and the \n     efficacy which it must derive from the Union.\n       The two great points of difference between a Democracy and \n     a Republic are, first, the delegation of the Government, in \n     the latter, to a small number of citizens elected by the \n     rest: secondly, the greater number of citizens, and greater \n     sphere of country, over which the latter may be extended.\n       The effect of the first difference is, on the one hand to \n     refine and enlarge the public views, by passing them through \n     the medium of a chosen body of citizens, whose wisdom may \n     best discern the true interest of their country, and whose \n     patriotism and love of justice, will be least likely to \n     sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations. Under \n     such a regulation, it may well happen that the public voice \n     pronounced by the representatives of the people, will be more \n     consonant to the public good, than if pronounced by the \n     people themselves convened for the purpose. On the other \n     hand, the effect may be inverted. Men of factious tempers, of \n     local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may by intrigue, by \n     corruption or by other means, first obtain the suffrages, and \n     then betray the interests of the people. The question \n     resulting is, whether small or extensive Republics are most \n     favorable to the election of proper guardians of the public \n     weal: and it is clearly decided in favor of the latter by two \n     obvious considerations.\n       In the first place it is to be remarked that however small \n     the Republic may be, the Representatives must be raised to a \n     certain number, in order to guard against the cabals of a \n     few; and that however large it may be, they must be limited \n     to a certain number, in order to guard against the confusion \n     of a multitude. Hence the number of Representatives in the \n     two cases, not being in proportion to that of the \n     Constituents, and being proportionally greatest in the small \n     Republic, it follows, that if the proportion of fit \n     characters, be not less, in the large than in the small \n     Republic, the former will present a greater option, and \n     consequently a greater probability of a fit choice.\n       In the next place, as each Representative will be chosen by \n     a greater number of citizens in the large than in the small \n     Republic, it will be more difficult for unworthy candidates \n     to practise with success the vicious arts, by which elections \n     are too often carried; and the suffrages of the people being \n     more free, will be more likely to centre on men who possess \n     the most attractive merit, and the most diffusive and \n     established characters.\n       It must be confessed, that in this, as in most other cases, \n     there is a mean, on both sides of which inconveniences will \n     be found to lie. By enlarging too much the number of \n     electors, you render the representative too little acquainted \n     with all their local circumstances and lesser interests; as \n     by reducing it too much, you render him unduly attached to \n     these, and too little fit to comprehend and pursue great and \n     national objects. The Federal Constitution forms a happy \n     combination in this respect; the great and aggregate \n     interests being referred to the national, the local and \n     particular, to the state legislatures.\n       The other point of difference is, the greater number of \n     citizens and extent of territory which may be brought within \n     the compass of Republican than of Democratic Government; and \n     it is this circumstance principally which renders factious \n     combinations less to be dreaded in the former than in the \n     latter. The smaller the society, the fewer probably will be \n     the distinct parties and interests composing it; the fewer \n     the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will \n     a majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the \n     number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller \n     the compass within which they are placed, the more easily \n     will they concert and execute their plans of oppression. \n     Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of \n     parties and interests; you make it less probable that a \n     majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the \n     rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, \n     it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover \n     their own strength, and to act in unison with each other. \n     Besides other impediments, it may be remarked, that where \n     there is a consciousness of unjust or dishonorable purposes, \n     communication is always checked by distrust, in proportion to \n     the number whose concurrence is necessary.\n       Hence it clearly appears, that the same advantage, which a \n     Republic has over a Democracy, in controlling the effects of \n     faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small Republic--is \n     enjoyed by the Union over the States composing it.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n                         The Federalist No. 14\n\n\nJames Madison\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n       The error which limits Republican Government to a narrow \n     district, has been unfolded and refuted in preceding papers. \n     [See Essays 9 and 10.] I remark here only, that it seems to \n     owe its rise and prevalence, chiefly to the confounding of a \n     republic with a democracy: And applying to the former \n     reasonings drawn from the nature of the latter. The true \n     distinction between these forms was also adverted to on a \n     former occasions. [See\n\n[[Page S6306]]\n\n     Essay 10.] It is, that in a democracy, the people meet and \n     exercise the government in person; in a republic they \n     assemble and administer it by their representatives and \n     agents. A democracy consequently will be confined to a small \n     spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.\n       To this accidental source of the error may be added the \n     artifice of some celebrated authors, whose writings have had \n     a great share in forming the modern standard of political \n     opinions. Being subjects either of an absolute, or limited \n     monarchy, they have endeavored to heighten the advantages or \n     palliate the evils of those forms; by placing in comparison \n     with them, the vices and defects of the republican, and by \n     citing as specimens of the latter, the turbulent democracies \n     of ancient Greece, and modern Italy. Under the confusion of \n     names, it has been an easy task to transfer to a republic, \n     observations applicable to a democracy only, and among \n     others, the observation that it can never be established but \n     among a small number of people, living within a small compass \n     of territory.\n       Such a fallacy may have been the less perceived as most of \n     the governments of antiquity were of the democratic species; \n     and even in modern Europe, to which we owe the great \n     principle of representation, no example is seen of a \n     government wholly popular, and founded at the same time \n     wholly on that principle. If Europe has the merit of \n     discovering this great mechanical power in government, by the \n     simple agency of which, the will of the largest political \n     body may be concentred, and its force directed to any object, \n     which the public good requires; America can claim the merit \n     of making the discovery the basis of unmixed and extensive \n     republics. It is only to be lamented, that any of her \n     citizens should wish to deprive her of the additional merit \n     of displaying its full efficacy on the establishment of the \n     comprehensive system now under her consideration.\n       As the natural limit of a democracy is that distance from \n     the central point, which will just permit the most remote \n     citizens to assemble as often as their public functions \n     demand; and will include no greater number than can join in \n     those functions; so the natural limit of a republic is that \n     distance from the center, which will barely allow the \n     representatives of the people to meet as often as may be \n     necessary for the administration of public affairs.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/28/senate-section/article/S6306-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6306-S6309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we all know that on Wednesday, in a 2-to-1 \ndecision, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nheld that the United States Pledge of Allegiance was unconstitutional. \nThe court held that the pledge was unconstitutional because in 1954 the \nCongress had the audacity--imagine that--to include a reference to God \nin its provisions.\n  Some say these are just mechanical, ceremonial provisions. Get out of \nmy face. That may be what some people think, but the majority of people \nin this country I don't believe are thinking in terms of ceremonial \nlanguage.\n  I was a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives at that time. I \nam the only Member of Congress today in either body who can say that I \nwas a Member of the House of Representatives on June 7, 1954, when the \nwords ``under God'' were included in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  Now I see in the morning paper that the next thing these misguided \natheists are wanting to do is to challenge the words ``In God we \ntrust.''\n  I was a Member of the House of Representatives on that same date, \ncoincidentally, June 7, 1 year later, 1955, when the House voted to add \nthe words ``In God we trust'' to the Nation's coins and currency. Every \ntime you take out a dollar bill--that is a pretty popular bill in my \nlifetime, a dollar bill; here it is--on it we read the words ``In God \nwe trust.'' It is all there. It is on the coins.\n  I was a Member of the House of Representatives when Congress voted to \nmake that the motto, and here it is, inscribed, which is said in \nmarble, ``In God we trust,'' right here over this door to the Chamber.\n  Over to my left are those words, ``Novus Ordo Seclorum,'' a new order \nof the ages.\n  ``E Pluribus Unum,'' all in one, one in all.\n  Over here, ``Annuit coeptis,'' God has favored our undertakings.\n  Here are these inscriptions. Bring in your stone masons and take \nthese off the walls. That is what these pernicious atheists are saying. \nThey want everything to suit themselves.\n  God have mercy on them. But if they have their way, we will have to \nhave stonemasons come into this Chamber and chisel off these words.\n  They are not going to have their way. The people of these United \nStates are not going to stand for this. And the courts had better take \nnotice and kind of draw back a little bit. After all, if the American \npeople do not believe in it and if they do not support it, that court \ndecision is not going to be obeyed.\n  The courts, starting with the Supreme Court, need to take a new look \nat this first amendment. If anything will ever result in amending the \nfirst amendment, then continue to go down this road, I say to the \ncourts. They ought to draw back just a little bit distant from going \ndown the road they are presently on.\n  I am proud to inform my colleagues that I was in the House when Joint \nResolution 243, which was entitled ``A Joint Resolution to codify and \nemphasize existing rules and customs pertaining to the display and use \nof the flag of the United States of America'' was enacted. That \nresolution was approved by the House on June 7, 1954--almost half \ncentury ago.\n  The plaintiff in the case that was just decided is a self-described \natheist. His daughter attends elementary school in California. The \npublic schools there, as elsewhere, begin each school day with the \nPledge of Allegiance to the Flag. If this court's outlandish and ill-\nconceived decision is allowed to stand, it will mean that children in \npublic schools in at least nine states will no longer be allowed to \nrecite the pledge of allegiance by referring to America as ``one \nNation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.''\n  That is too much power.\n  Specifically, the court in this case has held that the words ``under \nGod'' are unconstitutional because they support the existence of God \nbut deny ``atheistic concepts.'' Unbelievably, the Court has held that \nthis runs counter to the intent of the First Amendment of the U.S. \nConstitution, because, according to this court, the Establishment \nClause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from endorsing \nany particular religion, including a belief in one God--which the court \ncalls ``monotheism''--at the expense of atheism.\n  Take a look at this Bible, which I hold in my hand. Here it is, the \nHoly Bible. It is the King James version--King James of England. Here \nis what it says in Psalm No. 127:\n\n       Except the Lord build the House, they labour in vain that \n     build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh \n     but in vain.\n\n  Those are the words written long before the U.S. Constitution was \nwritten--written by wise men in many instances, Solomon, Son of David--\nlong before the Constitution was written, long before the court system \nwas established in these United States. Those are the words:\n\n       Except the Lord build the House, they labour in vain that \n     build it.\n\n  Hear me, Judges!\n  In reading the court's decision, I was astonished by the tortured \nreasoning of the majority as opposed to the lucid opinion recorded by \nJudge Fernandez, the lone dissenter. In responding to the arguments of \nthe majority, Judge Fernandez did not see fit to hold that the phrase \n``under God'' violates the Constitution of the United States.\n  How silly, how lucidly silly.\n  If the schoolchildren of America were to be required to commemorate \nto memory, as they used to be required to commit many things to memory, \nthe Declaration of Independence, would that ninth circuit judge render \nsuch an absurd decision concerning the constitutionality of the \nDeclaration of Independence?\n  Let's just select three or four phrases from the Declaration of \nIndependence.\n  The Declaration refers to ``Nature's God.'' The Declaration also \nrefers to ``the Supreme Judge of the world,'' meaning God. The \nDeclaration refers to ``a firm reliance on the protection of divine \nProvidence.'' This is the Declaration of Independence. It was not \nwritten by Congress in 1954, as the words ``under God'' were inserted \ninto the pledge. This Constitution was not written then. This \nDeclaration of Independence was not written then. And who wrote it? In \nthe main, it was written by Thomas Jefferson, along with John Adams, \nBenjamin Franklin, Philip Livingston, and one other. But there are at \nleast four or five references to ``Providence,'' to ``the Divinity,'' \nto\n\n[[Page S6307]]\n\n``God,'' to ``the Supreme Judge of the world'' in the Declaration of \nIndependence.\n  Now, would the same judge render such a misguided, absurd decision \nconcerning the Declaration of Independence?\n  Let's see who signed that Declaration of Independence. John Hancock--\nthere are several signers. I will just select a few: John Hancock; \nGeorge Wythe; Richard Henry Lee; Thomas Jefferson; Benjamin Harrison, \nwho later would become President; Robert Morris, the financier of the \nAmerican Revolution; Benjamin Rush; Benjamin Franklin; George Clymer; \nJames Wilson of Pennsylvania; Samuel Adams; John Adams; Elbridge Gerry \nand Roger Sherman. What would they think? What would these signers of \nthe Declaration think?\n  What would the signers of the Constitution say if they could speak \ntoday? What would they say about this pernicious decision we have just \nread about?\n  What would Roger Sherman think? What would William Livingston think? \nI am wondering, if they could speak today, what would they think? What \nwould Benjamin Franklin say? What would Robert Morris think, George \nClymer? These are also signers of the Constitution. What would James \nWilson think? How about George Read? How about John Dickinson, what \nwould he say--John Dickinson of Delaware, who signed this Constitution?\n  What would George Washington think? He presided over the \nConstitutional Convention. What would he say? What would John Rutledge \nsay? What would Charles Cotesworth Pinckney say? What would Charles \nPinckney say? What would Pierce Butler say? If they could speak to \nthis--I will use a word that is pretty widely used--god-awful decision, \nwhat would they say?\n  Well, Judge Fernandez said we should recognize ``that the religious \nclauses in the Constitution were not designed to drive religious \nexpression out of public thought; they were simply written to avoid \ndiscrimination.''\n  Judge Fernandez acknowledged further, that, ``we can run through the \nlitany of tests and concepts which have floated to the surface from \ntime to time.'' But, he said, ``when all is said and done, the danger \nthat the words `under God' in our Pledge of Allegiance will tend to \nbring about a theocracy or suppress somebody's beliefs is so minuscule \nas to be de minimis.'' He concluded his dissent by finding that there \nis nothing unconstitutional about the Pledge of Allegiance, because any \ndanger presented to first amendment freedoms by the phrase `one nation \nunder God' is, in his words, ``picayune.''\n  Well, to that, I would say, ``Amen.''\n  Mr. President, over my many years in office, I have known other \ncritics, like the majority of this court, who have attacked the words \n``under God'' as they exist in the Pledge of Allegiance. They have \nimplied that the Founding Fathers were essentially ``areligious'' or \n``neutral'' about religion. Some of these critics even claim the \nFounding Fathers were antireligious, that they were bent on \nestablishing a completely secular state in which God has no place. \nThese individuals assert that America's fundamental origins are \nbasically devoid of religious meaning, and that this was the intent of \nthe Founding Fathers.\n  Well, nothing could be further from the truth.\n  If we read the Federalist essays, if we read other documents, we know \nthat the intent of the Framers was to keep the new government from \nendorsing or favoring one religion over another. It was never meant to \nprohibit any voluntary expression of religious faith. I believe that \nthis court's decision is wrongheaded, destructive, and completely \ncontrary to the intent of the Founders of this great Nation. Instead of \nensuring freedom of religion in a nation founded in part to guarantee \nthat basic liberty, a literal suffocation of that freedom has been the \nresult. The rights of those who do not believe in a Supreme being are \nbeing zealously guarded, to the denigration, I repeat, the denigration, \nof the rights of the millions of people in this country who do believe.\n  The American doctrine of separation of church and state forbids the \nestablishment of any particular religion by the state, but it does not \nforbid the influence of religious values in the life of our Nation. \nReligious faith has always been a basic tenet of American life. This is \nevident throughout the history of America.\n  The history of the first amendment in particular is one of the great \nlegacies of faith bequeathed by the Founding Fathers, but it is one \nthat is little understood and sometimes distorted--as it was in the \nrecent court decision. In 1791, Congress passed the first 10 amendments \nto the Constitution. We refer to these 10 amendments as the Bill of \nRights. The very first amendment recognized the importance of religion \nin American life, stating that, Congress shall make no law respecting \nan establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, \nwhich the second phrase is just as important and has equal weight with \nthe preceding clause. The purpose of this tenet was to allow religious \nfaith to flourish, not to suppress it, not to hobble it.\n  In fact, even earlier--before the passage of the First Amendment--\nCongress had clarified its attitude toward religion when, on August 7, \n1789, it officially reenacted the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which \nincluded an explicit endorsement of religion. Article III of the \nNorthwest Ordinance of 1787 stated, ``Religion, morality, and knowledge \nbeing necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, \nschools and the means of learning shall forever be encouraged.''\n  At that juncture, most schools were church enterprises. Congress \nrecognized this, and expected--and I want to emphasize this--expected \nthat the schools would teach religion and morality.\n  Against this backdrop, the First Amendment is especially \nenlightening. James Madison, the principal sponsor of the Bill of \nRights and later himself President, was a lifelong Episcopalian who had \nstudied theology at Princeton with apparent plans to enter the \nministry. However, on his return to Virginia after college, he changed \nhis mind and went into politics primarily because he was deeply \ndisturbed by the persecution of Baptists and other nonconformists in \nthe Old Dominion. He therefore entered politics to become an ardent \nadvocate of religious tolerance.\n  Madison declared that, ``the religion of every man must be left to \nthe conviction and conscience of every man.'' Thus, in consultation \nwith John Leland, the leading Baptist clergyman in Virginia, Madison \nhammered out the church/state principles that were eventually embodied \nin the first amendment.\n  As a result, the institutions of Church and State were officially \nseparated, but the exercise of religion and its influence on society \nwere encouraged--not discouraged.\n  One of the most perceptive observers of the early American scene was \nthe celebrated Alexis de Tocqueville. De Tocqueville, in summarizing \nthe condition of religion in the United States in the 1830s, wrote:\n\n       On my arrival in the United States the religious aspect of \n     the country was the first thing that struck my attention . . \n     . In France I had almost always seen the spirit of religion \n     and the spirit of freedom marching in opposite directions.\n\n  That is what this court would have us do in this country. But, \ncontinued de Tocqueville:\n\n       But in America, I found they were intimately united and \n     that they reigned in common over the same country . . . \n     Religion . . . must be regarded as the foremost of the \n     political institutions of the country--\n\n  Meaning this country--\n\n     for if it does not impart a taste for freedom--\n\n  We hear the word ``freedom'' kicked around everywhere today----\n\n     it facilitates the use of free institutions.\n\n  De Tocqueville grasped what millions of Americans have known, past \nand present. God has been and continues to be an intimate and profound \nparticipant in the ongoing history of these United States. Keep that in \nmind. God has been and continues to be an intimate and profound \nparticipant in the ongoing history of America.\n  Remember the Scriptures: ``Except the Lord build the house, they \nlabor in vain that build it.'' The American people believe that.\n  Through the decades, most Americans have come to discover the truth \nof de Tocqueville's conclusion when he asserted that, ``Unbelief is an \naccident.'' Hear that, ye atheists: ``Unbelief is an accident, and \nfaith is the only permanent state of mankind.''\n  In the context of this heritage, then, it is not surprising that the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S6308]]\n\nStates--a nation that evolved out of the American Revolution--should \nbe, at root, a religious nation, from the beginning, from the Mayflower \nCompact, which in at least four instances refers to God.\n  Indeed, most of the men who have been President of the United States \nhave been men of exceptional faith. Two Presidents other than James \nMadison John Adams and Benjamin Harrison had considered entering the \nministry. James Garfield was a lay preacher in the Disciples church. \nAnd Theodore Roosevelt, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, and James \nEarl Carter were all Sunday School teachers at various points during \ntheir lives.\n  Of all of the Presidents, Abraham Lincoln was among the most \ntheologically astute and Biblically influenced. Paradoxically, he never \nformally joined any particular church. Nonetheless, he said the Bible--\nthis is what Lincoln was talking about, the Holy Bible--was ``the \ngreatest gift God has given to man.'' Hear me, Judge Goodwin of the \nNinth Circuit. This is Lincoln speaking, not Robert C. Byrd. Lincoln \nsaid the Bible was ``the greatest gift God has given to man.'' And he \nwas an avid reader of the Bible. He kept a battered old family Bible \nwith him in the White House, and his speeches were laced with Biblical \nquotations. Reporters of his day stated that his delivery reflected the \ncadences and rhythms of the King James Version of the English Bible. \nThe first Bible was the Coverdale Bible, written in 1535, the same year \nThomas Moore was executed.\n  But Lincoln was not alone among the Presidents who bore public \nwitness to their personal faith. Every President, from George \nWashington through George W. Bush, has included some reference to God \nin his inaugural address. I have gone through all the inaugural \naddresses. I think there might have been one President who was pretty \nweak in his references to the Supreme Judge of the world. But in most \ncases they didn't have any hesitancy about referring to providence, to \nGod.\n  In his First Inaugural address, Washington declared, ``No people can \nbe bound to acknowledge and adore the Invisible Hand which conducts the \naffairs of men more than those of the United States. Every step by \nwhich they have advanced to the character of an independent nation \nseems to have been distinguished by some token of providential \nagency.'' George Washington also instituted another custom that has \nbeen followed by every President since, by proclaiming a national day \nof Thanksgiving in late November of 1789.\n  Jefferson, specifically included in his plans for the University of \nVirginia the proposal that ``proof of the being of God, the Creator, \nPreserver, and Supreme Being of the Universe, and Author of all \nmorality, and the laws and obligations these infer, will be the \nprovince of the Professor of ethics.''\n  However, nowhere, perhaps, did Jefferson's religious faith have a \ngreater influence than in the words of the Declaration of Independence. \nAt one point, Jefferson wrote, ``Religion is the alpha and omega of our \nmoral law.'' He also pledged that he had ``sworn upon the altar of God \neternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.'' \nIn the Declaration, which he wrote, Jefferson made it clear that \nreligion is not only the root of our moral law but of our political \nrights. The Declaration of Independence contains five synonyms for the \nword ``God,'' and maintains that freedom itself is a gift from God as \nan element of man's being.\n  As, hopefully, we all recall, the Declaration of Independence states, \nwith respect to God:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. . . .\n       We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of \n     America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the \n     Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our \n     intentions. . . .\n       And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm \n     reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually \n     pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred \n     Honor. . . .\n\n  These are various and sundry excerpts from the Declaration of \nIndependence.\n  Based on this foundation established by Jefferson and the other \nFounding Fathers, archaeologists in future millennia will have little \ndifficulty reading the evidence of the religious faith and traditions \nthat have been part and parcel of American history. Every nook and \ncranny of this Capitol--and I might add, of this Capital City--provides \nsuch evidence. In fact, wherever one may go in this great national \ncity, he or she is constantly reminded of the strong spiritual \nawareness of our forefathers who wrote the Constitution, who built the \nschools, who built the churches, who hewed the forests, who dredged the \nrivers and harbors, and who created this Republic.\n  Here in the Senate, for example, the services of an ordained \nclergyman have been employed since 1789. The Senate Chaplain is the \nembodiment of a corporate faith in God and the symbol of the eternal \njudgment that we Senators recognize exists over our legislative and \npersonal actions. Moreover, the institution of the Senate Chaplaincy is \nitself the result of a historical process that reveals much about the \nlong development of American values.\n  For example, the first prayers offered in Congress were uttered on \nSeptember 7, 1774. At the initial meeting of the First Continental \nCongress, Samuel Adams requested that the convention begin with prayer. \nAs the Revolutionary War continued, the Continental Congress issued \ncalls for periodic national days of prayer and fasting, asking the \npopulace ``to reverence the Providence of God, and look up to Him as \nthe Supreme Disposer of all events and the arbiter of the fate of \nnations.''\n  These religious expressions were not just pretense, they were not \njust ceremonial verbiage. Heavens no. Prayer and worship were held in \nhigh regard by the remarkable men who led the American Revolution, and \nthe Chaplaincy of today's Senate is derived directly from the guidance \nprovided by those great men. During the rocky sessions of the \nConstitutional Convention of 1787, the various representatives of the \nseveral States were locked in heated disagreement over petty \nprerogatives with little concern, apparently at that moment, for the \nnational well-being. The weather had been very hot--probably as humid \nas it gets here in Washington at times--and the delegates to the \nConvention were tired and they were edgy. The debates were stymied and \na melancholy cloud seemed to hang over the Convention.\n  Suddenly, old Dr. Franklin stood to his feet and faced the chair in \nwhich sat GEN George Washington. His famous double-spectacles were low \non his nose, and he broke the silence when he addressed George \nWashington. Franklin reminded the Convention how, at the beginning of \nthe war with England, the Continental Congress had prayed for Divine \nprotection in that very room. ``Our prayers, sir, were heard,'' he \ndeclared. ``They were graciously answered. . . .'' He then asked, ``And \nhave we now forgotten that powerful Friend? Or do we imagine that we no \nlonger need His assistance?''\n\n  He continued on saying:\n\n       I have lived, sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the \n     more convincing proofs I see of this truth--that God governs \n     in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the \n     ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can \n     rise without his aid?\n       We have been assured, sir, in the sacred writings, that \n     ``except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that \n     build it.''\n\n  He selected the same portion of Scripture that I picked today, didn't \nhe? This is Benjamin Franklin talking. He went on to say:\n\n       I firmly believe this: and I also believe that without His \n     concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no \n     better than the builders of Babel. . . .\n\n  Well, today, we follow the Senate tradition of morning prayer. The \nChaplain was among the first officers elected in the Senate upon \nadoption of the Constitution. In my volumes, ``The Senate 1789-1989,'' \nSenators will find a chapter on the Senate Chaplain. I hope they will \nread it again. To this very day, the first daily order of the business \nin the Senate is a prayer for Divine Guidance by the Chaplain.\n  This, of course, was not perceived by the Framers as an attack on the \nfirst amendment requiring separation between church and state, for the \nsimple reason that no single church has anything to do with it.\n  It is not simply prayer in the Senate that reaffirms the religious \nhistory of the American people. Let us speak\n\n[[Page S6309]]\n\nbriefly of some of the other reminders in Washington that reaffirm the \nproposition that our country is founded on religious principles.\n  On the Washington Monument, one may read three Biblical quotations on \nthe 24th landing. One was donated by the Sunday school children of the \nMethodist Church of Philadelphia who contributed a stone bearing an \ninscription from the Book of Proverbs which states:\n\n       Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is \n     old, he will not depart from it.\n\n  Another inscription on the Washington Monument, which was contributed \nby the Methodist Church of New York, is also taken from Proverbs and \nreads:\n\n       The memory of the just is blessed.\n\n  That comes from chapter 22 of Proverbs, verse 6.\n  And the third stone bears these words of Christ from the Book of \nLuke:\n\n       Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them \n     not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.\n\n  Near the Washington Monument, of course, is the Lincoln Memorial. \nThis massive shrine pays homage to the greatness of this simple and \nheroic man whose very life was offered on the altar of liberty. We know \nof his knowledge of the Bible and his gentleness, his power, his \ndetermination, and we know that determination of Lincoln came to us \nclearly through his features chiseled in granite by the sculptor.\n  We can almost hear Lincoln speak the words which are cut into the \nwall by his side. Mr. President, we need to get some stonemasons to go \ndown to the Lincoln Memorial. If this judge with his pernicious ruling \nand if the atheists are successful in having these words stricken from \nthis Chamber--``In God We Trust''--and from the Nation's currency, we \nwill have to have a lot of new dollar bills printed and a lot of new \ncoins. We have to strike those words ``In God We Trust'' now from the \nbills if these pernicious suits by atheists are upheld by some \nmisguided judges, like the one who rendered this decision. We had \nbetter hire some stonemasons. That might be a pretty good job, come to \nthink of it. Maybe I should just retire at the end of this term--I \nwould be about 89 then--and then I can perhaps get myself a job as a \nstonemason. I could go down here to the Lincoln Monument--I would not \ndo it--at least I could think in terms of being a stonemason and take \nthese words off that Lincoln Memorial.\n  Listen to what Lincoln says, according to the inscription on the \nLincoln Memorial. Can you just witness those stonemasons going down \nthere and chipping with chisel and hammer, chipping out these words? \nListen, these are words that are cut into the wall by the side of \nLincoln on the Lincoln Memorial:\n\n       That this Nation under God--\n\n  Praise God, hallelujah, there they are. That is Lincoln, that is what \nhe said.\n\n       That this Nation under God, shall have a new birth of \n     freedom. . . .\n\n  Hear that, judges of the Ninth Circuit. Hear that, Judge Goodwin of \nthe Ninth Circuit. I have a great judge in West Virginia named Goodwin. \nHe is a Federal judge. He is Judge Goodwin. But I daresay he would not \nhave rendered that kind of a foolish decision. Here are the words that \nare cut into the wall by the side of Lincoln:\n\n       That this Nation under God, shall have a new birth of \n     freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, \n     and for the people shall not perish from the earth.\n\n  In his second inaugural address, this great President--a Republican, \nby the way. See, I do not hold that against him--in his great second \ninaugural address, great President Lincoln made use of the words \n``God,'' ``Bible,'' ``prayer,'' ``providence,'' ``Almighty,'' and \n``divine attributes,'' and then his address continues:\n\n       As was said 3,000 years ago so it still must be said, \n     [that] ``the judgements of the Lord are true and righteous \n     altogether.''\n\n  That was Abraham Lincoln.\n\n  With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the \nright as God--\n\n  This is Lincoln talking, Abraham Lincoln talking--\n\n       With malice toward none, with charity for all, with \n     firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let \n     us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the \n     Nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the \n     brunt of the battle and for his widow and his orphan--to do \n     all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace \n     among ourselves and all nations.\n\n  Before leaving Washington, a visitor might make a final stop at the \nNational Cemetery in Arlington, VA. Here are the peaceful ranks of \ncrosses, stars of David, other religious symbols reminding us that our \nGovernment has given its fallen men back to the God who gave them life. \nThe Tomb of the Unknown Soldier stands for all those who have fallen in \nbattle who could not be identified--members of all sects, faiths, and \nreligions. And here, once more, we find the acknowledgment of God's \ndivine power in the eloquent words:\n\n       Here lies in honored glory, an American soldier known but \n     to God.\n\n  Can you imagine, we may have to someday get stonemasons to go over \nthere and take hammers and chisels and take those words off that \nmonument.\n  Thus, the connection between God and the United States of America is \nlong established in the minds of most Americans. If we begin now to \nerase the connection between God and schoolchildren under the pretense \nof protecting the so-called constitutional rights of nonbelievers or \natheists, as the Ninth Circuit did, will it not be necessary to go a \nlittle further, or perhaps a great deal further, in the future?\n  Will we next be forced to remove the name of God from all official \ndocuments, historic edifices, and patriotic events for fear of possibly \noffending what is a nonbelieving minority?\n  Must we do so when even the possibility of offending such a minority \nis, in the words of Judge Fernandez, picayune?\n  What will the court crier say--``God save this honorable court''? He \nwill have to stop there, will he not? He will have to say something \nelse. Would he say, ``President Bush save this honorable court?'' Would \nhe say, ``President Clinton, save this honorable court?'' One can see \nhow silly such a decision was and how foolish it is to pursue that line \nin this country with all of its history.\n  Obviously, in establishing and maintaining a secular government, the \nAmerican people never intended to foster an atheistic or a faithless \nsociety. In this light, in closing, I recite perhaps more sincerely \nthan ever the prayer that climaxes one of our greatest national hymns:\n\n     Our fathers' God to Thee,\n     Author of liberty,\n     To Thee we sing;\n     Long may our land be bright\n     With freedom's holy light;\n     Protect us by Thy might,\n     Great God our King.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/28/senate-section/article/S6309-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6309-S6311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Nation will honor its birthday on the \nforthcoming July 4. That was the day on which, in 1826, both Thomas \nJefferson and John Adams died. They both died on the same day, 50 years \nexactly from the date on which Thomas Jefferson wrote that Declaration \nof Independence and the Congress approved it. What a coincidence. God \nworks in miraculous ways, his wonders to perform, does not he?\n  As I look forward to that Fourth of July, I know the Senate will not \nbe in session. But before we depart, I want to talk about the event \nthat Senators and Members of the other body will be celebrating next \nweek back in their home States and districts: Independence Day.\n  As I think of Independence Day, I think of Henry Van Dyke's poem, \n``America For Me.''\n\n     'Tis fine to see the Old World, and travel up and down\n     Among the famous palaces and cities of renown,\n     To admire the crumbly castles and the statues of the kings,--\n     But now I think I've had enough of antiquated things.\n\n     So it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n     My heart is turning home again, and there I long to be,\n     In the land of youth and freedom beyond the ocean bars,\n     Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n           stars.\n\n     Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air;\n     And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair;\n     And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study in \n           Rome;\n\n[[Page S6310]]\n\n     But when it comes to living there is no place like home.\n\n     I like the German fir-woods, in green battalions drilled;\n     I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing fountains \n           filled;\n     But, oh, to take your hand, my dear, and ramble for a day;\n     In the friendly western woodland where nature has her way!\n\n     I know that Europe's wonderful, yet something seems to lack:\n     The Past is too much with her, and the people looking back.\n     But the glory of the Present it is to make the Future free,--\n     We love our land for what she is and what she is to be.\n\n     Oh, it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n     I want a ship that's westward bound to plough the rolling \n           sea,\n     To the blessed Land of Room Enough beyond the ocean bars,\n     Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n           stars.\n\n  I will think of America in the context of Henry Van Dyke's beautiful \npoem, ``America For Me.'' I am not referring to the movie of several \nyears ago. No one will be battling any alien invasions. Rather, we will \nparticipate in that most American of all holidays, all birthdays \ncertainly, celebrating the founding of this Nation on July 4, 1776. \nThat was 226 years ago.\n  Our Nation's birthday party is a time for picnics, ice cream, \nparades, and fireworks. It is a time for family and friends to gather \nunder the shade of the biggest and the oldest tree around, camped out \nin lawn chairs and on blankets with sweating glasses of cold drinks in \nhand, watching, laughing, as children run through the lawn sprinklers--\nha, ha. What a joy that was, to run through those lawn sprinklers. \nThese pages have enjoyed those things. We did not have lawn sprinklers \nwhen I was a boy, but I knew the joy of the summer rain.\n  So while these children are running through the lawn and enjoying the \nlawn sprinklers, our minds will shift to hotdogs. When the evening \nshadows gather and the fireflies begin their display, it is time to \npull out the sparklers and watch the fireworks. Small children then, \nlike my granddaughters, like my great granddaughter, will nestle \nagainst parents or grandparents or great grandparents. They are made \ntimid by the loud booms and shrill shrieks of the big rockets, but \ntheir shyness is soon forgotten as the enormous chrysanthemum bursts of \nred, gold, green, and blue burst forth against the dark sky.\n  I can see it from McLean. I can look toward Washington and see these \nenormous chrysanthemums of fireworks, these bursts of gold, red, \nyellow, and blue as they burst against the dark sky. Only when the show \nis over do small heads and sticky hands hang limp against a parent's \nshoulder for a long, sleepy walk back to the car and then home.\n  Many holidays touch deep wellsprings of feeling in Americans. \nMemorial Day and Veterans Day play upon our heartstrings like the \nmelancholy sigh of a violin, calling up visions of heroism and \nsacrifice, of the tears and loss and suffering that are sadly necessary \nparts of defending our nation, our people, and our freedom. Columbus \nDay sounds a bright note of discovery and optimism, the shining promise \nof new worlds. Flag Day foreshadows the patriotism of Independence Day, \nbut no other holiday brings out such affection and pride in our nation \nand the ideals upon which it is based. It is as if the July sun heats \nthe deep strong current that flows through this nation and brings it to \nthe surface, each year as strong and fresh as ever, as powerful as it \nwas in 1776.\n  July 4, 1776 was probably much like July 4, 2002 will be: hot, sunny, \nsticky with humidity in the South and East, dry in the West, but in \n1776, the air would have been thick with tension. The colonies' ties \nwith England were tearing apart. The previous year, on July 6, 1775, \nthe Congress had issued a ``Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of \nTaking Up Arms,'' which detailed American grievances while explicitly \ndenying any intention of separating from Great Britain. King George \nresponded by proclaiming a state of rebellion in the colonies, and \nParliament passed an act that cut off colonial trade.\n  Since January of 1776, everyone had been reading and talking about \nthe then-anonymous pamphlet, ``Common Sense,'' that so eloquently \nargued for independence. Rebel forces were fighting, and winning, \nbattles against British forces at Lexington, Concord, Fort Ticonderoga, \nBreed's Hill, and around Boston. A lot of things going on around \nBoston. Unable to conscript sufficient forces, King George had resorted \nto hiring mercenary soldiers from Germany the ``Hessians.'' In May, \nKing Louis XVI of France secretly authorized arms and munitions \nshipments to the Americans. In June 1776 the Continental Congress \nappointed a committee to compose a declaration of independence.\n  On June 28, 1776, American forces in Charleston, South Carolina, \nfought off a British attack, but on July 2, British General Sir William \nHowe landed an army that would reach 32,000 troops, including 9,000 \nHessian mercenaries, at Staten Island, New York. The same day, Congress \nvoted for independence. Two days later in Philadelphia, on the evening \nof July 4, the Declaration of Independence was adopted when John \nHancock, president of the Congress, signed the final draft copy.\n  Composed primarily by one man, Thomas Jefferson, with changes made by \nafter debate among the Congress, parts of the Declaration of \nIndependence are well known to many Americans. Many people can recite \nthe opening words--``When, in the course of human events * * * ''--and \nmore can recite the first line of the second paragraph: ``We hold these \ntruths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal; that they \nare endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that \namong these, are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' After \nthat, sadly, Americans' knowledge of the substance of the Declaration \ndrops off sharply. I hope that perhaps some parents will read the \nDeclaration of Independence to their children this July fourth. Or some \nchildren will read the Declaration of Independence to their parent, on \nthis 4th. The litany of wrongs inflicted upon the colonists by the \nBritish crown, designed to incite rebellion, still retains the power to \ninflame our passions. The actual declaration that follows, in the last \nparagraph of the document, is by contrast, firm and solemn, a \nstraightforward and almost lawyerly assertion of separation from the \nCrown.\n  At the signing of the Declaration, which occurred on August 2, 1776, \nJohn Hancock was reported to have urged unanimity, saying ``There must \nbe no pulling different ways. We must hang together.'' To which \nBenjamin Franklin, with his usual wit, is said to have retorted, ``Yes, \nwe must indeed all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang \nseparately.'' Gallows humor aside, Franklin's words were true. Failure \non the part of the signatories to make the Declaration of Independence \na reality would, for these men, mean losing not just a war, but their \nhomes, their possessions, and, in all likelihood, their lives. These \nmen were committing treason. Think about that. These men were \ncommitting treason. They were putting their lives, their honor, their \nsacred honor, on the altar.\n\n  They were putting everything they had on the line. The final words of \nthe Declaration could not have been lightly written: ``And, for the \nsupport of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of \nDivine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our \nfortunes, and our sacred honor.'' In the months ahead, American defeats \nat the battles of Long Island, White Plains, and Fort Lee may have made \na few signers wish that they had not been swayed by Hancock's plea. \nIndeed, by September of 1777, the British under Howe had driven \nWashington's army toward Philadelphia, forcing Congress to flee the \ncity. On September 26, 1777, Howe's forces occupied the city where the \nDeclaration of Independence was signed.\n  The Revolutionary War continued for six more difficult years, until a \npreliminary peace treaty was signed in Paris. Congress would not \ndeclare a formal end to the war until April 11, 1783. The Treaty of \nParis formally ending the war was signed on September 3, 1783 and \nratified by Congress in January 1784.\n  Mr. President, I think it is good to remind ourselves of these things \nfrom time to time. And remember those men who were willing to sign \ntheir names on the line, committing to the cause their lives--their \nlives, their fortunes,\n\n[[Page S6311]]\n\nand their sacred honor. What would you have given for their lives had \nthey not won that war? They were putting their lives on the line. They \nwere committing treason. What a chance they took--for us. For us!\n  It is difficult today, accustomed as we are to automobiles, air \nconditioning, electricity, mobile phones and instant communications, to \nimagine what those years of war must have been like. Weeks might pass \nbefore you heard or read, by candlelight on a hot summer's night, about \na decisive battle in a spot that might take you weeks to reach on \nhorseback. Imagine life as a Revolutionary soldier: a wool uniform if \nyou were lucky, and some French powder and ammunition hanging at your \nwaist while you walk in the middle of long, dust-covered column between \nbattles, carrying your three-foot-long, very heavy musket over your \nshoulder. I can see those boys from Vermont, can't you? In the hills of \nNew Hampshire, Boston--can't you see them, plodding along from \nLexington on to Concord?\n  In the winter you might have a tent to protect you from the winter, \nnot nearly enough to eat. You might get paid only sporadically. Most of \nus could not do that for a weekend, let alone for six years.\n\n  This Independence Day, America is at the beginning of what promises \nto be another kind war--a war against terrorism. It, too, will be \nfought on our territory as well as at points far distant from us. It \nwill require the same kind of resolve and commitment, and the same \nreliance on the protection of Divine Providence, that our Founding \nFathers showed. But next week, as we celebrate 226 years spent enjoying \nthe inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, \nof freedom from tyranny, I am confident that Americans will demonstrate \nthe same fortitude and bravery that our Founding Fathers displayed. Our \nideals are too deeply ingrained in us to be lightly given up.\n  I close with the words from Longfellow's poem, ``The Building Of the \nShip'':\n     Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!\n     Sail on, O Union, strong and great!\n     Humanity with all its fears,\n     With all the hopes of future years,\n     Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\n     We know what Master laid thy keel,\n     What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,\n     Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,\n     What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\n     In what a forge and what a heat\n     Where shaped the anchors of thy hope!\n     Fear not each sudden sound and shock,\n     'T is of the wave and not the rock;\n     'T is but the flapping of the sail,\n     And not a rent made by the gale!\n     In spite of rock and tempest's roar,\n     In spite of false lights on the shore,\n     Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!\n     Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,\n     Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,\n     Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,\n     Are all with thee,--are all with thee!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/28/senate-section/article/S6311-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6311-S6312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE DECISION\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my outrage at \nthe decision reached by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Newdow v. \nU.S. Congress, in which a three-judge panel held that schoolchildren's \nrecitation of the phrase ``under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance \nviolates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution. This case is the \nresult of yet another attempt by the radical left to wipe away public \nreferences to God, and is an unconscionable act of judicial activism. I \nhope that the Ninth Circuit's decision will ultimately be reversed on \nappeal, allowing reason and common sense to prevail.\n  Simply put, there is no support in the law for this ruling, even in \nthe Ninth Circuit's own jurisprudence. The phrase ``under God'' in the \nPledge of Allegiance is very similar to the use of ``In God We Trust'' \non currency and as the national motto, which has been repeatedly upheld \nby the courts. In Aronow v. United States, the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals ruled that the phrase does not violate the Establishment Clause \nof the Constitution. The court said, ``Its use is of a patriotic or \nceremonial character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental \nsponsorship of a religious exercise.'' It also said that ``it is quite \nobvious'' that the phrase ``has nothing whatsoever to do with the \nestablishment of religion.''\n  While the Ninth Circuit is the most relevant here because of \nWednesday's ruling, other circuit courts have reached the same \nconclusion. The Tenth Circuit explained in Gaylor v. United States that \nthe national motto ``through historical usage and ubiquity cannot be \nreasonably understood to convey government approval of religious \nbelief.'' In cases such as Lynch v. Donnelly, the Supreme Court has \nindicated its approval of these rulings. Even Justice William Brennan, \none of the most liberal Supreme Court justices of the modern era and \none of the most strident advocates for the separation of church and \nstate, indicated his support for this view, saying that Americans have \n``simply interwoven the motto so deeply into the fabric of our civil \npolity'' as to eliminate constitutional problems.\n  The same reasoning applies to the phrase ``under God'' in the Pledge \nof Allegiance. The use of this phrase simply indicates the important \nrole that religion plays in America, but it does not establish a \nreligion or endorse a religious belief.\n  It is also significant that even when the Supreme Court ruled in \nEngel v. Vitale that organized prayer is unconstitutional in public \nschools, the Court made it clear that the case did not apply to \npatriotic slogans or ceremonial anthems that refer to God. While I have \nalways viewed this case as misguided, and have for years introduced a \nconstitutional amendment to reverse it, even this case supports the use \nof phrases, such as ``under God'' and ``God Bless America,'' as part of \nour civic vocabulary.\n  The fact is that religion is central to our culture and our patriotic \nidentity as a nation. As the Supreme Court said in Lynch v. Donnelly, \nthere is ``an unbroken history of official acknowledgment by all three \nbranches of government of the role of religion in American life.''\n  I am pleased my colleagues have denounced this ruling. Throughout the \nhistory of this great Nation, we have invoked the blessings of God \nwithout establishing religion. From prayers before legislative assembly \nmeetings and invocations before college football games to the national \nmotto on our currency, our Constitution has allowed references to God.\n  I would also like to say a few words about the Ninth Circuit. Several \nyears ago, it was suggested that the Ninth Circuit be broken up. I \nthink that it is time to reconsider that proposal. The Supreme Court \nreverses the Ninth Circuit at a much higher rate than other circuits, \nindicating the activist propensities of this circuit. Simply put, the \nNinth Circuit is out of the mainstream, and the decision in Newdow \nunderscores that fact. It is unhealthy for our democracy when one \ncircuit routinely refuses to follow the law. During the last six years, \nthe Supreme Court has reversed 80-90% of Ninth Circuit cases reviewed. \nWhile the Supreme Court corrects the Ninth Circuit often, it cannot do \nso on every questionable ruling, and this allows the establishment of \ndangerous precedents.\n  I am particularly concerned about Wednesday's ruling because one of \nthe judges who joined in the majority opinion was Judge Stephen \nReinhardt, whose own confirmation process was marked by controversy in \n1980. I served as Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee at the \ntime, and I expressed serious concern over Judge Reinhardt's fitness to \nserve as a Federal judge. He was extremely active in politics and known \nfor his very liberal views. Judge Reinhardt's major area of practice \nwas labor law, and there was a question as to whether he had sufficient \nexperience. His record, in my view, called into question his ability to \nserve as an impartial judge. During his tenure of the Ninth Circuit, \nJudge Reinhardt has been reversed an alarming number of times. He was \nreversed 11 times during the 1996-97 term, and he holds the record for \nunanimous reversals in one term.\n  I mention the matter of Judge Reinhardt's controversial past only to \naddress his fitness as a Federal judge. This question is legitimate \nbecause circuit judges make important decisions that affect a lot of \npeople. In the Ninth Circuit case, Judge Reinhardt helped create law \nthat is dangerous in its precedent and unsound in its reasoning.\n  Mr. President, once again I want to state unequivocally that the \nNinth Circuit made a poor decision in the Newdo\n\n[[Page S6312]]\n\ncase. I hope that this decision will alert all Americans to the \ndangerous judicial activism that plagues the Ninth Circuit. \nFurthermore, I hope that this case is reversed on appeal, so that many \nmore generations of schoolchildren will proudly learn the Pledge of \nAllegiance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/28/senate-section/article/S6312-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6312-S6314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP ANTITRUST DECISION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to bring to the Senate's attention a \nrecent decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, \nwritten by Judge Richard Posner, in the case of In Re High Fructose \nCorn Syrup Antitrust Litigation, found at 2002 U.S. App. LEXIS 11940. \nJudge Posner's unanimous opinion, joined by Circuit Judges William \nBauer and Michael Kanne, articulates in clear, cogent, and unequivocal \nlanguage the standard for the Federal courts in the Seventh Circuit to \nfollow in deciding whether circumstantial evidence of price-fixing or \ntacit collusion should be presented to a jury in antitrust cases. This \nis a much needed improvement in the state of the law, and I hope that \nit will soon be followed in other circuits as well.\n  Last month, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I \nchair, completed a 10-month investigation into the reasons why gasoline \nprices fluctuate so dramatically and why retail gasoline prices seem to \ngo up and down together at so many gas stations. The majority staff \nissued a comprehensive 400-page report explaining our findings, and we \nthen held 2 days of hearings on the report.\n  I will not summarize the entire report here, but I would urge anyone \ninterested in how gasoline prices are set to visit the subcommittee's \nWeb site, where the report can be downloaded.\n  I would like to highlight, however, several of the issues the \nsubcommittee examined that are directly relevant to the Seventh \nCircuit's decision. First, the subcommittee found that in several of \nour domestic gasoline markets where there is little competition a few \noil companies have sufficient market power to raise the price of \ngasoline through their decisions on how much gasoline to produce.\n  The subcommittee examined retail prices in several geographic \nmarkets. The subcommittee found at various times in these markets the \nprices of the major brands of gasoline followed a ``ribbon-like'' \npattern. The prices of these brands moved up and down together, usually \nby about the same amount each day, and they maintained a constant \ndifference in price with respect to each other.\n  The documents reviewed by the subcommittee indicate that the \nmarketing practices of the various gasoline wholesalers and retailers \nin the market contribute to this pricing pattern. First, the major \nbrands usually seek to maintain a constant price difference with \nrespect to one or more other brands that are considered the major \ncompetition or the price leader in that market. Second, the market \nstrategy of the major brands generally is to maintain market share, and \navoid costly price wars which do not result in greater market shares, \nbut often lead to lower margins for all of the firms competing in the \nmarket. Thus, most of the major brands establish their retail price \nsimply by following the price movements of one or more other brands. \nThey do not attempt to undercut their rivals; rather they seek to \nmaintain their relative competitive position with respect to their \nrivals.\n  Another strategy supporting the ribbon-like retail price pattern is \nthe influence the refiners maintain over the retail price. Major brand \nrefiners usually set the wholesale price paid by their dealers on the \nbasis of surveys of the retail prices of competitors; the refiner then \nsubtracts an amount considered to be an adequate margin for the \nretailer, and charges the retailer for the remainder. In this manner, \nthe dealers receive a fixed margin for their gasoline, and the benefits \nand costs of retail price changes accrue to the refiner rather than the \ndealer. In reality, therefore, a few refiners rather than many \nindividual dealers set the retail price of gasoline for the major \nbrands.\n  The resulting retail pricing pattern--the ribbon-like pattern--is \nexactly the same pattern one would expect to see in a market where \nthere is some type of collusion between the firms in the market. In a \ncollusive marketplace, each firm has an agreed-upon market share, and \nthe relative prices of the different brands are fixed.\n  By itself, parallel pricing does not indicate collusion. Parallel \npricing can develop in a competitive market, as each firm strives \nindependently to obtain some advantage from a movement in price, only \nto be matched by its competitors who seek to deny that firm any such \nadvantage.\n  Hence, to establish that firms in a market are colluding with one \nanother, it is necessary to demonstrate more than just the existence of \nparallel or interdependent pricing. A plaintiff, or the government, as \nthe case may be, must establish either an explicit agreement on \npricing, or present sufficient circumstantial evidence indicating a \ntacit agreement on pricing.\n  It is rare to find in the modern age, with many corporations well-\nschooled in the antitrust laws, and legions of lawyers eager to educate \nthose who are not, to find an express agreement to fix prices or \nrestrict supply. Moreover, in markets most susceptible to price-fixing \nthose with few firms, a high degree of concentration, homogeneous \nproducts, and high barriers to entry, such as the gasoline market--\nexpress collusion is totally unnecessary to carry out the purposes of \nany such conspiracy. In highly concentrated markets, the few firms can \nobserve each other's behavior, determine how they react to various \nstrategies, and react accordingly. After a while, the firms in these \nmarkets can develop patterns of behavior that are as non competitive as \nif an actual agreement had been reached.\n  The problem, therefore, is how to determine whether certain market \nactivity is the natural result of the structure of the market and \npurely independent decisionmaking, or is the result of some tacit \nagreement or understanding or agreed-upon practices that restrict \ncompetition.\n  Again, rarely will there be a ``smoking gun'' document pointing out \nthe existence of tacit collusion. The best way--and in reality the only \nway to determine whether in fact such collusion exists is to look at \nall of the evidence regarding the marketplace and the behavior of the \nfirms in the market. For example, are the companies acting \nindependently? To what extent and how do they communicate with each \nother? To what extent do they have agreements between themselves on \nterms of sale, supply, storage, or transportation? To what extent do \nthey share information? To what extent do they pursue innovation \nindependently?\n  At the subcommittee's hearings we heard testimony from several \nattorneys general, knowledgeable in the antitrust laws, including \nAttorney General Jennifer Granholm from my home State of Michigan, that \nthe standards used by the courts in recent years have become unduly \nstringent for plaintiffs seeking to present evidence of tacit collusion \nto a jury in an antitrust case. Many courts have been requiring \nplaintiffs in price-fixing cases to present evidence that it was more \nlikely than not that the conduct complained of was the result of \ncollusion before the evidence would be presented to the jury. In \neffect, this standard relegates to the judge on a motion for summary \njudgment the determination of the basic factual issues that are \nnormally the province of a jury. Furthermore, it essentially requires \nthe plaintiff to present evidence amounting to a ``smoking gun'' \ndemonstrating collusion in order to survive a motion for summary \njudgment by the defendants. This standard thus prevents many cases that \nshould be presented to a jury from ever getting to the jury.\n  Judge Posner's opinion in the High Fructose Corn Syrup case clarifies \nthe law of the Seventh Circuit that economic evidence and other \nevidence indicating firms in a market have an agreement--either tacit \nor explicit--not to compete should be presented to a jury. The opinion \nclearly states that in a price-fixing case the question of ``whether, \nwhen the evidence was considered as a whole, it was more likely that \nthe defendants had conspired to fix prices than that they had not \nconspired to fix prices'' should be presented to a jury, and that the \nantitrust laws do not establish a higher threshhold for surviving \nmotions for summary judgment than other types of cases. The plaintiff \nneed not present one single item that demonstrates an\n\n[[Page S6313]]\n\nagreement; rather the plaintiff need only demonstrate that the evidence \nas a whole more likely than not shows an agreement.\n  Several weeks ago, following the subcommittee's hearing, I wrote a \nletter to the Federal Trade Commission informing them of the \nsubcommittee's findings, and urging the FTC to take a number of actions \nto improve the competitiveness of the gasoline refining and marketing \nindustry.\n  One of the points I stressed to the FTC was that ``In concentrated \nmarkets juries should be permitted to consider circumstantial evidence \nin determining whether or not the firms in the market are acting in \ncollusion. In highly concentrated markets, outright conspiracies and \ncollusion between the market participants are totally unnecessary to \ndevelop concerted action. When there are few firms in a market, these \nfirms can easily track and follow each other's behavior. In reality, \nthe only way to demonstrate collusion in a concentrated market is \nthrough circumstantial evidence.''\n  The Seventh Circuit has now established this principle as law. I \ncommend the Seventh Circuit for this clarification and hope that other \ncircuits will follow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to the FTC be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                            Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2002.\n     Hon. Timothy J. Muris,\n     Chairman, Federal Trade Commission, Pennsylvania Avenue, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Muris: I am writing to follow-up on several \n     issues raised in the recent report of the Permanent \n     Subcommittee on Investigations, ``Gas Prices: How Are They \n     Really Set?,'' and the Subcommittee's hearings on this \n     subject.\n       One of our central findings is that the increasing \n     concentration in the petroleum refining industry has \n     exacerbated the factors that cause price spikes. This has led \n     to sharp increases in prices and an unprecedented level of \n     volatility in a number of gasoline markets in the past \n     several years. Because of the importance of petroleum in \n     America today, gasoline price spikes can significantly harm \n     the national economy.\n       During our investigation and at the hearing we examined a \n     variety of proposals for reducing this volatility. I am \n     pleased that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been \n     proceeding with its own study of the reasons for the \n     volatility in gasoline prices and, as you stated in your \n     remarks at the second public conference on this subject, will \n     closely study our report and hearing record during your \n     review. I nonetheless would like to take this opportunity to \n     highlight some of the areas we examined that I believe \n     deserve serious attention during your overall review and as \n     the FTC reviews proposed mergers in the oil industry.\n\n\n                     Vertically Integrated Markets\n\n       The Majority Staff report and testimony at the \n     Subcommittee's hearings addressed a number of problems that \n     arise when there is a high degree of vertical integration in \n     highly concentrated markets. In such markets, refiners have \n     little incentive to lower wholesale prices, and retailers \n     have limited ability to shop around for lower wholesale \n     prices. The current situation on the West Coast also \n     demonstrates that a high degree of vertical integration in a \n     highly concentrated market poses substantial barriers to \n     entry for other firms seeking to enter either the wholesale \n     or retail market, including very high barriers to imports.\n       Professors Preston McAfee and Justine Hastings, both of \n     whom testified at our hearings, have extensively studied the \n     effects of vertical integration in concentrated markets. \n     Their work indicates that mergers between two vertically \n     integrated firms in highly concentrated wholesale and retail \n     markets may be more detrimental to competition, through \n     interdependent interactions between the integrated markets, \n     than a straightforward analysis of the increase in \n     concentration in each of those separate markets might \n     indicate. For example, in looking at the California market, \n     Professors Hastings and Richard Gilbert found ``evidence in a \n     broad panel that vertical integration matters for upstream \n     retail prices and that wholesale prices tend to be higher in \n     markets with large vertically integrated firms.'' I urge you \n     to seriously examine and consider these findings and the work \n     of Professor McAfee in this same area.\n\n\n                              Inventories\n\n       The increasingly tight balance between supply and demand in \n     gasoline markets--including the reduced levels of crude oil \n     and gasoline in inventories--is one of the prime factors \n     underlying the recent volatility. In a tightly balanced \n     market, even the slightest disruption in supply, such as a \n     pipeline break or an unplanned refinery outage, will lead to \n     a sharp increase in price due to the inelasticity in the \n     demand for gasoline.\n       Most oil companies today have adopted just-in-time \n     inventory practices. Although from each company's perspective \n     these practices may minimize day-to-day operational costs, in \n     the aggregate this has eliminated the refining industry's \n     cushion or ``insurance'' against price spikes resulting from \n     minor disruptions in the refining, distribution, and \n     marketing system. It also has created a perverse incentive \n     for refiners. The Subcommittee found documents indicating \n     that a number of refiners prefer a market that is vulnerable \n     to disruptions so they could take advantage of the higher \n     prices that follow any disruption.\n       In reviewing proposed mergers, the FTC should carefully \n     examine the potential effects upon the aggregate inventories \n     that would be created as a result of the merger. The FTC \n     should consider requiring companies seeking to merge to \n     ensure that the aggregate inventories that would be \n     maintained after the merger would not be less than, and \n     perhaps even greater than, the aggregate inventories prior to \n     the merger. This would ensure that increasing concentration \n     would not further exacerbate one of the factors leading to \n     price spikes.\n\n\n                     Pipeline and Terminal Capacity\n\n       The history of the Wolverine Pipeline in Michigan, as \n     recounted in the Subcommittee's report, demonstrates how \n     control of critical transportation and storage facilities are \n     a less visible but very effective way to influence cost, \n     supplies, and market prices. The Wolverine case demonstrated \n     that parties who control the transportation and storage \n     facilities can take advantage of the complexity of the laws \n     and regulations to circumvent the requirements of the law and \n     limit competition in the market.\n       According to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n     (FERC), the Wolverine Pipeline violated the Interstate \n     Commerce Act for approximately twenty years in the manner in \n     which it allowed access and established tariffs for shipments \n     over the pipeline. With the intervention of the Michigan \n     Attorney General, one small, independent company, Quality \n     Oil, successfully challenged Wolverine's practices and \n     obtained its rightful access to the pipeline. Quality Oil's \n     access to the Wolverine Pipeline at non-discriminatory \n     tariffs will benefit consumers in Michigan by increasing the \n     supply of gasoline to independent dealers at competitive \n     prices.\n       The Quality Oil/Wolverine Pipeline case demonstrates the \n     importance of the mission of agencies such as the FERC and \n     the FTC in ensuring there is fair competition in the \n     marketplace. In markets in which a dominant player controls \n     the transportation and storage of a product such as gasoline, \n     I urge the FTC to use its available authorities to ensure \n     that this market power is not abused. Similarly, in reviewing \n     proposed mergers, the FTC should ensure that the proposed \n     merger does not create any new barriers to entry into a \n     market through a lack of access to pipelines and terminals.\n\n\n                           refining capacity\n\n       As you are aware, approximately half of the refineries in \n     the United States have closed over the past twenty years. \n     This has resulted in a decline in the aggregate amount of \n     refining capacity, as well as increasing concentration in the \n     refining industry. There are a variety of reasons for this \n     increase in concentration, including the phase-out of federal \n     subsidies that benefitted smaller refiners, increasing \n     capital costs for refinery operation due to more stringent \n     environmental regulations, economies of scale, and mergers \n     within the oil industry. One of the Subcommittee's central \n     findings is that in a number of markets this increase in \n     concentration has exacerbated the factors that lead to price \n     spikes.\n       In several recent mergers the FTC has required the \n     divestiture of refining assets to preserve competition in the \n     wholesale market. The Subcommittee received testimony that \n     the divestiture of refining assets to firms that were much \n     less capitalized than the divesting firm has contributed to \n     the decline in inventories, as these less capitalized firms \n     are less able to carry inventories. I urge you to review \n     whether the divestitures the FTC has required have had the \n     intended effect of preserving competition, or whether, in \n     view of experience to date, additional conditions upon \n     mergers or divestitures of assets are necessary to fully \n     preserve competition in the refining industry.\n\n\n                         moratorium on mergers\n\n       At the Subcommittee's hearing, the Attorneys General from \n     the States of Connecticut and Michigan recommended that a \n     one-year moratorium be placed on all major mergers within \n     highly concentrated markets in the oil industry. The purpose \n     of the moratorium would be to enable the Congress to consider \n     more effective remedies to the problems arising from \n     increasing concentration and allow the FTC to consider this \n     problem as well. I am enclosing for your consideration a \n     copy of the statement of Attorney General Blumenthal in \n     support of this moratorium.\n\n\n                            parallel pricing\n\n       The Subcommittee also received testimony on what the \n     appropriate burden of proof should be in order to establish \n     illegal collusion under the antitrust laws. The Attorneys \n     General testified that the standard currently used by many \n     courts presents too high a hurdle for plaintiffs in antitrust \n     cases to present their evidence to a jury.\n       In concentrated markets juries should be permitted to \n     consider circumstantial evidence in determining whether or \n     not the\n\n[[Page S6314]]\n\n     firms in the market are acting in collusion. In highly \n     concentrated markets, outright conspiracies and collusion \n     between the market participants are totally unnecessary to \n     develop concerted action. When there are few firms in a \n     market, these firms can easily track and follow each other's \n     behavior. In reality, the only way to demonstrate collusion \n     in a concentrated market is through circumstantial evidence.\n       We found numerous instances of parallel pricing within the \n     gasoline industry. At certain times in certain markets, all \n     of the major brands went up and down together, and stayed at \n     a constant differential with respect to each other. Although \n     parallel pricing in and of itself does not necessarily \n     indicate collusion, I believe that additional circumstantial \n     evidence should be considered by a jury in determining \n     whether in fact such collusion exists in concentrated \n     markets.\n       I therefore support the standard set forth in In re \n     Coordinated Pretrial Proceedings in Petroleum Products \n     Antitrust Litigation, 906 F.2d 432 (9th Cir. 1990), cert \n     denied, 500 U.S. 959 (1991), in determining whether the \n     plaintiff's circumstantial evidence of collusion can be \n     presented to the jury.\n\n\n             importance of independents in gasoline markets\n\n       Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of \n     independent gasoline refiners and dealers in preserving \n     competition in the gasoline wholesale and retail markets. For \n     example, in one of the most rigorous studies to date, which \n     is cited in the Subcommittee's report, Professor Hastings \n     documented how the loss of one independent retail chain in \n     Southern California led to across-the-board price increases \n     at the pump in the areas previously served by the chain. In \n     addition, the Subcommittee's investigation found a number of \n     industry analyses indicating that the greater the presence of \n     non-majors in a specific market, the lower the retail price.\n       The continuing decline of independents nationwide and in a \n     number of markets presents a significant concern that prices \n     in the affected markets will rise above purely competitive \n     levels. In your reviews of proposed mergers I urge you to \n     carefully examine the effect of the proposed merger upon the \n     presence of independents in the market. Not only are large \n     retail chains necessary to present effective competition \n     for other large retail chains, but a healthy independent \n     sector is necessary to maintain true price competition.\n       In this context, I urge you or the FTC staff to meet with \n     the Association of Merger Dealers and seriously consider \n     their proposal for the purchase of up to 17 Mobil-branded \n     retail sites currently owned by Phillips/Tosco, which were \n     acquired by Tosco under the consent decree in the Exxon-Mobil \n     merger. In my opinion, it would be worthwhile for the FTC to \n     consider this proposal as a test case to see whether the \n     divestiture of gasoline stations owned by major brands to the \n     dealers rather than to other major brands can be an effective \n     way to inject competition into markets where a proposed \n     merger would be detrimental to competition.\n       In closing, I would like to thank you and the FTC staff for \n     the support provided to the Subcommittee during this \n     investigation. Our extensive requests for documents were \n     responded to in a timely manner, and the FTC personnel were \n     readily available to answer the Subcommittee's questions. I \n     look forward to continuing our productive working \n     relationship in this and other issues.\n       Should you have comments regarding this letter, please feel \n     free to contact me or have your staff contact Dan Berkovitz \n     or Laura Stuber, Counsels to the Subcommittee, at 224-9505. \n     Again, thank you for your time and consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Carl Levin,\n\n                                               Chairman, Permanent\n     Subcommittee on Investigations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/28/senate-section/article/S6314-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6314-S6316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 HONORING MELISSA BYERS OF LEAWOOD, KS\n\n Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to honor \nMelissa Byers of Leawood, KS, for her impressive essay, ``Determining \nthe Role of Peacekeeping in a Global Age.'' This essay won first place \nin a State-level competition in the 15th Annual National Peace Essay \nContest sponsored by the United States Institute of Peace. She received \na $1,000 college scholarship, and is competing for national awards of \nup to $10,000. Melissa is a high school student at Blue Valley North \nHigh School in Overland Park, KS.\n  Melissa sets an incredible example for all students in our country. \nMelissa came into my office and I met with her to extend my \ncongratulations on her accomplishments. I would like to submit her \nessay into the Record and recognize her fine work.\n  The United States Institute of Peace is an organization created and \nfunded by Congress to promote research, education, and training on the \nresolution of international conflicts. This National Peace Essay \nContest is one of the Institute's oldest activities to promote civic \neducation on international peace for students across the United States. \nI would like to commend the Institute of Peace and Melissa Byers for \ntheir participation.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Melissa's essay be printed in the Record.\n  The essay follows:\n\n          Determining the Role of Peacekeeping in a Global Age\n\n                           (By Melissa Byers)\n\n       Throughout the history of the United States, we have \n     adapted foreign policy to meet the unique challenges of the \n     times. Past US foreign policies of imperialism, expansionism, \n     and isolationism were adapted in ways representing a narrow \n     national interest. But global conflicts such as those \n     moderated by the current United Nations missions to the \n     Central Africa Republic, Sierra Leone, and Kosovo, not \n     withstanding the huge ramifications of September 11, require \n     a new foreign policy perspective. The collapse of the Soviet \n     Union effectively ended the Cold War, bringing with it the \n     possibility and the necessity of recognizing that the old \n     order is past and a new order is required. By examining the \n     traditional roles of the military and exploring several case \n     studies, the issues surrounding national policy come more \n     clearly into focus, and we can better begin to formulate and \n     redefine a new way of thinking about the peacekeeping role of \n     the United States military and our national interest.\n       Much has been written about the traditional role of the \n     military, and protecting the homeland is a foundational \n     context in defining the role of the military. Erwin A. \n     Schmidl, a historian for the Austrian Ministry of Defense \n     defines five types of peacetime military operations (1) \n     frontier operations, (2) colonial interventions and \n     counterinsurgency, (3) occupational duties, (4) peacekeeping \n     military operations, and (5) multinational operations \n     (Sismanidis 1). This theory can certainly be applied to U.S. \n     history. In frontier operations, the presence of US military \n     was a stabilizing influence in fulfillment of Manifest \n     Destiny. The US military in putting down the Filipino \n     insurrection of 1901 was an example of colonial interventions \n     and counterinsurgency operations, and the US post-WW II \n     occupation of Germany and Japan in deterring the rise of \n     militant forces was an example of occupational duties. The \n     presence of forces in Haiti in trying to maintain political \n     and economic stability is an example of peacekeeping military \n     operations, and the recent NATO interventions in the old \n     Yugoslavia in preventing ethnic cleansing and genocide is an \n     example of multinational operations. The common thread of \n     national protectionism underpins all five roles, formulating \n     the traditional groundwork for the post-WW II definition of \n     peacekeeping.\n       The timeliness of this essay is evident in the ashes and \n     aftermath of September 11. With the physical destruction of \n     the two World Trade Towers also came down the ideological \n     pillars of an inviolable and invincible United States. \n     Traditionally, wars have been fought between known enemies \n     and specific military targets. The profile of the enemy was \n     defined. But with the fall of the United Soviet Socialist \n     Republic came a new set of variables that changed foreign \n     policy. The profile of the ``enemy'' is not obscured. In many \n     modern conflicts, violence often occurs between subtle \n     ideological or ethnic enemies. The role of modern \n     peacekeepers is evolving around these global human and \n     economic conflicts. On the evening of September 11th, \n     President George W. Bush's address to the nation articulated \n     a shift in peacekeeping policy as it relates to national \n     security and foreign relations, ``America and our friends and \n     allies join with all those who want peace and security in the \n     world and we stand together to win the war against \n     terrorism'' (Bush Sept 11). In the evolving new foreign \n     policy, definitions are broadened, national security is \n     equated with international security, and American interests \n     are linked with global interests.\n       The current evolution of the U.S. military's peacekeeping \n     role stems from United Nations mandates that peacekeepers \n     should maintain international peace and security. As \n     published on the United Nations Website, the role of the \n     peacekeeper is divided into three categories. (1) Cease-fire \n     peacekeeping, in which conflicting countries can pull back, \n     creating a more conducive environment for negotiations. (2) \n     Multi-dimensional peacekeeping, in which experts inspire \n     major political, social and economic change, strengthening \n     national institutions. (3) Humanitarian peacekeeping, in \n     which massive human suffering is relieved, delivering needed \n     support and supplies (What is Peacekeeping?).\n       In the last six months, the role of U.S. peacekeepers has \n     been drastically redefined to include these roles. In \n     response to the threat of global terrorism, the U.S. has \n     broadened homeland defense to include global interests. In a \n     speech, marking the 100-day anniversary of September 11, Bush \n     declared, ``American power will be used against all \n     terrorists of global reach'' (Bush Dec. 20). The U.S. has now \n     begun to build coalitions, attack terrorist networks, employ \n     economic sanctions against those supporting and harboring \n     terrorism, and condemn terrorist attacks wherever they occur. \n     More funds have\n\n[[Page S6315]]\n\n     been made available the military's role, from not only \n     eliminating terrorist targets, but also to providing 2.5 \n     million humanitarian rations inside Afghanistan (Bush Dec. \n     20).\n       One positive example of U.S. military involvement in \n     peacekeeping happened during the 1999 Kosovo campaign to stop \n     the ethnic cleaning entire of the Albanian community (U.S. \n     White House 41-42). The presence of NATO peacekeepers \n     provided for surrender of Slobodan Milosevic, repatriation of \n     Albanian refugees, and withdrawal of Serbian forces from \n     contested soils (U.S. White House 41-52). The success of the \n     peacekeepers' involvement in Kosovo in promoting democratic \n     principles also increased the security and stability of \n     Europe. In October 2000, the world watched as Kosovo held its \n     first free and open municipal election, and its positive \n     result increased public confidence that peacekeeping efforts \n     could be successful.\n       Negative examples of U.S. military involvement in \n     peacepeekping occurred during operations in Lebanon and \n     Somalia, failing due to a lack of US focus and resolve. \n     During the Lebanese civil turmoil in the eighties, several \n     thousand American, French, British, and Italian peacekeepers \n     intervened to stop bloodshed, yet terrorism and flagging \n     public support forced the peacemakers to withdraw without \n     finding a peaceful solution (Magnuson 54). During the \n     Somalian Conflict in 1992, 30,000 U.S. military troops \n     attempted to open supply routes and disarm local militias, \n     but horrific images of the bodies of U.S. soldiers being drug \n     through the streets of Mogadisu helped to break U.S. national \n     resolve (Carpender). Both missions were designed to decrease \n     localized violence and civilian suffering, with limited \n     international involvement, but in each, American uniforms \n     because the target of heavily armed local militias. While \n     these failed attempts at peacekeeping diminished U.S. \n     international prestige, the most negative result was public \n     disillusionment. Unsuccessful interventions in the civil \n     matters of others countries, compounded by costs of American \n     lives and resources, drastically limits the public resolve \n     to intervene.\n       The tragedy of Rwanda is an example of the negative \n     implications of restricting U.S. military involvement abroad. \n     When the UN Security Council withdrew most of its \n     peacekeepers from Rwanda, it created a deathly vacuum, \n     resulting in the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis in three months \n     (Kuperman 105). Four months later the UN reversed its \n     decision (Carnegie 4). In part, due to the Somalia \n     experience, the U.S. continued to be reluctant to intervene \n     (Nye 32). Experts project that the timely intervention of \n     6,000 U.S. troops could have prevented 275,000 Tutsi deaths \n     (Kuperman 100). Lack of U.S. military action partially \n     resulted in the human tragedy of Rwandan genocide, while the \n     guilt of the nations grew and the national consciences \n     appeared to numb.\n       Vietnam is an example of the positive implications of \n     restricting U.S. military involvement abroad. For decades, \n     France and Vietnam had been embroiled in military conflict. \n     When France withdrew, the Americans entered in a peacekeeping \n     role, fearing the domino effect. By 1955, American \n     peacekeepers began advising military and political leaders \n     against the communist forces lead by Ho Chi Minh (Bailey 916-\n     917). Eventually, peacekeeping forces became military troops, \n     escalating U.S. involvement, distracting the U.S. from its \n     goal of peace, and entangling the U.S. in a long protracted \n     war. Thus, public support decreased. What started out as a \n     peacekeeping effort resulted in 47,355 American casualties, \n     over one million Vietnamese casualties, and at a cost of 352 \n     billion dollars (Bailey A34). The extent of such losses makes \n     for a strong argument in limiting U.S. military engagement \n     abroad.\n       Over the next decade, there is no doubt that the American \n     military must play a leading part in insuring international \n     peace and security. The old order, including the narrow \n     traditional role of the military, is obsolete, and a new \n     order, including a broadened innovative role of military, is \n     required. Experiences in Kosovo, Lebanon and Somalia, Rwanda, \n     and Vietnam testify that it is in our national interest to \n     formulate and redefine broader peacekeeping roles for the \n     United States military. As in the case of Kosovo, the U.S. \n     needs to be bold enough to commit the forces needed to \n     resolve the situation. As seen in Lebanon and Somalia, \n     military objectives need to be well defined in order to avoid \n     escalating entanglement and unnecessary loss of life. To \n     prevent another Rwanda, the U.S. military policy needs to \n     defend human rights violations wherever they occur, yet, move \n     with enough caution and insight to prevent another Vietnam \n     imbroglio. The lessons of September 11 call us to the \n     openness and flexibility of preventative peacekeeping. The \n     United States must realize that it has a vested interest in \n     what goes on outside its borders, and that the best way to \n     protect our national interests is to defend personal and \n     economic rights worldwide.\n\n\n                              Works Cited\n\n       Bailey, Thomas A. and David M.

Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the \ncontribution to this nation provided by the workers and management of \nAlcoa's Massena, New York Operations. The Massena Operations make \naluminum ingot--which is the raw material that is used in a variety of \napplications--and fabricated aluminum products.\n  I hope many of my colleagues will have the chance to visit the town \nof Massena, NY, because it is a wonderful community. Massena is located \non the St. Lawrence River in St. Lawrence County, serving as a gateway \nto America's Fourth Coast, including the St. Lawrence Seaway, the \nThousand Islands and the Great Lakes.\n  This year, Massena is celebrating its 200th birthday, and along with \nit a century of Alcoa involvement in the community. Alcoa is \ncelebrating an incredible 100 years of aluminum production at its \nMassena location. As part of its celebration, Alcoa will establish the \nMassena Operations Memorial Park. Earlier this year, Alcoa-Massena \nofficials also announced their contribution of $100,000 to the Massena \nBicentennial.\n  The history of Alcoa's Massena Operations is a true American success \nstory. A century ago, the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, a predecessor \nof Alcoa, built a smelting plant at Massena. The products manufactured \nat Massena have included wire and electric transmission cable. Consumer \nproducts with aluminum components made in Massena have harnessed the \npower of electricity for the home. The Massena Operations have also \nmade significant contributions to our Nation's military and aerospace \nefforts.\n  For a century, Alcoa's Massena Operations has upheld the proud \nAmerican tradition of quality manufacturing. I wish to thank you for \nthe opportunity to highlight their fine work and the important role \nthat Alcoa's Massena Operations plays in their community in New \nYork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/28/senate-section/article/S6316-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak \nabout hate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in \nMarch of last year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 12, \n2001, in Boston, MA. Three teenagers, claiming they wanted to ``get \nback at Arabs,'' threw three Molotov cocktails onto a convenience store \nthe day after the September 11 terrorist attacks. The teenagers thought \nthat the store was owned by an Arab. The owner of the store, Aswin \nPatel, an Indian man, escaped unharmed. The three perpetrators face \nFederal hate crimes charges and have been charged with assault with \nintent to murder and arson.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/28/senate-section/article/S6316-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONGRATULATING INDIANAPOLIS ON BECOMING DIGITAL TELEVISION ZONE\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the city \nof Indianapolis on its recent designation as a ``Digital Television \nZone.'' Viewers in Indianapolis are fortunate to be served by local \ntelevision broadcast stations that have been and continue to be leaders \nin the digital television transition. These stations are: WTHR, a \ndispatch broadcast-owned NBC affiliate; WISH-TV, a LIN television-owned \nCBS affiliate; WRTV, a dispatch broadcast-owned ABC affiliate; and \nWXIN, a tribune broadcast-owned FOX affiliate.\n  As the broadcast industry undertakes its transition to digital \ntelevision, I am proud to say that our local Indianapolis affiliates \nare already fully on the air in digital.\n  For those not familiar with digital television, it is the next step \nin the evolution of television. Those of us old enough, remember the \nmove from black and white to color. Now, the next exciting step in the \nprocess is digital. Just as the other communications mediums are moving \nfrom an analog to a digital world, so too is television.\n  This past spring, Indianapolis' local CBS station, WISH-TV, granted \nthe wish of many of my constituents. Through digital television, the \nstation was able to simultaneously broadcast four NCAA basketball \ntournament games. Our local ABC affiliate, WRTV, has expanded its \nprimetime digital line up. Today, Indianapolis viewers can watch \npopular programs such as ``Drew Carey,'' ``Alias,'' and ``NYPD Blue''--\nall in high definition. The local NBC affiliate, WTHR, airs ``Crossing \nJordan'' and ``The Tonight Show'' in high-definition nightly. This \nyear, they broadcast the Olympics' opening ceremonies in digital. It is \ncompelling programming like this that will propel the transition \nforward and encourage consumers to invest in digital technology--like \ntheir local broadcasters have done already.\n  In January, Indianapolis earned the distinction of being named a \n``Digital TV Zone.'' As Mayor Bart Peterson said at the ribbon cutting \nceremony, ``Our designation as a Digital TV Zone--being one of only a \nhandful of cites to have all local network affiliates broadcasting in \ndigital--is evidence that Indianapolis is where it needs to be to \ncompete in the digital world.''\n  Through the Digital TV Zone Program, Indianapolis broadcasters pooled \ntheir resources over the past year to educate Indianapolis consumers--\nmy constituents--about digital TV technology and its benefits.\n  The local stations cooperated with electronics manufacturers and \nretailers to post digital sets in high traffic areas throughout the \ncity. If you walked through Indianapolis International Airport, or if \nyou went to Conseco field house, or the NCAA Hall of Champions over the \nlast 5 months, you would have seen the local Indianapolis stations in \ndigital being displayed on high-definition digital television sets.\n  Clearly, Indianapolis broadcasters are doing their part to launch the \ndigital television future. All of these different activities are \ndesigned to educate my constituents about the promise of this new \ntechnology.\n  There will, of course, be many challenges before all consumers can \nfully benefit from digital television. Despite any outstanding issues, \nI am proud to say that Indianapolis broadcasters are leading the charge \ninto the digital television future and giving local viewers the \nopportunity to experience digital television now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/28/senate-section/article/S6316-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6316-S6317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  LETTER TO HARVEY PITT, CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Harvey L. Pitt,\n     Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Pitt: We are writing out of deep concern \n     regarding recent reports about a variety of abuses in \n     corporate accounting scandals by companies and corporate \n     executives. In particular, the accounting practices at \n     WorldCom that led to an error of more than $3.5 billion is \n     unforgivable and inexcusable.\n       We are pleased to have taken steps to investigate several \n     recent disturbing disclosures and encourage you to pursue \n     initiatives to improve corporate responsibility and \n     shareholder protections. We fear that these reports of \n     corporate fraud may just be the tip of the iceberg, and the \n     need to improve accountability in America's public companies \n     is imminent.\n       American business is built upon an integrity and trust in \n     business relationships that bolster our currency and provide \n     a shining face of transparency that supports western values \n     and spreads capitalism and corporate\n\n[[Page S6317]]\n\n     responsibility across the globe. We can't emphasize how \n     important it is for you to continue to work to improve \n     corporate disclosure, make corporate officers more \n     accountable and develop a stronger, more independent audit \n     system. American businesses must be trustworthy, transparent \n     and able to withstand the light of any audit.\n       We look forward to working with you and the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission as you fully investigate the companies \n     and individuals who abuse the system and prosecute them to \n     the full extent of the law.

Mr. President, I rise to salute a \ncommunity leader in my home State of Oregon. Today, I want to recognize \nthe efforts of Susan Abravanel, Education Coordinator at SOLV, a non-\nprofit organization in Oregon, in advocating for service-learning, one \nof the most exciting educational initiatives taking hold in our Nation \ntoday.\n  Service-learning gives students the opportunity to learn through \ncommunity service, but it is important to note that it is much more \nthan just community service. It is a method of classroom instruction \nthat engages a student's intellect through hands-on work outside the \nclassroom that benefits the community at large. Research shows that \nstudents participating in service-learning make gains on achievement \ntests, complete their homework more often, and increase their grade \npoint averages.\n  In addition to producing academic gains, service-learning is also \nassociated with both increased attendance and reduced dropout rates. It \nis clear to educators across the country that service-learning helps \nstudents feel more connected to their own education while strengthening \ntheir connection to their community as well. It is for all of these \nreasons that Susan Abravanel is working so hard to advocate for \nservice-learning in classrooms in Oregon and across the nation.\n  Ms. Abravanel is working closely with my office and with education \nleaders in Oregon to ensure that my home State remains a national \nleader in service-learning. Just 2 months ago, I introduced a bill with \nmy colleague, Senator Edwards, to strengthen our Nation's commitment to \nservice-learning. I feel confident that this bill will soon become law \nand that with Ms. Abravanel's continued efforts both here in \nWashington, DC, and at home in Oregon, students will continue to \nbenefit from an education tied to civic engagement.\n  Ms. Abravanel exemplifies the type of engaged citizen our schools \nmust endeavor to produce, and her persistence will ensure that future \ngenerations of Americans will give back to their communities just as \nshe has. I would also like to note that Susan isn't just concerned \nabout education, her interests and efforts in Portland's Jewish \ncommunity are well known and highly appreciated, she is the new \nPresident of the Oregon chapter of the American Jewish Committee. I \nlook forward to working with Susan in her new role at the AJC and thank \nher for her continuing devotion to service-learning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/28/senate-section/article/S6317-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            COMMUNITY HEROES\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President I rise today to recognize \nsome community heroes in my home State of Oregon. The Agape House, \nwhich has been serving needy families in the Hermiston area for 15 \nyears, is one of those rare organizations that dedicates its efforts \nentirely to the service of others.\n  Founded in 1987, Agape House began as a small group of volunteers \nproviding food and clothing to approximately 100 families a month. Over \nthe years, Agape House has been able to expand its reach, and last \nmonth was able to help 644 families in need. Food and clothing still \nconstitute the majority of the assistance provided by Agape House's \nvolunteers, but they are often able to help local residents with energy \nbills, prescription drug bills, emergency shelter, and any number of \nother unmet daily needs.\n  Perhaps the most encouraging aspect of Agape House's work is that it \nis done by a large number of area volunteers who take turns staffing \nthe Agape House. On any given day, six to eight volunteers work at \nAgape House, but they are seldom the same six to eight people who were \nthere the day before. Not only do its many volunteers come from the \ncommunity, but Agape House relies primarily on food, clothing, and \nfinancial donations from local citizens. Agape House is truly a \ncommunity effort, and, for that reason, has been uniquely successful in \nproviding assistance to the needy families of western Umatilla County.\n  One recent and extraordinary example of Agape House's effectiveness \ninvolves a young single mother in the Hermiston area. As a young single \nmother with three mouths to feed, this jobless Hermiston woman relied \non Agape House for many of her family's daily needs. When she was \nfinally able to find work, she struggled to get to and from her job \nbecause she could not afford a car, and was at risk of finding herself \njobless once again. Seeing her problems, Agape House stepped in and \ngave her a car. A car is not a typical charitable gift to a young woman \nin need. With her new car, this young woman flourished at her job, and \nAgape House, which once served this woman nearly every day, has not had \na visit from her since the day she received her car. This is just one \nexample of how Agape House goes the extra mile to help people truly \nbecome self-sufficient, which takes much more dedication than simply \nproviding temporary relief.\n  I think it is important to recognize organizations like Agape House \nhere on the Senate floor. The staff and volunteers associated with \nAgape House are heroes to their community, and are shining examples of \nwhat can be accomplished by a generous group of civic-minded citizens. \nI appreciate the important work they do each and every day, and want \nthem to know that their efforts do not go unnoticed by those outside \nUmatilla County.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/28/senate-section/article/S6317-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/28/senate-section/article/S6317-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/28/senate-section/article/S6317-5", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6317-S6318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:34 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2578.

A bill to amend titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act \nto limit the amount of attorney assessments for representation of \nclaimants and to extend the attorney fee payment system to claims under \ntitle XVI of that Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Social \nSecurity Attorney Fee Payment System Improvement Act of 2002. This bill \nwill help ensure that all Social Security claimants have equal access \nto representation.\n  Unfortunately, the Social Security Administration's disability \ndetermination system has become far too complex for most claimants and \ntheir families to successfully navigate on their own. Claimants are \nconfronted by a confusing, time-consuming and multi-level process, \nwhich, more often than not, results in a denial of their claim. \nAppealing a disability claim is a daunting task for anyone without the \nnecessary legal experience, but for individuals who are in poor health \nor disabled, the procedural hurdles that must be cleared in order to \nobtain disability benefits can seem insurmountable. As a result, many \nof the hard working men and women applying for Social Security \nDisability Insurance, SSDI, benefits or Supplemental Security \nInsurance, SSI, benefits choose to retain an attorney to help them with \ntheir appeal. The bill I am introducing today will help both SSDI and \nSSI claimants get the benefits to which they are entitled by extending \nthe attorney fee direct payment system to both programs, a change that \nis long overdue and that enjoys the support of both claimants' \nrepresentatives and disability advocates.\n  Additionally, this bill corrects a serious and unintended consequence \nof the Ticket to Work Act of the 106th Congress. Although this plainly \nwas a landmark piece of legislation, the disproportionately onerous \nnature of the attorney fee assessment provisions contained therein have \ncaused a dramatic decline in the number of legal professionals who can \nafford to represent individuals seeking Social Security disability \nbenefits. As a result of such a decrease in the number of attorneys \nskilled in this area of the law, the most vulnerable claimants, those \nwith serious physical or mental impairments, those with financial \nchallenges, and those who do not or cannot understand the disability \nclaims process, are often left to find their own way through SSA's \nlabyrinthine bureaucracy. This bill seeks to reverse this disturbing \ntrend and to encourage attorneys to continue providing this extremely \nimportant service by enacting rational and equitable modifications to \nthe fee assessment system.\n  I want to say that my long-term goal is to reform the Social Security \ndisability claims process so that it is not so difficult and \nfrustrating for claimants. However, I recognize that this will not \nhappen overnight and, in the near term, it is essential that we enable \ncitizens to cope with this onerous process.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in ensuring that the hard working \nmen and women of America obtain adequate legal representation as they \npursue their Social Security disability claims. As my colleagues know, \nindividuals with disabilities rely on Social Security disability and/or \nSupplemental Security Income benefits for life-sustaining income. We \nmust do all we can to support their efforts to obtain benefits they \nneed and deserve. This bill does just that.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2707. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide comprehensive \npension protection for women; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a pleasure to join Senator Snowe in \nintroducing the Women's Pension Protection Act of 2002. In this new \nmillennium, women still work in a world of ``less'' and ``fewer.'' Less \npay and fewer benefits, especially retirement benefits. Less job \nsecurity and fewer opportunities for advancement. Less respect for \ntheir work and fewer rewards for their contributions.\n  A major challenge of our time is to protect women's retirement \nsecurity. The legislation we introduce today meets this important goal \nby giving women greater say in the management of 401(k) funds, giving \nwidows more generous survivor benefits, and granting divorced spouses \nexpanded opportunities to receive a share of their former spouses' \npension after a divorce.\n  The challenge of retirement security is overwhelmingly a women's \nissue. The Older Women's League's annual Mother's Day Report concludes \nthat women's pension problems are rooted in the realities that shape \ntheir lives: the reality of the wage gap, the reality of caregiving \nresponsibilities, and the reality of jobs that offer few benefits, \nespecially pensions.\n  Almost 40 years after the Equal Pay Act was passed, women still earn \nonly 73 percent of what men earn. You can't save what you don't earn. \nAnd the impact of the wage gap extends far beyond the years that women \nparticipate in the workforce. Over a lifetime, the wage gap adds up to \nan average of $250,000 less in earnings for a woman to invest in her \nretirement. The result is that one in four older women are living in \npoverty.\n  Women represent less than half of the paid workforce, but comprise \nalmost two-thirds of those working in minimum wage jobs. This should \nnot come as a surprise to anyone, but women are 96 percent of all \nchildcare workers, 97 percent of receptionists, and 90 percent of \nsecretaries. Because so many of these jobs are non-union, part-time, \nand low wage, women are much less likely to be covered by a pension \nplan than men.\n  At the same time, women are much more likely to spend time out of the \nworkforce to tend to family caregiving responsibilities. In fact, the \naverage woman now spends 12 years out of the workforce over her work \nlife. That is time that she is not earning a pension, vesting in a \npension or contributing to Social Security. This absence from the paid \nworkforce translates into inadequate retirement income and an increased \nfinancial dependency on their spouses at retirement. A woman who drops \nout of the labor market for as few as five years, can end up with as \nmuch as 30 percent less in her defined contribution plan.\n  Although the pension laws are gender neutral, pension policy \nunintentionally discriminates against women. Women continue to be less \nlikely to be covered by a pension plan and less likely to receive \npension benefits. And even when women earn pensions, their benefits \ntend to be only a fraction of what men receive because of pension \nformulas that penalize them for moving in and\n\n[[Page S6321]]\n\nout of the workforce. Only 13 percent of women age 65 and over receive \na pension, and among that small group the median annual pension is only \n$3,000. These challenges are made even more acute by the fact that \nwomen live longer than men and have a greater need for retirement \nincome than men.\n  We need to make our pension system fairer, especially for women. \nMarried women often count on their husband's retirement benefits to \nsupport them in old age, then outlive their husbands and frequently \ntheir husbands' retirement income.\n  Over the last twenty years, reform of the Federal pension law has \nseen some improvement with changes that allow a widow to continue \nreceiving defined benefit pension payments. The Retirement Equity Act \nof 1984 requires defined benefit pension plans to pay survivor benefits \nunless a spouse waives this protection. But this protection does not \nextend to 401(k) and other defined contribution plans.\n  The Women's Pension Protection Act offers simple, common sense \nimprovements in our private pension system to ensure that retirement \nsavings programs better respond to the realities of women's working \nlives. This bill will help women like Joan Mackey of Salem, New Jersey, \nwho testified recently about the difficulties she has faced in trying \nto collect survivor benefits from her former husband's pension plan. \nMs. Mackey's ex-husband wanted her to collect survivor benefits after \nhis death, but because Ms. Mackey didn't know to ask for a widow's \nbenefit at the time of their divorce, the plan now refuses to pay.\n  Sadly, Joan Mackey is not alone. Congress must do all it can to \nprotect women's retirement security and address inequities in our \npension laws that primarily affect women. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Women's Pension Protection Act.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to join with Senator Kennedy in \nintroducing The Women's Pension Protection Act of 2002 to improve the \nretirement security of women.\n  As Americans live longer, achieving financial security can be a \nparticular challenge for women. Women live, on average, seven years \nlonger than men but earn less money over their lifetime, and as women \ncontinue to be society's primary caregivers, they continue to lose time \nfrom the workplace during their prime earning years. The result? Just \n40 percent of women have pensions, compared with 47 percent of men. Of \nthose with pensions, women retirees receive only about half the pension \nbenefits that men receive--on average, $4,200 annually compared to \n$7,800 for men.\n  With less time to invest in their retirement, women are frequently \nunable to establish a solid nest egg for future years. Women sometimes \nrely on their spouse's pension for essential savings in later years. If \na marriage dissolves, as roughly half of marriages in America have, \nthis can deal a terrible blow to a women's retirement plans.\n  For elderly women the situation worsens, as they are three times as \nlikely than men to outlive their spouses. Lower pensions can make it \ndifficult for women to make ends meet in their later years. Tragically, \nalmost one in five nonmarried elderly women, 17 percent, live in \npoverty today. These facts help explain why our pension laws should \nreflect the reality and needs of our workforce.\n  The bill we are introducing today is aimed at meeting the unique \nfinancial needs of women. It recognizes the economic partnership of \nmarriage, ensuring that women are included in financial decisions that \neffect their future. Under this bill, spousal consent would be required \nbefore participants can withdraw lump sum payments of pension benefits \n401(k) plans. Similar requirements already exist for spouses of workers \ncovered by traditional pension plans. This bill also encourages more \ninvestment into annuities, which pay a guaranteed stream of lifelong \nincome and help to prevent poverty. Spouses will have the option of \nselecting a 75-percent survivor benefit, in addition to the current 50-\npercent survivor benefit.\n  This legislation also enhances the financial security of women by \nrequiring plans to offer the option of increasing survivor benefits \nfrom 50 percent to at least 75 percent of her husband's retirement. It \nensures that a widow can receive her husband's pension regardless of \nwhen the husband dies or whether he applied for the pension to begin. \nAnd it closes a glaring loophole by ensuring that pension plan \nadministrators will abide by the division of pension benefits ordered \nby the courts in a divorce proceeding, regardless of when the order is \ngiven.\n  Ultimately, this legislation will strengthen our country's future by \ngiving the tools women, and men, need to secure their retirement \nfuture. We have an opportunity to improve the benefits to our workforce \nand enhance opportunities for women in a way that makes sense. I urge \nmy colleagues to join in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/28/senate-section/article/S6321-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6321-S6322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 296--RECOGNIZING THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF IGNACY JAN \n PADEREWSKI AS A MUSICIAN, COMPOSER, STATESMAN, AND PHILANTHROPIST AND \n   RECOGNIZING THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RETURN OF HIS REMAINS TO \n                                POLAND.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Biden, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Murkowski, and \nMr. Fitzgerald) submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Roosevelt, Paderewski's remains were placed along \n     side America's honored dead in Arlington National Cemetery, \n     where President Roosevelt said, ``He may lie there until \n     Poland is free.'';\n       Whereas in 1963, United States President John F. Kennedy \n     honored Paderewski by placing a plaque marking Paderewski's \n     remains at the Mast of the Maine at Arlington National \n     Cemetery;\n       Whereas in 1992, United States President George H.W.

Mr. President, today I rise to submit a resolution \nrecognizing the accomplishments of Ignacy Jan Paderewski as a musician, \ncomposer, statesman, and philanthropist and to commemorate the 10th \nanniversary of the return of his remains to Poland.\n  Born in Poland in 1860, Paderewski is remembered for his \ncontributions to the arts and humanities and as one of the great men of \nour times. Paderewski was a brilliant and popular pianist who performed \nhundreds of concerts in Europe and the United States during the late \n19th and early 20th centuries, donating the proceeds to numerous \ncharitable causes. During WWI, Paderewski played a central role in \nachieving Poland's independence, becoming the first Premier of Poland \nin 1919 until 1922 when he left politics and returned to music.\n\n[[Page S6322]]\n\n  The German invasion of Poland in 1939 spurred Paderewski to return to \npolitics where he fought against the Nazi dictatorship in World War II. \nBy joining the exiled Polish Government he helped to mobilize the \nPolish forces and to urge the United States to join the Allied Forces.\n  Paderewski died in 1941. At the direction of President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt, Paderewski's remains were placed alongside America's honored \ndead in Arlington National Cemetery, where President Roosevelt said he \nmay lie until Poland is free.\n  For over a half century, the remains of Paderewski were interred at \nArlington National Cemetery. He did not live to see the U.S. and Allied \nForces liberate Europe from the tyranny of Nazi control. Nor did he \nwitness the subjugation of Poland during the Soviet era. It was, \nhowever, the legacy of Paderewski that inspired movements throughout \nEurope, including Solidarity in Poland, which led to the liberation of \nEurope.\n  In 1992, Solidarity Leader Lech Walesa, the first democratically \nelected President of Poland following WWII, asked U.S. President George \nH.W.

Con. Res. 127\n\n       Whereas the Parthenon was built on the hill of the \n     Acropolis in Athens, Greece in the mid-fifth century B.C. \n     under the direction of the Athenian statesman Pericles and \n     the design of the sculptor Phidias.\n       Whereas the Parthenon is the ultimate expression of the \n     artistic genius of Greece, the preeminent symbol of the Greek \n     cultural heritage--its art, architecture, and democracy--and \n     of the contributions that modern Greeks and their forefathers \n     have made to civilization;\n       Whereas the Parthenon has served as a place of worship for \n     ancient Greeks, Orthodox Christians, Roman Catholics, and \n     Muslims;\n       Whereas the Parthenon has been adopted by imitation by the \n     United States in many preeminent public buildings, including \n     the Lincoln Memorial;\n       Whereas over 100 pieces of the Parthenon's sculptures--now \n     known as the Parthenon Marbles--were removed from the \n     Parthenon under questionable circumstances between 1801 and \n     1816 by Thomas Bruce, seventh Earl of Elgin, while Greece was \n     still under Ottoman rule;\n       Whereas the removal of the Parthenon Marbles, including \n     their perilous voyage to Great Britain and their careless \n     storage there for many years, greatly endangered the Marbles;\n       Whereas the Parthenon Marbles were removed to grace the \n     private home of Lord Elgin, who transferred the Marbles to \n     the British Museum only after severe personal economic \n     misfortunes;\n       Whereas the sculptures of the Parthenon were designed as an \n     integral part of the structure of the Parthenon temple; the \n     carvings of the friezes, pediments, and metopes are not \n     merely statuary, movable decorative art, but are integral \n     parts of the Parthenon, which can best be appreciated if all \n     the Parthenon marbles are reunified;\n       Whereas the Parthenon is a universal symbol of culture, \n     democracy, and freedom, making the Parthenon Marbles of \n     concern not only to Greece but to all the world;\n       Whereas, the since obtaining independence in 1830, Greece \n     has sought the return of the Parthenon Marbles;\n       Whereas the return of the Parthenon Marbles would be a \n     profound demonstration by the United Kingdom of its \n     appreciation and respect for the Parthenon and classical art;\n       Whereas returning the Parthenon Marbles to Greece would be \n     a gesture of good will on the part of the British Parliament, \n     and would set no legal precedent, nor in any other way affect \n     the ownership or disposition of other objects in museums in \n     the United States or around the world;\n       Whereas the United Kingdom should return the Parthenon \n     Marbles in recognition that the Parthenon is part of the \n     cultural heritage of the entire world and, as such, should be \n     made whole;\n       Whereas Greece would provide care for the Parthenon Marbles \n     equal or superior to the care provided by the British Museum, \n     especially considering the irreparable harm\n\n[[Page S6323]]\n\n     caused by attempts by the museum to remove the original color \n     and patina of the Marbles with abrasive cleaners;\n       Whereas Greece is constructing a new, permanent museum in \n     full view of the Acropolis to house all the Marbles, \n     protected from the elements in a safe, climate-controlled \n     environment;\n       Whereas Greece has pledged to work with the British \n     government to negotiate mutually agreeable conditions for the \n     return of the Parthenon Marbles;\n       Whereas the people of Greece have a greater, ancient bond \n     to the Parthenon Marbles, which were in Greece for over 2,200 \n     years of the over 2,430 year history of the Parthenon;\n       Whereas the British people support the return of the \n     Parthenon Marbles, as reflected in several recent polls;\n       Whereas a resolution signed by a majority of members of the \n     European Parliament urged the British government to return \n     the Parthenon Marbles to their natural setting in Greece;\n       Whereas the British House of Commons Select Committee on \n     Culture, Media and Sport is to be commended for examining the \n     issue of the disposition of the Parthenon Marbles in hearings \n     held in 2000;
