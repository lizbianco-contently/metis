Mr. President, I will yield myself up to 10 minutes to \nspeak in favor of going ahead with the motion for cloture on this bill.\n  This is the sixth week we have been on the energy bill on the Senate \nfloor. Today is the 22nd legislative day we have worked on the bill. We \nwill be voting this morning on cloture on the substitute amendment that \nwas first laid down on February 15. It was modified to its present form \non March 5.\n  Since then, we have had a great many amendments. We have acted on 84 \namendments to the substitute amendment. Of those 84 amendments, 68 were \nadopted, 9 were defeated or otherwise fell, and 7 were withdrawn.\n\n[[Page S3112]]\n\nSeven other amendments are currently pending on the bill.\n  One would think that dealing with 84 amendments on a bill would \nrepresent fairly good progress on a bill, and in many ways it does. We \nhave taken up almost all the major issues on the bill, and they have \nbeen disposed of with very few exceptions. I appreciate the help of \nSenator Murkowski and others who have been active in this debate, \ntrying to move this set of issues along and to move the legislation \nalong.\n  At the same time, we have had many days when Senators have not been \nwilling to come to the Chamber and offer amendments. We have had \nperiods when Senators have delayed votes on their amendments and been \nanxious to wait until conditions seemed more favorable before a vote \nwould occur on their amendments.\n  If we in fact were out of amendments, obviously that would be good \nnews. The truth is, yesterday at the time of the filing deadline that \nwas triggered by the cloture process, there were 115 additional \namendments filed. Some of those amendments are variations on earlier \namendments that have been filed. Some are variations on others that we \nunderstand can be handled. Clearly, we still have a substantial number \nof issues that Senators believe they need to have considered.\n\n  I am also disappointed that our efforts to get unanimous consent on a \nfinite list of amendments have been blocked. We have asked unanimous \nconsent several times on the Senate floor to get agreement, not on time \nlimits--we had never got to the stage where we were asking for time \nlimits--but first, before we asked for time limits on amendments, we \nwere trying to get a finite list of amendments. The effort to get that \nhas been blocked. Even adoption of amendments that both managers of the \nbill have been willing to clear has been a problem for us.\n  So we have not had, in my view, the cooperation we need to bring this \nbill to conclusion. We need to have that change quickly if we are going \nto continue on the bill and conclude action on it.\n  I know there is great concern as we approach this cloture vote about \nthe tax-related provisions. I strongly support those provisions, the \ntax incentive provisions that were voted out of the Finance Committee \non February 28. I supported those. I believe they are dramatically \nbetter than the tax-related provisions that were attached to the House-\npassed energy bill last year.\n  The argument was made yesterday that the Senate should now think of \nthis bill as some sort of omnibus tax bill. I think that would be a big \nmistake, for us to now look on this measure as the major tax bill of \nthe year and see this as an opportunity for all Senators to come and \noffer all sorts of provisions relating to taxes, particularly those \nthat do not relate to energy taxes. I think that would be a very major \nmistake.\n  This is not an omnibus tax bill. It is an energy bill. We need to \nbring debate on the bill to a close. I hope we can do so with tax \nprovisions included. I know the Senator from Montana has tried to get \nunanimous consent to do that. I support us doing that, having the \nprovisions coming out of the Finance Committee brought up, debated, and \nvoted on. But clearly we need to keep in context that this is not the \nmajor tax bill the Senate is going to consider in this Congress, and \ntherefore it should not be a vehicle for all sorts of non-energy-\nrelated tax proposals.\n  I compliment our majority leader, Senator Daschle, for the enormous \namount of floor time he has committed to trying to pass this bill. A \nlot of speeches have been made over the last several months implying \nthat our majority leader was not committed to moving an energy bill \nthrough this body.\n  His actions speak much louder than words and the rhetoric around \nhere. It is clear from his actions and committing 5 weeks of the \nSenate's time to this important issue that he is committed to trying to \nget an energy bill through the Senate.\n  I also appreciate the strong support that Senator Lott has been \nproviding in trying to move to cloture and move ahead with invoking \ncloture and completing action on the bill. I think that is very \nimportant as well.\n  Energy is a central policy concern in the Senate in this session. It \nis appropriately so. Our President has made it an agenda item for the \ncountry. Many of us have felt strongly that there are provisions in \nthis bill that should be enacted into law. I hope we can do so. If you \nexclude Mondays and Fridays from the calculation, we now have 15 \nworking and voting days between now and the Memorial Day recess. \nClearly, there is a limit as to how much of the Senate's time we can \ndevote to this very important issue.\n  I hope all Senators will support the effort to invoke cloture on the \nsubstitute amendment. Even if cloture is invoked, there are several \nhard fought battles still to be waged on particular amendments that \nhave been offered and that will remain germane.\n  I believe we have reached a point where further debate should be \nlimited to germane amendments. For that reason, I urge Senators to \nsupport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority controls 30 minutes. I do not \nknow if the minority wishes to use any of their time. It is my \nunderstanding that Senator Baucus wishes to give remarks in opposition \nto cloture. Is that true?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. At this point.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to yield 5 minutes to the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will suspend my statement at this time \nif someone else wishes to speak.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska wishes to speak on \na subject not related to cloture. I yield 5 minutes to him.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and \nfriend from Nevada for giving me this opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3112-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3112-S3113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, as we proceed with the \ndebate--and hopefully it will end with a cloture vote--on the renewable \nfuel standard in S. 517, it is important to clarify some of the main \nissues and to counter some of the misinformation that has been offered \nby opponents of ethanol and other biofuels and the RFS.\n  In today's New York Times, one of our colleagues is quoted as saying \nthat the renewable fuel standard may raise the cost of gasoline by 10 \ncents a gallon in New York. I am not sure how that number is achieved \ngiven the fact that the wholesale price of ethanol today in New York is \nabout 30 cents per gallon less than gasoline.\n  But it is frustrating. For 25 years, we have all worked to ward off \nthe negative arguments presented by some of the opponents. The \nopponents are determined to maintain control over the transportation \nfuels market by excluding ethanol, by excluding reformulated fuels, and \nby excluding new opportunities for renewable resources. Yet because the \nethanol industry is right for America and for our State, it has \nsurvived and expanded from essentially zero in 1977 to over 2 billion \ngallons a year capacity today.\n  It has taken sound public policy to achieve this strength and it will \ntake sound public policy to take the next leap forward in these days of \ndangerous and growing foreign oil dependency and mounting concerns \nabout the environment including climate change. The RFS is the next \nsound and critical policy leap forward to more than double biofuels \nproduction in the next 10 years.\n  In recent years, an enlightened sector of these industries ha \naccepted the benefits of ethanol blends. But the remaining and \ncommanding sectors stand steadfast in their opposition. Old data, \nnegative projections, and misinformation are their tools.\n  They have convinced some to actively embrace their campaign to \nmaintain a fossil-interest stranglehold on transportation fuels. For \nthese companies, national energy, economic and environmental security \nof the United States is not part of their global calculus as they \npursue their determined path against ethanol and other biofuels. These \nbiofuels are becoming an international force. If opponents\n\n[[Page S3113]]\n\ncan delay the United States in its embrace of the biorefinery concept, \nthey will succeed in sustaining the position and profitability of their \nindustry.\n  I will address the opponent's arguments issue by issue. It is my hope \nthat, ultimately, an objective and thoughtful overview will lead to \nacceptance of the Renewable Fuel Standard.\n  I would first like to stress the urgent needs for a ``Manhattan'' \ntype project to commercialize the biorefinery industry in the United \nStates. This industry will take agricultural and forestry crops and \nresidues, rights-of-way, park, yard and garden trimmings as well as the \nclean portion of municipal wastes that are disposal problems or end up \nin the our land fills or sewers and convert these renewable resources \ninto biofuels, biochemicals and bioelectricity.\n  Poster 1 shows existing ethanol plants in gold, plants under \nconstruction in green, and other biorefineries in the planning stage in \nred.\n  You can see that the dispersal of biorefineries will be nationwide, \nnot limited to the Midwest, and not limited to any location or region \nwithin our country.\n  Moving from planning to construction is largely contingent on \nimplementation of the RFS since capitalization will not proceed without \nan assured and profitable market for their outputs.\n  America needs a Manhattan-type project to accelerate this process and \nto ensure the development of smaller, fully integrated, community-based \nbiorefineries bringing new basic industries and quality jobs to rural \nand urban communities with ownership/partial ownership and value-added \nbenefits accruing to local people. The RFS is part of this approach \nbecause it expands the market for biofuels and provides a 1.5 credit \nfor cellulosic biomass ethanol and biodiesel compared to 1 credit for \ncorn-based ethanol; that is, each gallon of ethanol from cellulosic \nbiomass will be worth 1.5 gallons of corn-based ethanol. This extra \ncredit is an important driver in advancing technology so that \nCalifornia, New York, and other States can join the Midwest in \nbenefiting from new industries, better jobs, and improved incomes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's 5 minutes has \nexpired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, we hope the cloture vote will \nmove forward and that we will, in fact, pass the RFS.\n  Thank you very much.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have been in consultation with the \ndistinguished Republican leader and our terrific chair of the \ncommittee, as well as others, with regard to finding some procedural \narrangement to accommodate Senators and continue the effort to bring \nthis bill to a close.\n  I think we are making progress, but in order to accommodate further \ndiscussion, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote be postponed \nuntil 2:30.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the cloture vote has been suspended until \n2:30 this afternoon. I think that is very wise. There are a few \nprovisions that various Senators are trying to work out. I hope very \nmuch that they are worked out.\n  One of the big provisions is the Finance Committee-passed tax package \nwhich I believe members of the Finance Committee believe very much \nshould be part of this bill.\n  The Finance Committee has worked long and hard on tax provisions to \nhelp wean America from OPEC. They are not huge incentives, but on the \nmargin they will help a bit. They are divided roughly equally between \nconservation incentives on the one hand and production incentives on \nthe other. The conservation incentives are renewable energy provisions. \nFor example, they extend and modify what is called the section 45 \ncredit.\n  In addition, the alternative fuels and alternative-fuel vehicles \ncredit is to help America develop automobiles that are much more fuel \nefficient so we will consume fewer gallons of gasoline for every mile \ndriven. There are a lot of great ideas, whether hybrids or fuel cells, \nbut it is important to give those incentives.\n  There are also some conservation and energy-efficiency incentives for \nenergy efficiency in existing homes, for new home construction, a \ncredit for residential solar, for example, wind, fuel cell properties, \na credit for more efficient air-conditioners, water heaters, heat \npumps, and the list goes on. That is the conservation side. As I said, \nit is about half of the total package.\n  The tax incentives for 1 year total about $8 billion and over the \nlife of the bill--that is 10 years--$14 billion. Half of that, as I \nmentioned, is renewables and conservation. The other half is production \nincentives. The production incentives are for clean coal technologies. \nWe know we can utilize coal significantly in the future. It makes sense \nthat we use cleaner technologies so that there is less pollution. There \nare oil and gas conventional incentives as well as some electric \nindustry restructuring incentives.\n  I might say, for our Native Americans on Indian reservations, we have \nprovided accelerated depreciation and wage credit benefits for \nbusinesses that are on Indian reservations. This provision was thrashed \nout in committee. It passed out of the committee unanimously, albeit on \na voice vote.\n  I believe that, by and large, most Members of the Senate support--and \nsupport strongly--these provisions. They do help, on the margin, wean \nus a bit from our dependency on OPEC because they provide a little more \nself-sufficiency and have actual, honest to goodness provisions; that \nis, the myriad of conservation measures I mentioned.\n  I take my hat off to our leader Senator Daschle, to Senator Reid, and \nto Senator Lott for trying to figure out ways to put this together so \nwe can finally pass the energy bill. It is an almost impossible \nsituation. You have 100 Senators, each with a different point of view. \nBut as to the Finance Committee provisions, by and large, the President \nproposed many of them in his proposed energy tax package. Senator \nBingaman, chairman of the Energy Committee, has proposed energy tax \nincentives. Senator Murkowski has proposed energy tax incentives. That \nis some indication why we in the Finance Committee passed this measure \nout unanimously.\n  It is bipartisan by definition. It is broad based, but it is not \ngermane, obviously. That is why I hope we can get the agreement in some \nresponsible fashion to take up and pass the Finance Committee package \nin a posture so it will be included in the bill, that it is not \nexcluded perhaps because cloture is invoked, therefore making the \nprovision not germane.\n  It is a good provision, the Finance Committee package. I think it is \nalso important we pass it because there may be scoping issues in \nconference. I\n\n[[Page S3114]]\n\ncannot guarantee 100 percent, just because the House has about $30 \nbillion in tax incentives, that necessarily any provision the Senate \nhas in mind would be within the scope; it may not be.\n  Second, if we do not pass our energy tax incentive package, we will \nbe disadvantaged in negotiating with the House. The House will have \npassed $33 billion, the Senate zero. One can argue, look at what is in \nthe Finance Committee package, but I can tell you, having worked with \nthe chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in conference many times, \nI know what he is going to say. I know it is going to give him a leg \nup. It is going to give him an advantage. And it is going to make it \nmore different for us in the Senate to get provisions we want.\n  Third, that is no way to operate. The Finance Committee has done its \nbusiness. We had many hearings. We have had a markup. We have debated \nthese issues. We passed out our provision incentives to add, to \ncomplement--in fact, supplement--the underlying energy bill. We waited \nuntil the rest of the bill was about ready to pass to bring up our \npackage. I think it is only appropriate--in fact, it is for the good of \nthe country, definitely--that these provisions be included.\n  So with great respect I urge all my colleagues, in the next couple \nhours, to help all of us together, as 100 Senators, figure out a way we \ncan bring up and pass the Finance Committee tax incentives. They are \ngood. They are good for America--half conservation, half production. I \nthink it is basically by and large agreed to.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3114-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I have about only 5 minutes to speak \non an issue that is important for all of us in our country and in the \nworld. That is the Middle East. There is much to say, and 5 minutes is \njust a beginning.\n  We were not in session on Friday so today I will briefly present my \nanalysis of Secretary Powell's trip. There was a lot of discussion in \nsome of the media that Secretary Powell was unsuccessful in his \nendeavor. I actually choose to view his effort as but a first step. It \nis extremely important--I know the Chair believes as well--that our \nGovernment be engaged, even more so now.\n  Secretary Powell's trip was an important first step. There are now \ndiscussions under way, very tough discussions, about security measures. \nUltimately, the question is, how do we get from where we are right now \nto where we all hope we can be so that there can be peace for Israel \nand for her neighbors? That is the question. The emotion people feel, \nthe sentiment people feel, that I feel, that all of us feel, is very \nvivid.\n  When Israelis were murdered at a seder meal, as a first-generation \nAmerican of a Jewish immigrant who fled persecution from Russia, it \nsent chills down my spine. When I read about the rise of anti-Semitism \nin Europe, some of what has happened in France, the targeting of Jewish \nteenagers, the physical attacks, the hatred, it is frightening. Inside, \nyou feel the indignation, and you say to yourself: We will not let \npeople do this to Jews anywhere in the world.\n  I called Assistant Secretary Wolfowitz, who spoke at the rally, and \nsaid: We also have to be concerned about the loss of life of innocent \nPalestinians--not terrorists, innocent Palestinians. He is right. I \ncalled him and said: I believe, based upon my own background, when I \nthink about my mother and father, who are no longer here, what you said \nshould have been said. I think it was important to say that. It is a \nvery Jewish thing to say in terms of my sense of Jewish justice. I \ncan't imagine my mother and father not saying exactly the same.\n  I thank Secretary Powell for his trip. Clearly, it takes courage to \ndo what he did. He is out there. Frankly, he is doing the right thing. \nI believe now, however, we have to come forward with some very creative \npolitical ideas about how we can move to some kind of framework. It \nseems as if the present course will result in a deeper river of blood. \nHow can we get to some kind of a framework that makes some sense so \nthat we can get to where we want to get, which is people living in \ndignity side by side, with secure borders, and an end to the killing. \nThat is, how do we get there?\n  I wish I had the answer. Secretary Powell needs to go back. I don't \nknow whether he thinks I should be saying this in the Senate, but we \nwill need him to go back. Our government has to stay engaged in these \nnegotiations.\n  Over the next couple of days, I will try to talk about some of the \ndiscussions I have had with people about ways in which we can move to a \ndifferent framework--not the present course but a different course. It \nis terribly important. I am not naive about this. It is very \ncomplicated, and it is very difficult.\n  Since we were not in session Friday, I didn't want to let some of the \ninterpretation of Secretary Powell's work be the only interpretation. \nAgain, the emotion we feel and the indignation that many of us have is \nquite understandable. The real question is, how can we be constructive? \nWhat can we do gestaltwise that makes sense? What kind of proposals can \nwe propose that are credible, that somehow will result in a place and \ntime when Israel lives in peace and Israel's neighbors also live in \npeace. That is the question.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I want to take a moment to discuss where we are \ncurrently in the continued movement on the energy bill.\n  A cloture motion was filed last Thursday, and we are looking forward \nto moving forward on this bill. I know many Members have been somewhat \nfrustrated with the pace. We have been on the bill almost 6 weeks, not \ncontinually but certainly for the most part.\n  I know the majority leader is working in good faith, and I support \nhis efforts to move the bill forward in a timely manner, but I remind \nmy colleagues that we are on an extremely difficult and complex piece \nof legislation. We have divisive issues, and we have dealt with them as \nbest we could through a process of amendments.\n  Since the debate on this issue began, we have had 172 amendments--\nsome 60 Republican, 112 Democratic. We have dispensed with 92 \namendments--35 Republican, 57 Democratic. Most of the remaining \namendments are currently on the other side of the aisle, but that is \nneither here nor there. I am sure we can deal with them in a relatively \nshort timeframe.\n  Some of the more difficult amendments we have dealt with are: Whether \nCongress should decide on new vehicle standards or leave that \ndiscretion to the experts, specifically CAFE standards; whether \nCongress should impose a renewable portfolio standard on some\n\n[[Page S3115]]\n\nelectricity producers or leave the decision on appropriate renewable \nportfolio standards to the States; whether the Federal Government \nshould continue the liability and introduce protection on our nuclear \nplants; that is, Price-Anderson. I think the sustainability and \nexpansion of the nuclear industry certainly represents protection on \nthat particular issue of limiting the liability for the industry if we \nare ever going to get nuclear power generation in this country. \nFurther, how best to ensure reliability on our electricity grid--that \nwas the reliability issue and significant progress was made on that--\nand whether to create a renewable fuels requirement, ethanol.\n\n  Our work is not complete. There are still many significant issues to \nresolve. We need to close out the issues dealing with electricity. We \nneed to reach some agreement on the massive climate change provision in \nthe bill. We must address the tax provisions for renewables, \nconservation, alternative fuels, efficiency, and production. We need to \ndecide how best to increase our domestic production of energy sources \nsince there are no real production provisions in the substitute we have \nbefore us.\n  On the issue of supporting cloture, a vote in favor of cloture would \ncut off any opportunity to adopt a rational tax component on energy \nlegislation, which I believe is so important in this package--taxes \nthat would encourage the use of renewables, alternative fuels, increase \nour efficiency relative to conservation, increase our production of \nconventional fuels.\n  As far as oil is concerned, as this bill now stands, there is not one \nsingle provision that would increase our domestic production of oil \nbecause the tax package is not part of the bill at this time.\n  There are numerous studies and authorizations regarding oil \nproduction in title VI but no specific new production. As it stands \nnow, this measure, in my opinion, is neither balanced nor \ncomprehensive. In fact, many provisions in the legislation specifically \nexclude production of oil from the energy incentives.\n  The irony is that while there are provisions in the bill dealing with \nwind, solar, and biomass, these energy sources are not currently \nthreatened by events around the world. I know of no world leaders \ncalling for--or with the ability to--cutting off our wind supply or our \nSun, although Saddam Hussein may be up to it. In any event, we are at a \ntime when many in the Arab world are calling for using oil as a weapon \nagainst the United States.\n  We have seen today a release from Iraq where Saddam Hussein is quoted \nas indicating he will pay $25,000 for any of the Palestinians who may \nhave lost their homes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That comes \nafter a previous statement by Saddam Hussein about providing payment to \nthe survivors and family members of any of the individuals who saw fit \nto strap themselves with bombs and be used to initiate terrorist \nattacks associated with the issue in Israel, providing $25,000 to their \nfamilies. I think that clearly is an incentive that those of us in the \nWestern world find totally unacceptable and reprehensible.\n  As some in this Chamber may recall, on Thursday we passed, by a vote \nof 88 to 10, a sanction against Iraqi oil. The logic for that was the \nvery fact that Saddam Hussein had seen fit to foster terrorism by \nproviding incentives for human beings to be used as bombs in crowded \nareas. Furthermore, a justification for that deserves another \nreflection because we also saw several years ago sanctions against \nLibya, and the sanctions against Libya were justified because of \nterrorist attacks associated with the downing of the Pan Am flight over \nScotland. Previous to that, we had initiated sanctions against Iraq \nunder the same rationale. The attack on our U.S. Embassy in Iran is \nevidence of the country fostering terrorism.\n\n  So for anyone, including the administration, who might be critical of \nthe action taken by the Senate, I remind them there is a principle \ninvolved, as our President stated on numerous occasions, that we will \nnot stand by and let anyone or any country or any leader foster \nterrorism or use it as an incentive. That, clearly, is the case with \nSaddam Hussein. Hence, I think the action by the Senate last Thursday \nwas most appropriate in terminating any imports of oil from Iraq.\n  So as we recognize today, again, some in the Arab world are calling \nfor using oil as a weapon against this country. They do this at the \nsame time they use the hard currency revenues from our dependence on \ntheir oil to fund homicide bombers and state-supported terrorism.\n  We must protect ourselves, and the tax title in the bill would help \nto slightly rectify this by providing incentives for marginal oil \nproduction, and heavy oil production as well, which would decrease our \ndependence on imported oil.\n  In the area of natural gas, we do have a provision dealing with the \nAlaskan natural gas pipeline and the underlying provisions in the \ndevelopment of that gas. The majority has indicated they recognize this \nis a provision that would create somewhere in the area of 400,000 jobs. \nHowever, as it currently stands, the provision would not create one job \nif cloture is invoked.\n  So without any real economic security, the project, of course, may \nnot become a reality. I am sure we are all aware of this, but I \ncertainly cannot agree to have moved this position this far and not see \nit completed.\n  In the interest of moving forward--I know the majority leader wants \nto move forward, and the minority leader as well. I understand that \namendments involving the death and estate tax complicated the efforts. \nCertainly, cloture would end that provision. However, I think there is \na better way. I propose we try to enter into a unanimous consent \nagreement--I understand there has been a shot at it now--that would \nlimit the number of remaining amendments to be debated on energy-\nrelated amendments and limit that number by first-degree amendments. \nThese would be specific amendments so the issue of germaneness would \nnot come up.\n  If we are able to get such an agreement, I believe we could be off \nthis bill by the end of the week. I would certainly be willing to work \ntoward that end. Of course, it is not going to be an easy task. We \nstill have the divisive issues of climate change to deal with, but I \nthink it is possible to do that.\n  My purpose is to pledge my support to improve the legislation before \nus and get a bill to the President as soon as possible. I urge my \ncolleagues to recognize the weight of the task before us to push aside \nsome of the personal agendas and do what is right for the Nation, and \nthat is to adopt an energy policy as developed in this bill by an \namendment process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today marks, I believe, the 6th week \nduring which we have been debating the energy legislation that is \nbefore us. In my own view, among the bills we will debate and discuss \nand vote on this year in this Chamber, few, if any, are as or more \nimportant.\n  I am encouraged there is a growing likelihood we actually may vote on \ncloture and begin to reduce the scope of the amendments and the amount \nof time that remains for this critical debate, to get to final passage, \nand hopefully to enter a conference with the House and provide a \ncompromise the President can sign into law.\n  It is in our naked self-interest as a nation to finish our work and \nto do so with some dispatch. We have heard countless times about our \ngrowing dependence on foreign sources of oil, which is now approaching \n60 percent. We have heard concerns from a number of Members related to \nthe trade deficit our Nation continues to run, a trade deficit that \nexceeded $400 billion last year and roughly a third of which is \nattributable to the oil we import.\n  I will take the next few minutes and share one other reason why we \nshould feel a sense of urgency in passing this legislation and \nattempting to finalize a compromise with the House and the \nadministration. That deals with what is happening in the atmosphere of \nour Earth: global warming.\n  This past Saturday, in Wilmington, DE, the annual Commonwealth Awards \nwere bestowed upon a variety of some of the most famous, remarkable \npeople in the world. Among the people who received the Commonwealth \nthis past\n\n[[Page S3116]]\n\nweekend were a husband and wife team who are researchers who work out \nof Ohio State University in Columbus, OH. Their names are Dr. Lonnie \nThompson and Dr. Ellen Mosley-Thompson.\n  I ask unanimous consent the full statement of Calvert A. Morgan, who \npresided at that event, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Remarks of Calvert A. Morgan\n\n       The issue of global warming has been vigorously debated for \n     the past two decades. Is the climate on Earth getting \n     dangerously warmer, and if so, is modern-day air pollution to \n     blame? While many have exchanged rhetoric on the matter, two \n     American researchers have trekked to the world's remote ice \n     fields to dig for answers.\n       Dr. Lonnie Thompson and Dr. Ellen Mosley-Thompson are \n     husband-and-wife collaborators who study climate change and \n     global warming. They have spent the past 25 years collecting \n     and analyzing ice cores extracted from glaciers on the five \n     continents.\n       Their research has yielded a remarkable and priceless \n     archive of the earth's ancient climate.\n       What's more, their findings offer some of the most \n     convincing evidence yet that global warming is real, and \n     human activity is a contributing factor.\n       For their work in deciphering the Earth's frozen history \n     and its implications for our future, PNC honors these world-\n     class scientists with the 2002 Common Wealth Award for \n     Science and Invention.\n       The Thompsons conduct their work at the Byrd Polar Research \n     Center at Ohio State University.\n       Dr. Lonnie Thompson is a professor of geological sciences. \n     He has led some 40 international expeditions to collect ice \n     cores from the mountains of Africa, South America and Asia. \n     Dr. Mosley-Thompson is a professor of geography. She has led \n     similar field programs to Greenland and Antarctica.\n       To understand the earth's past and present climate, our \n     honorees and their research teams analyze the chemical and \n     physical properties preserved in ice cores.\n       Lonnie Thompson's research is unique because it focuses on \n     the ice fields of the tropics and sub-tropics instead of \n     polar ice. He believes the hottest part of the globe is \n     crucial to understanding global warming. Tropical glaciers, \n     he says, are ``the most sensitive spots on Earth'' and serve \n     as ``an indicator of the massive changes taking place'' in \n     today's global climate.\n       But to find ice in the tropics, you have to climb pretty \n     high. The physical and logistical challenges of this high-\n     altitude research are staggering. First, there's the climb to \n     a nearly inaccessible mountaintop with about six tons of \n     equipment in tow.\n       Once the team gets to the expedition site, the challenges \n     continue. Equipment maneuvers over crevasses, the danger of \n     avalanches, frigid temperatures, thin air and frequent \n     windstorms are all part of a day's work.\n       While six tons of equipment go up the mountain, 10 tons \n     come back down when you add four tons of ice samples. Dr. \n     Thompson has experimented with bringing the ice down in his \n     hot air balloon, the Soaring Penguin. Most often, however, \n     each core sample is carried by hand in an insulated box and \n     brought back to laboratories at Ohio State University for \n     analysis.\n       For our honorees, the thrill of discovery far outweighs the \n     occupational hazards. For instance, a 1,000-foot-long ice \n     core, drilled from the Tibetan Plateau, reveals China's \n     climate history for the last 130,000 years. An ice core \n     record of this length from the sub-topics is unprecedented.\n       New cores from two sites in central and southern Tibet \n     reveal that the past 50 years have been the warmest in the \n     last 10,000 years in that part of the world.\n       Using two decades of ice core data and aerial mapping, the \n     Thompsons offer proof that the world's tropical glaciers are \n     melting faster and faster as the years pass.\n       The icecap on Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak, has \n     lost 82 percent of its area since it was first mapped in \n     1912. One-third of the area has disappeared just since 1989.\n       Based on this dramatic evidence, Lonnie Thompson predicts \n     that the snow cap of this storied mountain will be gone by \n     2020. He says the same fate awaits other mountain ice caps in \n     Peru and around the world. These vanishing glaciers ``will \n     have a massive effect on humanity,'' he says, posing an \n     urgent natural and economic threat around the globe.\n       The Thompsons believe that it is already too late to save \n     the tropical glaciers. Now, they race against time, gathering \n     more core samples before Earth's frozen history is lost \n     forever.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in showing our esteem \n     to these dedicated and courageous scientist, Dr. Lonnie \n     Thompson and Dr. Ellen Mosley-Thompson, winners of the 2002 \n     Common Wealth Award for Science and Invention.\n\n  Mr. CARPER.

I think it is important that we remind ourselves of the \neconomic trouble we create for America by a growing trade deficit, a \nthird of which is attributable to our dependence on foreign oil, on \nimported oil.\n  Lost in this discussion are the points that Drs. Thompson have made, \nof which we were reminded in Delaware just this last Saturday; that is, \nthere is global warming. The climate of the Earth has changed and is \nchanging more rapidly as time goes by. Fully one-quarter of the carbon \ndioxide that we put into the air comes from the cars, trucks, and vans \nwe drive.\n  As we prepare to approach the end of this debate, I hope we will not \nonly have done something to reduce our reliance on foreign oil, not \nonly done something to reduce our growing trade deficit, but that we \nwill have taken affirmative steps to reduce the amount of carbon \ndioxide we are putting into our atmosphere, that literally is \ndestroying the icecaps of Mount Kilimanjaro and any number of other \nmountains throughout our tropics and subtropics.\n  I used to think global warming was a figment of somebody's \nimagination. I don't see how any of us anymore can say that is the \ncase. It is real. It is here. It is imminent. It is something we can do \nsomething about, and we need to do that in the context of this energy \nbill. I hope we will.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator from Delaware leaves the floor, I would \nlike to say, the Senator from Delaware and I came here from the House \nof Representatives together in 1982. The Senator has always been very \nstudious. What I mean by that is that legislation is something he \nreviews and studies and I am sure worries about. This legislation now \nbefore the Senate is no different.\n  The Senator from Delaware is concerned, as he has indicated, with the \nneed for an energy bill. We had a vote on an issue that is of extreme \nimportance to the country. It did not go the\n\n[[Page S3117]]\n\nway a lot of us believed it should. The Senator from Delaware is coming \nback at such time as I hope he can offer this amendment, with something \non which he has spent hours and days, coming up with something that is \nreasonable and will meet many of the goals that need to be met, \nallowing the United States to become less dependent on production.\n  I say to my friend from Delaware, I am very glad he is in the Senate. \nHe has brought to the Senate the same style that he had in the House of \nRepresentatives and, I am sure, to the office of Governor, although I \nam not as aware of his work as a two-term Governor of the State of \nDelaware. But he has brought, really, a fine dimension to the Senate. I \nam proud of the work he has done, as should be the people of Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. If the Senator will yield, I say to my friend, our \nassistant majority leader, those words mean more than you know. I have \nbeen called any number of things as Governor, as a Member of Congress, \nand as a Member of the Senate, and studious is one of the kinder and \nmore generous.\n  It is an honor to work with the Senator. I thank him for his \nleadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, throughout the morning we have \nattempted to find ways to move the process along. I thank a number of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle for their cooperation. We are at a \npoint now where procedurally I think we are in a position to move \nforward. We will make a unanimous consent request following this one \nhaving to do with amendments to the energy bill. But that is a separate \nmatter. This has primarily to do with the question of estate taxes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate considers Calendar No. \n33, H.R. 8, the estate tax bill, no later than June 28, the only \namendments in order are as follows:\n  Senator Gramm of Texas, an estate tax amendment; the majority leader, \nor his designee, an estate tax amendment which shall be subject to two \nsecond-degree amendments to be offered by Senator Daschle, or his \ndesignee, with Senator Daschle's amendment being the first one offered; \nthat all of the above amendments deal solely with the subject of estate \ntax; that all of the above estate tax amendments be subject to a 60-\nvote Budget Act point of order and that no other amendments or motions \nbe in order to the bill, except motions to waive the Budget Act; and \nthat if any of the above amendments, after each has had its motion to \nwaive vote, is adopted, the bill be read a third time and the Senate \nvote on final passage of the bill without any intervening action or \ndebate, and that if none of the amendments achieve 60 votes to waive \nthe Budget Act, the bill be placed back on the calendar; further, that \nthere be 2 hours for debate on each of the above amendments equally \ndivided in the usual form; further, that upon the granting of this \nconsent, Senator Baucus be recognized to offer the Baucus-Grassley \nFinance Committee tax amendment to the energy bill, and that the \namendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, without any intervening action or debate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, let me just say, it is the intention of \nSenator Lott and me to offer the unanimous consent request shortly \nwhich would make in order a number of amendments pertaining to the \nenergy bill that, hopefully, will bring us to closure.\n  What we have done in this case is simply agree to a debate on the \nestate tax legislation sometime prior to June 28. Senators will have an \nopportunity to debate the estate tax bill. I know there is a great deal \nof interest on both sides of the aisle.\n  We will also now entertain the Baucus amendment as it relates to the \ntax provisions of the energy bill. All Senators, of course, still \nretain their right to offer amendments on taxes prior to cloture.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and thank all of my colleagues for \ntheir cooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3117-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3117-S3120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL LABORATORIES PARTNERSHIP IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3286 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n              (Purpose: To provide energy tax incentives)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the pending \namendments are set aside.\n  The clerk will report the Baucus amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for himself, Mr. \n     Grassley, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Hagel, \n     and Mrs. Carnahan, proposes an amendment numbered 3286.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this amendment consists of the energy \ntax incentives reported by the Finance Committee.\n  Let me explain why this amendment is necessary.\n  The short term energy crisis has ended. But the long term problem has \nnot.\n\n[[Page S3118]]\n\n  Earlier this year, at a House hearing, Energy Secretary Abraham \nsummed up the energy situation. He said that ``Over the last 12 months \nwe have seen energy supply shortages, natural gas and gasoline price \nspikes in the Midwest and California, and terrorist attacks within our \nborders.''\n  He was right on target. His words emphasize that energy independence \nmatters. It matters to our economy, to our national security, and to \nthe well-being of average American families.\n  Take one example. Gas prices.\n  Remember last summer. The price was $1.70 per gallon. A record high.\n  Just 6 weeks ago, the national average retail price for gasoline was \n$1.14 per gallon.\n  Since then, gas prices have climbed again. Today, the national \naverage price is back up to $1.42 per gallon.\n  Over the past several years, prices have been extremely volatile.\n  This volatility has had a sharp economic effect, disrupting \nbusinesses and lives.\n  Here is why. The difference between $1.14 per gallon and $1.70 per \ngallon is 56 cents per gallon.\n  The average household uses about 1,100 gallons of automobile gasoline \na year. All else being equal, that amounts to a swing in household fuel \nexpenditures of more than $600, just for transportation.\n  That is like a $600 tax increase, on every American family.\n  For a small business, the economic impact of these price swings can \nbe even worse.\n  And the situation is not likely to improve anytime soon.\n  Between now and 2020, worldwide demand for oil is projected to \nincrease from 76 million barrels a day to nearly 120 million barrels \nper day. That's an increase of almost 60 percent.\n  Clearly, the more we depend on only one source of energy, the more we \nare subject to price fluctuations.\n  With that background, let's turn to the legislation.\n  The chairman of the Energy Committee, Senator Bingaman, has designed \nthe underlying energy legislation that is the basis for our energy \npolicy.\n  Now why should tax incentives be part of the bill?\n  The use of tax incentives to promote energy development is not some \nradical new idea. From the time of the enactment of the income tax in \n1916, we have had tax incentives for the production of oil and gas.\n  In 1978, we went further. We created the first tax incentives for \nrenewable fuels and for conservation.\n  These incentives were effective. Last July, at a Finance Committee \nhearing, economist Kevin Hassett told the committee that the tax \ncredits ``were fairly successful at stimulating conservation \nactivity.'' More specifically, he found that ``a 10 percentage point \ncredit would likely increase the probability of investing [in \nconservation] by about 24 percent.''\n  The Finance Committee amendment takes this experience to heart. We \nuse targeted tax incentives to promote investments that are critical to \nenergy independence.\n  We do this in three important ways. First, we create incentives for \nnew production, especially production from important renewable sources.\n  Second, we create incentives for the development of new technology.\n  Third, we create incentives for energy conservation.\n  Let me explain each in turn.\n  First, new production. Regardless of the source, total U.S. energy \nproduction directly affects our dependence on foreign sources of \nenergy.\n  If U.S. production rises, while consumption remains constant or \nfalls, we become less reliant on foreign energy. Unfortunately, the \nopposite is expected to occur.\n  Through 2020, energy consumption is projected to increase more \nrapidly than domestic production. If that happens, our reliance on \nforeign energy--shown on the chart as ``net imports'' of energy--will \nincrease accordingly.\n  Here is how we address the problem.\n  We extend the wind and biomass credit for an additional 5 years. We \nalso qualify many more sources as renewable fuel sources, including \ngeothermal, solar, plant life, and other sources.\n  We create incentives for clean coal. If you retrofit to use currently \navailable clean coal technology, you are eligible for a production tax \ncredit. If you use advanced technology, you're eligible for both an \ninvestment credit and a production credit.\n  We create a new credit for oil and gas production from marginal \nwells, and a limited tax break for geological and geophysical \nexpenditures.\n  Each of these tax incentives will encourage more energy production, \nfrom a variety of renewable and traditional sources.\n  Let me turn to the second key element of the bill. New technology.\n  Think big. Thing new. Think way into the future.\n  New technology can bring both energy independence and a cleaner \nenvironment.\n  Before long, our cars and trucks will run on electricity, new and \nalternative fuels, and fuel cells. And maybe someday, when we get home \nfrom work, we'll plug our fuel cell automobiles in to generate the \nelectricity for our homes.\n  But we need to make investments in these technologies today. History \ntells us it can take a very long time to deploy new technology. The \nfirst commercial telephone service was offered in 1876, but it took \nmore than 90 years to make the service available to 90 percent of \nresidences in the United States.\n  It would be a shame if it takes half that time to bring these \npromising new technology vehicles to market.\n  So here is what we do.\n  We create tax credits for the purchase of new technology vehicles. \nThese vehicles of the future. They'll be powered by alternative fuels, \nby fuel cells, and by electricity.\n  In the near term, we provide tax credits for the purchase of hybrid \nvehicles, which run partly on electricity and partly on gasoline.\n  What is so great about these vehicles?\n  For starters, fuel cell and electric vehicles are zero-emissions \nvehicles. In the meantime, hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles can \nspeed us toward the development of these zero emissions vehicles.\n  On top of that, when it comes to emissions and fuel economy, these \nvehicles have significant advantages compared to traditional fuel \nvehicles.\n  To make sure of this, we provide tax credits only to vehicles that \nmeet very stringent emissions standards.\n  There's a related point. New vehicles require new fuels. And it takes \nnew infrastructure to deliver these fuels. Therefore, we provide tax \nincentives for the installation of new refueling station technology and \nfor the purchase of alternative fuels.\n  All told, these investments in new technology will transform \nautomotive transportation in the United States, so that it is cleaner, \nmore fuel efficient, and less reliant on imported oil.\n  The third key element of the bill is conservation.\n  Conservation is the only way to solve the problem of excessive \ndependence on foreign imports. When we increase conservation, it has \nthe same effect as if we reduce consumption. We see that this will \nlessen our reliance on foreign sources of energy.\n  Conservation also will have positive environmental effects. Namely, \ncleaner aid.\n  Perhaps most important, tax investments in energy conservation will \nreduce monthly energy bills.\n  How do we accomplish this?\n  We create incentives for people to get more complete energy \nconsumption information with devices like the smart meter, which allows \npeople to track energy use in their homes.\n  We create incentives for people to buy energy efficient \nrefrigerators, air conditioners, and other appliances.\n  And we encourage energy efficient construction, to make homes and \ncommercial buildings more energy efficient.\n  Those are the three key elements of the bill. New production, new \ntechnology, and conservation.\n  We also address several other issues. Perhaps the most important is \nelectric utility restructuring. This is important for investor owned \nutilities, municipal utilities, and cooperatives. And, of course, for \nconsumers.\n  But there is a lot of uncertainty. We all remember the rolling \nblackouts in California. Many other states also have been affected. In \nMontana, the legislature has had to delay the implementation of a law \ncalling for retail choice, because the state does not yet have a \ncompetitive market in place.\n\n[[Page S3119]]\n\n  There is similar uncertainty in other states and nationwide.\n  To my mind, we don't yet know what a restructured electric industry \nwill look like.\n  In light of this, the amendment tells the Treasury Department to \nreport back to us by the end of the year on restructuring and the tax \nissues it raises. The study will help us make the right decisions to \naddress future issues raised by restructuring.\n  Senators Bingaman and Murkowski may wish to go further, as part of \nthis bill, and Senator Grassley and I are discussing options with them \nnow.\n  At the same time, there are some current problems, that we do know \nhow to address.\n  The amendment does so with respect to nuclear decommissioning funds \nand the treatment of cooperatives.\n  Before closing, I'd like to acknowledge all of those who helped write \nthe Finance Committee bill.\n  The President's budget called for tax incentives for renewable \nresources, residential solar systems, alternative fuel vehicles, and \ncombined head and power systems.\n  Those are included.\n  Our committee members have also made very important contributions.\n  Our ranking member, Senator Grassley, has worked hard to make this a \nbalanced, bipartisan bill.\n  Senator Hatch and others were the principal authors of the \nalternative fuels provisions.\n  Senator Rockefeller was the principal author of the clean coal \nprovisions. Other Members were responsible for other important \nprovisions.\n  I also appreciate the help of the leaders of the Energy Committee, \nSenators Bingaman and Murkowski. We are lucky that they also are \nmembers of the Finance Committee, and we benefited from their expertise \nand dedication.\n  In other words, this has been a cooperative effort, all around.\n  Pulling this together, we have a package of tax incentives that are \nimportant in their own right and that will complement the broader \nenergy bill.\n  In short, this amendment is good environmental policy and good energy \npolicy.\n  Don't get me wrong. This bill is not a panacea. It is a work in \nprogress. It is just a step. But it is a good step. A step in the right \ndirection.\n  I thank members and urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.\n  The amendment (No. 3286) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, may I ask the Senator from Montana, \nmy understanding is that there is going to be a managers' amendment out \nof the Finance Committee on the energy tax aspect.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct. Given the posture we are in, I \nassume procedurally that is available at this time. But that is an \nassumption. I am not positive. That is an assumption. If procedurally \nthat is available, the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Well, I would like to have some assurance that we will \nhave an opportunity for input in the managers' amendment before I would \nagree to a unanimous consent which I assume will be forthcoming. The \nSenator from Montana has not proposed a unanimous consent, he has just \nproposed this; is that correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In answer to the Senator, the Finance Committee tax \nincentives are now part of the energy bill. The Senate has adopted \nthem. They are in the bill now. I am not at this point attempting to \nseek a UC request.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Well, it would be my hope we could work to----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I understand. I have been working with the Senator and \nwith the distinguished chairman of the committee to try to figure out \nwhat appropriately could be put in that package.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It would appear, Madam President, it would be a \ncombination of either specifically identified amendments that could be \nagreed upon or we would have to address the issue of germaneness. If I \nhave the assurance of the chairman of the Finance Committee that he is \nwilling to work with us on that aspect, I would be satisfied.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, might I inquire of the Senator from \nMontana, it is the Senator's intention that the Finance Committee \nversion--not a modified version of that--be offered for inclusion in \nthe underlying bill; is that correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to my good friend, the Senate has already adopted \nthe measure that passed the Finance Committee. That is now an adopted \namendment and now part of the energy bill.\n  Mr. KYL. The reason I ask is, there was some confusion at the desk as \nto which version the Senator was offering.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. Since there was not an amendment pending at the desk.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The two versions at the desk were identical.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I want to just announce that we will be \noffering a unanimous consent request shortly that would propose that we \nlimit the number of amendments to be taken post cloture to a certain \nnumber. I believe we are going to suggest seven on a side. But let me \nsay, with or without that unanimous consent request, post cloture, \nSenators would still be eligible to offer amendments having to do with \ncertain tax provisions or any other provisions of the bill.\n  What we are simply trying to do is to find a way, at long last, to \nbring this bill to closure. I remind my colleagues that I laid this \nbill down on February 15. It is now April 23, and the only way we are \ngoing to bring this to conclusion so that we can move to other \nlegislation is to either get this unanimous consent request that \nSenator Lott and I are about to propound or cloture.\n  So I ask my colleagues for their cooperation in this regard. And \nfailing the unanimous consent, as my colleagues may note, I have moved \nthe cloture vote to 2:30 this afternoon. So one or the other will \noccur. Either we will get a UC or we will have a vote on cloture at \n2:30 this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I appreciate the work we have been able to \ndo to try to get a reasonable agreement as to how to proceed on the \ndeath tax matter. I think the agreement just entered is fair to all \nsides.\n  Also, I think it is very important that we have the tax section as a \npart of our energy package, when it is completed, because many of the \nimportant incentives to get more production and to find alternative \nfuels and develop new technologies--whether it is hybrid cells or \nwhatever it may be--are in that section. We have almost $15 billion \nthat came out of the Finance Committee unanimously, as I recall. So \nthat needed to be included. The fact that it is included is a very \nimportant recognition that work has been done by Senator Grassley, \nSenator Baucus, and others.\n  With regard to the unanimous consent request we are going to propound \nto limit the number of amendments and get to passage by a time certain, \nI also think that is the right thing to do. There may be many \namendments that are out there, but we could not get an agreed-to \nnumber. I know we can accept a limited number of five or seven, \nwhatever that number may be. Also, we are prepared to make a commitment \nto get final passage on this legislation no later than Thursday at 6 \no'clock. I think that is the responsible thing to do. I support that. \nAnd Senator Daschle and I have been working for the last 24 hours to \ntry to come to that agreement.\n  It is time we bring consideration of this bill to a conclusion. We \nhave had a full debate, lots of amendments. I am sure nobody is \nperfectly happy with it, but to have expended over 5 weeks and then not \nbe able to bring this to conclusion, would be disastrous for our \ncountry, and the Senate would look very bad.\n  So I hope we come to an agreement on how to get a vote on this \nlegislation, complete action, and send it to conference for final \nactivity.\n\n[[Page S3120]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor, Madam President, and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, yesterday was the 1:30 p.m. filing \ndeadline. The Baucus-Grassley amendment was not part of the substitute \nthen so people couldn't draft amendments to that section. To be fair, I \nask unanimous consent that Members have until 1 p.m. tomorrow to file \nfirst-degree amendments to the Baucus-Grassley title and that Members \nhave until 10 a.m. Thursday to file possible second-degree amendments \nto those amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I have noted on a couple of occasions \nthis morning that it was our intention, in close consultation with the \ndistinguished Republican leader, to see if we might find a way to bring \nclosure to the bill, either with or without cloture. But I ask \nunanimous consent that immediately following cloture, notwithstanding \nthe cloture vote, and notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the \nSenate resume consideration of the energy bill with the opportunity of \neach leader or his designee to offer seven amendments which are either \nenergy or tax related.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nwant to say again, this is the right way to proceed. We have been on \nthis legislation for 5 weeks. We have had a full debate. Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle have had opportunities to offer their \namendments. This will give us seven more opportunities on each side. We \nwill have to get a limit. We will have to have a process, which will \nnot be easy for either one of us. But we have discussed this in our \ncaucus. We are prepared to accept the limitation. This would also be \nthe process that would get us to a conclusion by, I believe, Thursday \nor Friday, at the latest, of this week.\n  I support this initiative, and it is a bipartisan effort. I thank \nSenator Daschle for making the request. I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I \nwould like to ask the majority leader if three amendments would be \nconsidered among his amendments. The first would be Senator Schumer's \namendment to remove the ethanol mandate, the renewable fuels mandate \nfrom the bill; second would be Senator Boxer's amendment to remove the \nsafe harbor provisions relating to liability; and the third would be my \namendment to remove PADDs I and PADDs V from the renewable fuels \nrequirement.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I certainly want to work with the \ndistinguished Senator from California to accommodate her and other \nSenators who wish to be heard on the ethanol question. I know this is a \nvery important matter for them. At this point, I would not be able to \nconfirm that three of those seven amendments would be related to \nethanol, although I would not want to assume that they would not be \npart of it.\n  I think we would want to negotiate with all of our colleagues to \naccommodate as many Senators with an interest in offering amendments as \npossible. Keep in mind, as I said earlier, this is in addition to, \ncloture notwithstanding. Those amendments that are eligible to be \noffered postcloture, we anticipate they would still be offered. It \ncould be, and I would guess most likely would be, the case that one or \nmore of those amendments would be able to be offered without the \ninclusion in this unanimous consent request.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. In response to the majority leader, if I may, Madam \nPresident, we do not know at this time whether they would all be \ngermane under the bill. Based on the fact that the majority leader is \nonly reserving seven spaces and will not permit three spaces for this, \nI object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I had a commitment to offer an \namendment to the energy bill dealing with the right of the Eskimo \npeople of Alaska to proceed with oil and gas development on their \nlands. This weekend I conferred with them and their representatives, \nand they would prefer not to raise that issue at this time and to allow \nthe process to go forward in terms of the energy bill and in terms of \ntheir rights which they may wish to raise at another time but do not \nwish to have me raise at this time.\n  Under the circumstances, I want the manager of the bill to know we \nwill not offer the amendment that would permit drilling on the lands in \nthe Kaktovik area that are owned by the Kaktovik Eskimos, and the \nsubsurface rights owned by the North Slope Borough. I believe the \ndecision is a right one, and I am going to honor their request not to \nintroduce the amendment at this time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this is an amendment on which we have had \nsome discussion. It is the amendment to strike the ethanol mandate, the \nethanol gas tax, from the energy bill.\n  Once again, I want to let my colleagues know how much I understand \nthose who are for this amendment, their desire to do it, and I \nparticularly want to let people know how much I respect our majority \nleader, Tom Daschle, and how painful it is for me to oppose him on \nsomething about which I know he cares very much.\n  He is a principled, compassionate, and an extraordinary public \nservant. He is a friend to the people of my State and the whole \ncountry, and I thought long and hard about this but felt compelled to \nspeak out about it.\n  The ethanol mandate in this bill is something we have not seen in \nmany years. It is one of those provisions that sort of starts out \nquietly, sometimes passes this body and the other body, and becomes \nlaw. There are these types of provisions that come up every so often \nwithout much debate, and then a year or two later there is an outcry in \nthe Nation. We all come back and say to one another: How the heck did \nthis thing pass? How did it pass with so little debate? How did it pass \nwith such detrimental requirements to such a large percentage of our \npopulation?\n  It happened on the catastrophic illness bill about 10 years ago. It \nhappened on the S bill about 20 years ago when we allowed S to \ntake people's hard-earned money and invest it in almost anything they \nwanted. Each of these amendments, as this one, has the potential to \nsort of breeze right through the legislative process, be signed into \nlaw because it seems all the special interests that want it are lined \nup behind it, and only after it becomes law is there a public outcry. I \nbelieve that will happen with this amendment, and I ask my colleagues \nto be very careful before they vote for it because what this mandate \nprovision does, above all, by requiring that every State use ethanol or \nbuy ethanol credits for their gasoline, whether they need it or not, is \nit will raise gasoline prices. It is like a gas tax in every State of \nthe Union, a minimum of 4 cents to 10 cents, and probably at certain \ntimes much more than that.\n  If we look at the States, those on the east coast and the west coast \nare more affected--I have a chart with maps--and even States in the \nheartland will be affected as well.\n\n  Why are we doing this? We know we want to keep the air clean, but the \nrefiners tell us ethanol is not the only way to proceed. Many \nenvironmental leaders say ethanol is at best a neutral proposition; it \nsometimes will reduce carbon in the air but will increase smog. At the \nsame time, we are saying as to those additives that cause trouble and \nmight pollute the ground, you cannot sue those who put them there.\n  This provision is a combination. It is almost a bewitching brew of \ncats and dogs that leads to trouble for the American people.\n  I have gone over in my previous talks what this amendment does and \nwhy it has come about, but let me say that every one of us wants to see \nthe air clean, every one of us wants to see no backsliding in the clean \nair provisions, and every one of us believes there are a number of ways \nto do it. In some States in the Middle West, ethanol is probably the \nbest way to do it, but in many States on the coasts, in the heartland, \nand in the Rocky Mountain areas, ethanol is more expensive, less \nenvironmentally useful, and a needless mandate.\n  Let me again read the names of some of the States where the price of \ngasoline will go up a lot. This is a study that is conservative and \nthat does not deal with spikes. In Arizona, it will go up 7.6 cents; in \nCalifornia, 9.6 cents; in Connecticut, 9.7 cents; Delaware, 9.7; \nIllinois, 7.3; Kentucky, 5.4; Maryland, 9.1 cents; Massachusetts, 9.7 \ncents; Missouri, 5.6 cents; New Hampshire, 8.4 cents; New Jersey, 9.1 \ncents; New York, 7.1 cents; Pennsylvania, 5.5 cents; Rhode Island, 9.7 \ncents; Texas, 5.7 cents; Virginia, 7.2 cents; Wisconsin, 5.5 cents; and \nin all the other States it goes up 4 cents.\n  Some of our colleagues say this is necessary in the Middle West. They \ntried to pass a mandate in Nebraska and in Iowa. In both cases it was \ndefeated. The legislative bodies of those States, which will do a lot \nbetter under ethanol mandates than New York, California, Texas or \nFlorida, defeated it, and yet we have the temerity to impose it on \nevery State in the Union.\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side advocate free market \npolicies. I have rarely seen a greater deviation from free market \npolicies than this proposal. As somebody said to me, first the \nGovernment subsidizes ethanol and then mandates that everybody use it. \nThat sounds more like something out of the Soviet Union than out of the \nUnited States of America.\n  I, too, want to help corn farmers, and my voting record shows it, but \nthis is going to be trickle down for the farmers. As we have mentioned \nbefore, Archer Daniels Midland controls 41 percent of the ethanol \nmarket. If the mandate is tripled, which is what we do, there will be \nprice spikes and somebody with monopoly power--as has Archer Daniels \nMidland or Coke--will be able to raise the prices through the roof. \nRemember the California electricity crisis where someone had a virtual \nmonopoly on a necessity? They raised the price. That is what is going \nto happen if we pass this ethanol mandate.\n  I am going to yield for a few minutes and let my colleague from \nCalifornia join in. But the bottom line is simple: There are better \nways to clean the air for most parts of the country. This is expensive, \nit is a mandate, it will raise our gasoline prices, and it is so \nantithetical to free market policies, I find it hard to believe we are \ngoing to pass it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment of \nSenator Schumer, which is to remove the so-called renewable fuels part \nof the energy bill.\n  I am a member of the Energy Committee. You can imagine my \nconsternation when I find a bill that is put together in the dark of \nnight with this renewable fuels requirement that has had no hearing, no \ncomment, no opportunity for the Energy Committee to take a good look at \nit.\n  This is a bill that adds to a subsidy of 53 cents a gallon on ethanol \nunder existing law, it mandates a tripling of the\n\n[[Page S3123]]\n\nethanol use in the next 10 years throughout the Nation, this is in \naddition to protective tariffs of 54 cents a gallon in existing law, so \nno nation that might be able to produce it more cheaply has no chance \nof exporting it economically into the United States. It is protect, \nprotect, protect.\n  It has been said that this is a massive transfer of wealth out of \nsome States into other States. I deeply believe all of that is true.\n  Only 1.77 billion gallons of ethanol were produced in 2001. The \nSenate bill requires 5 billion gallons by 2012. Alone, California, the \nlargest State in the Union, is forced to use 2.68 billion gallons of \nethanol it does not need. It doesn't need this ethanol to clean the air \nbecause California has reformulated fuel and can meet the clean air \nstandards at all times except for winter months in the southern \nCalifornia-Los Angeles market. Then it uses ethanol.\n  This chart very clearly indicates the situation. I have shown this \nbefore. Here, the blue is what my State would use of ethanol to meet \nclean air standards. This is what this mandate requires that the State \neither use or pay for. That is not good public policy. It is not good \npublic policy because the State doesn't need it.\n  Additionally, the California Energy Commission has said this action \nwill create a 5-percent to 10-percent shortfall in California's \ngasoline--a 5-percent to 10-percent shortfall.\n  Our refiners are at 98 percent of capacity, so how do we refine \nenough gasoline to meet the need? We do not. This means a gas tax.\n  It is estimated by some that it could even lead to gas prices of $4 \nper gallon. Senator Schumer has said it is 10 cents a gallon additional \nfor California, New York and other States. If you put two tankfuls in \nyour car a week, figure out what that costs in terms of an additional \ntax that every motorist will be paying.\n  Since 98 percent of the ethanol production is based in the Midwest, \nStates outside the Corn Belt have severe infrastructure and ethanol \nsupply problems. This is the reason we do: You cannot put ethanol in a \npipeline. You have to barge it, truck it, or rail it in. We will have \nto rail in 2.68 billion gallons of ethanol that California does not \nneed. The infrastructure is not presently there for it.\n  We have talked about the high market concentration, the fact that one \ncompany controls 41 percent of the ethanol production and that eight \ncompanies together control 71 percent. Some articles have been written \nsaid this is what creates a massive transfer of wealth: 70 percent of \nthe dividends in this package go to the ethanol producers; only 30 \npercent go to the actual corn farmers.\n  Ethanol also has a mixed environmental impact. Let me tell you why. \nEthanol helps retard carbon monoxide, but ethanol also produces more \nnitrogen oxide emissions. So the NOX, which produces smog \npollution, is actually greater as a product of ethanol.\n\n  In a State like California that has been very concerned about \npollution, this is only going to do one thing: it is going to increase \nsmog in the State of California.\n  Additionally, ethanol enables the separation of the components of \ngasoline; therefore, benzene, for example, which is in gasoline and \nwhich is carcinogenic, can separate from gasoline. So if there is a \nleak, then benzene is one of the additives that leaks. All of the \nreports say it enables gasoline leaks to travel farther and faster, \nonce it is released.\n  Important in all of this to those of us who care about transit and \nhighway funding is something that is really interesting. We presently \nput into the Highway Trust Fund about 18 cents a gallon. Since ethanol \nis only taxed at 13 cents a gallon the Highway Trust Fund will lose at \nleast $7 billion. So this lessens the highway trust fund for everybody \nwho looks to that fund for dollars for buses, for dollars for highways, \nfor dollars for transportation systems. There will be at least $7 \nbillion less according to CRS.\n  Let me read what the boilermakers say about that. The International \nUnion of Boilermakers have written:\n\n       Simply put, for each $1 billion the Trust Fund loses, \n     America loses almost 42,000 jobs. . . . And that is a \n     resource we cannot renew. It is our understanding that by \n     mandating the use of ethanol, this legislation is encouraging \n     the market penetration of ethanol, undermining America's \n     infrastructure and America's environment.\n\n  The bottom line in this letter is that this ethanol mandate is a \ndangerous approach and is going to result in dramatic job loss.\n  Also, ethanol is not necessarily a renewable fuel, despite what \neveryone says. There are a number of scientific reports that have found \nit takes more energy to make ethanol than it saves. It actually takes \n70 percent more energy to produce ethanol than it saves.\n  So the bottom line is that this is a bad deal. This deal is even made \nworse by the fact that despite these environmental considerations, \nnobody will be able to sue. There is a safe harbor provision, so no one \ncan sue if the environment is damaged or the public health is damaged.\n\n  Here we have a bill that on top of the ethanol subsidies, it cuts the \nhighway trust fund, it mandates an increase in the gas tax, and it \nbenefits mainly producers in the Midwest. It is, in my view, a bad \naddition to this energy bill. Frankly, I think it is so bad that I am \nvery pleased to support Senator Schumer's amendment which would remove \nthis renewable fuels requirement from the bill, permit an oxygenate \nwaiver but remove the ethanol from the bill.\n  I don't quite know how we defeat this. I wish to read from a Wall \nStreet Journal editorial that ran last week:\n\n       If consumers think the federal gas tax is ugly, this new \n     ethanol tax will give them shudders. Moving ethanol to places \n     outside the Midwest involves big shipping fees, or building \n     new capacity. Refiners also face costs in adding ethanol to \n     their products. According to independent consultant Hart \n     Downstream Energy Services, the mandate would cost consumers \n     an extra annual $8.4 billion at the pump the first 5 years. \n     New York and California would see gas prices rise by 7 cents \n     to 10 cents a gallon. . . .\n       And that doesn't take into account inevitable price spikes. \n     There simply isn't enough corn in all of Iowa to meet new \n     ethanol demands. Last year the ethanol industry produced only \n     1.7 billion gallons. The Daschle mandate would require it to \n     increase production by more than 35 percent in a mere 3 \n     years.\n       That is a tall order for any industry, much less one that \n     relies on Mother Nature. Some estimates are that a shortage \n     could double gas prices.\n\n  Why are we doing this? Why does this bill have to be so greedy? Why \ndoes it need to triple ethanol use? Nobody really knows what it does to \nthe environment. Why triple it? How is a good energy bill going to be \nviewed, if it triples something about which there is great uncertainty \nand many States don't need to use it? The west coast and the east coast \ndon't have the infrastructure to absorb it, let alone a $7 billion cut \nin the highway trust fund.\n  Cut the highway trust fund and Californians are forced to pay higher \ngas taxes, and have less money to build the roads, highways, and \ntransportation systems they need, let alone cut 300,000 jobs \nnationwide.\n  I will admit that the ethanol lobby is a tough lobby. About a year \nago, I was trying to negotiate in my office. I invited most of the \nCalifornia refiners, oil companies, the corn growers, and the renewable \nfuels associations. I thought we had worked out something. Then, the \nrenewable fuels people backed off the table. Now they come back greedy.\n  What they have done--and let us call a spade a spade--is essentially \nquieted the refineries by promising them in this bill protection \nagainst liability, so that nobody can sue an oil company if the ethanol \ncauses gasoline to separate, as it does, and benzene leaks, and people \nare adversely impacted. They cannot sue. The gasoline companies--\nbecause they told me this--wanted this protection against liability. If \nthey had the protection against liability, they would reluctantly \ngo along with this package.\n\n  That is not good energy policy. How is it good energy policy to \ntriple something that has mixed environmental impact, at best? How is \nit good energy policy to increase gas prices? How is it good energy \npolicy to take $7 billion out of the highway trust fund, cost 300,000 \njobs, and cut funding to the transportation system, the highways, and \nthe roads that this country needs? How is that good energy policy?\n  To mandate a tripling of the fuel, then saying they are credits, but \nif you do not use them, you pay for them. This is on top of \nfundamentally protecting the Midwest corn industry by\n\n[[Page S3124]]\n\nputting a 54-cent-a-gallon tariff on any imported ethanol to keep it \nout of the country because it might cost the motorists less, how is \nthat good energy policy?\n  Somebody come and tell me.\n  California would top the list in the amount of transit dollars lost \nbecause of the ethanol mandate. Maybe nobody cares about California, \nbut Senator Boxer and I do.\n  I would like to reference an article that mentions the big losers.\n  California is a big loser. It loses $905 million from the highway \ntrust fund over 9 years.\n  Texas is a big loser. It loses $750 million from the highway trust \nfund.\n  New York is a big loser. It loses $493 million that could be used for \nsubways, for buses, and for transit systems.\n  Pennsylvania is a big loser. It loses $446 million.\n  Florida is a big loser. It loses $436 million from the highway trust \nfund.\n  Illinois: $337 million from the highway trust fund.\n  Ohio: $336 million from the highway trust fund.\n  Georgia: $333 million from the highway trust fund.\n  Michigan: $312 million from the Highway Trust Fund.\n  And New Jersey, the last State that is a big loser, loses $262 \nmillion from the highway trust fund.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question, \nthe Senator is saying that in those States we are going to charge the \nmotorists more, but at the same time, because all roads lead to \nethanol, we are going to give them less money for their highway trust \nfund. So they pay more for gasoline, but, unlike even the gasoline tax \nthat doesn't go to road building, the effect of this amendment is to \ntake money out of road building.\n  Mr. FEINSTEIN. That is exactly correct, because of the subsidy on \nethanol, usually 18 cents a gallon, which goes into the highway trust \nfund. With ethanol, it drops to 13 cents a gallon. That is a $7 billion \ntake from the highway trust fund over the years of this bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from New York.\n  How is this a good provision for the energy bill? How does it even \njustify the rest of the energy bill? I don't think it does.\n  How can you cost States this enormous amount? How can you force a \ntripling of ethanol when you don't know all of the environmental \neffects? How can you force it when you know the effect is increasing \nNOx which increases smog? How is that good legislation?\n\n  It may well be that some ethanol is good. The problem is tripling it. \nIt is forcing ethanol where it isn't needed. It is forcing ethanol with \na potential deterrent to health, to the environment, and to the highway \ntrust fund.\n  I have a dramatic difference of opinion with respect to this bill. I \nbelieve that any shortfall in supply, because of manipulation, which we \nknow is possible because just a small number of producers control the \nmarket--this is Enron redux; therefore, they will have unusual market \ncontrol over price--will be exacerbated because the State will be \nreliant on ethanol coming from another region.\n  According to a recent report issued by the GAO, 98 percent of ethanol \nproduction is located just in the Midwest. I don't have a problem if \nthe Midwest wants to use it; that is fine with me. The problem is as a \nmatter of public policy pushing it here and pushing it there where \nStates don't need it.\n  As you can see, if you can't pipe it, you have to truck it or barge \nit or rail it. Where is the infrastructure? How do you get these \nbillions of additional gallons required to California? What if some of \nthe plants aren't built?\n  With the electricity crisis in California, it is very interesting; \nthere were a number of new electricity generating facilities that were \ngoing to come online. The economy dipped. Some of them aren't built. \nCompanies have financial reverses, and they don't build.\n  What is to say that is not going to happen with ethanol? Who is to \nsay that all of the facilities the ethanol supporters believe will be \nthere will actually be there?\n  Who is to say there will not be price spikes? Who is going to say \nthere is not going to be an increase in the gas tax? Who is to say we \nare not going to lose $7 billion from the highway trust fund and that \nthat is not going to result in 300,000 less jobs in this country? How \nis that good public policy?\n  I think it is unconscionable public policy. It is selfish public \npolicy. It is parochial public policy to the nth degree.\n  I must tell you, to me, this ethanol mandate overcomes everything \nelse in the bill because I do not know any driver--California has some \nof the longest commutes in the Nation. Drivers sometimes fill their \ntanks three times a week. Some of our drivers travel 2\\1/2\\ hours in \nthe morning and 2\\1/2\\ hours in the evening from the Central Valley to \nthe coast to work.\n  What does that do to the price of gas? It is a huge tax increase. It \nwould be hundreds of dollars a year at 10 cents a gallon. So nobody \nshould think that you are not voting for a tax hike when you vote for \nthis bill.\n  I think that I have covered it except I want, just once again, to \nrepeat these losses for States. We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \nStates that are big losers as to the highway trust fund: California, \nTexas, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, Georgia, \nMichigan, and New Jersey. As the distinguished Senator from New York \nhas said, they are going to be forced to pay higher gas prices, to lose \nmoney for the trust fund, to put something in their gasoline that they \ndo not need that increases pollution and may well have a detrimental \nenvironmental effect.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, ordinarily I am in agreement \nwith my esteemed colleague from California and certainly with my \nesteemed friend and colleague from New York, but this is one occasion \nwhere I could not be in more opposition to what was said and to the \npositions which are being held.\n  Earlier this morning, I vented my frustration over the continuing \nattacks against ethanol and other biofuels that extend back almost a \nquarter of a century. In many instances, opponents simply have said \nthat the marketplace will not permit the price to go to the bottom \ncost. Opponents have said this will actually create a challenge and \nincrease gasoline prices at the pump. But the information being \nprovided just simply isn't accurate.\n  The RFS and the biorefinery concept will actually lead to the \nconstruction of many of the biorefineries now being planned in \nlocations indicated by the red dots on this map I have. It is not \nsimply concentrated within the Midwestern States, as has been \nsuggested. This may be where it began, but, as in so many things, where \nthings end does not always depend on where they began. This is a \nperfect example. I think Delaware is close to being included in part of \nthat because biomass of all kinds, as well as animal waste, can be \nutilized in the development of ethanol and other fuels.\n  I would like to move away from some of the negative things that have \nbeen said about ethanol to something which I think is more positive and \nprovides some information. The RFS will not increase the cost of \nethanol from 4 to 50 cents more than ethanol-free gasoline. Depending \non which statistic is being provided, you simply have to ask this \nquestion: Which cost analysis do you believe?\n\n  A consulting firm, working for the Oxygenated Fuels Association, \nwhose members produce and market MTBE, 70 percent of which is \nimported--and the defeat of the RFS will keep MTBE markets alive--says \nit will increase the cost $4 to $9.75 per gallon. Do you believe those \nfigures or do you believe the Department of Energy's Energy Information \nAdministration material which says the increase, at the most, is \nbetween a half a cent and 1 cent per gallon.\n  If you do not believe our Department of Energy's Energy Information \nAdministration calculation and cost estimate, then let's just go to \nmarketplace reality, because that is where we will end up in any event.\n  Twenty years' experience in Nebraska, 1 cent less than ethanol-free \ngasoline at the pump; 10 years' experience in Minnesota, 8 cents less \nthan gasoline at the wholesale level; 1.5 years' experience in \nCalifornia, there is no essential difference to the public; 10 years' \nexperience nationwide, no essential difference to the public.\n\n[[Page S3125]]\n\n  The question is, which numbers do you believe? It is always about \nthat when you come to projections.\n  Furthermore, the availability of ethanol blends has been shown to \nactually drive down the price of all gasoline as a result of market \nforces. If you take a look at the wholesale price of regular gasoline \nversus ethanol, as shown on the chart, you can see that ethanol, as \nindicated by the green line on this chart--and on one or so occasions \nspiked above regular gasoline, such as back in 1992--continues to trail \nregular gasoline at the wholesale price, as you see the amount of \nexperience that we have had over this 12- or 10-year period.\n  If you go to the next chart and take a look at the retail price of \nmotor gasoline versus ethanol, you can see that that is a similar trend \nfactor, so that ethanol has trended a lower cost than ethanol-free \ngasoline or, if you will, regular gasoline.\n  So the question is, in many instances, which numbers do you believe? \nIf you do not believe the Department of Energy's Energy Information \nAdministration, and you want to believe another organization, that is \nfine, but what I think you should do, ultimately, is look at the \nmarketplace reality of what has, in fact, happened to the price of \nethanol.\n  Further, as evidenced by these graphs, the cost of ethanol has been \nat or below the cost of gasoline. That cost advantage for ethanol has \nbecome more pronounced in recent months and is now nearly 30 cents a \ngallon lower than gasoline at the wholesale level.\n  This is the principal reason we cannot delay implementation of the \nRFS. The smaller, newer ethanol producers urgently need fair market \nprices.\n  Furthermore, ethanol production capacity by the end of 2002 is \nexpected to be 2.3 billion gallons, the level required by the RFS in \n2004. There will not be any shortages.\n  For those who have suggested that somehow we will not be able to \nproduce enough ethanol to meet the standards and requirements, the \nfacts, once again--the marketplace reality and the production reality--\njust do not show that.\n  The bottom line is that history and realistic projections show that \nethanol will be the least cost option for refiners to extend supplies \nand meet octane needs.\n  Now, it also takes much less fossil-fuel energy to produce ethanol \nthan it contains in a renewable form; and, consequently, there are \nmajor energy security benefits from its production and use. Biodiesel \nand cellulosic ethanol are even much better.\n  If you take a look at the net energy balance of corn ethanol, it \nincreased from 1.24 percent in 1995 to 1.34 percent in the year 2000. \nSince then--you can follow the chart--higher corn yields per acre and \nnew technologies used to convert corn to ethanol have further improved \nthe net energy savings or the net energy balance.\n  So if you really take a look at the production of ethanol, it now \nconsumes much less nonrenewable oil as the ethanol replaces. The latest \nU.S. Department of Agriculture report demonstrates that ethanol \nproduction actually has this positive balance that we have displayed on \nthis chart. The bulk of the energy used in fertilizing the crops and to \npower ethanol production plants comes from natural gas or \ncoal. Additionally, with farmers using more ethanol and biodiesel in \ntheir vehicles, the use of fossil fuels to produce biofuels could \nactually approach zero. The bottom line: Ethanol and other biofuels are \nAmerica's best bet in cutting imports and advancing national and energy \nsecurity. Everybody seems to be in agreement, we need to have less \nreliance on foreign oil.\n\n  Homeland security also benefits because biorefineries will be much \nsmaller than oil refineries and far more distributed, as the first \nchart demonstrated. We don't have the same concern about concentration \nwhen we talk about biorefineries and spreading the biorefinery concept \nacross our Nation, with positive effects for energy security as well as \nfor homeland security.\n  Additives to gasoline such as aromatics and alkylates to replace MTBE \nand ethanol are not better and less expensive. Some have suggested that \nwhat we ought to do is find another way to go. We ought to find other \nadditives, and they actually are best. When lead was phased out of \ngasoline in the early 1980s, the ethanol industry was hopeful that \nrefiners would turn to ethanol to gain needed octane. Instead, they \nturned to aromatics, driving levels up to the point that they \nthreatened engine performance and human health.\n  The Clean Air Act amendments of 1990 actually put a cap on aromatics \nand an especially low cap on benzene, a potent carcinogen. A recent \nsampling in Nebraska revealed that in several instances aromatics in \ngasoline exceeded the cap and passed well into the danger area, \nthreatening the environment and human health.\n  What is not commonly known is that the other two aromatics, toluene \nand xylene, to some extent convert to benzene in the combustion \nprocess; therefore, both in the engine and in the catalytic converter. \nFurthermore, last week's prices demonstrate that on average the three \naromatics I am referring to were selling about 52 cents a gallon higher \nthan ethanol and again on average have an octane number about 10 points \nlower than ethanol.\n  Bottom line: The aromatics are no match for ethanol in terms of cost, \noctane, human health, and the environment.\n  Please recognize that the wholesale prices for aromatics on average \nlast week were twice the cost of ethanol and are 10 points short in \nproviding sought-after octane.\n  Alkylates are a better bet. They have an octane number ranging from \n92 to 95. Ethanol has an octane number of 113. They have a valuable \nblending pressure while ethanol's blending vapor pressure requires \ncompensatory action. However, alkylates are the most valuable component \nin finished gasoline, at least the value of premium gasoline. Because \nthey are so valuable and so clean burning, they are husbanded by \nrefiners and are in short supply and not available on the open market.\n  The other alternative being offered, alkylates--bottom line--they are \nvaluable and clean burning, but their octane number is lower than \nethanol, and they are destined to be much more costly than ethanol, as \nis the case with aromatics.\n  There is another point. There will be no shortages. There has been \nthe suggestion that somehow we might find ourselves short on the \nproduction of ethanol. There won't be any shortages of ethanol and \nother biofuels in the marketplace over the next 10 years. If you take a \nlook at poster No. 1, you have already seen the map showing ethanol \nplants, biofuel plants that are, first, those that are under \nconstruction or expansion, those that are undergoing planning, and \nthose that are actually operating. By the end of this year, there will \nbe surplus supplies to meet the 2004 target, and the incentives of the \nRFS will keep supplies well ahead of the requirements in the standards. \nIf that proves to be wrong, there are provisions in the RFS to protect \nconsumers--in other words, a backup plan if all else fails. With the \nexception of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, there are no such \nprovisions to protect consumers from rising foreign oil costs.\n\n  Bottom line: The provisions of the RFS and biofuels provide the \ndriving public with much greater protection against shortages, higher \nprices, and negative national security, as well as environmental \nconsequences than MTBE, aromatics, and alkylates.\n  In yet a better world, biofuels and all three of these gasoline \ncomponents should work cooperatively to provide an optimum fuel--\noptimum in considering the full spread of the Nation's needs.\n  If you review the map and you review historic and current pricing \nstructures, you see they not only provide assurance that there will be \nno biofuels shortages under the RFS that could drive prices up, but \nthey also give evidence that it will not be the three big ethanol \nproducers benefiting from the new public policies. Rather, the \nbeneficiaries will be smaller producers of feedstocks and owners of \nbiorefineries spread all across the country.\n  Bottom line: We must in fact build a better and a new and more self-\nreliant energy policy in America.\n  Another point: Ethanol biodiesel and other biofuels, their incentives \nand the RFS will actually save the taxpayer money. Study after study \nhas shown over the years--this is the most recent study--that biofuels \npolicies, programs, and incentives are real bargains\n\n[[Page S3126]]\n\nto Americans and of great import to the strength of our Nation. \nAmericans are the big winners with ethanol and other biofuels and even \nbigger winners when these renewable fuels have ready access to the \ntransportation fuels market at fair prices.\n  Some opponents of ethanol are simply wrong on their opposition. They \nhave pointed out that the Iowa and Nebraska Legislatures were certainly \ntrying to do something different than what we are proposing in this \nbody. These were only exploratory regulatory efforts to increase the \nmarket for ethanol in both States and were in fact resolved in a \npositive manner that increased production and market share in Iowa and \nNebraska. There was no effort to create a mandate but, rather, a \nstandard for gasoline that would best serve the overall needs of the \nStates.\n  The effort, though not embodied in law, was in fact successful. \nBetween our two States of Iowa and Nebraska, we have the capacity to \nproduce 920 million gallons of ethanol annually--more than enough in an \nemergency to meet 20 percent of our gasoline requirements with enough \nleft over to give New York and California an additional helping hand.\n  By working together, we can find ways to make almost every State in \nthe Union equally self-reliant when it comes to the additive to motor \nfuels gasoline. Just as the Senate passed the renewable portfolio \nstandard for electricity that enjoyed the support of California and New \nYork, structured to serve the overall electricity needs of the Nation, \nthis standard is designed to help meet the overall transportation fuel \nneeds of America.\n  In terms of national energy security, we are not importing \nelectricity from distant nations unfriendly to the United States. Ours \nis a liquid fuel program. Failure to support the renewable fuel \nstandard in reality will mandate our Nation to continue our dangerous \nand declining path to foreign oil dependency which everyone opposes.\n\n  In conclusion, it is clearly in the best interest of the United \nStates for us to be able to pass this RFS. We in the Senate should band \ntogether to try to find ways that will help make the renewable fuel \nstandard available for economic development and for the fuel security \nof all of our States. We need to advance a Manhattan-type project to \nensure that we retake the world leadership in promoting biorefineries \nin order to increase energy, national and homeland security, create new \nbasic industries and quality new jobs, while enhancing our environment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nebraska for an outstanding statement and for the leadership he \nhas shown on this issue for some time. He has been a stalwart advocate \nand an extraordinarily clear and strong voice on this issue. I \ncongratulate him and thank him for all of his effort.\n  As the Senator from Nebraska has noted, there have been a number of \nmyths perpetrated about methanol and ethanol that need to be addressed \nas we consider this RFS.\n  I want to take a couple of minutes--I know a number of my colleagues \nare on the floor and I know each one wants to speak--to address briefly \nthese myths because they need to be knocked down.\n  A myth stated often enough becomes fact in the minds of many. We do \nnot want these myths to become fact in the minds of our Senate \ncolleagues before they have the opportunity to vote on amendments as \ncritical as this one.\n  One myth is that this requires States to use ethanol. This does not \nrequire any State to use ethanol, not one drop, and I hope Senators \nwill be clear about that point. Senators have heard that so frequently \nI am sure it is soon going to become fact in the minds of some, but \nbecause of the credit trading provisions, because of the waiver \nprovisions in this legislation, there is no requirement that States use \nethanol. So to begin with let's clarify that myth.\n  The second myth, and the one I have heard so often expressed on the \nSenate floor, is that this RFS is going to somehow increase the price \nof fuel. That assertion is made on the basis of one study done by Hart/\nIRI Research. That is the one cited by all of the opponents of RFS.\n  What they do not tell you is that the Hart/IRI Research organization \nis funded in large measure by the methyl tertiary butyl ether industry, \nby the MTBE industry. One-half of the revenue that is used to support \nHart/IRI comes from Liondel Petrochemical, which is the largest \nmarketer of MTBE, methyl tertiary butyl ether, and the advocate.\n  This is not, let me emphasize, an independent review. This is a very \nsubjective review funded by the methanol industry to destroy the \nalternative energy fuels market. Their study, of course, advocates a \nposition that is just not accurate and has no basis in fact. Their \nstudy projects that the price would increase 4 to 10 cents a gallon, \nand it is being used by our distinguished Senators from New York and \nCalifornia. The fact is, it is just wrong.\n  The Department of Energy said that the RFS requirement would mean \nless than 1 cent a gallon, nationwide one-half cent per gallon. That is \na Department of Energy study.\n  The API study, the American Petroleum Institute study, said it would \nbe a one-third of a cent increase--not 4 cents, not 10 cents. One would \nthink the oil companies would be opposed to this. They support it. Why \ndo they support it? Because they understand this has very significant \nopportunities for us to address the oxygenate market, the alternative \nenergy market, the opportunities to deal with the challenges they are \nfacing without MTBE. Their report, their review, their study says it \nwould be a one-third of a cent increase, not 4 cents, not 10 cents, but \none-third of a cent.\n  We have the Department of Energy and the American Petroleum Institute \nsaying this will be less than a 1 cent increase in the overall cost of \nfuel.\n  Let us make sure that people understand. It is a myth, I say to my \ncolleagues, it is a myth and do not let anybody tell you differently. \nThere is no increase, no 4-cent, no 5-cent, no 10-cent increase. Who \nshould know better than the Department of Energy and the American \nPetroleum Institute?\n  It is clear, Hart/IRI would lose most of its business if they could \nnot sustain the position they have advocated from the very beginning in \nthis very subjected, distorted, and erroneous assertion that we are \ngoing to see the kind of increase in cost that they have advocated and \nthat is often repeated in the Senate Chamber.\n  There is another myth, and the myth is that somehow if we incorporate \nthe renewable fuel standard, it is going to be disruptive to the \npetroleum market.\n  I will tell you what is going to be disruptive, Mr. President. What \nis going to be disruptive is if we phase out MTBE--14 States have \nalready done that--if we phase out MTBE and we do not have anything in \nits place. You want to see disruption, wait until we phase out MTBE and \nthere is nothing there. We have no alternative.\n  If you want to talk about the abrupt disruption of supply and the \nincrease in cost, I cannot think of anything that will do that more \neffectively and in a more pronounced way than to simply do what we are \nscheduled to do right now: Phase out methyl tertiary butyl ether.\n  The very best thing we can do for the consumers is to pass this bill, \nto pass this standard to allow this gradual transition that this bill \ncontemplates in phasing in an alternative to this disruptive approach \nthat will currently be contemplated if we do not have something to \nsubstitute in its place.\n  That is the third myth, that we are subject to disruption if the bill \npasses. I would argue just the opposite. We are subject to major \ndisruptions in supply and extraordinary increases in cost if this bill \nis not in place to address those disruptions now.\n  There are two more myths, and I want to talk about those. One is that \nit is ethanol that will affect this cost, and to find some alternative \nto ethanol is one that will provide the panacea. I have heard some of \nmy colleagues come to the Chamber and say: We do not really need \nethanol. The oil companies can come up with alternatives to ethanol, \nand we ought to give them the opportunity to come up with those \nalternatives without mandating that ethanol be used.\n  First, a large percentage of what the oil companies are going to have \nto use is either going to be imported or domestic. We know that. There \nis no other choice. The two alternatives to ethanol, in large measure, \nare imported\n\n[[Page S3127]]\n\nproduct. We have alkylates and we have iso-octane. Both of those are \nimported. Both of those are far more expensive than ethanol. Both of \nthose would cause the price hikes that our opponents continue to argue \nare the reason they oppose ethanol.\n  The only domestic alternative is ethanol. The only domestic \nalternative where we can guarantee a supply is ethanol. The only \ndomestic alternative where we know we are going to have some control on \nprice is ethanol, if you look at DOE and API reports. So do not let \nanybody think that somehow we can import all these products and not be \nsubject to dramatic increases in price. What is it about energy policy \nthat would ever cause somebody to advocate more imported product is the \nanswer? That is what some of our opponents are doing. I do not \nunderstand that.\n  If they are concerned about price, if they are concerned about \nsupply, if they are concerned about disruption, if they are concerned \nabout all the ramifications of making sure their consumers are \nprotected, the last thing they should do is depend more on imported \nproduct that we know is going to cost more than ethanol.\n  The final myth is we do not have consumer protections in the bill. I \nam amazed some people make that assertion. They could not possibly have \nread the bill. There are a number of consumer protections beyond those \nI have already addressed.\n  The first consumer protection is that DOE is required under this \nlegislation to look at the ethanol market and the supply problems that \nexist. They have the opportunity written in the legislation--it is in \nwriting; it is guaranteed--that the ethanol mandate will be reduced.\n  The second guarantee is in subsequent years any State can apply and \nhave the mandate reduced within a 90-day period, which is the day we \nhave agreed to. We had a vote last week, and we acknowledged that the \n240 days is long. We are prepared to go to 90 days. DOE and the EPA \nargue they would like to have more time, but we are going to insist \nthey do it within 90 days so States can see their mandate reduced if \nthey can demonstrate there is going to be some concern for disruption.\n  Then we have what I said at the beginning, the credit trading \nprovisions. Any refinery that uses more ethanol can trade the credits \ngenerated from the use of additional ethanol to those refineries that \ndo not use ethanol or that come in at a lower level than what the \nmandate requires.\n  We have credit trading, the waiver, and the overall review that is \nstipulated in the bill requiring EPA to reduce the mandate if \ndisruptions can be proved.\n  We offered, I might also say, another year prior to the \nimplementation of the legislation, in exchange for banning MTBE on \nschedule, and at least to date our opponents have rejected that offer. \nThat would have been a fourth consumer protection I thought would have \nsufficed in meeting some of their concerns, but they chose not to take \nthat offer. It stands as we proposed it, and clearly Senators would \nhave an opportunity to avail themselves of that offer if they chose to \ndo it.\n  There have been a number of myths, and I am disappointed the myths \ncontinue to be perpetrated without an adequate response. We are going \nto continue to respond to those myths and try to knock them down and \nclarify the record so all Senators are very clear about what these \nalternatives are prior to the time they have a chance to vote.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would like to ask my colleague a question.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request? \nUnder the rule, I have 1 hour of time postcloture. While the majority \nleader is in the Chamber, I ask unanimous consent that 55 minutes of my \nhour be given to the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada may yield that time to \nthe majority leader or the manager but not directly to another Senator, \nabsent unanimous consent.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 55 minutes \nfrom the time of the Senator from Nevada be yielded to the Senator from \nNew York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I had asked my colleague from South \nDakota to yield for a question. Before I ask him a question, I \nreiterate what I said at the beginning of my speech, how much I respect \nhim, his leadership, his integrity, and his fighting for all of us. It \nis such a difficult job to be majority leader, and no one in all the \nyears I have been a legislator has done it better than the Senator from \nSouth Dakota. So it pains me to stand up and oppose him and ask him \nquestions.\n  The only question I have is the following, and that is, let us--I do \nnot know what the truth is. I hear from my refiners that they could do \nthis a lot more cheaply. I hear from my refiners that bringing ethanol \nover, whether it be from overseas or from the heartland of America, \nwill raise the price dramatically. So I guess the only question I ask \nmy colleague is: If it is going to be cheaper with ethanol than any \nother method, either the alkylates or the reformulation of gasoline or \nanything else, why not let the market determine it? Because what if we \nare wrong in this bill and the price does begin to go through the roof, \nthrough a price spike, where my constituents would not be happy to wait \n90 days, 3 months, as the price goes up so much, or not through a price \nspike but just because there is a shortage of ethanol and the market \ngoes up?\n  I think ethanol is going to do very well once the oxygenate \nrequirement and MTBE is eliminated anyway. The ethanol market is going \nto get better. It has to. So I guess my question to my friend--and I \nreally mean this, ``my friend,'' not just in the legislative parlance--\nis, Why can't we let the market determine it? Why mandate it instead? \nBecause the thrust of his argument is that ethanol is better--and maybe \nit is--and if it is, our argument does not mean much but then \nthe market would have New York, California, and all these other States \nbuy ethanol.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from New York asks a very \ngood question. My answer would be the same as I am sure he responded to \nSenator Levin about CAFE. Senator Levin said: Why not let the market \nwork on CAFE? A lot of other Senators said: Why not let the market work \non CAFE? I think the Senator disagreed, for good reason, because if we \nset goals oftentimes, as a country working within government and within \nthe industry, we achieve them. Oftentimes, without the role of some \ngoal-setting, we never achieve anything beyond where we are today. We \ndid with CAFE in the past. I think we can do that with ethanol now. \nThis is a goal, just as the Senator supported CAFE as a goal. We failed \non that. I hope in this case we can achieve it.\n  The Senator understandably is concerned about price hikes. As I said \na moment ago, if we are concerned about price hikes, I think we ought \nto be concerned about what happens when we phase out MTBE in a vacuum, \nbecause that is where we are going to get price hikes. We are going to \nget serious price hikes when we start relying on these imported \nproducts for which we are not certain of supply and we are certainly \nnot certain of price.\n  As we phase in the RFS, we have an opportunity to do three things: \nFirst, require that DOE look at the supply and say, OK, if we need more \ntime we are going to give it to you. We look at the States and we say, \nall right, if you want more time, you get an opportunity to ask us for \na waiver and we will give it to you. And over all of that, we say \nbeyond any other waiver or beyond a DOE review, we are going to say you \ncan trade credits right now. You do not have to worry about any other \ndecision. You can trade credits right off the bat.\n  So we have three protections built into the price hike. With this, we \nhave no protections built in if we do nothing.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield, but I know other Senators are \nwaiting patiently. I came out of turn, but I would be happy to answer \none question.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Since the majority leader attacked the points I made, \nI\n\n[[Page S3128]]\n\nwould like to have an opportunity to respond.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator will have the opportunity, but I think it \nwould be preferable to do it on her own time, but I will answer one \nquestion.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. My question is, Is the Senator saying, then, that the \ncredits in this bill do not say if you do not use it you have to pay \nfor it?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The credits in this bill allow you to get out from under \nthe mandate without any intervention from DOE or EPA or anybody else. \nYou are not required, in this legislation, with the RFS, to use one \ndrop of ethanol.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. But then do you pay for it if you do not use it under \nthe credit trading provision?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Of course you pay for it, but the credits are available.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So you pay the amount?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let us put this in the proper context. You pay an \namount, but what are you going to pay when there is no alternative to \nMTBE? How much is that going to cost? If we phase out MTBE in \nCalifornia, and they are then forced to go to alkylates or iso-octane \nand you do not know what it is going to cost, you do not know whether a \nsupply is going to be available and the people of California are forced \nto pay 30 or 40 cents more per gallon because that is the only \navailable supply, I say the people of California would rise up in huge \nopposition. That is, of course, the choice of each of us has to make.\n  What we are saying is we have a very careful and balanced approach in \nphasing out MTBE with ethanol in a way that gives every State an \nopportunity to fashion and to tailor its response to the circumstances \nthey find themselves in, with credit trading, with the waiver \nopportunity, and with the DOE review, not to mention a delay of 1 year \nin the implementation should Senators wish to afford themselves of the \nopportunity we present.\n  So there are tremendous protections for each one of these States \nshould the Senators or should the States choose to use them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I appreciate an opportunity to \nrespond. The majority leader might want to listen or he might not want \nto listen. What he said might be true if one needed to use an \noxygenate, but California does not need to use an oxygenate because it \nhas a reformulated gasoline, and it has to use just a limited \noxygenate.\n  This bill forces California to use this much that it does not need, \nand a careful reading of the credit trading provision in this bill \nmeans you either use this ethanol or you have to pay for it.\n  Let me respond to another point he made on the issue of increased gas \nprices. He said we use one study. Let me give another study. This is an \nEPA staff white paper, study of unique gasoline blends, effects on fuel \nsupply and distribution and potential improvements: Replacing the RFG \noxygenate mandate with the renewable fuel mandate will result in a \nshift of ethanol use from RFG to conventional gasoline, while ethanol \ndistribution costs and blending costs should decrease. However, this \nwill be offset to some extent by an increase in ethanol production \ncosts. For the purpose of this study, we have assumed, based on \nprevious analyses, as discussed in the cost memorandum in the docket, \nthat ethanol production costs would be increased by 15 cents per gallon \nrelative to today's ethanol prices. So it shows there that the cost of \nethanol is apt to go up.\n  With respect to the study that he mentioned, the Energy Information \nAdministration report, that report used national averages. It does not \nadequately predict gas prices in California and other States.\n  The report he referred to did not model how infrastructure problems \nand market concentration can drive prices up.\n  So, what California is saying is we will not have the infrastructure \nin place, and that alone will create price spikes.\n  With respect to his comment on the 90-day amendment, the majority \nleader knows I have been interested in this for a long time. A 90-day \nwaiver has never, ever, by anyone, been offered to me. I will be very \nhappy at the appropriate time to call up my amendment, which is a 90-\nday waiver. I hope, then, that that 90-day waiver will be agreed to. \nBut at no time was a 90-day waiver ever mentioned to me.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I think we are having a good debate. I \nthink it is informative to my colleagues. I thank and compliment my \ncolleague from New York, Mr. Schumer, and my colleague from California, \nSenator Feinstein, for their leadership in bringing out an amendment \nand exposing this for what it is. It will greatly increase costs, a \ncouple of costs.\n  I haven't heard too many people talk about what is very obvious. We \nhave already agreed to an amendment that extends the ethanol subsidy in \nthe Tax Code. That is just a fact. We have extended it, I believe, for \n10 years. Ethanol now receives a subsidy of 53 cents per gallon. It \ndoesn't pay an excise tax that goes to the highway trust fund. That is \nalready the case. That is present law. We just extended that for 10 \nyears.\n  Presently, we are producing a little less than 2 billion gallons of \nethanol a year. So that costs the trust fund a little over $1 billion. \nThe trust fund loses that because we give ethanol the advantage over \nall other fuels. That is about $1 billion. OK, that is present law.\n  What the bill does if you look on page 189 of the bill, is increase \nthe ethanol mandate. Right now, we are producing about 1.9 billion \nbarrels per year. It says in the year 2004 it goes to 2.3 billion. It \ndoesn't sound like a lot, but that is about a 20-percent increase.\n  Then, over the period of time to the year 2012 it goes to 5 billion. \nWe go from 1.9 billion to 5 billion. That is a little less than a 200-\npercent increase in ethanol. So ethanol gets it both ways. They have \nthe subsidy, so much per gallon it doesn't pay in excise taxes that all \nother motor fuels pay, and now we are going to mandate in addition that \nsubsidy: Oh, yes, now refiners, you have to make 5 billion gallons, \nwhich is over two times what we are making right now.\n  That has a cost to it. Some people say there is a cost of an \nadditional 4 cents or 5 cents a gallon. I think it probably does \nbecause it is more expensive to make than gasoline, probably to the \ntune of about 20 cents a gallon. But it also has a cost to the highway \ntrust fund. I have heard people say when we take up the budget we are \ngoing to have to add billions of dollars to the highway trust fund. If \nwe keep the ethanol mandate as it is, in addition to the tax subsidy, \nbut increase the amount that must be produced from current law into a \nFederal mandate of a figure that I guess came from the sky--all of a \nsudden we are going to do 5 billion gallons--that means we are going to \nhave to more than double the capacity of the plants we have right now.\n  The highway trust fund, which is presently losing in excess of $1 \nbillion, is going to be losing in excess of $2.5 billion, if my quick \nmath is right. If you are talking about 53 cents a gallon, and if you \nare going to make 5 billion gallons, that is over $2.5 billion that the \nhighway trust fund is not going to get every year.\n  I believe ethanol vehicles--and they may be just great and it may be \na fantastic fuel, and I am not arguing that--do damage to the roads. \nThe highway trust fund is to repair the roads. Whether the cars are \nrunning on diesel or gasoline or ethanol, those roads have to be \nmaintained and repaired. We are creating a giant gap or loophole for \nthe highway trust fund that is going to be ever expanding by this ever-\nincreasing mandate.\n  My point is that I think we can have it one way or the other. We can \nprobably afford one, or maybe the other, but I question both. If we \nhave a tax subsidy--and I see my friend and colleague, the former \nchairman of the Finance Committee, for whom I have the greatest \nrespect--the tax subsidy giving the 53 cents exclusion from the highway \ngasoline tax is already in the law, and it has been extended. Fine. \nThat is one big one. But to also say we should have a mandate to more \nthan double the production I think is a lot to ask. That is a lot to \nask of the highway trust fund, which most of us want\n\n[[Page S3129]]\n\nto make sure we keep our highways maintained.\n  We are creating a big void. We are facing a lot of highway work that \nneeds to be done. But where is that money going to be coming from? For \nawhile some people said maybe we will have general revenues pick it up. \nI think there is some legitimacy in having a highway user fund, having \nusers pay for highway maintenance. That is the whole purpose of having \na gasoline tax or diesel tax; it is for highway maintenance. To take \none particular fuel and say we are going to exclude it from a very \nsignificant portion of the highway tax is one thing. Now we are going \nto have a mandate that, oh, yes, you have to increase your production \nby another 160 percent. I just question whether it is affordable, \nwhether it is affordable for the highway trust fund, and whether it is \nneeded.\n  I do not mind encouraging alternative sources of fuel. I certainly \ndon't mind helping agriculture. I certainly don't mind doing anything \nthat will reduce our dependency on foreign sources of fuel. But I look \nat this and I say: Wait a minute, aren't we going to far? Aren't we \ndoing too much? We are doing the tax exemption. Do we really need a \nmandate that says you have to produce that much? I ask: Can we make \nthis 2.3 billion gallons in the year 2004? Can we really increase \nproduction in all these plants in 2 years? At that point, we are at 2.3 \nbillion. Maybe we can. In another 8 years, can we double it? Heaven \nforbid that we let the marketplace decide which fuel we should be \nburning.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, will my colleague from Oklahoma yield for \na question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I have been following his very cogent arguments. I am \nglad we are on the same side on a few issues. Hopefully, there will be \nmany more.\n  He made two points. I would like to ask him if I am wrong. There are \ndouble contradictions here. One is that we are going to raise the price \nof gasoline, as we would with the gas tax. But we are actually going to \ndeplete the trust fund at the same time we lose the gas tax, whereas, \nat least the gas tax has the purpose of the user tax.\n  As my friend from Oklahoma accurately stated, at least that does \nimprove the fund. We get hit both ways. There is a second sort of the \nanomaly here. I haven't seen anything like it. We have a large subsidy \nfor a product--I think he mentioned 53 cents a gallon; that is huge \nalready for the motorist--to help the farmers. I don't know anything \nelse that gets up to that extent. At the same time, we are now forcing \npeople to buy it with that subsidy.\n  Am I correct that those are two separate contradictions within this \nbill, two separate anomalies?\n  I ask my colleague from Oklahoma, has he ever seen anything such as \nthis in his years of making sure the free market policies are pursued \nfor our country?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the question. I have seen something like \nit. I will allude to it. I hope we can fix it at a later date. That \ndeals with the renewable portfolio standards that are also in this \nbill.\n  To show you how similar they are, in that particular section of the \nbill, there is a mandate that 10 percent of the electricity be produced \nfrom renewable fuels. Incidentally, if you can't do that, you can buy a \ncredit for 3 cents per kilowatt hour. That is the price of electricity \nin the wholesale market today. In some cases, it is a lot less than \nthat. You can get out of that mandate by giving the government 3 cents \nper kilowatt hour. Wow. That is expensive. That is the equivalent of \nabout a 5-percent increase in the electricity bill.\n  I see this as very similar. This says: OK. Buy a lot more ethanol--up \nto 5 billion gallons--more than double what we are buying right now. \nAnd, oh, yes. We are going to subsidize that, too. We are going to \nmandate that you buy it and subsidize it. But consumers are going to \npay for it. They are going to pay for it by having a shortfall in the \nhighway trust fund to the tune of over $2.5 billion a year.\n  Obviously, if you are exempting 3 cents a gallon and mandating that \nyou manufacture 5 billion gallons, the trust fund is coming up $2.6 \nbillion short per year. As consumers of fuel, users of the highways are \ncoming up short. That means other fuels or general revenue is going to \nhave to make up the difference. It just doesn't fit.\n  I happen to think there is a reason why people say, well, we need the \n53 cents per gallon to make ethanol competitive with other fuels. In \nother words, it is more expensive. I think that is obvious.\n  I understand the proponents, and I respect the proponents, but they \nare saying we need the tax subsidy to make it competitive. It is more \nexpensive to produce ethanol than it is gasoline. So we give them the \ntax subsidy so they can afford to do it. We are now going to mandate \nthat they more than double the production. If it is more expensive to \nmake, that means the price of gasohol is going to go up. I think the \nestimates of 4 or 5 cents a gallon are probably accurate. That may not \nsound like very much. It is probably about a 6-percent increase in \ngasoline costs. Consumers are going to pay for that.\n\n  I was shocked. I didn't know until I heard Senator Feinstein mention \nthat under current law there is an import fee on ethanol. I asked my \nstaff. I started looking for it. Where is it? It is not in here. It is \nin current law.\n  The ethanol industry has already been successful in having \nprotectionism, saying we can't have ethanol imports. There is only \ndomestic product. Guess what. We import a lot of gasoline. We import a \nlot of oil. We import a lot of fuel. Right now we are saying we are \ngoing to mandate this much more production but we are going to keep the \nprotection.\n  I am troubled by that. Consumers will pay. If ethanol were \ncompetitive, it wouldn't need a tax subsidy and it wouldn't need us \nmandating 5 billion gallons by the year 2012. It costs more to produce. \nConsumers will pay it. This bill is going to cost consumers.\n  I know there are charts floating around here on the cost per gallon. \nI think 5 or 6 cents per gallon is a good estimate.\n  To answer my friend's question, is there another example of that? \nYes. It is in the renewable portfolio standard. It is a 3 cents per \nkilowatt hour credit which we mandate in this bill. Senator Breaux and \nI and others will have amendments to reduce that from 3 cents per \nkilowatt hour to 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour, which is the same amount \nthe Clinton administration proposed. We will reduce the penalty--the \ntax--that is in the bill.\n  This bill we have before us right now increases the price of gasoline \nbecause of the ethanol standard, and it increases the price of \nelectricity because of the renewable portfolio standards.\n  I compliment my colleagues from New York and California for trying to \naddress the gasohol tax increase that will hit all consumers, all \ngasoline purchasers. Later on we will have an amendment to hopefully \nreduce the electricity penalty that is in the bill as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair. I appreciate the desire of the \nSenators from New York and California to protect their States and their \nconstituents.\n  I think it is unfortunate that so much misinformation about ethanol \nexists today. It has been distributed and is being distributed even as \nwe speak. There is so much misunderstanding about what ethanol's role \nis, and also ethanol's potential in our energy future.\n  Today, the United States consumes 25 percent of all the oil that is \nproduced in the world. One out of every four barrels of oil produced in \nthe world is consumed in the United States.\n  Given the significance of the transportation sector in this country, \none out of every seven barrels of oil goes into American gasoline. If \nthose who continue to oppose any kind of alternative have their way, \nthe policy of this country is going to be basically hang on and hope--\nhang on to the status quo, hang on to the present consumption of oil \nand gasoline, hang on to the present energy consumption patterns of \nthis country and hope nothing changes.\n  I find it disappointing that we focus on these alternatives as though \nthey are somehow going to impose something more onerous and more \nexpensive on the American people when, in fact, if you look \nrealistically at the future, 10, 20 years from now, the most expensive \npolicy for the American consumer is for us to do nothing.\n\n[[Page S3130]]\n\n  The notion that we will be able to continue to consume one-fourth or \nmore of the world's oil production, the notion that prices will remain \nthe same as today's prices, that there won't be disruptions, and to put \nourselves in a situation where we will be faced with either supply \ndisruption or price increases of major proportions, I think is putting \nour head in the sand and hoping for something that goes beyond what is \nrealistic.\n  Despite the efforts of the manager of this bill, basically the \nposition of the Senate on this bill is to do nothing in terms of \nbringing about any real reduction in the consumption of oil and \ngasoline or the development of real alternatives. We said no to the \nCAFE standards. We said no to basically any meaningful change or \ndevelopment of any alternative. Why? Because, as the opponents say, any \nalternative, any change in our practice, involves some dislocation and \nsome price increase on a temporary basis--not nearly what this \nproposes. They may involve some need to refigure our supply. Anything \nthat changes the status quo, therefore, changes some aspect of this \nsystem that we keep treating as though it is in place and it is secure \nfor years to come.\n  How long, realistically, do we think we are going to be able to \ncontinue to have all the oil that we wish to consume, at the prices we \nare paying today, with no disruptions, and no price spikes? In fact, if \nwe don't start developing alternatives, such as ethanol and other \nbiofuels, we are going to guarantee that we are in the same predicament \n10 years from now or 20 years from now. I guarantee you that those \nprices will not continue to be stable.\n  In Minnesota, we have been practicing an alternative for the last 5 \nyears mandated by the Minnesota Legislature, which is a 10-percent \nblend of ethanol in every gallon of gasoline sold in the State of \nMinnesota. That ethanol is blended. Ten percent is used by every \nvehicle that puts gasoline into its tank. It requires no change in \nengines produced by General Motors, Ford, or any other company, foreign \nor domestic.\n  In fact, the engines in vehicles that use 10 percent ethanol requires \nno modification whatsoever. They have no supply problems.\n  The cost of a gallon of gasoline in Minnesota today is 20 cents less \nthan a gallon of gasoline in California. It is a penny more than in New \nYork. It is 5 cents a gallon less in Illinois, and it is less in our \nsurrounding States that don't have this mandate. That is just the \nbeginning.\n  My office leases a vehicle, a Chrysler Suburban, that travels around \nMinnesota. It consumes 85 percent ethanol--a fuel that is blended 85 \npercent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. That is priced 20 cents less \nthan a gallon of unleaded fuel in Minnesota today--meaning 40 cents \nless than a gallon in California, 10 cents less than a gallon of \ngasoline in New York, and so on.\n  Yes, this is a subsidy. Yes, this is an incentive provided to make \nthe conversion to this kind of fuel. Again, if we don't provide some \nkind of incentive, we will have no alternative form of energy which is \ngoing to be competitive with what it is today.\n  On the other hand, if we don't follow the direction in this \nlegislation that we begin to make this transition to having a supply of \nethanol that will actually not just displace MTBE--that is far too \nlimited a view of the future of ethanol. Ethanol could not only \nsupplant MTBE, as this legislation encourages, but also ethanol could \nsupplant gasoline itself.\n  As I said, right now in Minnesota, 10 percent of the gasoline has \nbeen supplanted by ethanol.\n  That could be 20 percent if we had the supplies available that could \nbe applied across this country. And 85 percent of ethanol can be used \nin 2 million vehicles across the country. Imagine what it would do 10, \n20 years from now to the energy independence of this country if we were \nusing 20 percent, 40 percent, 60 percent ethanol instead of gasoline.\n  As I say, these changes are not going to happen overnight. We are not \ngoing to be able to find ourselves in an energy crisis down the road \nand be able to make these kinds of changes immediately. If we do not \nstart now, if we do not have a goal of 10 years from now reaching a \nmanageable amount of product that will encourage others to get into the \nmarket--for example, I hear criticism that one company now controls 41 \npercent of the market for ethanol in this country.\n  Twenty-five years ago that same company controlled 99 percent of the \nethanol in this country, and that number has gone down every single \nyear thereafter as more and more producers have gotten into the ethanol \nmarket. The production concentration in that industry is diminishing. \nIt will continue to diminish with or without this mandate, but it will \ncertainly accelerate the reduction in concentration as more and more \nproducers get into the market.\n  We hear about supply difficulties and questions about supply which \ncannot be answered today for a market that will exist 10 years from \nnow. But to think we are transporting oil and oil products from the \nMiddle East, from South America--thousands of miles to our ports--to \nStates such as California, which is now importing 75 percent of their \nMTBE by barge from Saudi Arabia, and we are saying that the supplies \ncannot be transported from the middle section of this country to either \ncoast at a competitive transportation price boggles the mind and defies \nimagination.\n  Furthermore, I guarantee you, with this kind of mandate, the \nagricultural sector in California, which is enormous, and the \nagricultural sector in New York, which is very substantial, will move \nto producing the kinds of crops which can then be converted into \nethanol. I guarantee producers and refineries will sprout in those \nStates and elsewhere across this country to supply this additional \nproduct.\n  So this is not a static situation. It is a dynamic one, and one \nwhich--with this mandate, with this encouragement--has tremendous \nopportunity over the course of the next decade and thereafter to meet a \nsignificant part of our energy needs, our consumption of gasoline.\n  Finally, in terms of liability protection, I happen to agree with \nthose who are concerned about that. I am willing to have that stripped \nfrom the bill. But this amendment, as it is proposed, does not just \ndeal with some of these flaws; it would eliminate the entire ethanol \nprovision entirely. So if there are particular concerns, let's deal \nwith those particular concerns. But I think just to wipe this out \nentirely is shortsighted and, as I say, will result in American \nconsumers paying higher prices for gasoline or gasoline products.\n  Finally, I wish to make one last comment on the highway trust fund. \nAgain, I agree with the critics of this measure who say our actions \nwill result in less dollars going into the highway trust fund. That is \ntrue. But anything that results in the lessening of the consumption of \ngasoline in this country results in fewer dollars going into the \nhighway trust fund. If you follow that logic, then, it means, in order \nto maximize dollars going into the highway trust fund--which is \nimportant to Minnesota and every other State--we ought to lower the \nfuel efficiency of our vehicles, we ought to drive them more miles, and \nwe should do whatever we can to burn more gasoline because that results \nin more dollars going into the highway trust fund.\n\n  I suggest we are better off to reconsider that policy, to reconsider \nwhether we want the highway trust fund to be dependent on the number of \ngallons of gasoline consumed, when we know what the effects of that are \non our economy elsewhere.\n  So I say it is better to change the policy over time, better to \nchange the supplement, the funding mechanism of the highway trust fund, \nrather than sacrifice a sound alternative energy policy on that altar.\n  Again, in conclusion, if we do not start this now, if we do not start \nencouraging this transition, we are going to be nowhere in 10 years, we \nare going to be nowhere in 20 years, except where we are today with our \nenergy dependency. And I guarantee we will have no solution to our \nenergy predicament.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I only intend to take 4 or 5 minutes. I \nask unanimous consent that the Senator from Iowa be recognized \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S3131]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I certainly will not object. I see \ncolleagues on the floor. I ask unanimous consent that after Senator \nDorgan and Senator Grassley--and I gather Senator Murkowski also is \ngoing to speak; is that correct--and the Senator from Alaska speaks, \nthat I then be recognized to speak after Senator Murkowski, in that \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, what is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has requested that \nat the conclusion of Senator Dorgan's comments and Senator Grassley's \ncomments and Senator Murkowski's comments, he would be recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection, but I do say that we have, under \npostcloture, 30 hours. There is going to come a time--certainly we are \nnot approaching it quickly--but somebody will have to move either to \ntable or to set a definite time for voting on this amendment because I \ndo not think it is fair to spend the whole 30 hours on this one issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I thank my \ncolleagues.\n  Let me say that some issues are less complicated than they seem, and \nthis, I think, is one of those issues. The ability to take a kernel of \ncorn or barley, for example, take the starch from it, break it down \ninto its simple sugars, ferment it into a drop of alcohol, and use it \nto extend America's energy supply makes great sense. Being able to take \na drop of alcohol from a kernel of corn or barley to extend America's \nenergy supply, and still have the protein feedstock left to feed \nanimals, also makes great sense. We will produce ethanol in substantial \nquantities. The question is not whether it will be done; the question \nis when.\n  We produce a substantial amount of energy right now, but not nearly \nas much as we could from ethanol. We will, at some point, dramatically \nincrease the ability to produce our own fuel. Producing renewable fuel \nthat we can use for gasoline, the fuel we can use in other ways to \nextend America's energy supply, just makes sense.\n  The provision in this legislation makes good sense as well. It will \nsubstantially increase the quantity of ethanol that is produced in our \ncountry, and do it more quickly than we otherwise could.\n  One of my colleagues, Senator Nickles, said: Let the market decide \nthese things. Well, it is interesting that the market apparently has \ndecided that we should import 57 percent of our oil supply, much of it \nfrom Saudi Arabia. Is that a market decision that makes a lot of sense? \nIs that a market decision that puts us in peril of someday waking up in \nthe morning to find out that some heinous act by a terrorist has \ninterrupted the energy supply from the Saudis or the Kuwaitis, and all \nof a sudden America's economy is flat on its back? Is that a \nmarketplace decision that makes good sense? No, it does not make good \nsense. So, in a number of ways, we are trying to move in different \ndirections.\n  This debate is about the replacement of MTBE. All of us understand \nthat in various parts of the country it has been showing up in ground \nwater. We understand that this has to be dealt with. And that gives \nrise to this provision in the energy bill. But this provision in the \nenergy bill, in my judgment, has much more significance than just that \nissue.\n  I think my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Dayton, just described \nthat. It is not just about a replacement for MTBE; it is about \nadditional production of energy in our country. It is about growing our \nfuel on a renewable basis year after year. It is about another market \nfor family farmers who produce crops that can be turned into alcohol, \nand then use the protein feedstock later for animal feed. It just makes \ngood sense for our country to do this.\n  I know there are some who have some heartburn about this provision, \nand I certainly respect their views. There are some who object to \neverything that is done for the first time. I am not suggesting that is \nthe case with the opponents here, but we are going to march, \ninevitably, in this direction. The question for us is: Do we do it \nsooner, or do we do it later?\n  This is the time when we decide that we want additional production \nfrom renewable sources.\n  And yes, that is ethanol. It is good for our country, for the \nenvironment, and for our family farmers. Frankly, it is even good for \nthose who are objecting to it today.\n  I hope we will reject this amendment, as we should, and continue to \nkeep this provision in the bill.\n  I thank my colleague from Iowa for allowing me to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I speak about the volume of \nmisinformation we have on the renewable fuel standard, there were a \ncouple statements made in the debate by the Senator from Oklahoma that \nI want to address.\n  No. 1, don't assume ethanol is going to increase the cost of \ngasoline. At least in my State, you find in most cases ethanol in \ngasoline will sell for 2 cents a gallon cheaper than gasoline without \nethanol. If that is not the case, it is the same price. Very rarely do \nyou find anytime that ethanol in gasoline causes the price of that \ngasoline to be higher than gasoline without ethanol.\n  The other misinformation we ought to clear up is the use of the word \n``subsidy.'' Because of the consumer tax on gasoline not being as high \nif it has ethanol in it as without ethanol, that is a lower rate of \ntaxation. The subsidy, as we use it in this body, refers to money \ncoming from the Federal Treasury to benefit somebody. When a consumer \npays less tax on a gallon of gasoline because it has some ethanol in \nit, that is less tax. Do the proponents of this bill suggest we ought \nto raise the tax on gasoline because there is ethanol in it? Some of \nthese Members I hear abhor the idea that there ought to be any increase \nin any tax, let alone an increase in the gasoline tax.\n  Those are two things I wanted to clear up.\n  Now, about this misinformation, I know my colleagues who are \nsupporting this amendment are very intelligent people. I don't think \nthey are purposely misleading us. There has been some propaganda spread \nby some industries in this country, and it has been picked up by some \nMembers of Congress. They have lent their credibility and voice to this \nantireformulated fuels standard in a way that, quite frankly, does not \ndo anybody any good. This misinformation campaign can help only two \ninterests: It can help producers of MTBE, which production contaminates \nour drinking water supplies--and it does this in the States of \nCalifornia and New York; that has been very well documented; secondly, \nMiddle East producers of both oil and MTBE that seek to tighten a very \ndangerous grip they have upon America's energy security.\n  How does this misinformation campaign help MTBE producers? That is \nbecause the reformulated fuel standard includes an MTBE ban. The MTBE \nproducers know that the entire reformulated fuel standard will unravel \nif they can chip away at it with some amendments.\n  A broad coalition of interests helped produce this balanced \ncompromise we have before us. This coalition may very well be \nunprecedented. The coalition consists of farm groups, petroleum and \nrenewable fuel producers, environmental groups, and State environmental \nagencies. I had an opportunity to address a group where the American \nPetroleum Institute had one of their employees. I had to tell him, when \nI heard of their supporting this compromise, it is a good thing I had a \ngood heart. Otherwise, I would have passed out as a result of it \nbecause they have never been with this group of people in the past. \nHere they see the need for renewable fuels as well.\n  They all agreed to a compromise proposal embodied within the \nrenewable fuel standard that in the past seemed impossible to \naccomplish.\n  What do MTBE producers do? They get their consultant, Hart/IRI, to \ncook numbers to make it look as if requiring ethanol usage will cause \nmotor fuel prices to go up by almost 10 cents a gallon. This is \nblatantly false. The truth is, according to the Energy Information \nAdministration, requiring ethanol under the renewable fuel standard\n\n[[Page S3132]]\n\nwill increase motor fuel costs, if at all, by one-half a cent to a \npenny per gallon.\n\n  So we have had a couple Senators address this issue in a Dear \nColleague letter. I will quote from the letter, ``MTBE Consultant \nMisleads Members on Ethanol Debate.'' Let me share with you the letter \nfrom Senators Johnson and Hagel. I quote:\n\n       Senators from New York and California have distributed \n     charts and spoken on the floor, claiming that the renewable \n     fuels standard will increase consumer costs by 4-9.75 cents \n     per gallon. The source of this data is the MTBE consulting \n     firm, Hart/IRI, which claims it based its cost estimates on \n     data from the Energy Information Administration.\n\n  Further quoting:\n\n       [The Energy Information Administration] has completed two \n     analyses. . . . The first, found that the MTBE ban would \n     increase gasoline costs 4-10.5 cents per gallon, while the \n     renewable fuels standard could increase gasoline costs by 1 \n     cent per gallon in reformulated gasoline areas, and .05 per \n     gallon overall.\n\n  I want my colleagues to listen very carefully to the next sentence \nfrom this letter:\n\n       Hart/IRI lumped these costs together and attributed . . . \n     them to the renewable fuels standard, making that provision \n     appear to be roughly ten times more expensive than it is.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       Since the fuels compromise bans MTBE, Hart/IRI has every \n     incentive to exaggerate and misrepresent the cost impacts on \n     the legislation. It is ironic and unfortunate that some \n     members--whose states have already banned MTBE, because it \n     has poisoned their drinking water--chose to use this MTBE \n     consulting firm's analysis rather than relying upon the \n     objective EIA numbers.\n\n  We ought to repeat that sentence:\n\n       It is unfortunate and ironic that some members--whose \n     states have already banned MTBE, because it has poisoned \n     their drinking water--chose to use this MTBE consulting \n     firm's analysis rather than relying upon the objective EIA \n     numbers.\n\n  We proponents of this renewable fuels standard are trying to help \nconsumers in California and New York. We are trying to reduce their \ndependence upon MTBE, because it poisons the groundwater, and oil, and \nboth of those come from the Middle East. In fact, we are trying to do \nso in a manner directly advocated in 1999 by the two California \nSenators and the senior Senator from New York when the Senate approved \nSenator Boxer's resolution calling for the ban of MTBE and replacing \nthe MTBE with renewable ethanol. That is what the resolution said.\n  Yet today our efforts are opposed because our legislation would \nincrease the use of ethanol made by farmers and ethanol producers in \nAmerica's Middle West as opposed to getting our energy from the Middle \nEast.\n  Our opponents claim they are worried about supply shortages and price \nspikes. Yet how can any Member of this body be more worried about \nethanol from the Midwest than they are about MTBE and oil from the \nMiddle East? How can anyone oppose America's farmers and ethanol by \nusing bogus information from an MTBE consultant. It is unbelievable, \nisn't it?\n  Mr. President, what the MTBE consultant did was distort an analysis \nof banning MTBE included in an earlier proposal, not the proposal \npending before the Senate. The Energy Information Administration did \ntwo analyses. The outdated one concluded that an MTBE ban under the old \nproposal would increase consumer costs by 4 to 10 cents a gallon. \nRequiring the use of ethanol under the old analysis would cost at most \na penny a gallon.\n  A second Energy Information Administration analysis was conducted, \nbut this time it focused on the pending legislation. The Energy \nInformation Administration concluded that banning MTBE would increase \nthe cost of motor fuel by about 2 to 4 cents per gallon, and again it \nfound that requiring ethanol would increase consumers' cost by less \nthan one penny a gallon.\n  Again, who are we to believe, the MTBE industry, which will lose if \nMTBE is banned, or the Energy Information Administration?\n  Let me critique this for my colleagues with a closer look. Those who \nare offering killer amendments to this renewable fuel standard point \nout in detail, State by State, the price increases consumers will \nsupposedly suffer if the renewable fuel standard is adopted.\n  The bogus Hart/IRI analysis concluded, for instance, Arizona \nconsumers would pay 7.6 cents more per gallon; Maryland, 9.1 cents; \nTexas, 5.7 cents; Pennsylvania, 9.1 cents; New York, 7.1 cents; \nCalifornia, 9.6 cents, and I can go through the 50 States.\n  When one looks slightly below the surface and gives the Hart/IRI \nstudy even a moment's attention, one will see but half a cent or a \npenny of these predicted price hikes are related to the ban of MTBE and \nnot the cost of requiring ethanol.\n  Our renewable fuel standard opponents want us to fear price hikes, \nbut they do not want us to figure out that the price hikes are driven \nby banning MTBE. Instead, the aim is to mislead us into thinking \nethanol causes the price hikes, but by using this pro-MTBE consulting \nfirm study and by subtracting the half cent or penny-cost increase \nsupposedly relating to ethanol, we find that what our New York and \nCalifornia colleagues are really arguing is that if we ban MTBE, the \ncost of gasoline will go up by 8.6 cents per gallon in California and \nby 6.1 cents per gallon in New York.\n  What is the logical conclusion? Isn't that simple? If we are to \nbelieve the studies used by our colleagues from New York and \nCalifornia, the only conclusion we can draw is they do not want to ban \nMTBE because the price of gas will go up.\n  The opponents of the renewable fuel standard cannot have it both \nways. They have to make up their minds. Either they want to ban MTBE to \nprotect drinking water or they want to keep using MTBE so prices do not \nspike. The bed was made with Hart/IRI; now lay in it.\n  Mr. President, surely we can put a little more care into debate so \nimportant as our energy security. Some of our colleagues who are \nopposing the renewable fuel standard mentioned in passing that there is \ncleaner fuel at less cost and that we do not need to use oxygenates. \nReally.\n  In 1991, the California Energy Commission compared the cost of \nethanol-blended motor fuel with motor fuel that included no oxygenates, \nneither ethanol nor MTBE. In short, the California Energy Commission \nfound that nonoxygenated fuels could cost more per gallon than ethanol-\nblended motor fuels.\n  I note that the California Energy Commission analysis was done when \nannual ethanol production capacity stood at less than 1.7 billion \ngallons, and it was when skeptics said there would not be enough \nethanol to replace MTBE. Today ethanol production capacity stands at \n2.3 billion gallons per year.\n\n  I hope that settles some of the fears the Senator from Oklahoma had \nabout whether we have the capacity to do it. We have unused capacity \nright now. We also have new plants coming online, and production \ncapacity will increase to 2.7 billion gallons per year by the end of \nDecember and climb to between 3.5 billion and 4 billion gallons by the \nend of 2003.\n  I suggest that given the large increase in ethanol capacity, ethanol-\nblended motor fuel would be even cheaper than estimated by the \nCalifornia Energy Commission.\n  Moreover, even the recent Energy Information Administration study \nconcluding motor fuel could go up a penny if ethanol is required may be \ntoo high because it does not take into consideration the efficiencies \nof the credit trading program.\n  Our California and New York colleagues argue that nonoxygenated motor \nfuel is cheaper than ethanol-blended fuel, but that contention is just \nthe opposite of what the California Energy Commission reported. Our \ncolleagues choose not to take their information from the California \nEnergy Commission and they choose not to take their information from \nthe U.S. Energy Information Administration. They would rather take \ntheir information from an MTBE consultant. Why would they do this? I \nwish I knew.\n  I want to share another independent source of energy analysis \nproduced by the Department of Energy's Office of Transportation \nTechnologies. These two draft studies underscore the extreme importance \nof expanding renewable fuel use, particularly now that we aim to ban \nMTBE because it poisons our water.\n  In short, these analyses conclude that alternative and replacement \nfuels leverage lower prices for consumers\n\n[[Page S3133]]\n\nand reduce the impact of OPEC oil-producing nations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two economic \nanalyses of the benefits of replacing gasoline with alternative fuels \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Oil Price Benefits of Increasing Replacement/Alternative Fuel Market \n  Share, Draft Analysis, Office of Transportation Technologies, U.S. \n                          Department of Energy\n\n       Increasing the market share of alternative and replacement \n     transportation fuels would have significant energy security \n     and oil market benefits for the United States. Some of these \n     benefits will occur even if use of the fuels is induced by \n     regulations, subsidies, or demonstration programs. Additional \n     energy security benefits would be generated if the fuels are \n     competitive with petroleum fuels in at least some market \n     segments.\n       Competitive alternative and replacement fuels produce \n     energy security benefits in two principal ways:\n       First, by reducing the quantity of petroleum consumed and \n     imported, they reduce the vulnerability of the economy to oil \n     price shocks.\n       Second, by increasing the price-responsiveness of oil \n     demand, they reduce the market power of the OPEC cartel, \n     making it more difficult for OPEC to raise prices and the \n     sustain those price increases.\n       Today alternative and replacement fuels account for 3.6 \n     percent of total U.S. gasoline demand. The majority of this \n     is blending stocks used in gasoline. Methyl tertiary butyl \n     ether, MTBE, which is predominately derived from natural gas, \n     comprises 2.6 percent of gasoline demand. Ethanol produced \n     from renewable energy sources, which is primarily blended \n     into gasoline, comprises 0.7 percent of gasoline demand. The \n     use of MTBE is driven by clean air requirements, while \n     ethanol use is subsidized by a partial exemption from motor \n     fuel excise taxes. Alternatives to petroleum-based fuels, \n     such as propane, compressed natural gas, alcohols, \n     electricity and biodiesel comprise only 0.3 percent of total \n     U.S. gasoline use.\n       Even these modest levels of alternative and replacement \n     fuel uses are providing some energy security benefits. In a \n     very preliminary, draft market simulation of world oil \n     markets, we have estimated the world oil price impacts of \n     U.S. alternative and replacement fuel use. The following \n     results were obtained.\n       The present 3.6 percent market share of alternative/\n     replacement fuels produces an approximately $1.00/barrel \n     reduction in oil prices from what they would be if \n     alternative/replacement fuels were not used at all. At \n     current U.S. oil consumption levels of 6.8 billion barrels, \n     this level of alternative/replacement fuel use results in a \n     savings of approximately $7 billion on an annual basis.\n       If the U.S. were to achieve the 10 percent replacement fuel \n     goal of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, oil prices could be \n     reduced by approximately $3.00/barrel. At current U.S. oil \n     consumption levels of 6.8 billion barrels, this level of \n     alternative/replacement fuel use would result in a savings of \n     approximately $20 billion on an annual basis.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  The Impacts of Alternative and Replacement Fuel Use on Oil Prices--\n                                 Draft\n\n                          (By David L. Greene)\n\n       This memorandum presents estimates of the long-run oil \n     market benefits of increased use of alternative and \n     replacement fuels by highway vehicles in the United States. \n     No attempt is made to estimate the costs of increasing use of \n     alternative energy sources. Potential benefits in the event \n     of possible future oil price shocks are not addressed. Nor \n     are likely environmental benefits considered. Current use of \n     alternative and replacement fuels is estimated to reduce \n     total U.S. petroleum costs by about $1.3 billion per year \n     (about $0.29 per barrel). Cumulative savings from 1992 to \n     2000 are estimated to be $9 billion. Increasing alternative \n     and replacement fuel use to 10% of motor fuel use by 2010 is \n     estimated to increase oil market benefits to $6 billion per \n     year ($0.68/bbl), for a 2000-2010 cumulative savings of $35 \n     billion. These estimates were made using a very simple model \n     of world oil markets and are contingent on the assumption \n     that historical and projected OPEC production levels do not \n     change.\n\n\n        Oil Market Benefits of Alternative and Replacement Fuels\n\n       Displacing petroleum with alternative and replacement \n     transportation fuels helps hold down petroleum prices in two \n     ways. First, reducing the demand for petroleum makes it \n     harder for OPEC to raise oil prices. Although the actual \n     impact will depend on precisely how OPEC responds, a \n     reasonable rule of thumb is that a 1% decrease in U.S. \n     petroleum demand will reduce world oil price by about 0.5%, \n     in the long-run. Short-run (1 year or less) impacts would be \n     even greater, due to the short-run inelasticity of oil supply \n     and demand. The Energy Information Administration offers the \n     following as a rule of thumb for short-run supply reductions.\n       ``For every one million barrel per day (1 MMBD) of oil \n     disputed, world oil prices could increase by $3-5 barrel.'' \n     http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/security/rule.html\n       Demand reductions would have the exact opposite effect, \n     assuming OPEC took no action to cut back production in \n     response. One MMBD would be about 5% of U.S. oil consumption, \n     whereas $3-5 per barrel would be a 15-25% price increase, if \n     oil cost $20 per barrel, suggesting a short-run elasticity \n     about ten times as large as the long-run elasticity. This \n     leads us to the second oil price benefit of alternative and \n     replacement fuel use, the potential for increased price \n     elasticity in case of a supply disruption.\n       The existence of an alternative source of liquid fuels \n     supply can also increase the elasticity of oil demand by \n     providing a potential substitute for oil in the event of a \n     price shock caused by a sudden reduction in supply. It is \n     precisely the inelasticity of oil demand and supply that \n     makes price shocks possible. Increasing the elasticity of \n     demand mitigates the impact of a supply shortage on \n     prices.\n\n\n               estimating the long-run oil price benefits\n\n       The long-run oil market benefit of alternative and \n     replacement fuels can be approximately estimated by a simple \n     simulation model of the world oil market. The model is \n     comprised of two demand equations and two supply equations \n     representing U.S. and Rest-of-World, and a assumed level of \n     OPEC output. All supply and demand equations are linear and \n     depend on current price and lagged quantity. A year-specific \n     constant term is used to calibrate the equations to exactly \n     match the 2000 Annual Energy Outlook Reference Case \n     projections. Since the equations are linear, elasticity \n     increases with increasing oil price and decreases with \n     increasing oil demand. Representative elasticities are shown \n     in table 1 for the U.S. and ROW at various oil prices and \n     1998 quantities.\n\n                            TABLE 1.--LONG-RUN PRICE ELASTICITIES OF WORLD OIL MODEL\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                     U.S.        U.S.\n                                                                    demand      supply    ROW demand  ROW supply\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMBD............................................................      19.41        8.96       58.32       36.00\nPrice Slopes....................................................      -0.329       0.138      -0.966       0.376\n \n                                              ELASTICITY ESTIMATES\nOil Price:\n    $10.........................................................      -0.17        0.15       -0.17        0.10\n    $20.........................................................      -0.34        0.31       -0.33        0.20\n    $30.........................................................      -0.51        0.46       -0.50        0.31\n    $40.........................................................      -0.68        0.61       -0.66        0.41\n    $50.........................................................      -0.85        0.77       -0.83        0.51\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The historical data and the 2000 AEO projections reflect \n     the current levels of alternative and replacement fuel use. \n     The impact on oil prices is therefore best answered by \n     answering the question, how much would prices rise if there \n     were no alternative and replacement fuel use? This \n     counterfactual analysis also requires an assumption about \n     OPEC behavior. It is assumed that there is no change in OPEC \n     behavior. In other words, oil supply by OPEC is held constant \n     at historical and AEO 2000 projected levels. Given the \n     relatively small amounts of alternative and replacement fuel \n     use, this assumption seems quite reasonable. Of course, in \n     reality OPEC could increase or decrease output. By increasing \n     output, OPEC would lower prices further, increasing the oil \n     market benefits. If OPEC cut production, say enough to \n     restore oil price to the prior levels, there would still be \n     oil market benefits, though they would be more difficult to \n     quantify. First, at lower production levels OPEC would have a \n     smaller market share and thus less market power than before. \n     This would make it more difficult for OPEC to create a price \n     shock, to raise prices further, and to maintain discipline \n     among its members. Second, the loss of wealth by the U.S. \n     economy due to monopoly pricing would be reduced, because \n     the U.S. would be consuming less imported oil. Thus, if \n     OPEC reacted to increased U.S. alternative and replacement \n     fuel use by further production cutbacks to restore the \n     price level, the nature and magnitude of oil market \n     benefits might change, but there would still be \n     significant benefits.\n       Two alternative ``what if'' scenarios were analyzed: (1) \n     what if there had been no alternative or replacement fuel use \n     after 1991? 2) what if, starting in 2001, alternative and \n     replacement fuel use increased to 10% of U.S. motor fuel use \n     by 2010? Actual U.S. alternative and replacement fuel use is \n     shown in table 2. Alternative fuel use increased from 230 \n     million gallons of gasoline equivalent in 1992 to 341 million \n     gallons in 1999, with usage of 368 million gallons projected \n     for 2000. Replacement fuel use increased from 2,106 million \n     gallons in 1992 to 4,311 million gallons in 1999 with usage \n     of 4,388 projected for 2000. As a fraction of total motor \n     fuel use, alternative and replacement fuels amounted to 1.57% \n     in 1992 and comprised 2.71% in 1999.\n\n[[Page S3134]]\n\n\n\n                                         TABLE 2.--ESTIMATED CONSUMPTION OF VEHICLE FUELS IN THE U.S., 1992-2000\n                                                        [Millions of gasoline-equivalent gallons]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                Fuel                     1992         1993         1994         1995         1996         1997         1998         1999         2000\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlternative........................          230          293          281          277          296          313          325          341          368\nOxygenates.........................        2,106        3,123        3,146        3,879        3,706        4,247        4,156        4,311        4,388\n                                    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total Motor Fuel...............      134,231      135,913      140,719      144,775      148,180      151,598      156,839      159,171      163,149\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: U.S. DOE/EIA, 2000, Alternatives to Traditional Transportation Fuels 1998, table 10, http//www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/alt-trans-\nfuel98/table10.html.\n\n       The first scenario assumes that there was no alternative or \n     replacement fuel use by highway vehicles, and that petroleum \n     use (before oil market equilibration) would increase by \n     exactly the amount of actual alternative and replacement fuel \n     use. Assuming OPEC production would not have changed, new \n     world oil prices, supplies and demands were computed for the \n     higher level of oil demand. The resulting price increases are \n     modest, because the 0.14 to 0.29 million barrels per day \n     (mmbd) of U.S. alternative and replacement fuel use is small \n     relative to the 67.5 to 77.9 mmbd of world petroleum \n     consumption over the 1992-2000 period. In 1992, oil prices \n     are estimated to be $0.08/barrel higher, rising to an $0.16/\n     bbl increment by 1999. Implied total oil cost savings from \n     alternative and replacement fuel use rise from $500 million \n     in 1999 to $1.3 billion by 2000, with a cumulative total \n     savings of 9.1 billion by 2000 (undiscounted 1998 dollars).\n       The impacts of increasing alternative and replacement fuel \n     use to 10% of motor fuel use by 2010 are estimated in a \n     similar way. The AEO 2000 forecast includes increasing levels \n     of alternative and replacement fuel use, but the projected \n     levels are far lower than 10% of total motor fuel use. Rather \n     than create an alternative world and U.S. oil market \n     projection, it is assumed that the AEO 2000 projection \n     contains no alternative or replacement fuel use. U.S. \n     petroleum demand is then lowered by an amounts which increase \n     gradually to 10% of motor fuel demand in 2010. Motor fuel \n     demand is assumed to increase at the rate of 1.5% per year \n     from 163.15 billion gallons in 2000 to 189.34 billion gallons \n     in 2010. Thus, alternative and replacement fuel use is \n     assumed to increase from its estimated 2000 level of 4.39 \n     billion gallons (0.29 mmbd) to 18.93 billion gallons (1.23 \n     mmbd) in 2010. As a result of the consequent reduction in \n     U.S. oil demand, world oil prices drop by approximately \n     $0.68/bbl in 2010. The estimated cumulative savings from 2000 \n     to 2010 is $35 billion.\n       Neither of these estimates takes into account the potential \n     benefits of increased alternative fuel use in mitigating the \n     impacts of possible future oil price shocks, or even reducing \n     the probability of oil price shocks. The size of the \n     potential benefits would depend not only on the size and \n     frequency of future price shocks, but on how much the \n     substitution of alternatives for petroleum increased the \n     price elasticity of demand for oil. Methods for making such \n     calculations have yet to be developed. As a result, the \n     numbers presented above should be considered lower bounds, in \n     the sense that they estimate only part of the full range of \n     oil market benefits of greater use of alternative and \n     replacement fuels. Likewise, no attempt is made here to \n     estimate the costs of increasing use of substitutes for \n     petroleum.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, these draft reports produced by the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy's Office of Transportation Technologies will \nfurther expose inaccuracies of these contentions that renewable fuel \nstandard will increase the cost of motor fuel.\n  As these reports conclude, the opposite is the truth. The first draft \nis entitled ``Oil Price Benefits of Increasing Replacement/Alternative \nFuel Market Share.'' The second draft is entitled ``The Impacts of \nAlternative and Replacement Fuel Use on Oil Prices.'' Allow me to read \nexcerpts for my colleagues.\n  The very first sentence of the first draft states:\n\n       Increasing the market share of alternative and replacement \n     transportation fuels would have significant energy security \n     and oil market benefits for the United States.\n\n  This Department of Energy analysis states further:\n\n       First, by reducing the quantity of petroleum consumed and \n     imported, they reduce the vulnerability of the economy to oil \n     price shocks.\n\n  The economic analysis continues with a second point. By increasing \nthe price responsiveness of oil demand, they reduce the market power of \nthe OPEC cartel, making it more difficult for OPEC to raise prices and \nto sustain these prices.\n  It is very obvious that should be our goal--that is our goal. Do we \nnot want to reduce the market power of OPEC? Do we not want to make it \nmore difficult for OPEC to raise prices? Is not the object of our \nenergy legislation to reduce the quantity of petroleum consumed and \nimported and to reduce the vulnerability of the economy to oil price \nshocks, particularly those caused by OPEC withdrawal of oil from the \nmarket?\n  If the Senate approves these killer amendments that are offered by \nour New York and California colleagues, OPEC will win; America will \nlose.\n  When the Department of Energy did this analysis, the market share for \nalternative replacement fuels amounted to only 3.6 percent of our motor \nfuel supply. About 2.6 percent was MTBE, about .7 was ethanol, and the \nremaining .3 came from propane, compressed natural gas, electricity, \nand others. That mere 3.6 percent, according to the Department of \nEnergy analysis, leveraged a reduction of the cost of oil by $1 per \nbarrel.\n  The Department of Energy study concluded that by using a mere 3.6 \npercent, alternative fuels saved Americans $7 billion a year. The study \nalso pointed out:\n\n       If the United States were to achieve the 10 percent \n     replacement fuel goal of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, oil \n     prices could be reduced by approximately $3 per barrel . . . \n     (with) savings of approximately $20 billion on an annual \n     basis.\n  The second draft offered more conservative estimates of consumer \nsavings but nevertheless stated that current alternative motor fuel use \nreduced total U.S. petroleum costs by $1.3 billion per year, and if we \nincreased usage to 10 percent by 2010, we would save $6 billion a year. \nWhether it is $20 billion a year or $6 billion a year, it is saving an \nawful lot of money for the consumers of America.\n\n  I appreciate the support of President Bush, as well as the Republican \nand Democrat leaderships in the Senate, in supporting and promoting \nrenewable fuels. In addition to bipartisan unity, however, Congress \nneeds to exhibit leadership that puts regional differences aside, for \nthe sake of all Americans.\n  I will never understand why some people are more worried about the \nfarmers and ethanol producers of the American Middle West than they are \nabout oil and MTBE produced from the Middle East. I will never \nunderstand why people use MTBE-industry-generated misinformation about \nprice spikes that, if taken to its logical conclusion, would argue that \nMTBE should not be banned, that drinking water contamination is no big \ndeal in California or New York. It is very baffling to me.\n  I firmly believe the renewable fuel standard benefits all Americans, \nparticularly including consumers in California. But even if California \nand New York do not get special treatment under this bill, would not my \ncolleagues rather do something to benefit America's Midwest instead of \ndoing things that continue to benefit the world's Middle East?\n  The opponents of ethanol suggest it costs too much or that it should \nbe taxed at a higher level. That is their complaint. They think a \ngallon of gasohol should be taxed at around 18 cents a gallon instead \nof 13 cents a gallon. They want to raise taxes on the consumer who uses \nethanol. For some reason, however, they choose to ignore the costs of \nthe status quo: Our ever-increasing vulnerability on imported oil. They \nchoose to ignore the real cost of imported oil.\n  Ten years ago, during debate on the Energy Policy Act of 1992, then-\nEnergy Committee Chairman Senator Johnston of Louisiana reported that \nthe United States was subsidizing imported oil to the tune of $200 per \nbarrel.\n  Former Navy Secretary Lehman estimated the defense cost of protecting \nMiddle East supply lines at around $40 billion a year, and we all know \nwhat the Persian Gulf war was about. It has been pointed out by \nnumerous energy experts, including the ranking Republican of the Senate \nEnergy Committee, that the Persian Gulf war was about oil.\n  So I hope my colleagues from California and New York will ponder on\n\n[[Page S3135]]\n\nthis truth: Not one of our sons or daughters who have proudly donned \nthe military uniforms of the United States has ever lost his or her \nlife or limb. None of our children has ever shed their blood to protect \nethanol supply lines and the production of ethanol.\n  What value might my colleagues place on that, that there has been no \nloss of life in this country and that there has been loss of life \nelsewhere protecting our oil lines? I will be in shock if we cannot all \nagree that reducing the risks to our sons and daughters, the risk of \nthem losing life and limb trying to protect Middle East oil supply \nlines, is worth far more than the few cents a gallon that was \nmentioned, albeit incorrectly, as the increased cost of using renewable \nfuels.\n  My New York and California colleagues used the term ``mandate'' much \nduring the debate. None of us likes mandates. I, for one, did not like \nmandating sending our sons and daughters to defend Middle East oil \nsupply lines.\n  I heard one talk about market principles. What market principles are \ninvolved when supply must be protected by military escort to the tune \nof what Secretary Lehman said, $40 billion a year?\n  We also hear complaints about the highway trust fund, that it does \nnot collect enough revenue because gasohol is not taxed highly enough. \nOne has to wonder why my colleagues are not equally upset by the fact \nthat billions of dollars from the highway trust fund are diverted away \nfrom highway construction and instead used for mass transit subsidies \nof California and New York. Before we increase taxes on motorists, I \nsuggest it makes more sense to first put a stop to this transfer of \nwealth from highway users to subsidize cities' mass transit users. At \nthe same time, I wonder if our colleagues have ever considered that \nmass transit subsidies are justified for the same reason as charging \nlower taxes on gasohol.\n  Are we not in both cases trying to reduce our dependence upon foreign \noil imports? Why are subsidies to encourage mass transit ridership in \nNew York and California OK, but subsidies to encourage all Americans to \nuse gasohol somehow not okay?\n  Ten years have passed since we took up and enacted the Energy Policy \nAct of 1992. Given the fact that our dependence upon foreign imports \nhas increased substantially, I think we can agree that the Energy \nPolicy Act was a dismal failure. Part of the reason we failed was that \nwe let regional bickering get in the way of pulling together a \ncomprehensive energy plan that is good for every American.\n  We do not dare fail again, as we did in 1992, and that is why I urge \nmy colleagues to defeat these anti-renewable-fuel-standard amendments \nthat are before us.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the amendment \noffered by the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, to strike the \nethanol mandate from the fuels title and to address comments that have \nbeen made in opposition to the fuels title contained in the Senate \nenergy bill currently before us. I want to share my perspective on the \nfuels title as a Midwestern Senator who has had a cautious record on \nextending Federal subsidies for ethanol production. But I also come to \nthe floor as a Senator who represents a State that is part of the only \nmarket for reformulated gasoline--or RFG--that sells entirely ethanol \nblends, the Chicago-Milwaukee market, and as a Senator who supports the \nClean Air Act. We need to make certain that there are adequate supplies \nof ethanol so that when State bans on MTBE go into effect the short \nsupplies of ethanol for Chicago and Milwaukee aren't stretched even \nfurther. It is appropriate that we ramp up that production over time, \nas the fuels title would do.\n  Despite the speculation by opponents of this title about policy \nreasons for using ethanol in reformulated gasoline, we use solely \nethanol blended RFG in Wisconsin because of consumer preference due to \npublic health concerns. Unlike other jurisdictions that continue today \nto use reformulated gas containing the additive methyl tertiary butyl \nether, or MTBE, the citizens of the six non-attainment counties in \nSoutheastern Wisconsin switched within the first month of the RFG \nprogram to ethanol blends.\n  This consumer demand was overwhelming. The EPA Regional Office in \nChicago and my office received thousands of calls from individuals in \nSoutheastern Wisconsin during the first week of February 1995, when the \nreformulated gasoline program was first implemented nationwide. Phone \ncalls to my offices were coming in at rates of dozens per hour, and \nseveral hundred constituents contacted me to share their experiences. \nMost callers said that reformulated gasoline containing MTBE was making \nthem ill.\n  The rest of the country now shares Wisconsin's concerns about MTBE's \neffect on health and the environment, and several States have acted to \nban MTBE. These State bans on MTBE are having and will continue to have \nserious consequences for fuel markets, especially if the oxygenate \nrequirements remain in place which they will unless this title passes. \nAs ethanol is the second most used oxygenate, it is likely that it \nwould be used to replace MTBE. But, quite simply, as even the \nproponents of this amendment acknowledge, there is not currently enough \nU.S. ethanol production capacity to meet the potential demand to \nreplace the 3.8 billion gallons of MTBE used annually in reformulated \nfuel. The mandate in the energy bill seeks to create and guarantee a \nnationwide supply of ethanol to meet this new demand.\n  The fuel provisions in the energy bill require a uniform phase-down \nof the use of MTBE as an additive to produce reformulated gas, remove \nthe oxygen content requirement for reformulated gas, and put in place a \nnationwide renewable fuels standard--or RFS--that will phase-in \ngradually over a number of years. These provisions provide for a more \norderly and cost-effective solution to the MTBE issue than State-by-\nState action. Because individual States are banning or are considering \nbanning the use of MTBE, without the action in this title, the existing \nFederal oxygenate requirement for RFG will increase the cost of \ncomplying with these bans and lead to an inefficient pattern of fuel-\ntype by State.\n  In his floor statements, my colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, \nread at length the cost increases that ethanol RFG use would have on \nseveral States. My constituents are well aware of the 5-cent estimate \nof cost increase due to the use of reformulated fuel containing ethanol \ncited by the Senator from New York and have already paid for that \nincrease and much more. And what has caused that price increase is, \nquite simply, limited supply.\n  Before the start of the second phase of the reformulated gas program \nin 2000, when the reformulated fuels were required to be cleaner, \nestimates of the increased cost to produce the blend stock for ethanol-\nblended RFG ranged from 2 to 4 cents per gallon, to as much as 5 to 8 \ncents per gallon. In summer 2000, RFG prices in Chicago and Milwaukee \nwere considerably higher than RFG prices in other areas, ranging from \n11 to 26 cents higher, in part due to the higher production cost of \nproducing ethanol RFG just for this market. To decrease the potential \nfor price spikes, on March 15, 2001, EPA changed its enforcement \nguidelines to allow for the blending of cleaner burning reformulated \ngasoline containing ethanol during the summer months. Nevertheless, we \nare continuing to see gas prices again increase in Wisconsin as the \ntime for having summer reformulated fuels at the pump grows closer. We \nin Wisconsin see States that are banning MTBE as reaching for our small \nand limited supply of ethanol RFG. Congress must act to make certain \nthat our supplies increase.\n  Despite all indications that the energy bill fuels title will produce \nsufficient ethanol supplies to meet the needs of a State's banning MTBE \nand will not increase prices, the bill includes additional safeguards. \nPrior to 2004, the Department of Energy is to conduct a study to \ndetermine whether the bill is likely to significantly harm consumers in \n2004. If the Department determines this to be the case, then the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency must reduce the volume of the renewable \nfuels mandate for 2004. Also, upon petition of a State or by EPA's own \ndetermination, and in consultation with DOE and USDA, EPA may waive the \nrenewable fuels standard, in whole or in part, if it determines the \nstandard would severely harm the economy or environment of a State, a \nregion, or\n\n[[Page S3136]]\n\nthe United States, or if there is an inadequate domestic supply or \ndistribution capacity to meet the requirement.\n  In addition to the ethanol mandate, there are other provisions in the \nfuels title that would improve fungibility of RFG nationwide, by \nstandardizing volatile organic compound--or VOC--reduction \nrequirements. In practice, when combined with the energy bill's \nrenewable fuels mandate, this would enable the part of Wisconsin that \nuses Federal RFG to draw on supplies of Federal RFG from other areas, \nsuch as St. Louis and Detroit, if necessary. The ability to rely on \nother sources of RFG is especially important when sudden supply \nshortages arise due to unexpected events, such as refinery fires or \npipeline breakdowns, which we in Wisconsin have also experienced. The \nfuels language in the energy bill would help address this problem by \nbringing other areas that use Federal RFG in line with Wisconsin's \nblend by standardizing VOC reduction requirements nationwide.\n  With State bans on the books and a continuation of the Federal RFG \noxygen requirement, we face a serious ethanol shortfall. Consumers want \nand deserve affordable gasoline and clean air. We cannot let this bill \ngo by and not do everything we can to achieve this goal. I urge my \ncolleagues, even those who have concerns about ethanol, to think \nseriously about how we meet our obligations under the Clean Air Act \nwithout these provisions and to rethink efforts to strip this language \nfrom the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nuntil 6 p.m. today be divided with respect to Schumer amendment No. \n3030 and that the time be divided as follows: Ten minutes each under \nthe control of Senators Schumer and Feinstein; 20 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Wellstone; and 10 minutes under the control of \nSenator Murkowski; that at 6 p.m. today, without further intervening \naction or debate, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the \namendment, with no intervening amendment in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Iowa for \nreminding Members we are talking about considerable expense to the \ntaxpayer, providing a domestic source of energy that would ordinarily \ncome from the technological advancements of looking for oil either \noffshore or on land. We already had a debate on ANWR; I will not go \nback into that.\n  However, I call my colleagues' attention to a couple of realities. I \nam sympathetic to the concerns raised by the Senators from California \nand New York. I don't like mandates of any kind. I find it ironic that \nthe same Senators who voted for a renewable portfolio standard argue \nagainst a renewable fuel standard. This forces some $88 billion in \nhigher costs to consumers and forces consumers in California and New \nYork to pay 3 cents per kilowatt for electricity they are not going to \nuse.\n  Again, I ask why they voted for the renewable portfolio standards. No \nnew energy supply was created, no national security benefit. So \nalthough we do not like mandates, the renewable portfolio standards \nhave increased our energy supply. As the Senator from Iowa said, it \ncertainly enhances our national security.\n  If we are not going to have the courage to develop our domestic oil \nand gas reserves in an environmentally sound manner, the only option we \nhave to extend our supply is to reduce dependence on imported oil in \nprovisions such as ethanol. Again, mandates I find unacceptable, but \nthey are a part of the price. We simply don't have to pay for our \nfailure to develop domestic resources.\n  Consequently, I remain in opposition to the amendment of the Senators \nfrom New York and California. Different regions of the country have \ndifferent points of view on energy, and alternative fuels are \nrecognized in this body, but most Members thought any deal between the \noil industry and the American farmers was doomed at one time. I think \nthis proposal proves them wrong. I am basically opposed to gutting the \namendment before the Senate.\n  One of the things I am particularly opposed to, after a discussion of \ngasoline prices, was the issue of whose figures are right. The Energy \nInformation Agency supports using those figures, addressing some of the \namendments that are before the Senate. The point is, where did the \nreport come from? We asked for it. I asked the Energy Information \nAgency to study different provisions of the bill because the Senate \ncommittees were denied the chance to mark up the bill in committee, as \nwe have discussed previously.\n  The Senate leadership and I have had strong and opposing words about \nthe energy bill consideration. As for ethanol, on the other hand, I \nthink we have collectively tried to do what is right for the country, \nas part of a comprehensive bill. What has driven all parties to this \nagreement is the price of gasoline.\n  We want fair prices for consumers. If States ban MTBE and don't use \nethanol, the price of gasoline is certainly going do go up. That is not \nwhat the ethanol part of this bill does.\n  Senator Daschle and I wrote a letter asking the EIA for clarification \non what their report said about the impact of ethanol in the MTBE \nprovisions of the bill. I ask unanimous consent the letter dated April \n12 from the Department of Energy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Department of Energy,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Energy and Natural \n         Resources, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: Enclosed is an analysis responding \n     to your and Senator Daschle's April 10, 2002, request to \n     analyze the provisions of Senate Bill 517 (The Energy Policy \n     Act of 2002) requiring a four-year phase down of the use of \n     methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and a ten-year ramp-up in \n     the amount of renewable fuels included in gasoline. Per your \n     request, we have provided results of: 1) a 14-State ban on \n     the use of MTBE based on those States that have already \n     banned the use of MTBE, 2) a Northeast State ban on MTBE in \n     2004 along with the 14-state ban which is the Reference Case \n     of this study, 3) the provisions of S. 517 requiring an MTBE \n     ban with State waivers including the provisions of the above \n     two cases, and 4) no MTBE ban, but including the renewable \n     fuel requirement. We implemented the State waiver provision \n     in S. 517 according to your instructions of assuming the \n     continual use of MTBE in gasoline at 13 percent for the \n     remaining States. This results in an effective MTBE reduction \n     of 87 percent. We did not implement the banking and trading \n     provisions of the Bill because of the complex modeling \n     required and your need for immediate results. We have found \n     from our other analyses that banking results in meeting the \n     required targets at a later date than without banking, and \n     that trading lowers the cost of the provision because it \n     allows for the least cost entities to meet the requirements \n     first. Thus, the results below should be treated as an upper \n     bound on the price impacts.\n       The results indicate:\n       That reformulated gasoline (RFG) prices are projected to \n     increase in 2006 by about 4 cents per gallon because of a 14 \n     State ban on MTBE, by an additional 2 cents per gallon if the \n     remaining Northwest States ban MTBE (for a total of 6 cents \n     per gallon), and by an additional 2 cents per gallon if S. \n     517 is passed and the assumed States exercise the waiver \n     option (for a total of 8 cents per gallon);\n       The comparable numbers for average prices of all gasoline \n     in 2006 are an increase of: about 2 cents per gallon for the \n     14-State Ban, an additional 0.5 cents per gallon when the \n     remaining Northeast States ban MTBE (total of 2.5 to 3 cents \n     per gallon), an additional 0.5 cents per gallon when the \n     State waiver provisions of S. 517 are assumed (3 to 3.5 cents \n     per gallon).\n       Assuming a Renewable Fuel Standard (FTS) without an MTBE \n     ban has much less impact on prices. An RFS increases RFG \n     prices by less than 1 cent per gallon and increases the \n     average prices for all gasoline by less than 0.5 cent per \n     gallon. This is the same finding that was in our original \n     analysis.\n       If you have further questions, please contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Mary J. Hutzler,\n\n                                             Acting Administrator,\n                                Energy Information Administration.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I refer to the last paragraph on the first page of \nthat letter.\n\n       The results indicate:\n       That reformulated gasoline (RFG) prices are projected to \n     increase in 2006 by about 4 cents per gallon because of a 14 \n     State ban on MTBE, by an additional 2 cents per gallon if the \n     remaining Northeast States bang MTBE (for a total of 6 cents \n     per gallon), and by an additional 2 cents per gallon if S. \n     517 is passed and the assumed States exercise a waiver option \n     (for total of 8 cents per gallon);\n\n[[Page S3137]]\n\n       Assuming a Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) without an MTBE \n     ban has much less impact on prices.\n\n  That is a reasonable explanation relative to the alleged costs \nassociated with ethanol that is really associated with the MTBE \nprovisions.\n  Further, it is fair to say the farmers previously supported our \nopening of ANWR as part of the comprehensive bill. I thank them for \nthat support, because the bottom line is reducing our dependence.\n  I make one point, however, since I have had a long history and some \nassociation with charts. As we recall in the ANWR debate, we had quite \na discussion about footprints. Let me show one chart, the footprint \nassociated with ethanol. The point is, there is no free ride on \nfootprints. This happens to be a chart which shows the comparison. If \nyou had 2,000 acres of grain corn in an ethanol farm, you would produce \nthe energy equivalent to 25 barrels a day. If you had 2,000 acres of \nANWR production, you would be producing a million barrels of oil a day.\n  As we look at the expansion of ethanol and its contribution to our \nnational security in relieving us of the dependence on imported \nsources, it would take 80 million acres of farmland, or all of New \nMexico and Connecticut, to produce as much energy as 2,000 acres of \nANWR.\n  So, there is a comparison, whether we talk of popcorn or oil. \nObviously, there is a footprint.\n  With that profound observation, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  Let me start not with a disclaimer but just to be clear. My State of \nMinnesota is a leader in ethanol production. We have 14 ethanol plants, \nof which 12 are owned and operated by farmer co-ops. Last year, the \ntotal production from Minnesota ethanol was 200 million gallons, which \nwas 95 percent of our State's ethanol needs.\n  After having said that, because this is so important to Minnesota, so \nimportant to farm country, so important to what we call greater \nMinnesota, I make some other arguments that go beyond Minnesota.\n  Expanded ethanol production promises to relieve us from some of our \ndependence on foreign energy supplies. With the current cost of home \nheating oil and gasoline going up, every American knows the value of \nachieving more energy independence. Ethanol is important to achieving \nenergy independence.\n  Some of my colleagues say: Of course you are for ethanol, Paul, given \nyou represent Minnesota. But I can make a lot of good public interest \narguments for ethanol.\n  Second, expanded ethanol production provides a clean fuel which can \nbe relatively pollution-free; that is certainly not the case with oil. \nAs United States negotiators hammer out agreements--I hope--over global \nclimate change, we are being constantly reminded of the long-term \nenvironmental costs of fossil fuel use.\n  We have, A, energy independence; and, B, a compelling environmental \ncase. Also, because ethanol is oxygen-rich when added to gasoline, it \nburns cleaner, reducing the amount of harmful tailpipe emissions in the \nair. Fewer toxins, carcinogens enter your lungs. So better health is a \nthird compelling public interest argument for ethanol. Finally, ethanol \nmeans rural development, bringing employment to a lot of the parts of \nour country where people are hurting the most. A recent study by \nNorthwestern University concluded that nationwide, ethanol production \nboosts employment by 195,000 jobs, it improves America's balance of \ntrade by $2 billion, and it adds $450 million to State tax receipts.\n\n  There are a lot of compelling arguments that can be made. In \nMinnesota, it creates jobs for Minnesotans. In fact, Minnesota has the \nNation's most significant cooperative--I am really proud of that--\nethanol industry owned by more than 7,000 Minnesota farm families.\n  I want to go back to the argument about energy independence, and I \nwill make it in a different context. The whole war on terrorism has \nrenewed interest, as it should, in reducing the energy imports and \ndiversifying our energy sector. Oil imports today account for 56 \npercent of our oil consumption. The EIA estimates that our import \ndependency could grow to 70 percent by 2020--70 percent of our oil \nproduction imports by 2020. We spend more than $300 million a day for \nimported oil, with an annual cost of more than $100 billion imported \noil.\n  Alarmingly, Iraq represents the fastest growing source of United \nStates oil imports, exporting 700,000 barrels per day to the United \nStates. We send Saddam Hussein more than $12 million per day--$4.3 \nbillion annually--for his oil.\n  I do not know that I need to make any more of this case. I just don't \nsee the point of subsidizing terrorism through the importation of oil \nfrom rogue nations. American agriculture, rural America, has part of \nthe answer for energy independence. As to environmental benefits, I \nwill make the point again. Ethanol continues to be an important tool \nfor improving air quality in our Nation's cities. Ethanol reduces all \nthe criteria of pollutants--carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, NOx, toxics, \nand particulates--all of them. The benefits are going to continue. \nStudies show that ethanol reduces emissions of carbon monoxide and \nhydrocarbons by 20 percent and particulates in the air by 40 percent.\n  So there is a compelling case to make for Minnesota, a compelling \ncase to make for our co-ops and family farmers. Value-added \nagriculture? You had better believe it. But a compelling case to make \nfor the country: More energy independence, less dependence on Middle \nEastern oil; in addition, much better for the environment; and some \ncompelling public health reasons.\n  The final point is that this renewable fuel standard will cause price \nspikes. I don't get this. The EIA, which is the independent research \narm of the Department of Energy, released a report last week on what \nwould be the price impact of this RFS standard which is before us in \nthe Senate. Their analysis says that requiring renewables would add \nabout one-half cent per gallon to the price of gasoline--a half a cent. \nThis is not renewable fuels organizations. I am talking about the EIA, \nU.S. Energy Information Administration, the independent research arm of \nthe Department of Energy. That is what we get.\n  Finally, I have heard arguments that farmers do not benefit from this \nrenewable fuel standard. That is simply wrong. If we use corn, \nsoybeans, and other commodities grown on farms as the feedstock for \nrenewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel, then farmers benefit, \nrural America benefits. The farmers who benefit in Minnesota are not \nmonopolies. I am not talking about ADM. I am talking about farmer co-\nops.\n  Companies owned by farmers are creating most of the new production in \nethanol. I think Senator Dayton made this point earlier. Today, 61 \nethanol facilities produce more than 2.3 billion gallons of ethanol, \nand 26 percent of these facilities are farmer owned. Additionally, \nthere are 14 ethanol facilities under construction, of which 11 are \nfarmer owned.\n  So the only thing I can tell you is that this requirement of 5 \nbillion gallons ethanol biodiesel, as you look to the future--I will \nsay it right now. I do not want to offend anybody. I wish ADM did not \nhave the control. Thank goodness it is actually less and less a \npercentage of locally owned market control, but they still have way too \nmuch. I am not in favor of oligopoly or monopoly. But there are a lot \nof farmer co-ops that are formed. This is very good for farm country, \nvery good for family farmers, very good for economic development in our \nrural communities.\n  Frankly, it is win-win-win. It is a win for energy independence, it \nis a win for public health, it is a win for the environment, it is a \nwin for family farmers, and it is a win for Minnesota, the last point \nbeing the most important.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would like to sum up on behalf of \nthe sponsors of this amendment. The amendment deletes this particular \nrenewable fuel mandate from the bill.\n  This is a tripling of ethanol. It may be fine in the Midwest where \nall the facilities that produce ethanol are located, but for those of \nus on the west coast and those of us on the east coast, it is truly \negregious.\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\n  One of the reasons it is egregious is that we don't have the \ninfrastructure to really accept it. Another reason is that, for many of \nus, our gasoline is already reformulated and already meets clean air \nstandards and therefore we are forced to use a specific product, \nethanol, way in excess of what is necessary.\n  Sure, we want to be relieved from the MTBE oxygenate requirement. But \nto replace it with a renewable fuels requirement that mandates a \ntripling of this additive on States that do not need it imposes some \nvery substantial detriments.\n  I would like to read from the letter from the Governor of California. \nI know there are a lot of people who are experts on California in this \nbody, but I think the Governor's position also bears scrutiny. He \npoints out that:\n\n       While the [California Energy Commission's] Fall 2001 survey \n     indicated that there may be adequate ethanol production \n     capacity in the Midwest to meet California demand, both the \n     [California Energy Commission] and its independent experts \n     concluded that the infrastructure necessary to deliver \n     ethanol and distribute it within California is not in place. \n     Specifically, they pointed out the following problems:\n       Lack of unit-train off-loading facilities for ethanol in \n     California; lack of storage tanks at distribution terminals; \n     inadequate rail and marine capacity for handling ethanol; \n     inadequate facilities to transport ethanol from marine \n     terminals to inland distribution points.\n       Furthermore, the two-year delay in the decision by the \n     federal government on California's request for a waiver of \n     the oxygenate requirement has delayed completion of the \n     infrastructure changes necessary to make a successful \n     transition to ethanol within our current timeframe.\n\n  It also goes on to point out that:\n\n       California's Air Resources Board reformulated fuel \n     standards--so critical to California's air quality--make it \n     nearly impossible to replace gasoline with supplies from \n     other states. In 2004 and 2005, a more stringent federal \n     reformulated fuel standard begins to phase in, which will \n     make it easier to import cleaner burning gasoline from \n     other states and maintain California's strict air quality \n     standards.\n  The point is, we can do a lot of this without tripling of ethanol.\n  The letter goes on to point out California has:\n       Limited refining capacity--California refineries have been \n     running at operating rates approaching 95 percent of their \n     nameplate capacity which, in effect, means California's \n     refineries are operating at maximum levels now. Without new \n     capacity, California cannot replace the volume lost by \n     replacing MTBE with ethanol. In 2005, the Longhorn pipeline \n     and other pipeline projects will be completed, freeing up \n     California fuel that is now being shipped to Arizona.\n\n  The point of this is that ethanol absorbs more gasoline. It needs \nmore gasoline. MTBE needs less gasoline.\n  California's refining plants are at capacity. Therefore, it cannot \nrefine enough gasoline to take the amount of ethanol that we are \nrequired to take under this bill. That is the rub. It is a kind of \nstrict mandated formula all across the Nation.\n  I can't believe people think this is good public policy. I can't \nbelieve people think the lack of flexibility in this policy is good for \nall States. Every State is in a different position with respect to \nethanol. Some can absorb it. Some can't. Some need it. Some don't.\n  It seems to me that the key is the clean air standards in the Clean \nAir Act. If you can meet those clean air standards in other ways, good \npolicy would allow a State to have that capacity.\n  This, in essence, is a selfish public policy. It is selfish just for \na specific area of the United States that produces it, that has the \nplants there, that has the producers there, and, therefore, has \nadequate supply and adequate infrastructure. That is why we will move \nto delete this from the bill. Obviously, we don't expect to win it, but \nwe expect to make the case. And I believe we have.\n  After this amendment is considered, it will be my intent--if I need \nto wait, I will wait--to call up the 90-day waiver amendment, which \nSenator Daschle has offered, and also the amendment which would produce \na 1-year delay in the mandate which Senator Daschle has said he is \nagreeable to, and see what happens with these two amendments.\n  By and large, as somebody who has been in public life for 30 years \nnow, as a lifelong Californian, to be part of a body that places my \nState in this kind of jeopardy in terms of loss of revenues from the \nhighway trust fund, which is probably the most vital Federal \nappropriations we have, from a State that produces much more in taxes \nthan we get back in services from the Federal Government, and to create \na loss in the highway trust fund, and in all probability a gas tax \nhike--the Senator from Iowa particularly criticized us using a study to \nshow the gas tax.\n  The reason we don't agree with the Energy Information Office study is \nbecause the Energy Information Office study does not account for \nproblems with infrastructure or market concentration as criteria in \nevaluating any impact that this would have on increased fuel prices.\n  I see the Senator from New York on the floor. I know he wishes to sum \nup as well.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I have 10 minutes. But we will finish \nahead of time. Because not everyone used their time, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the order be modified so that in addition to my 10 \nminutes, the Senator from South Dakota could have 5 minutes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I thank my colleague from New York for \nhis gracious willingness to allow me to make a few remarks about this \npending amendment.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment on the renewable fuels \nstandard.\n  The Senate energy bill contains a landmark renewable fuels standard \nthat is an essential part of a sound national energy policy. The bill \nprovides for an orderly phase-down of MTBE use, removal of the oxygen \ncontent requirement for reformulated gasoline--RFG--and the \nestablishment of a nationwide renewable fuels standard--RFS--that will \nbe phased in over the next decade. The standard has strong bipartisan \nsupport and is the result of long and comprehensive negotiations \nbetween farm groups, the American Petroleum Institute, and coastal and \nMidwestern States. It is the first time that a substantive agreement \nhas been reached on an issue that will reduce our dependency on foreign \noil and greatly improve the Nation's energy security.\n  I have spoken in the past about the benefits of renewable fuels. \nThese home-grown fuels will improve our energy security and provide a \ndirect benefit for the agricultural economy of South Dakota and other \nrural States. The new standard is largely based on legislation that I \nintroduced with Senator Chuck Hagel. The leadership of Senators Daschle \nand Bingaman resulted in the consensus legislation on this issue.\n  The consensus package would ensure future growth for ethanol and \nbiodiesel through the creation of a new, renewable fuels content \nstandard in all motor fuel produced and used in the United States. \nToday, ethanol and biodiesel comprise less than 1 percent of all \ntransportation fuel in the United States, 1.8 billion gallons is \ncurrently produced in the United States. The consensus package would \nrequire that 5 billions gallons of transportation fuel be comprised of \nrenewable fuel by 2012--nearly a tripling of the current ethanol \nproduction.\n  I don't need to convince anyone in South Dakota and other rural \nStates of the benefits of ethanol to the environment and the economies \nof rural communities. We have many plants in South Dakota and more are \nbeing planned. These farmer-owned ethanol plants in South Dakota, and \nin neighboring States, demonstrate the hard work and commitment being \nexpended to serve a growing market for clean domestic fuels.\n  The new standard does not require that a single gallon of renewable \nfuel must be used in any particular State or region. Moreover, the \nlanguage includes credit trading provisions that give refiners \nflexibility to meet the standard's requirements. In no way is this \nintended to penalize California, New York, or any other region in the \ncountry.\n  Much has been made on the Senate floor and in the press recently \nabout the possibility of additional costs that could be incurred when \nthe new standard is enacted into law. I understand the concerns raised \nby the Senators from California and New York. This is a major change in \nthe makeup of our transportation fuel. However, the goal of the \nagreement that has been reached\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\non this title is to phase in the renewable fuels standard in a manner \nthat is fair to every region of the country.\n  The ban on MTBE and the elimination the oxygenate standard are two \nchanges that Californians, New Yorkers, and others have sought for \nyears. The goal of this agreement is not to raise gas prices, but to \ndiversify our energy infrastructure and increase the number of fuel \noptions. This helps to increase our energy security, increase \ncompetition and reduce consumer costs of gasoline.\n  Moreover, little has been made about the source of information that \nhas been cited to alarm Members or about its potential impacts about \nthe consequences of failing to enact these provisions. Senators from \nNew York and California have distributed charts and spoken on the \nfloor, claiming that the renewable fuels standard will increase \nconsumer costs by 4 to 10 cents per gallon. The source of this data is \nthe MTBE consulting firm, Hart/IRI, which claims it based its cost \nestimates on data from the Energy Information Administration.\n  EIA has completed two analyses of the fuels provisions of S. 517. The \nfirst, completed in February on the original provisions of the bill, \nfound that the MTBE ban could increase gasoline costs by 4 to 10 cents \nper gallon, while the renewable fuels standard could increase gasoline \ncosts by 1 cent per gallon in reformulated gasoline--RFG--areas and a \nhalf cent per gallon overall. Hart/IRI lumped these costs together and \nattributed them solely to the use of renewable fuels, making that \nprovision appear to be roughly 10 times more expensive than it is.\n  The second EIA analysis on the new compromise agreement found that, \nbecause 14 States already have banned MTBE, the incremental costs of \nthe MTBE ban in S. 517 would be only 2 to 4 cents per gallon, while the \ncost of the renewable fuels provision would be less than a penny per \ngallon in RFG areas and less than a half cent per gallon overall. The \nanalysis did not consider the positive economic effects of the banking \nand trading provisions of the bill, which the American Petroleum \nInstitute has said will reduce the costs to less than one-third of a \ncent per gallon.\n\n  The difference between the Hart/IRI analysis and the EIA analysis is \nnot surprising. Hart/IRI is an MTBE consultant whose business depends \non the continued existence of the MTBE industry. Since the fuels \ncompromise bans MTBE, Hart/IRI has every incentive to exaggerate and \nmisrepresent the cost impacts of the legislation. It is unfortunate and \nironic that some Members have misinterpreted the data from this \nanalysis.\n  The renewable fuels standard in S. 517 addresses the difficulties \nthat States have encountered in meeting Federal gasoline requirements, \nwhile promoting the use of home-grown fuels that will reduce our \nNation's dependency on foreign oil. Any further attempts to reduce or \neliminate the standard should be opposed so that we can move forward \nand improve our Nation's energy security.\n  The inclusion of the renewable fuels standard will result in cleaner \nair, more jobs across America, a better trade balance for the United \nStates, less reliance on the politics of very troubled parts of the \ncountry, fewer gallons of oil imported from Saddam Hussein, and it will \nresult in better prices for our farmers and overall be a major plus as \nour Nation moves in the direction of renewable fuels.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I believe I have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I will get into the substance of this \namendment once again, but before I do, I alert my colleagues to one \nparticular provision that is in the bill that is particularly odious, \nand that is a pretty strong accomplishment given how many pretty odious \nprovisions there are in this bill. But this is the ethanol gas tax safe \nharbor provision. The chart I have shows what it says. It is adding \ninsult to injury to make a deal with the petroleum industry, which has \nalways opposed ethanol. They have given them a safe harbor so you \ncannot sue if an additive causes pollution of the ground water. So here \nwe are.\n  And I beg to disagree with my colleague from South Dakota, and \nothers. This bill abolishes MTBE. The Schumer amendment does not change \nthat. So anyone who likes MTBE is not going to be for either the bill \nor my amendment.\n  The reason so many States have abolished MTBE--and this bill does--is \nthat it pollutes, and all of a sudden we are giving the petroleum \nindustry a total safe harbor exemption from being sued, even if they \nknowingly pollute. Can you imagine that?\n  Senator Boxer has an amendment to get rid of that, but we do not even \nknow if she will be able to offer it. Therefore, if you do not like \nthis safe harbor, the one sure way of making sure that this safe harbor \nis eliminated is to vote for the Schumer amendment, which not only gets \nrid of the ethanol mandate but also this particularly odious safe \nharbor.\n  I am utterly amazed that so many on my side, who believe in the right \nto sue, are going to vote to keep this particular safe harbor, all to \nsubsidize ethanol.\n\n  I guess, in a certain sense, this is a regional fight.\n  I have looked at who has spoken out for the ethanol mandate and not a \nsingle person comes outside of this Middle West region. So if you think \nthe decision is totally on the merits, just look at this chart: 98 \npercent of the ethanol comes from this particular region. No wonder the \npeople from the Middle West want it. Although, I will tell you this. \nWhen Iowa and Nebraska legislators were given a chance to mandate MTBE \nin their States, they rejected it. They rejected it because they knew \ntheir drivers would pay more. Even in States with so many corn farmers, \nthe legislators said no. The editorial opinion throughout the States \nwas against it.\n  That is another thing that makes me incredulous about this amendment, \nthat it is not done in the Middle West by its own States. Yet they are \nimposing it on everybody else.\n  In New York, I think we are the largest producer of cabbage in the \ncountry. Maybe we should mandate that the rest of the country buy our \ncabbage. California is probably the biggest producer of almonds in the \ncountry. Maybe we should say that you have to buy almonds in the other \n49 States. By the way, if you do not want almonds, you like cashews, \nyou are still going to have to buy an almond credit; so you will have \nto pay for it. Or maybe you like peaches, where South Carolina and \nGeorgia and Pennsylvania lead. Maybe we should require the whole \ncountry to buy peaches.\n  This is utterly amazing, I say to my colleagues. One region of the \ncountry requires everybody else to buy ethanol.\n  Both my colleagues and friends from South Dakota and Minnesota argue \nthis will not cost that much. If it will not cost that much, how come \nyou have to mandate it? If this is so good, why do you require us to do \nit? If the market is going to work, and these other additives are more \nexpensive, let it.\n  Well, we think something is rotten in Denmark.\n  I do not think the people here who are for this mandate believe it is \ngoing to be so inexpensive or they would not have done a mandate. Let \nme tell you, ethanol is going to be a more valued commodity the minute \nwe ban MTBEs nationwide because it is the only other additive that is \nproduced domestically.\n  We believe that in New York we can reformulate our gasoline without \nan oxygenate. We are not given the chance to do that, even though it \nwould be cleaner, it would be environmentally preferred, and it would \nbe cheaper. There would still be plenty of other places that it would \nbe in their market interest to buy ethanol.\n  Also, my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, talked about the \nhighway trust fund. That is decreased. It is very hard, my colleagues, \nto think of an amendment that has bad provision after bad provision \nafter bad provision.\n  I guess another thing I call this amendment is the ``piling on \nprovision.'' Not only do you mandate ethanol, not only do you provide a \nsafe harbor for polluters, not only do you deplete the highway trust \nfund, but, to boot, you raise our gas prices 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 cents a \ngallon.\n  My colleagues say this study is an MTBE-based study. We are \nabolishing\n\n[[Page S3140]]\n\nMTBE. Anybody who wants MTBE is not going to be for this amendment.\n  My colleagues from Minnesota and South Dakota have brought up a straw \nhorse. Yes, if it were MTBE or ethanol, I would guess ethanol would \nwin. But there are other alternatives, and those other alternatives, in \na classic way that a free market economy should not work but a planned, \nsocialistic, fascistic economy would work are being mandated. We do not \ndo that for virtually anything else.\n\n  Do we set clean air standards? Yes. My good friend from South Dakota \nsaid there is a mandate on CAFE standards. That is correct. But we do \nnot say the only way you can meet the CAFE standards is that you have \nto use aluminum or you have to use plastic. We set a standard and then \nlet the market meet that standard.\n  That is all we are asking: Set a clean air standard. Require us all \nto meet it. Get rid of polluting materials such as MTBE, but do not say \nthe only road to salvation is ethanol, although I know many of my \ncolleagues truly believe that.\n  We always get on the floor and debate about working families. To me, \nthis amendment, simply put, is: Whose side are you on? Are you on the \nside of working families who struggle and raise their gas tax 5, 6, 7, \n8, 9, 10 cents--that is during good times--and then during spikes raise \ntheir gas prices 25, 30, 40 cents? Are you on the side of working \nfamilies or are you on the side of Archer Daniels Midland? Because this \nis not going to even help the farmers. It will trickle down a little \nbit, but first Archer Daniels Midland, and the other companies, take \ntheir vig. They decide how much the farmer gets.\n  I have listened and often supported my colleagues who say the middle \nman gets all the money out of agriculture. But all of a sudden, the one \nmiddle man who has 41 percent of the market, Archer Daniels Midland, is \nbeing exalted. I would feel a lot better if every nickel here had to go \nto the farmer. It still would not be a good bill, but at least it would \ntake away one of the objections.\n  So this is a ``whose side are you on'' amendment? Are you on the side \nof working families or are you going to make the guy or the gal who \nmakes $25,000 a year and has to drive their car 25 miles to work \nsubsidize Archer Daniels Midland to a large extent, and farmers who \nmake more money than them, by and large, to the rest of the \nextent? That is not fair. That is not cricket.\n\n  This amendment is really appalling. As I have said before, if any \nproposal should have a skull and crossbones on it--beware, voter; \nbeware, Senator--it is this one.\n  I mentioned this before, but I want to mention it again because I \nhave a feeling 2, 3 years from now my colleagues will be coming back to \nme and saying: You were right; I should have listened.\n  I have seen every so often terrible amendments pass. They usually \npass quietly. This one is passing pretty quietly. The number of us \ngetting up to oppose it is small, and it wouldn't have even been \ndebated had I not offered the amendment. In 1982, I think it was, Garn-\nSt Germain seemed sort of innocuous. There were about 25 Members of the \nHouse who said: You had better watch out. This is allowing banks to use \nfree money. It passed. Five years later, everyone was trying to explain \nwhy the heck they voted for it.\n  In the early 1990s, catastrophic illness: There was a mandate to help \nthe few who needed help, but it was imposed on everybody else--not too \ndissimilar to this, except the people who were helped with catastrophic \nillness were a lot more worthy than the people being helped here--\nmainly agribusiness. It passed. It seemed all right. It was not \ndebated. Then we all rued the day.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, since I don't think there \nis anyone else who wishes to speak, for 2 additional minutes to \nconclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from New York yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that I be given 5 additional \nminutes and then I will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator from New Mexico wishes to speak, I won't \nask for that.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Reserving the right to object, as I understand it, the \nSenator from California continues to retain 2 minutes of her own time \nand, in addition, the Senator from New York has asked for an additional \n2 minutes of time. I ask my colleagues if that will be sufficient for \nthem to conclude their remarks.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. That would be great. That is fine with the Senator from \nNew York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would the Senator from California like me to use my 2 \nminutes first?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would like to put some documents in the Record that \njust came over from the House.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Please.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. These documents were just disclosed in a House \nhearing this afternoon. They were disclosed to the FTC. What they show \nare competitors in the ethanol industry sharing bidding information to \nrig bids. One memo describes bringing European ethanol and laundering \nit through the Caribbean to avoid the tariff. These are hearings that \nare now going on in the House. I cannot, in the 5 minutes I have had \nthese documents, have an opportunity to really confirm to anybody what \nthey do or what they don't do. There are a number of suggestive \ncomments in them, such as one company saying to the other: We are \nprepared to stop bidding should the price drop below $1.38 a gallon.\n  Interestingly enough, this all concerns ethanol going into your \nState, Washington, Madam President, a few years ago.\n  Whether this shows price manipulation or not, I don't know. But \nbecause these documents have just been made public this afternoon in \nthe House, I ask unanimous consent to print them in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Western Ethanol Company LLC,\n\n                                               September 29, 2000.\n     To: Herbert Wolf\n     From: Doug Vind\n     Re: Sales Opportunity--Requires Immediate Attention/Response\n\n       Further to our telephone conversation of today, I am \n     writing to inform you of the details of a sales opportunity \n     for LAICA's anhydrous alcohol. In order to participate in \n     this opportunity, I must hear back from you by no later than \n     close of business on Tuesday October 2.\n       British Petroleum (``BP'') has scheduled an on-line reverse \n     auction to be conducted via the internet next week. They are \n     requesting pre-qualified ethanol suppliers to bid on \n     supplying product into the Ohio and Washington State markets \n     beginning November 2000 and running through January 2001. We \n     are interested in bidding to supply a portion of the volume \n     requested into Washington State. This Lot is broken into \n     partial supply percentages of 10,25,50 and 100%. The total \n     volume requested for Washington State is 9,600,000 gallons \n     over the 3 month period.\n       I am specifically recommending that LAICA consider \n     committing to this reverse auction the 38,000 HL it has \n     scheduled to receive from Europe. I believe this feedstock \n     will arrive Costa Rica sometime during the month of November \n     and be available for delivery into the US in December.\n       The delivery of denatured ethanol of BP into Washington \n     State can only be made by either Railcar or Barge. Direct \n     deliveries of undenatured ethanol cannot be accepted. For \n     this reason, WEC is prepared to source railcars of domestic \n     ethanol in order to supplement the volume coming from LAICA. \n     This would allow us to bid on up to 25% of the requested \n     volume, for a total of 2,400,000 gallons. We are also in \n     discussion with Man with regard to their participation for a \n     small piece of this business.\n       I expect that the winning bid for the 25% volume will be \n     somewhere in the upper $1.30's to low $1.40's. We are \n     prepared to stop bidding should the price drop below $1.38 \n     per gallon. As I mentioned above, the delivery mode into \n     Washington State allows for only barge or railcar. In view of \n     this, it will be necessary to first discharge and denature \n     the imported ethanol. We then will schedule a barge to \n     transport the denatured ethanol to BP's terminal in Seattle. \n     I am in the process of verifying the barging, terminaling and \n     denaturing costs but I have been given a range of $.03--$0.4 \n     per gallon. I should have this information on Monday.\n       I believe that the BP ``Request for Quotation'' presents a \n     very good sales opportunity for LAICA's anhydrous alcohol. \n     However, in order to participate in the on-line auction, WEC \n     needs to receive LAICA's commitment to supply the 38,000 HL. \n     We must obtain LAICA's commitment to this program by no later \n     than close of business next Tuesday.\n\n[[Page S3141]]\n\n       For your guidance, I have enclosed a listing of the Lots to \n     be included in the Reverse Auction. As you will notice, we \n     will be required to participate in a ``Qualifying Round'' of \n     bidding on Wednesday September 3. This will enable us to move \n     on to the competitive bidding event scheduled for Friday \n     September 5.\n       I greatly appreciate your presenting this proposal to your \n     Board of Directors on Monday. I will be in my office and be \n     prepared to answer any further questions regarding this \n     matter.\n           Best regards,\n     Douglas Vind.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Regent International,\n\n                                      Brea, CA, November 20, 1995.\n     To: Dick Bok, ADM Ingredients\n     From: Dick Vind\n       Finally received a phone call from Tuite at 3:30 PM PDT \n     USA. Jeff stated he had at last been successful in talking to \n     the Kriete's and they have agreed to split the tender with \n     us.\n       Jeff's only reservation was that Kriete insisted that Man \n     be the purchaser of the tender. In order to avoid a ``show \n     down'' or bidding contest, I agreed to this request.\n       Therefore, Man will be bidding on the 75,000 hl out of \n     France at a price of 5.02. I would suggest that ADM underbid \n     at a price of 4.85. This will serve as a safety net in the \n     event Man's bid is rejected for any reason. As a reminder, \n     bids are due in this Thursday, November 23.\n       With regards to the sharing, I made it explicitly clear to \n     Jeff that we (ADM & Western) would be purchasing the product \n     FOB Port-la-Nouvelle from Man on a totally transparent basis. \n     We would then assume responsibility for our own shipping \n     which presumably we would be able to coordinate jointly in \n     the future.\n       I would suggest you contact Tuite tomorrow at your \n     convenience to confirm and request a signed agreement between \n     both parties in order to assure compliance with this accord.\n           Best regards,\n     Dick.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 17, 1996.\n     To: Dick Bok\n     From: Dick Vind\n     Subject: EU Wine Alcohol Tender--Due date: June 24\n       This will confirm that Archer Daniels Midland will be \n     bidding 5.9 ecu on Spanish tender (194-96) and somewhat less, \n     (say 5.75) on Italian tender (195-96).\n       I assume you have discussed with Man, and that all is OK. \n     Please call if this is not the case.\n       Hope all is well.\n           Best regards,\n     Dick.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Regent International,\n\n                                                   March 18, 1992.\n     To: Ed Harjehausen, Archer Daniels Midland Co.\n     From: Doug Vind\n       Per our previous discussion, I have prepared a price and \n     cost comparison demonstrating the sensitivity of the proposed \n     bid price options and the resulting ``out turned'' finished \n     ethanol costs FOB Acajulta, El Salvador.\n\n                          FOB COST CALCULATION\n \nBid Price (ECUs) Per Hectoliter.................     4.2     4.3     4.4\nBid Price ($ per gallon)........................   .2336   .2392   .2448\nFobbing.........................................   .1700   .1700   .1700\nOcean Freight (in)..............................   .1350   .1350   .1350\nInland Truck Freight (in).......................   .0147   .0147   .0147\nRaw Material Cost...............................   .5533   .5589   .5645\nProcessing Costs................................   .3800   .3825   .3850\nFOB Value Plant.................................   .9333   .9414   .9495\nInland Truck Freight (out)......................   .0147   .0147   .0147\nFOB Cost Port (Acajulta)........................   .9480   .9561   .9642\n \n                         VALUE ADDED CALCULATION\n \nDirect Costs....................................   .3450   .3475   .3500\nDivided by FOB Val.

For \n     purposes of this analysis, I have targeted a value added \n     percentage of 36.9%. This percentage should be adjusted to \n     reflect our mutual comfort level in order not to jeopardize \n     duty free qualifications. As one further observation, please \n     note the difference between ``processing costs'' and ``direct \n     costs''. This difference results from customs guidelines \n     limiting only certain types of costs as ``direct'' and \n     applicable to the Value Added calculation.\n       Recommendation: In reviewing the three lots being offered \n     by the EC for this tender, I suggest we bid ``competitively'' \n     on lot number 77 and submit lower priced bids on lots 75 and \n     76 as ``back up'' bids in the event other potential \n     purchasers fail in their attempt to secure these two lots.\n       I recommend our bid price on lot number 77 should be 4.15 \n     ECUs per hectoliter. I recommend our bid price on lots number \n     75 and 76 should be 4.10 ECUs per hectoliter each.\n       As you are aware, our bids must be formally submitted by \n     Friday, March 20, 1992. It will, therefore, be necessary to \n     communicate this pricing information to your office in London \n     by our close of business on Thursday.\n       Please give me a call with your recommendation after you \n     have reviewed this memo.\n           Regards.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           ED & F Man Alcohols\n\n                                    London, England, May 13, 1993.\n     To: Dick Vind,\n     From: Jeffrey Tuite\n     Regent International, Brea\n     El Salvador\n\n       On Tuesday evening I talked to the Kriets and here is what \n     was said.\n       They were still keen to make a bid on these tenders. I \n     cautioned once more against this. I said that Man would be \n     able to offer a compromise wherein Man offered 1 million \n     gallons when their plant was up and running. This would come \n     from these tenders and they would buy from Man and the \n     alcohol would be supplied equally by Vind and Hogan. Ideally \n     it would be swap deal with them returning the ethanol next \n     time around. In return it was expected that they did not \n     interfere with these tenders.\n       The Kriete response was that they were still very nervous \n     about being outmaneuvered and that we would block any alcohol \n     for them from the next round of June/July tenders. I said \n     that this was not the case and that if they could persuade \n     the Commission to call five lots next time we would support \n     them.\n       In summary Kriete is prepared to stay away from these \n     tenders if Man can guarantee that they will get 1.4 million \n     gallons from these tenders on a straight sale basis. I said \n     that 1 million gallons was more realistic. Tony Hogan is \n     prepared to make a straight sale and feels that this commits \n     him less to Krite and there is the point that Kriet may not \n     get any alcohol to return for one reason or another. My \n     recommendation to you is to make available a straight 500,000 \n     gallons sale (preferrably 750,000!) without strings and I \n     feel this will mend things.\n       Can I please have your agreement to do this. I already have \n     Tony's agreement. Naturally Man will secure ADMs P Bond risk \n     for this sale.\n       I talked to George Fitch in Brussels today who is suffering \n     the usual frustration one gets in Brussels. He had little to \n     add to your fax of yesterday.\n       I will call you latter when I get home.\n           Best Regards.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Regent International,\n\n                                          Brea, CA, April 6, 1994.\n     To: Dick Bok\n     From: Richard Vind\n     Subject: CBI Tenders\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n       I appreciate your quick response.

Meetings in Brussels, probably 19/20.\n       I will not know my exact travel plans until probably April \n     12 so I will communicate my itinerary along with pricing \n     information prior to April 14 to your office.\n           Best regards,\n     Dick.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Western Petroleum Importers Inc.,\n\n                                                    July 13, 1998.\n     To: Jeff Tuite\n     From: Doug Vind\n       I had hoped to hear from you today regarding the situation \n     that has developed in the Northwest. You can imagine my \n     surprise and disappointment today to learn that the ``deal'' \n     I have been discussing with you for the past several weeks \n     involving the shipment out of Costa Rica and El Salvador had \n     already been concluded last week. You can also imagine my \n     embarrassment with my customer when I called them today to \n     firm up the transaction only to learn that they had been \n     offered product which I had been previously told was not \n     available.\n       My current frustration with the recent sequence of events \n     is matched only by the humiliation of relying on what was \n     indicated as timely and accurate information, representing \n     that information as fact, and having my credibility at risk \n     when the ``facts'' changed.\n       As you are aware, I have been actively working with your \n     office in seeking a vessel to accommodate the delivery of \n     both parcels. Because the sale was to involve a direct \n     contract between Man and the customer, I revealed the \n     targeted value for the product to you for your concurrence, \n     which you provided. Late last week I attempted to reach you \n     several times to discuss this matter but did not receive the \n     benefit of a return call. As it turns out, you had already \n     concluded this transaction but elected not to inform me. A \n     simple call would have saved me from looking foolish today.\n       At this point I need to reconfirm your commitment to \n     providing the 900,000 gallons out of El Salvador in a joint \n     shipment sometime on or after mid August. As I have already \n     actively represented this volume as available for delivery, I \n     would prefer to avoid a repeat of today's confusion in the \n     event you have made other unilateral arrangements.\n       Additionally, I wish to discuss this entire situation with \n     you in greater detail in order to try and understand exactly \n     how things got off track. Please call me at your soonest \n     opportunity.\n                                                November 13, 1995.\n      To: George Fitch\n     From: Dick Vind\n     Subject: DGVI ``Doublespeak''\n\n       Please review the enclosed articles from a recent [October \n     20, 1995] issue of Agra Europe Magazine.\n\n[[Page S3142]]\n\n       This article seems to completely refute Alex's comments \n     made to us at our meeting of last week. Although the lead \n     paragraph is not easily readable because the fax machine \n     ``ate'' it, what it says is that The Commission is increasing \n     the amount of compulsory distillation for this coming year \n     [1995-96] versus last year [1994-95] by 137,000 HL. Although \n     small, it nonetheless is a definite increase, and shows that \n     the total amount of alcohol to be distilled via compulsory \n     distillation for the three primary countries of Italy, Spain \n     and France for this coming year will be a total of 5,400,000 \n     HL.\n       It must further noted that this year's total wine \n     production for these three countries is estimated to be \n     131,900,000 HL versus last year's 130,927,000 HL. With \n     compulsory distillation being 4% of the total, if you take \n     the total EU wine production of 155,400,000, this means that \n     a total of 6,216,000 HL will be available for EUstocks this \n     coming year.\n       It is apparent that there will continue to be significant \n     overproduction in the EU for years to come, in that the \n     Commission's efforts to reduce production have failed.\n       On a related matter, I have reviewed your memo to the CBI \n     group. Your suggestion on opening up future tenders to avoid \n     the GATT limits are troubling unless we couple it with some \n     type of end-use restriction. This is because, as you can also \n     see from the second article, notwithstanding what Tuite said \n     at the meeting, it appears that the Brazilians will be back \n     into the market in a big way next year. Unless we place some \n     type of restriction on end-use, they'll easily outbid us for \n     the entire EU output.\n       What happened to our end-use language we discussed with \n     Olsen last year?\n       I would appreciate your investigating these matters as soon \n     as possible and giving me the benefit of your thoughts. Also, \n     I want to report the results of my meeting with the SENPA \n     folks.\n     Dick.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Regent International,\n\n                                      Brea, CA, November 20, 1995.\n     To: Dick Bok, ADM Ingredients\n     From: Dick Vind\n       Finally received a phone call from Tuite at 3:30 PM PDT \n     USA. Jeff stated he had at least been successful in talking \n     to the Kriete's and they have agreed to split the tender with \n     us.\n       Jeff's only reservation was that Kriete insisted that Man \n     be the purchaser of the tender. In order to avoid; ``show \n     down'' or bidding contest, I agreed to this request.\n       Therefore, Man will be bidding on the 75,000 hl out of \n     France at a price of 5.02. I would suggest that ADM underbid \n     at a price of 4.85. This will serve as a safety net in the \n     event Man's bid is rejected for any reason. As a reminder, \n     bids are due in this Thursday, November 23.\n       With regards to the sharing, I made it explicitly clear to \n     Jeff that we (ADM & Western) would be purchasing the product \n     FOB Port-la-Nouvelle from Man on a totally transparent basis. \n     We would then assume responsibility for our own shipping \n     which presumably we would be able to coordinate jointly in \n     the future.\n       I would suggest you contact Tuite tomorrow at your \n     convenience to confirm and request a signed agreement between \n     both parties in order to assure compliance with this accord.\n           Best regards,\n                                                             Dick.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from California for that useful \naddition and also for her great work on this issue.\n  I was concluding by saying: There will be a stampede to deny \nknowledge of this amendment, to deny knowledge of the consequences of \nthis amendment, in a few short years. I wish we wouldn't have to do \nthat. I urge my colleagues, if you want to subsidize ethanol--it is now \nsubsidized already 53 cents a gallon; there is a tariff barrier so it \ncan't be imported; no good in our society has gotten as much--do that. \nIf you want to raise the subsidy a little more, do that, because then \nit is the General Treasury that is paying. But for God's sake, don't \nmake the drivers of Massachusetts pay 9 cents more a gallon and the \ndrivers of Rhode Island and Delaware pay 9 cents more a gallon and the \ndrivers of Pennsylvania pay 6 cents more a gallon.\n  That is the most regressive tax we are going to pass this year. \nSomehow, because it is coated in ethanol, that tax seems to be OK. The \nvery same people who would get up on the floor and oppose taxes on any \nbasis or on a regressive basis are allowing this one to go through.\n  We will rue the day we support an ethanol mandate. I urge my \ncolleagues to think twice before they vote and support our amendment \nwhich still allows the banning of MTBE, still keeps the clean air \nstandard, gets rid of oxygenate, but lets each State decide the best \nroute to clean the air and clean the water.\n  Mandates are no good for American families. Mandates are no good for \nour economy. This is an ethanol gas tax. I urge it to be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three and a half minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Whose time is that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is not allocated.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is not time either for or in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, that time was allocated to Senator \nWellstone. He didn't use all that time. Senator Wellstone is not here. \nUnless the Senators from New York and California want to use the time, \nI will yield back his time and we will start the vote now.\n  I yield back the time of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n3030.

Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate is voting on the 46th \njudicial nominee to be confirmed since last July when the Senate \nJudiciary Committee reorganized after the Senate majority changed. With \ntoday's vote on Jeffrey Howard to the Court of Appeals for the 1st \nCircuit, the Senate will confirm its 46th judicial nominee and its 9th \njudge to our Federal Courts of Appeals in the less than 10 months since \nI became chairman this past summer.\n  This is the 18th judge confirmed since the beginning of this session \nin late January. Under Democratic leadership, in less than 4 months the \nSenate has confirmed more judges than were confirmed in all 12 months \nof 1996 under Republican leadership. The Senate has confirmed more \njudges in the last 10 months than were confirmed in 4 out of 6 full \nyears under Republican leadership. The number of judicial confirmations \nover these past 10 months--46--exceeds the number confirmed during all \n12 months of 2000, 1999, 1997, and 1996.\n  Mr. Howard is the 9th Court of Appeals judge confirmed in the less \nthan 10 months since the Judiciary Committee was permitted to \nreorganize last July. This is more circuit judges than were confirmed \nin all 12 months of 2000, 1999, 1997, and 1996, 4 of the 6 years of \nRepublican control of the Senate during the Clinton administration. It \nis triple the number of circuit judges confirmed in 1993, when a \nDemocratic Senate majority was working with a President of the same \nparty and received some cooperation from the administration. It exceeds \nthe number of Court of Appeals judges confirmed by a Republican Senate \nmajority in the first 12 months of the Reagan administration and it \nequals the number of circuit judges confirmed in the first 12 months of \nthe first Bush administration.\n  As our action today demonstrates, again, we are moving at a fast pace \nand confirming conservative nominees. Since the change in Senate \nmajority, the Democratic majority has moved to confirm President Bush's \nnominees at a faster pace than the nominees of prior Presidents. The \nrate of confirmations in the past 10 months actually exceeds the rates \nof confirmation in the past three Presidencies. It took 15 months for \nthe Senate to confirm 46 judicial nominees for the Clinton \nadministration. The pace at the beginning of the Clinton administration \namounted to 3.1 judges confirmed per month. In the first 15 months of \nthe first George H.W. Bush administration, only 27 judges were \nconfirmed. The pace at the beginning of the George H.W. Bush \nadministration amounted to 1.8 judges confirmed per month. In President \nReagan's first 15 months in office, 54 judges were confirmed. The pace \nat the beginning of the Reagan administration amounted to 3.6 judges \nconfirmed per month. By comparison, in the less than 10 months since \nthe shift to a Democratic majority in the Senate, President Bush's \njudicial nominees have been confirmed at a rate of 4.6 per month, a \nfaster pace than for any of the last three Presidents.\n  During the preceding 6\\1/2\\ years in which a Republican majority most \nrecently controlled the pace of judicial confirmations in the Senate, \n248 judges were confirmed. Some like to talk about the 377 judges \nconfirmed during the Clinton administration, but forget to mention that \nmore than one-third were confirmed during the first 2 years of the \nClinton administration while the Senate majority was Democratic and \nSenator Biden chaired the Judiciary Committee. The pace of \nconfirmations under a Republican majority was markedly slower, \nespecially in 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000.\n  During the 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control of the Senate, judicial \nconfirmations averaged 38 per year, a pace of consideration and \nconfirmation that we have already exceeded under Democratic leadership \nin fewer than 10 months, in spite of all of the challenges facing \nCongress and the Nation during this period and all of the obstacles \nRepublicans have placed in our path. We have confirmed 46 judicial \nnominees in less than 10 months. This is almost twice as many \nconfirmations as George W. Bush's father had over a longer period, 27 \nnominees in 15 months, than the period we have been in control of the \nSenate.\n  Our Republican critics like to make arguments based on false rather \nthan fair comparisons. They complain that we have not done 24 months of \nwork in the less than 10 months we have been in the majority. That is \nan unfair complaint. A fair examination of the rate of confirmation \nshows, however, that Democrats are working harder and faster on \njudicial nominees, confirming judges at a faster pace than the rates of \nthe past 20 years.\n  I ask myself how Republicans can justify seeking to hold the \nDemocratic majority in the Senate to a different standard than the one \nthey met themselves during the last 6\\1/2\\ years. There simply is no \nanswer other than partisanship. This double standard is most \napparent when Republicans refuse fairly to compare the progress we are \nmaking with the period in which they were in the Senate majority with a \nPresident of the other party. They do not want to talk about that \nbecause we have exceeded the number of judges they confirmed per year.\n\n  They would rather unfairly compare the work of the Senate on \nconfirmations in the less than 10 months since the shift in majority to \nfull, 2-year Congresses. I say that it is quite unfair to complain that \nwe have not done 24 months of work on judicial vacancies in the less \nthan 10 months since the Senate reorganized. These double standards \nasserted by the Republicans are wrong and unfair, but that does not \nseem to matter to Republicans intent on criticizing and belittling \nevery achievement of the Senate under a Democratic majority.\n  Republicans have been imposing a double standard on circuit court \nvacancies as well. The Republican attack is based on the unfounded \nnotion that the Senate has not kept up with attrition on the Courts of \nAppeals. Well, the Democratic majority in the Senate has more than kept \nup with attrition and we are seeking to close the vacancies gap on the \nCourts of Appeals that more than doubled under the Republican majority.\n  In less than 10 months since the change in majority and \nreorganization, the Senate has confirmed 9 judges to the Courts of \nAppeals and held hearings on two others, with another circuit judge \nhearing scheduled for this week. In contrast, the Republican-controlled \nmajority averaged only seven confirmations to the Courts of Appeals per \nyear. Seven. In the less than 10 months the Democrats have been in the \nmajority, we have already exceeded the annual number of Court of \nAppeals judges confirmed by our predecessors. The Senate in the last 10 \nmonths has confirmed more Court of Appeals judges than were confirmed \nin 2000, 1999, or 1997, and nine more than the zero from 1996. In an \nentire session of the 105th Congress, the Republican majority did not \nconfirm a single judge to fill vacancies on the Courts of Appeals. That \nyear has greatly contributed to the doubling of vacancies on the Courts \nof Appeals during the time in which the Republican majority controlled \nthe Senate.\n  The Republican majority assumed control of judicial confirmation in \nJanuary 1995 and did not allow the Judiciary Committee to be \nreorganized after the shift in majority last summer until July 10, \n2001. During the period in which the Republican majority controlled the \nSenate and in which they delayed reorganization, the period from \nJanuary 1995 through July 2001, vacancies on the Courts of Appeals \nincreased from 16 to 33, more than doubling.\n  When Members were finally assigned to the Judiciary Committee on July \n10, we began with 33 Courts of Appeals vacancies. That is what I \ninherited. Since the shift in majority last summer, five additional \nvacancies have arisen on the\n\n[[Page S3144]]\n\nCourts of Appeals around the country. With this week's confirmation of \nJeffrey Howard, we have reduced the number of circuit court vacancies \nto 29. Rather than the 38 vacancies that would exist if we were making \nno progress, as some have asserted, there now remain 29 vacancies. That \nis more than keeping up with the attrition on the Circuit Courts.\n  Since our Republican critics are so fond of using percentages, I will \nsay that we will have filled almost a quarter--29 of 38, or 23.8 \npercent--of the vacancies on the Courts of Appeals in the last 10 \nmonths. In other words, by confirming four more nominees than the five \nrequired to keep up with the pace of attrition, we have not just \nmatched the rate of attrition but surpassed it by 80 percent.\n  While the Republican Senate majority increased vacancies on the \nCourts of Appeals by over 100 percent, it has taken the Democratic \nmajority less than 10-months to reverse that trend, keep up with \nextraordinary turnover and, in addition, reduce circuit court vacancies \nby more than 10 percent overall--from 33 down to 29, or 12.1 percent. \nThis is progress. Rather than having the circuit vacancy numbers \nskyrocketing, as they did overall during the prior 6\\1/2\\ years--more \nthan doubling from 16 to 33--the Democratic-led Senate has reversed \nthat trend. The vacancy rate is moving in the right direction--down.\n  Despite claims to the contrary, under Democratic leadership, the \nSenate is confirming President Bush's Circuit Court nominees more \nquickly than the nominees of other Presidents were confirmed by \nSenates, even some with majorities from the President's own party. The \nnumber of confirmations to the Circuit Courts has exceeded those who \nwere confirmed over 10 month time frames at the beginning of past \nadministrations. With the confirmation of Jeffrey Howard, 9 Circuit \nCourt nominees will have been confirmed in less than 10-months. This \nnumber greatly exceeds the number of Court of Appeals confirmations in \nthe first 10 months of the Reagan administration (three), the first \nBush administration (three), and the Clinton administration (two). This \nis three times, or 300 percent, the number of Court of Appeals nominees \nconfirmed in the comparable 10-month periods of past administrations. \nWith nine circuit judges confirmed in the less than 10 months since the \nSenate reorganized under Democratic leadership, we have greatly \nexceeded the number of circuit judges confirmed at the beginning of \nprior presidencies. Our achievements also compare quite favorably to \nthe 46 Court of Appeals nominees confirmed by the Republican majority \nin the 76 months during which they most recently controlled the Senate. \nTheir inaction led to the number of Courts of Appeals vacancies more \nthan doubling. With a Democratic Senate majority, the number of circuit \nvacancies is going down.\n\n  Overall, in little less than 10 months, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has held 16 hearings involving 55 judicial nominations. That \nis more hearings on judges than the Republican majority held in any \nyear of its control of the Senate. In contrast, one-sixth of President \nClinton's judicial nominees--more than 50--never got a committee \nhearing and committee vote from the Republican majority, which \nperpetuated longstanding vacancies into this year. Vacancies continue \nto exist on the Courts of Appeals in part because a Republican majority \nwas not willing to hold hearings or vote on more than half--56 \npercent--of President Clinton's Court of Appeals nominees in 1999 and \n2000 and was not willing to confirm a single judge to the Courts of \nAppeals during the entire 1996 session.\n  Despite the newfound concern from across the aisle about the number \nof vacancies on the circuit courts, no nominations hearings were held \nwhile the Republicans controlled the Senate in the 107th Congress last \nyear. No judges were confirmed during that time from among the many \nqualified circuit court nominees received by the Senate on January 3, \n2001, or from among the nominations received by the Senate on May 9, \n2001. Had the Republicans not delayed and obstructed progress on Courts \nof Appeals nominees during the Clinton administration, we would not now \nhave so many vacancies. Had the Republicans even reversed course just \nthis past year and proceeded on the circuit court nominees sent to the \nSenate in January, the number of circuit court vacancies today could be \nin the low twenties, given the pace of confirmation of circuit nominees \nsince the shift in majority last summer.\n  The Democratic leadership acted promptly to address the number of \ncircuit and district vacancies that had been allowed to grow when the \nSenate was in Republican control. The Judiciary Committee noticed the \nfirst hearing on judicial nominations within 10 minutes of the \nreorganization of the Senate and held that hearing on the day after the \ncommittee was assigned new members.\n  That initial hearing included a Court of Appeals nominee on whom the \nRepublican majority had refused to hold a hearing the year before. We \nheld unprecedented hearings for judicial nominees during the August \nrecess. Those hearing included a Court of Appeals nominee who had been \na Republican staff member of the Senate. We proceeded with a hearing \nthe day after the first anthrax letter arrived at the Senate. That \nhearing included a Court of Appeals nominee. In less than 10 tumultuous \nmonths, the Senate Judiciary Committee has held 16 hearings involving \n55 judicial nominations--including 11 circuit court nominees--and we \nare hoping to hold another hearing this week for half a dozen more \nnominees, including another Court of Appeals nominee. That is more \nhearings on judges than the Republican majority held in any year of its \ncontrol of the Senate. The Republican majority never held 16 judicial \nconfirmation hearings in 12 months. We will hold our 17th judicial \nconfirmation hearing this week.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding regular hearings on \njudicial nominees and giving nominees a vote in committee, in contrast \nto the practice of anonymous holds and other obstructionist tactics \nemployed by some during the period of Republican control. The \nDemocratic majority has reformed the process and practices used in the \npast to deny committee consideration of judicial nominees. We have \nmoved away from the anonymous holds that so dominated the process from \n1996 through 2000. We have made home State Senators' blue slips public \nfor the first time.\n  I do not mean by my comments to appear critical of Senator Hatch. \nMany times during the 6\\1/2\\ years he chaired the Judiciary Committee, \nI observed that, were the matter left up to us, we would have made more \nprogress on more judicial nominees. I thanked him during those years \nfor his efforts. I know that he would have liked to have been able to \ndo more and not have to leave so many vacancies and so many nominees \nwithout action.\n\n  I hope to continue to hold hearings and make progress on judicial \nnominees in order to further the administration of justice. In our \nefforts to address the number of vacancies on the circuit and district \ncourts we inherited from the Republicans, the committee has focused on \nconsensus nominees for all Senators. In order to respond to what Vice \nPresident Cheney and Senator Hatch now call a vacancy crisis, the \ncommittee has focused on consensus nominees. This will help end the \ncrisis caused by Republican delay and obstruction by confirming as many \nof the President's judicial nominees as quickly as possible.\n  Most Senators understand that the more controversial nominees require \ngreater review. This process of careful review is part of our \ndemocratic process. It is a critical part of the checks and balances of \nour system of government that does not give the power to make lifetime \nappointments to one person alone to remake the courts along narrow \nideological lines, to pack the courts with judges whose views are \noutside of the mainstream of legal thought, and whose decisions would \nfurther divide our nation.\n  The committee continues to try to accommodate Senators from both \nsides of the aisle. The Court of Appeals nominees included at hearings \nso far this year have been at the request of Senators Grassley, Lott, \nSpecter, Enzi, and Smith of New Hampshire--five Republican Senators who \neach sought a prompt hearing on a Court of Appeals nominee who was not \namong those initially sent to the Senate in May 2001. Each of the \nprevious 45 nominees confirmed by the Senate\n\n[[Page S3145]]\n\nhas received the unanimous, bipartisan backing of the committee.\n  Mr. Howard was given a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee due \nto Senator Bob Smith's efforts. The Senator from New Hampshire is not \nsomeone with whom I agree on all issues. Indeed, we have had our \ndisagreements on judicial nominations. He has applied a litmus test \nover the years and voted against nominees he felt were not against \nabortion. He voted against at least 20 Clinton judicial nominees. \nNonetheless, when Senator Smith spoke to me about his support for Mr. \nHoward, I accommodated Senator Smith's request that we proceed promptly \nwith a hearing on him. Mr. Howard is being confirmed by the U.S. Senate \ntoday, because Senator Smith worked to have this nomination considered \nfavorably.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle have falsely charged that if a \nnominee has a record as a conservative Republican, he will not be \nconsidered by the committee. That is simply untrue. Take, for example, \nthe nomination of Jeffrey Howard. Just 2 years ago, he campaigned for \nthe Republican nomination for Governor of New Hampshire. He has been a \nprominent figure in Republican politics in New Hampshire for many \nyears. He served as the New Hampshire Attorney General, the State \nDeputy Attorney General, and the Chief Counsel in the Consumer \nProtection Division. He also served as the U.S. Attorney for the \nDistrict of New Hampshire and the Principal Associate Deputy Attorney \nGeneral during the first Bush administration. Thus, it would be wrong \nto claim that we will not consider President George W. Bush's nominees \nwith conservative credentials. We have done so repeatedly.\n  The committee voted unanimously to report Mr. Howard's nomination to \nthe floor, even though a minority of the ABA committee found the \nnominee to be not qualified for appointment to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the First Circuit. No Senator is bound by the \nrecommendations of the ABA, but we have always valued their \ncontribution to the process and the willingness of the members of the \nABA standing committee to volunteer their time, efforts and judgment to \nthis important task. Based on the judgment of each individual Member \nabout the qualifications of a particular nominee, the Judiciary \nCommittee has reported out other Bush nominees who received mixed ABA \npeer review ratings and even some with negative recommendations. Mr. \nHoward is well-regarded by his home-State Senators. The next time \nRepublican critics are bandying around charges that the Democratic \nmajority has failed to consider conservative judicial nominees, I hope \nsomeone will ask those critics about Jeffrey Howard, as well as the \nmany other conservative nominees we have proceeded to consider and \nconfirm.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the confirmation of \nMr. Jeffrey Howard to the First Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Howard's \nrecord is impressive. He will make a valuable contribution to an \nalready prestigious First Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. Howard graduated summa cum laude from Plymouth State College. \nWhile attending Georgetown University Law Center, he became Editor of \nthat institution's American Criminal Law Review.\n  After law school, Mr. Howard began an illustrious period of service \nin the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office. There he quickly moved \nthrough the ranks to head that office's Consumer Protection and \nAntitrust Division. Upon successful completion of this assignment, he \nwas promoted to Associate Attorney General in charge of the division of \nLegal Counsel. He eventually became Deputy Attorney General, in \nessence, the second in command in this office.\n  Mr. Howard was then nominated and confirmed as U.S. Attorney for the \nDistrict of New Hampshire. During his tenure in that office, he became \nPrincipal Associate Deputy Attorney General at the Justice Department. \nHere his responsibilities included advising Attorney General Barr and \nsupervising the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Asset \nForfeiture.\n  Mr. Howard then returned to New Hampshire and was appointed that \nState's attorney general. He wrote and implemented one of the Nation's \nfirst effective comprehensive statewide interdisciplinary protocols to \ncombat domestic violence.\n  Clearly, Mr. Howard is a leader in the areas of fighting for \nconsumers that were the victims of fraud and the rights of abused \nwomen.\n  The people of New Hampshire can be proud of this nominee; Jeffrey \nHoward has been a servant of New Hampshire's people. President Bush has \ndone right by the people of New Hampshire and of New England with this \nnomination. Mr. Howard is a good example of the kind of high-quality \njudicial nominees selected by President Bush.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to say that Jeffrey Howard has my support \nand I believe he will be an outstanding addition to the first circuit.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in very strong \nsupport of the nomination of Jeffrey Howard to the First Circuit Court. \nI thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nLeahy, for bringing this nomination forward promptly, and also Senator \nHatch, the ranking member. I spoke to Senator Leahy a couple of weeks \nago, and he promised he would bring this nomination forward, and he \ndid. I am deeply appreciative because Jeff Howard is very qualified for \nthis position and I look forward to him having a long and distinguished \ncareer on the First Circuit Court. I am proud to support the \nnomination. I urge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Smith, in \nstrongly endorsing the nomination of Jeff Howard. I hope my colleagues \nwill vote for him for the First Circuit Court. Jeff Howard has been an \nextraordinary public servant in New Hampshire. He has served as \nattorney general, as U.S. attorney. He continues the long tradition of \nquality individuals who bring integrity, intelligence, and ability to \nthe appeals court in Boston. We are very proud of the fact he will be \nserving down there upon an affirmative vote from this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Jeffrey R.

Mr. President, I am a product of West Virginia. I was \npulled from the hard scrabble mountains of Appalachia, and I burn with \na passion to serve this nation. I remember my roots. I am proud of them \nas they have served me well throughout my career in Congress. I recall \nthe words of the legendary President of the United Mine Workers of \nAmerica, John L. Lewis:\n\n     When ye be an anvil,\n     lie ye very still;\n     When ye be a hammer,\n     strike with all thy will.\n\n  I believe that we should work diligently on legislation that is \nbeneficial to the American people--on education reform, Campaign \nFinance Reform, border security, homeland defense, energy security, and \na common sense climate change policy. But, surely, we should not allow \nthe White House to hammer us, disregarding what we have introduced, \ndebated, and passed in this Chamber on a number of important policy \nmatters. We must let the democratic process work. It is an open \nprocess, and it is the process that the Founders established so long \nago to make it possible to consider the people's business.\n  It was a little over a year ago that the Administration began a \ncomprehensive review of climate change--their alternative approach to \nthe Kyoto Protocol. I understand that any new Administration must \nexamine and develop its own set of policies and ideas on these issues, \nbut they should also understand that so must the Senate. In the absence \nof any Executive Branch action last year, the Members of the Senate on \nboth sides of the aisle took the lead, putting forward new ideas and \napproaches to address this climate change challenge.\n  In June 2001, I introduced bipartisan climate change legislation with \nSenator Stevens. Our bill received unanimous support in the Government \nAffairs Committee in July 2001, and Senators Daschle and Bingaman then \nincluded this bipartisan legislation along with other climate change \nprovisions in the larger energy bill in December 2001. Our proposal is \nbased on scientifically, technically, economically, and environmentally \nsound principles and would put into place a long-term, comprehensive, \nnational climate change strategy. I believe that this is the right \npolicy framework. The Byrd/Stevens legislation recognizes that what we \ntruly need is to find new ways to begin to solve the climate change \nproblem. Additionally, I believe that such innovation will be key to \nthe long-term viability of coal as an energy resource.\n  The primary cause of global climate change is due to the increase in \ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere, especially CO2 which \nresults from the burning of fossil fuels. To deal with climate change \nduring this century, the world must find better, more efficient, and \ncleaner ways to burn the very fossil fuels, including coal, that power \nvirtually the entire economy. Addressing climate change is one of the \ngreatest challenges facing the world in this century, and it will \nrequire the development of advanced energy technologies, ideas, and \nresponses far beyond today's endeavors. Therefore, the U.S. must set in \nplace a framework with a comprehensive strategy and structure to better \naddress this global challenge.\n  The Byrd/Stevens legislation calls for the development of a national \nstrategy to coordinate the Federal Government's response to climate \nchange and to examine how the U.S. and other nations can stabilize \ngreenhouse gas concentrations over the long term. The strategy is built \nupon a foundation of four key elements, including technology \ndevelopment, scientific research, climate adaptation research, and \nmitigation measures to deal with climate change in an economically and \nenvironmentally sound manner.\n  Byrd/Stevens recognizes that the large number of Federal agencies are \nengaged in climate change-related activities, often resulting in a \nhodgepodge of ad hoc approaches. Our legislation calls for the creation \nof a new, statutory office in the Executive Office of the President to \nserve as a focal point of accountability and to integrate the work of \nthese Federal agencies while enhancing congressional oversight.\n  Byrd/Stevens also fills a critical technology gap with a long-term \nresearch and development program through the creation of a new office \nat the Department of Energy which will focus on the innovative \ntechnologies necessary to move beyond the current, incremental steps \nbeing taken to address climate change today and authorizes $4.75 \nbillion over ten years for such programs. We must develop the critical, \ninnovative energy technologies that will help reduce emissions, while \nsimultaneously preserving a diversity of energy options to support our \ngrowing economy.\n  Additionally, Byrd/Stevens understands that enhancing international \nresearch and development efforts as well as opening markets and \nexporting a range of clean energy technologies globally will be key to \naddressing the long-term climate change challenge. Finally, while it is \ncritical to put in place the framework to address this long-term, \nmultifaceted issue, it should be noted that the Byrd/Stevens \nlegislation does not purposely include a mandatory or regulatory regime \nfor emission reductions.\n  Senator Stevens and I want to work in a bipartisan way to thread this \nneedle--to find a way to establish a balanced, long-term framework so \nthat the U.S. can better address the climate change challenge in a more \ncomprehensive way. Climate change policy is no more and no less than \ncumulatively addressing good economic, energy, environmental, \ntransportation, agriculture, forestry, and other relevant policy \nmeasures. At no time, was it our intent to presuppose or dictate any \nspecific policy outcomes to the Executive Branch or the public at \nlarge. Rather, the Byrd/Stevens legislation incorporated the views of \nmany Members and was built upon the experiences from past \nAdministration's efforts in order to create a stronger, more stable \nfoundation that would span this and many Administrations to come.\n  In summary, I believe that, by working in a bipartisan way in the \nSenate, we have refined the Byrd/Stevens legislation without \nundermining its core principles. I hope to work with the White House \nand other Members of Congress in the energy conference on this and \nother energy-related provisions. I look forward to the eventual \ninclusion of Byrd/Stevens in a comprehensive energy plan that can \nultimately pass the Congress and be signed by the President. Finally, I \nask unanimous consent that my full statement before the Senate \nGovernment Affairs Committee on July 18, 2001, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Remarks by U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd: ``Meeting the Challenge of \n   Climate Change''--Testimony Before the Senate Government Affairs \n                        Committee, July 18, 2001\n\n       Mr. Chairman, Senator Thompson, Senator Stevens, and \n     Members of the Committee:\n       I thank you very much for inviting me to speak on behalf of \n     S. 1008, the Climate Change Strategy and Technology \n     Innovation Act of 2001, and I appreciate your holding this \n     hearing on legislation that I believe incorporates the \n     interests of a wide range of Members.\n       I have spoken twice in recent months on the Senate floor \n     about the issue of global climate change. My desire to \n     discuss this important issue derives not only from my sense \n     of personal concern but also from my optimistic belief that \n     we can meet the climate\n\n[[Page S3147]]\n\n     change challenge if we are willing to make a commitment to do \n     so. It is my position that all nations, industrialized and \n     developing countries alike, must begin to honestly address \n     the multifaceted and very complex global climate change \n     problem. At the same time, I believe that our nation is \n     particularly well positioned, with the talent, the wisdom, \n     and the drive, in leading efforts to address the problem that \n     is before us.\n       For these reasons, I, along with Senator Stevens, \n     introduced the legislation (S. 1008) that is under \n     consideration today. The Byrd/Stevens climate change action \n     plan recognizes the awesome problem posed by climate change, \n     and it puts into place a comprehensive framework, as well as \n     research and development effort to guide U.S. efforts into \n     the future. This insidious diseases that have ravaged the \n     earth. Our nation is a world leader in medical and \n     telecommunications technologies, and we should also be a \n     leader when it comes to revolutionizing our energy \n     technologies. Such a commitment would be important for our \n     economy, our energy security, and the global environment \n     overall. But I must ask how long are we going to wait to \n     develop these technologies. This is a huge opportunity for \n     our nation, but our efforts will only be rewarded if can \n     we make a concerted commitment and dedicate ourselves to \n     the task ahead.\n       Make no mistake about it, global climate change is a \n     reality. There are some who may have misinterpreted my stance \n     on this issue based on Senate Resolution 98 of July 1997, \n     which I co-authored with Senator Hagel. That resolution, \n     which was approved by a 95-0 vote, said that the Senate \n     should not give its consent to any future binding \n     international climate change treaty which failed to include \n     two important provisions. That resolution simply stated that \n     developing nations, especially those largest emitters, must \n     also be included in any treaty and that such a treaty must \n     not result in serious harm to the U.S. economy. I still \n     believe that these two provisions are vitally important \n     components of any future climate change treaty, but I do not \n     believe that this resolution should be used as an excuse for \n     the United States to abandon its shared responsibility to \n     help find a solution to the global climate change dilemma.\n       At the same time, we should not back away from efforts to \n     bring other nations along. The U.S. will never be successful \n     in addressing climate change alone. This is a global problem \n     that requires a global solution. It is critical that nations \n     such as China, India, Mexico, Brazil, and other developing \n     nations adopt a cleaner, more sustainable development path \n     that promotes economic growth while also reducing their \n     pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\n       In the Senate's Fiscal Year 2001 Energy and Water \n     appropriations bill, I inserted language that created an \n     interagency task force to promote the deployment of U.S. \n     clean energy technologies abroad. Such an initiative is \n     complementary to the effort proposed in S. 1008. The Clean \n     Energy Technology Exports Initiative is now underway and will \n     help foreign nations deploy a range of clean energy \n     technologies that have been developed in our laboratories. \n     These technologies are hugely marketable. For example, if \n     nations like China continue to depend on coal and other \n     fossil fuels to grow their economies into the future, it is \n     incumbent upon the U.S. to accelerate the development, \n     demonstration, and deployment of clean coal and other clean \n     energy technologies that will be critical to meeting all \n     nations' energy needs while also providing for a cleaner \n     environment.\n       I believe that S. 1008 maps a responsible and realistic \n     course. That road may be bumpy--and I am sure that there will \n     be disagreements along the way--but it is a journey that we \n     must take.\n       We owe it to future generations. S. 1008, if adopted and \n     signed by the President, will commit the U.S. to a serious \n     undertaking, but one that should no longer be ignored. If we \n     are to have any hope of solving one of the world's--one of \n     humanity's--greatest challenges, we must begin now.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first, I thank the many Senators for their \ninvolvement in these discussions on the very complex issue of climate \nchange. I applaud their efforts to reach agreement on these titles.\n  It is not often that several Committees come together to discuss an \nissue that cuts across their respective jurisdictions. I think that the \nagreement that has been reached thus far represents major progress on \nthe road toward addressing the problem of climate change. I, like other \nMembers, have concerns that need further discussion. I think that a \ndialogue with the House and the Administration will be invaluable as we \ncontinue our efforts to finalize a domestic approach to the problem. \nTherefore, I look forward to working with the various Senators as we \ncontinue these discussions on the bill during the conference with the \nHouse.\n  In closing, I would like to note that I have concerns with the newly \nestablished Office of Climate Change Technology in Title X of the bill. \nI hope these concerns can be further addressed as we proceed on the \nbill. Additionally, I have issues with the loan guarantee provisions of \nTitle XIII. I will speak further on these in a separate statement.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \nforegoing amendments be agreed to en bloc and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment \nthat excludes the incineration of municipal solid waste from the \ndefinitions of renewable energy and biomass in the energy bill's \nFederal purchase requirement and renewable portfolio standard. This \namendment, which is cosponsored by Senators Corzine, Jeffords, and \nChafee, closes a loophole in the bill that would encourage the use of \nmunicipal solid waste incinerators that emit harmful pollutants into \nour air. Increased incineration will result in greater pollution which, \nin turn, will lead to greater health problems for all Americans.\n  The goal of the renewable portfolio standard and the Federal purchase \nrequirement in the energy bill is to promote a cleaner environment and \ndiversify our Nation's energy sources. My amendment to the Daschle \nsubstitute helps to achieve that goal by eliminating the incentive for \nenvironmentally hazardous municipal solid waste incinerators. Whatever \nyour thoughts are on the ultimate merits of incineration as a tool of \nwaste management, its inclusion in the energy bill as a clean and \nrenewable energy source is hard to defend.\n  This amendment does not preclude communities that elect to generate \nelectricity from incinerating their waste from doing so, but, rather, \nprevents them from receiving special treatment under Federal law. As \nmany of you know, the renewable portfolio standard requires that \nutilities either produce a percentage of their power from renewable \nenergy sources or that they purchase credits from another party for any \nshortfall.\n  Similarly, the Federal purchase requirement in the bill, which I \nchampioned during my tenure on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, requires that a percentage of the power consumed by the \nFederal Government come from renewable energy sources. Under the \nexisting language now in the Daschle substitute, as amended by Senators \nBingaman and Thomas, the incineration of waste would be considered \nalongside wind and solar as a clean and renewable energy source. I \ndoubt that those in communities with waste incinerators would consider \nthose incinerators as environmentally innocuous as solar and wind \nenergy.\n  During my years in the Illinois General Assembly, in the Illinois \nState Senate, I was confronted by a similar scheme to promote \nincentives for waste incinerators. In 1987, prior to my arrival in the \nGeneral Assembly, that body approved a tax incentive that encouraged \nthe construction of waste incinerators to generate electricity.\n  This subsidy to the waste incineration industry, which amounted to \nnearly $360 million over 20 years, according to some estimates, led to \na proliferation of planned incinerators in mostly poor communities \nsurrounding the city of Chicago. In response to significant public \nhealth and environmental concerns raised by these and surrounding \ncommunities, I joined several colleagues in repealing this subsidy and \npreventing the actual construction of many of these incinerators in my \nhome State. I would hope that my colleagues could benefit from the \nexperience that Illinois gained from providing special incentives to \nwaste incinerators.\n  As many of you already know, municipal solid waste consists of \nresidential and commercial refuge or garbage and is the largest source \nof waste in industrialized countries. Municipal solid waste is often \nburned as an alternative to placing the waste in landfills. Municipal \nsolid waste incinerators burn this waste and, in the process, can \ngenerate electricity. This process only produces a minimal amount of \nelectricity, while the environmental costs are immense. The \nincineration of municipal solid waste releases numerous pollutants into \nthe air, including acid gases, toxic heavy metals, dioxins, particulate \nmatter, nitric oxide, hydrogen chloride, and furans, to name but a few. \nThe EPA has found that municipal solid waste incinerators are the No. 1 \nsource of dioxin emissions nationwide and are responsible for nearly 20 \npercent of the Nation's mercury emissions.\n  The release of pollutants from municipal solid waste incinerators can \nlead to a myriad of serious public health problems. The hazardous \nmaterials emitted by municipal solid waste incinerators are deposited \nin fields, streams, woodlands, and other places. Municipal solid waste \npollutants are linked to cancer, respiratory ailments, and reproductive \nproblems.\n  Some contend that incineration can be made clean by removing harmful \nmaterials from the waste prior to its incineration or by limiting \nemissions by using filters and other pollution-control equipment. But \nregardless of these or other steps taken by municipal solid waste \nincinerator operators, such as scrubbing technologies, to limit the \npollution, incinerators are still not a clean source of energy.\n  Pollution control efforts are largely ineffective because they fail \nto contain 100 percent of these emissions. And even when most of the \nemissions are contained, the resulting ash left over from the \nincineration process must be disposed of as a hazardous waste. If this \nhazardous waste is not disposed of properly, the ash can also cause \nconsiderable health problems. When fly ash is released into the air, \npeople breathe in the small particles which can then sit in their lungs \nand lead to a number of the ailments I have already mentioned.\n  My amendment clarifies that the definition of biomass in the energy \nbill should not be construed to provide any special incentives to \nbusinesses that incinerate municipal solid waste. Eliminating these \ntypes of waste from the definition of biomass is consistent with the \ndefinition of biomass provided in the tax portion of the energy bill. \nThe tax portion of the energy bill specifically excludes municipal \nsolid waste in its biomass definition. If we choose to include \nmunicipal solid waste incinerators in the definition of biomass, we \nwill be advocating for the economic interest of waste incinerator \noperators at the expense of the health of the American people.\n  The amendment I am offering seeks to preserve the health of our \ncitizens and to keep our environment clean. Excluding municipal solid \nwaste from the definition of biomass and renewable energy is the \nenvironmentally responsible thing to do. It would seem incomprehensible \nto me to grant municipal solid waste incinerators a special incentive \nto increase the burning of municipal solid waste that would spoil the \nenvironment and put the public's health in jeopardy.\n  This is a commonsense amendment that separates municipal solid waste \nincinerators from the other clean and renewable energy sources already \nincluded in the Daschle substitute amendment. It is consistent with the \ntax provisions and the energy bill's overarching goal of providing \nclean energy and a safe environment for future generations.\n  I hope you will join me in voting for this amendment to protect our \nenvironment and the health of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the amendment proposes to eliminate \nmunicipal solid waste as a qualifying generator type for the purpose of \nthe renewable portfolio standard. I rise to oppose the amendment.\n  Specifically, I am opposed to the renewable portfolio standard as a \nmatter of policy because I think the cost to consumers is exorbitant, \nsome $88 billion over the next 20 years. I also am opposed to the \npending amendment because consumers are going to pay even more than \nthat. By reducing the types of qualifying generators, that will \nincrease the cost of renewable credits which will be passed on to \nconsumers through, obviously, the only alternative, which is higher \nelectric rates.\n\n[[Page S3150]]\n\n  I encourage consideration of opposing the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to say a word about an amendment to the \nenergy bill that I filed today and about a couple tax provisions on \nwhich I have been working. As my colleagues know well, I have long \nsought to promote hydrogen and fuel cells as clean, efficient energy \ntechnologies that also will enable an economy based on domestic \nrenewable energy sources. There are a number of provisions in the \nenergy bill that help move us in this direction. I am pleased that the \nbill includes the Hydrogen Future Act I introduced in the Senate to \nreauthorize DOE hydrogen energy programs. The energy tax provisions \nintended for the bill include strong tax credits for both stationary \nfuel cells and fuel cell vehicles, as well as for hydrogen and hydrogen \nfueling appliances.\n  However, I believe more Federal action is needed to accelerate the \ncommercialization of fuel cell technologies and bring their benefits to \nour country. In particular, the Federal Government needs to take bolder \naction to bring about the introduction of fuel cell passenger vehicles \nand of a hydrogen refueling infrastructure. Thus my amendment would \ncreate a federal fuel cell vehicle pilot program. In this program the \nDepartment of Energy would work with other federal agencies to identify \nseveral Federal fleets that would be suitable for demonstrating fuel \ncell vehicles under a variety of real-world conditions. DOE would help \ninstall the necessary fueling infrastructure at those sites; this \ninfrastructure could also be used for a stationary fuel cell at the \nsame location and be made available to other fuel cell vehicles. DOE \nwould purchase several hundred fuel cell vehicles, and DOE and the \ncompanies that make the vehicles would assist the federal fleets to \noperate and maintain these vehicles in normal service. Data would be \ncollected both to improve the next generation of vehicles and to assist \nfleet operators in incorporating fuel cell cars, and there would be \nregular reporting to Congress. The amendment also requires at least a \n50 percent cost share from non-federal sources, as in most DOE \ndemonstration programs. The total authorization for the program over \nsix years would be $350 million.\n  This amendment includes a second provision for a study of the \npotential of stationary fuel cells in federal buildings. Even before \nfuel cell vehicles are commercially available, fuel cells have a great \npotential for providing distributed, highly reliable power for \nbuildings, as well as heat. This study would look at what should be \ndone to incorporate fuel cells into new federal buildings, so that \nplanning for the buildings from the first stages can optimize the use \nof fuel cells and so that appropriate incentives can be put in place to \nencourage Federal purchase of stationary fuel cells. Again the Federal \nGovernment can become a lead consumer to foster commercialization of \nfuel cells and to demonstrate their benefits.\n  We also need to build a hydrogen fueling infrastructure. I am working \nwith the Finance Committee to make two important changes to the \nexcellent alternative fuel provisions that are in their package, in \norder to make the provisions effective for hydrogen fuel. The first \nwould extend the credit for installation of hydrogen fueling property \nthrough 2011. This would simply match the credit for the fuel cell \nvehicles themselves, and recognizes that it will be several years \nbefore commercial fuel cell vehicles are readily available and there is \nsignificant demand for hydrogen fuel. The second change would alter the \ndefinition of refueling property so that not only storage and \ndispensing of hydrogen but also production of hydrogen from natural gas \nand other alternative fuels would be included. This is necessary \nbecause unlike natural gas, for example, today you can't just pipe in \nthe hydrogen to a fueling station. You need to make the hydrogen on-\nsite, most likely be reforming natural gas. This amendment would \nclarify the definition to be sure that such equipment is covered.\n  Finally, on the tax provisions, I hope to extend the tax credit and \nthe exemption from the excise tax for biodiesel. Biodiesel is a \nrenewable product made from soy beans that can be mixed with diesel \nroughly like ethanol is mixed with gasoline. Its use would cut our use \nof diesel and thus our consumption of petroleum, and also cut \nassociated emissions. The tax provisions include a three-year tax \ncredit for biodiesel. While this credit could be very helpful to \nestablishing a strong biodiesel industry, three years is not enough to \nensure return on investment in a new biodiesel plant. Both the \ninvestors and the creditors need a longer planning horizon to be \nconfident of a stable market for the biodiesel. Thus I hope we will be \nable to extend this important new incentive in order to maximize its \neffectiveness.\n  With these provisions, and many others in the bill and the tax \npackage, I look forward to a bright, clean, domestic, renewable energy \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3150-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3150-S3156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Collins, and I would \nlike to engage in a colloquy regarding the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, or LIHEAP.\n  The Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition, which I chair with Senator \nCollins, is a bipartisan coalition of Senators from the Northeast, \nMidwest and Mid-Atlantic dedicated to improving the environmental \nquality and economic vitality of the region. The Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program is a vital program to our region. LIHEAP provides \nhome energy assistance to some of our Nation's most vulnerable \ncitizens, including families with children, the elderly, and disabled \nindividuals.\n  People in our region know that cold weather kills. Mr. President, the \nfacts speak for themselves. According to the Centers for Disease \nControl, between 1979 and 1998, hypothermia claimed the lives of over \n13,000 Americans, twice as many Americans than died due to excessive \nheat. Residential energy costs in the Northeast and Midwest are more \nexpensive which means that families in the region spend a greater \namount of their incomes on home heating. It also requires more energy \nto heat a home than to cool one. LIHEAP households in our region spend \nover twice as much to heat their homes in the winter than it costs to \ncool a home in the south in the summer. According to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, during the peak winter heating season, \nenergy bills can frequently reach up to 30 percent of a low-income \nfamily's income, especially if they live in substandard housing.\n  This winter, the average temperature in Rhode Island was in the low-\n30s. Without heat, these temperatures are\n\n[[Page S3151]]\n\nlife-threatening. In my State, sweaters and blankets are not enough to \nkeep you warm. If heating assistance is not available, low-income \nfamilies, senior citizens and disable individuals living on fixed \nincomes make drastic choices, they go without food, prescription drugs \nand other basic necessities in order to maintain heat in their homes. \nOn average, it cost $1,200 to heat a home in Rhode Island last year. \nLow-income families cannot afford these costs. LIHEAP provides vital \nassistance to keep the heat on for these households.\n  In February, my home State of Rhode Island ran out of LIHEAP funding \nand had to close its program. I received phone calls from a number of \nsenior citizens who were unable to heat their homes because they ran \nout of heating oil. To help low-income families address the runaway \ncosts of home energy bills, we need greater funding for this program. \nThis year, Senator Collins and I lead a bi-partisan letter supported by \n37 Senators that requested $3 billion for the LIHEAP program in fiscal \n2003. I will ask unanimous consent to print a copy of the letter in the \nRecord, and I want to thank Senators Harkin and Specter for their \nstrong and consistent support of this program.\n  Senators Harkin and Specter increased LIHEAP funding by $300 million \nin fiscal year 2002. Unfortunately this was not enough to help States \naddress the unmet need. During the winter of 2000/2001, the Nation \nexperienced extraordinarily and unprecedented levels in energy costs \nalong with colder winter temperatures. Many low-income families and \nsenior citizens are still trying to pay off from the energy debt they \nincurred last winter. While energy prices are lower this year, they are \nnot low by historic standards and the prices for natural gas and home \nheating oil remain at significant costs for many Americans. The \nrecession is also an increasing need for assistance.\n\n  There is something that President Bush can do immediately to help \nlow-income households meet their energy needs. Congress appropriated \n$300 million in the FY2001 Supplemental Appropriations bill for \nemergency LIHEAP assistance. For incomprehensible reasons, the \nPresident has chosen not to release the emergency LIHEAP funding. And, \nthe President's budget inexplicably requests $300 million less for this \nprogram in 2003. Leadership and action are urgently needed to help low-\nincome working families and senior citizens, and I hope the President \nwill take action to release the emergency funds.\n  Next year, the Health, Education and Labor and Pensions Committee \nwill begin reauthorizing the LIHEAP program. I want to thank Senator \nKennedy for his support of this program. I look forward to working with \nhim and my colleagues to improve the LIHEAP program and increase \nfunding.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Reed for \nhis comments. LIHEAP is a vital heating assistance program for low-\nincome families with children, senior citizens and disabled \nindividuals. My colleagues in the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition \nwork tirelessly every year to increase funding for this program and to \nensure that these resources get to those most in need.\n  There is a terrible reality some low-income households must face each \nwinter, to heat or to eat. Imagine a hard working low-income family \nthat cannot cover the costs of basic necessities in the winter having \nto ask: Do I heat my home or provide enough food for my children? Or, \nimagine being an elderly couple and living on a fixed income who has to \ndecide: Do we pay the heating bill or do we buy medicine? In Maine, a \nmajority of our low-income families use heating oil to stay warm. When \nthere is no oil, there is no heat. LIHEAP is the program that keeps the \nheat on for these families.\n  My State of Maine had to lower this year's benefit by $100 in order \nto serve the 48,000 households that needed assistance. Over 60 percent \nof the recipient in my State are elderly living on a fixed income of \nonly $10,000 a year. This year, 4,500 additional households applied for \nassistance. Many of these families needed help because they are \nunemployed and have exhausted unemployment benefits. While energy \nprices are lower this year, they are high for low-income Mainers. The \naverage LIHEAP benefit of $338 per household pays for only a little \nmore then one tank of fuel for these families. In Maine, the average \nannual cost to heat a home with oil is $1,200.\n  The LIHEAP program was enacted to respond to the higher fuel prices \nand severe winters in cold weather States. Its primary focus is to \nalleviate winter heating crises. Heating homes is expensive. According \nto the National Fuel Funds Network, at the end of the 2000/2001 winter \nheating season, at least 4.3 million low-income households were at risk \nof having their utility service cutoff because of an inability to pay \ntheir winter home energy bills. In the Northeast and Midwest, the cost \nto heat a home is more expensive than to cool a home in the south, and \nfamilies have to spend a greater amount of their incomes on home \nheating. LIHEAP households in the Northeast and Midwest spend over \n$1,200 on residential energy. This is 14 percent of their household \nincome in the Northeast and 18 percent in the Midwest. LIHEAP \nhouseholds spend over twice as much to heat their homes in the winter \nthan it costs to cool a home in the south.\n  The current allocation formula acknowledges the important public \nhealth role this program serves in cold weather States. Since its \nenactment, Congress reaffirmed the commitment of this goal. The program \nhas been reauthorized a number of times and Congress maintained its \ncommitment to low-income families faced with high heating bills. It did \nthis by ensuring that no State would receive less than it did when the \nprogram was enacted.\n  Low-income households will take drastic, and unsafe, measures to try \nto stay warm in winter when they are in jeopardy of losing heat. When \nhome energy bills are unaffordable in winter, low-income households \nrely on alternative heating sources such as ovens or space heaters. The \nNational Fire Protection Association reports that house fires show a \nsharp increase in the cold-weather months. Half of the home heating \nfires and three-fourths of the home heating fires deaths occurred in \nthe months of December, January, and February. Not being able to afford \nutilities place low-income households at increased risk to house fires \nand illness or death.\n  We need to increase funding for this vital program. Thirty-seven of \nmy colleagues joined Senator Reed and I in seeking increased \nappropriations for this program for fiscal year 2003. I look forward to \nworking with Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Gregg on the HELP \nCommittee on reauthorization of this important program.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter to which \nI referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin, Chairman\n     Hon. Arlen Specter, Ranking Member\n     Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n         Education Appropriations, Senate Committee on \n         Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Specter: We are \n     writing to express our strong support for the Low Income Home \n     Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). We appreciate your \n     consistent support for this critical program to help low-\n     income families and senior citizens address high energy \n     burdens. We recognize the difficult choices that you face \n     this fiscal year, however, we believe that the strong and \n     continued growth in households requesting LIHEAP assistance \n     demonstrates that the funding needed for this program has \n     never been greater. We respectfully request that you consider \n     appropriating $3 billion in regular LIHEAP funds for FY2003 \n     and provide advanced appropriations for FY2004.\n       LIHEAP is a vital safety net for our nation's low-income \n     households. For many low-income families, disabled \n     individuals and senior citizens living on fixed incomes, home \n     energy costs are unaffordable. Without LIHEAP assistance, \n     low-income families and senior citizens face the impossible \n     choice between paying their home energy bills or affording \n     other basic necessities such as prescription drugs, housing \n     and food. In FY2001, states received $2.25 billion in regular \n     and contingency LIHEAP funding. Despite this historic level \n     of funding, it is estimated that states were only able to \n     serve 17 percent of the 29 million eligible households. \n     Currently, states only have $1.7 billion available in LIHEAP \n     funds for FY2002. Sixteen states estimate that they will be \n     out of funding by the end of March.\n       We also request advanced appropriations for the program for \n     FY2004. Advance funding allows states to plan more \n     efficiently, and therefore, more economically. State LIHEAP\n\n[[Page S3152]]\n\n     directors begin planning in spring and early summer for the \n     upcoming year. Without advanced funding, state directors are \n     unable to plan program outreach or leverage resources as \n     effectively. Advanced funding will also ensure that states \n     have the necessary funding to open their programs at the \n     beginning of the fiscal year in order to provide timely \n     assistance to low-income families who cannot afford to wait.\n       We look forward to working with you to secure the necessary \n     LIHEAP funding to meet the needs of millions of low-income \n     families. Thank you for your consideration of our request.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jack Reed, Susan M. Collins, Olympia Snowe, Carl Levin, \n           Joseph Biden, Paul D. Wellstone, Debbie Stabenow, \n           Joseph Lieberman, Paul Sarbanes, Charles Schumer, \n           George V. Voinovich, Dick Lugar, James M.

Mr. President, ensuring necessary and affordable energy \nsupplies, including ethanol-blended motor fuels and other initiatives, \nis important to the quality of life and economic prosperity of all \nAmericans. Policies to achieve these objectives, however, should not \ncome at the expense of transportation infrastructure improvements.\n  By directing 2.5 cents from the sale of gasohol to the highway trust \nfund, we can begin to alleviate a growing problem for many States--\nlower highway trust fund contributions and therefore lower highway \napportionments.\n  Furthermore, a major goal of TEA-21 was to restore the integrity of \nthe highway trust fund by depositing all motor fuel taxes in the trust \nfund and then spending that money on highway, and some transit, \nprograms. Gasohol's 2.5 cents is the only user tax on vehicle fuel that \ndoes not flow into the highway trust fund . I am proud to have it as \npart of the energy tax package.\n  I would especially like to thank Senators Harkin, Warner, and the \nranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley for their \nhelp in getting the 2.5 cent provision in the energy tax package. But \nthe 2.5 cents is just the beginning.\n  I had planned to introduce an amendment, along with Senators Harkin \nand Warner, that would truly make the highway trust fund ``whole.'' \nThis amendment would keep the ethanol subsidy, but make sure that it is \nthe Treasury's General Fund that subsidizes ethanol--not the highway \ntrust fund.\n  The ethanol subsidy is good energy policy, good agriculture policy \nand good tax policy. Yet, ironically, it is the highway trust fund that \nbears the burden of the subsidy. Since it is good general policy, I \nbelieve that the general fund should bear the burden of the subsidy.\n  I have been asked by several Senators not to offer an amendment at \nthis time. I have complied with the requests of my colleagues. However, \nI am fully committed to recouping the 5.3 cents for the highway trust \nfund at the next possible opportunity.\n  I would like to thank Senators Warner and Harkin for working so \nclosely with me on this matter. I look forward to continuing that work \nas soon as possible.\n  I am pleased to see progress being made to include the highway trust \nfund in our collective thoughts as we discuss energy policy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus, for his strong leadership in working to \nsecure the integrity of the highway trust fund and promote the use of \nethanol and other renewable fuels like biodiesel. I also commend the \nhard work of Senator Warner to preserve the trust fund.\n  There is no question that a strong highway system is vitally \nimportant to the efficiency of our economy. Poor roads mean higher \ncosts to move goods, raising prices to consumers and making us less \ncompetitive in a world marketplace. It also means inconvenience to our \ncitizens. The use of fuels containing ethanol or soy is both extremely \nimportant to the economy of rural America and good for the environment. \nThe Federal Government wisely promotes ethanol as a fuel through the \nTax Code and in other ways. But, on the negative side, against the \nlogic of our country's need, current law provides that increased use of \nethanol in fuel means a reduction in the highway trust fund and fewer \ndollars being spent to repair and improve our roads and bridges. I \nwould note that mass transit currently is not adversely impacted under \nthe law.\n\n  I was very pleased to be an original cosponsor of S. 1306, Highway \nTrust Fund Recovery Act, which provides for the shifting of the excise \ntaxes on alcohol fuels from the general fund to the highway trust fund \nstarting on October 1, 2003. I am very pleased that the measure has \nbeen included in the package of tax measures that the Finance Committee \nproposed to be added to the energy bill along with the very important \nlegislation on biodiesel.\n  Enacting the Highway Trust Fund Recovery Act is the first step. The \nnext step is to provide that the highway trust fund be made truly whole \nfor the 5.3 cents not collected for gasohol. We have agreed to not \noffer a proposal to accomplish that goal during the floor debate of \nthis measure. However, it is my intention to work with Senator Baucus, \nSenator Warner and others to try to accomplish the goal of passing \nlegislation to fully reimburse the highway trust fund from the general \nfund as soon as possible.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I commend the Senators from Montana and Iowa for their \nvigorous support of the highway trust fund. Because of their efforts, \nthe measure pending before us, the trust fund, will recoup an \nadditional 2.5 cents per gallon of ethanol currently being deposited \ninto general revenue.\n  The Senator from Montana has also been very aggressive at trying to \nmake the trust fund whole with respect to the current 5.3-cent per \ngallon ethanol subsidy. Although he and I do not agree on how to best \naddress this issue, we are in agreement that the highway trust fund \nshould not pay to subsidize any fuel source. Our surface transportation \ninfrastructure needs are such that we cannot afford to forego any \nrevenue source.\n  Certainly one of the key factors in the economic engine that drives \nour economy is a safe, efficient transportation system. If our economic \nrecovery is going to continue to expand we cannot ignore the immediate \nand critical infrastructure needs of highways, bridges, and State and \nlocal roadways systems.\n  I believe this issue is best resolved through the reauthorization of \nthe surface transportation program next year. Furthermore, it is my \nhope that the final result will be one that can be embraced by all \nsides in this debate.\n  Thus, I will be pulling together a working group of the highway \ncommunity, the renewable fuels community, the refiners and the \nagricultural community to begin discussions on how we can make the \nhighway trust fund whole. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from \nthe Renewable Fuels Association be printed in the Record.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Again, I thank my colleagues from Montana and Iowa for their \nleadership on this issue and look forward to working with them to \ndevise a permanent solution to this drain on the highway trust fund.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I applaud Senator Baucus for his efforts to enhance the \nflow of revenues into the highway trust fund. In particular, his \nsuggestion that the time has come to redirect the 2.5 cents in ethanol \ntax that is now going into the general fund back to the highway trust \nfund is both timely and constructive.\n  As we reauthorize the surface transportation program over the coming \nmonths, I look forward to working with Senator Baucus and others on the \nbroader issue of the Nation's shifting fuel mix and the implications of \nthat trend on the highway trust fund.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. As the Senators know, the compromise \nfuels package in the Daschle energy bill, which includes my language to \nban MTBE and clean up the contamination caused by this gas additive, \nwill also dramatically increase the use of ethanol. This compromise \ncame after lengthy negotiations with several members of the Senate. We \nall worked in good faith to reach this agreement.\n\n[[Page S3153]]\n\n  However, the increase in ethanol use will, over time, have a negative \nimpact on the highway trust fund due to the ethanol subsidy which \nexempts ethanol from a good portion of the gasoline tax that pays into \nthe trust fund. This is a concern that virtually all members of the \nEnvironment & Public Works Committee share, and it is problem that we \nwill have to address. I believe that reauthorization of TEA-21 is the \nproper place to fix the trust fund problems caused by the increased \nethanol use.\n  Between now and the time we introduce TEA-21 reauthorization, I would \nencourage all parties to work together, in a similar fashion to the way \nwe reached the fuels compromise, in order to reach a consensus on the \nethanol tax subsidy. If we work together in good faith, I have little \ndoubt we will find a solution that can be included in reauthorization. \nI look forward to working my colleagues in that process.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Our Nation's vulnerability to foreign energy production \nhas been brought into bold relief by the continuing turmoil in the \nMiddle East. It is imperative that our Nation take greater strides to \npromote the use of domestic, renewable fuels as a means of reducing our \ndangerous dependence on imported oil and strengthening U.S. energy \nsecurity.\n  An aggressive program to produce and use more renewable fuel should \nbe one of the pillars of our Nation's energy policy. And, as America \nuses more renewable fuel, we need to make sure that the financial \nsoundness of the highway trust fund is not inadvertently undermined. \nThat is why I strongly support Chairman Baucus' efforts to ensure that \nfuture use of ethanol will have no impact on the trust fund. I applaud \nhis efforts in this regard and pledge to do whatever I can to see that \nwe hold the highway trust fund harmless as we seek to make America more \nenergy independent.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to support the efforts of Chairman \nBaucus and Ranking Member Grassley to ensure that the tax package from \nthe Finance Committee begins to reform our tax policies to provide \nequitable treatment for the highway trust fund, the only source of \nFederal revenues to improve our Nation's transportation infrastructure.\n  The Finance Committee's package ensures that revenue from the 2.5-\ncent excise tax on the sale of gasohol will be transferred to the \nhighway trust fund.\n  It has been my privilege to work closely with Senator Baucus as a \nsenior member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works during \nthe development of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, \nTEA-21. He has always been a steadfast partner on surface \ntransportation issues, and once again, he is providing the necessary \nleadership to protect the solvency and purpose of the highway trust \nfund. All vehicles, regardless of whether they use gasoline or gasohol, \ncause the same damage to our roads. The highway trust fund is the only \nmeans to finance highway maintenance and expansion activities, and \nwithout the Highway Trust Fund Recovery Act our States would receive \nless funding to improve our roads.\n  Depositing the 2.5 cents into the highway trust fund, however, is an \nimportant first step, but only part of the solution. I have been \nworking with Senator Baucus and others to offer an amendment to provide \nfor the full transfer of 5.3 cents to the highway trust fund, but we \nhave decided to reserve this issue for another time. I remain fully \ncommitted to restoring the integrity of the highway trust fund by \nrecovering the entire 5.3 cent per gallon subsidy that gasohol \ncurrently receives.\n  The bill before the Senate also contains other provisions which will \ncontribute to further reductions in revenues to the highway trust fund. \nDepending on the final disposition of the renewable fuels provisions, \nrevenues to the highway trust fund could significantly decrease as the \nrenewable fuels mandate increases. I look forward to working with \nChairman Baucus, Ranking Member Grassley, and the leadership of both \nparties to fully restore revenues to the highway trust fund so that our \nnational network of highways remains a premiere system.\n  Mr. REID. I share my colleagues' concern about the losses to the \nhighway trust fund that result from sale of ethanol-blended fuels. \nThese losses to the highway trust fund have two causes. First, 2.5 \ncents of the existing tax on ethanol goes into the General Fund rather \nthan the highway trust fund. Senator Baucus has introduced a bill to \naddress this problem and I am a cosponsor of that legislation.\n  Second, the trust fund loses revenue because the tax on ethanol-\nblended gasoline is lower than taxes on other fuels. With the mandate \ncontained in this bill, this subsidy will have an increasingly negative \nimpact on revenues into the highway trust fund.\n  Next year we will reauthorize the Transportation Equity Act for the \n21st Century. This Nation has tremendous transportation infrastructure \nneeds that must be addressed if we are to keep our roads safe and our \neconomy moving. As we begin work on this important legislation, I hope \nthat we can address the significant losses to the trust fund that \nresult from current ethanol policy. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on this and other issues related to the reauthorization of \nTEA-21.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Once again, I would like to state my intention of dealing \nwith the ``5.3-cent problem'' as soon as possible. I look forward to \nworking with these Senators and others as we work to protect the \nhighway trust fund our Nation's source of funding for our surface \ntransportation system.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                  Renewable Fuels Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 22, 2002.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Inhofe, Baucus, Smith, Conrad, Grassley, \n     Jeffords, Reid and Daschle: The Renewable Fuels Association \n     (RFA) appreciates your leadership on including a ``Renewable \n     Fuel Standard'' in the Energy Policy Act of 2002 (S. 517). \n     This program will provide significant energy, environmental \n     and economic benefits for the Nation.\n       At the same time, we recognize that an increase in the \n     production and use of renewable fuels, including ethanol, \n     will have an impact on Federal highway excise tax receipts. \n     The RFA does not believe any state should be penalized by the \n     use of renewable fuels. Sound transportation policy and sound \n     energy policy should not be mutually exclusive. Thus, as \n     Congress works to reauthorize highway and transportation \n     funding next year, we wholeheartedly encourage Congress to \n     work towards addressing the issues surrounding the Highway \n     Trust Fund and other transportation trust funds as they \n     relate to ethanol.\n       Much has been made of ethanol's impact on Highway Trust \n     Fund receipts in FY 2003, and at the appropriate time, prior \n     to or during the reauthorization of the Transportation Equity \n     Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), Public Law 105-178, we \n     look forward to working with the United States Senate, the \n     House of Representatives and the Administration, to create \n     the appropriate program to address the needs of these \n     programs.\n       Additionally, we support transferring the 2.5 cents \n     currently directed to the General Fund for deficit reduction, \n     back to the Highway Trust Fund as is included in the ``Energy \n     Tax Incentives Act of 2002'' (S. 1979), which has been \n     approved by the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year.\n       Transportation funding issues are not simple, and we look \n     forward to working with you on this important issue on a \n     unified front to address the many needs of the \n     transportation, petroleum, and renewable fuels industries.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Bob Dinneen,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts by Chairman \nBaucus for correcting an oversight by Congress when it failed to shift \nfrom the general fund to the highway trust fund, 2.5 cents per gallon \ncollected from sales of gasohol. Similar adjustments for other fuels \nwere made by a previous Congress, but not for gasohol.\n  I also want to thank the chairman for refraining from offering an \namendment at this time that would require the general fund to \ncontribute 5.3 cents to the highway trust fund for every gallon of \ngasohol sold.\n  It is wise to wait until next Congress when we can look at the big \npicture. Next year, we need to analyze all revenue sources for the \nhighway trust fund to determine if adjustments are appropriate.\n  We also need to determine if adjustments are appropriate in the way \nwe spend the Highway Trust Funds that are collected. For instance, we \nmay determine that it makes better sense for mass transit subsidies to \ncome from general funds instead of from the highway trust fund.\n\n[[Page S3154]]\n\n  We may find that the subsidies for special motor fuels such as \npropane, methanol, and liquified natural gas should be paid from the \ngeneral fund instead of the highway trust fund. These three fuels are \nnot paying the full 18.3 cents per gallon. Propane receives a 4.7 cent \nsubsidy, liquified natural gas receives a 6.4 cent subsidy, and \nmethanol receives a 9.15 cent subsidy. Much needs to be addressed as we \nreauthorize the highway bill, and approaching this very important \nmatter in a piecemeal fashion would be a mistake.\n\n\n                           Aviation Emissions\n\n  Mr. BURNS. At this time, the General Accounting Office is working on \na study--requested by the House Committee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure, Aviation Subcommittee--to conduct a comprehensive \noverview of key issues associated with emissions from aviation \nactivities. This study would cover the same subject matter as \ncontemplated in Section 803 of H.R. 4. At this time of tight budget \nconstraints, it is not a good use of limited resources to produce \nredundant studies. Accordingly, I urge Senator Murkowski in conference \non the Energy Bill to strike the language in H.R. 4 requesting an \naircraft emissions study.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I agree that this study does appear duplicative.\n  Mr. BURNS. In addition to the GAO study, I wish to bring your \nattention to a voluntary effort to address emissions from the aviation \nsector, known as the ``EPA/FAA Local Air Quality Initiative.'' As part \nof this voluntary initiative, the Environmental Protection Agency, \nFederal Aviation Administration, States, airlines, aerospace \nmanufacturers, and environmental groups are working together to develop \nanalyses that address the same subject matter detailed in H.R. 4.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I agree with my colleague from Montana that there is \nno need at this time for another study on this issue. The Senator has \nmy assurance that I will work to remove this provision when we go to \nconference.\n\n\n                       climate change provisions\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the substitute for Title X of the Senate \nAmendment 2917, and title XIII, encompass significant bipartisan \nprogress on the topic of climate change policy. This progress has been \nreached in discussions involving staff for many Senators with keen \ninterests in this area, including myself and Senator Murkowski on \nbehalf of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senators Byrd \nand Stevens, Senators Kerry and Hagel, and the chair and ranking \nmembers of the Committee on Governmental Affairs and the Committee on \nCommerce, Science and Transportation. All these Committees that I just \nmentioned have important jurisdictional responsibilities under rule XXV \nrelated to the climate change provisions in this bill. There is one \nmajor area in the proposed changes to Senate Amendment 2917 that is \nstill not in agreement, and that will be left to conference for further \ndiscussion, but will describe that in a moment. What has been agreed \nto, and for which there is commitment on the part of the co-sponsors of \nthis amendment to advocate for here in the Senate and maintain in \nconference, is substantial.\n  First, we have developed a streamlined set of findings and a Sense of \nCongress relating to climate change, the shared international \nresponsibility to address the problem, and the role of the United \nStates in that matrix of shared responsibility. Senate Amendment 2917 \nhad, in effect, two sets of findings in this regard. Developing a \nsingle set of agreed-to-statements, on the part of a broad cross-\nsection of Senators with active interests in climate change policy, is \nan important accomplishment.\n  Second, we have taken the fundamental elements of S. 1008, introduced \nby Senators Byrd and Stevens and agreed to nearly all of them. S. 1008 \nwas introduced on June 8, 2001 and referred to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs. That committee held a hearing on the bill on July \n18, and marked the bill up in a business meeting on August 2, 2001. It \nwas ordered reported by voice vote, and the Committee's report, as well \nas additional views of some members, was filed on November 15, 2001. \nThis legislative history should be relevant to those who will be \nresponsible for implementing these provisions. One of the agreed-to \nelements brought in from S. 1008 is a requirement for the development \nof a National Climate Change Strategy, which will be updated every 4 \nyears. That Strategy and its updates will be reviewed by the National \nAcademy of Sciences, which will provide its findings and recommendation \nboth to the President and to Congress. The Strategy will be the central \nfocus for integrating, across the government, a consideration of the \nbroad range of activities and action that can be taken to reduce, \navoid, and sequester greenhouse gas emissions both in the United States \nand in other countries. The development of the Strategy is also \nintended to draw on broad participation from the public, scientific \nbodies, academia, industry, and various levels of State, local, and \ntribal governments. Another agreed-to element from S. 1008 is the \ncreation of an Office of Climate Change Technology in the Department of \nEnergy, and authority for creation of other necessary offices to carry \nout the National Climate Change Strategy in other agencies. The DOE \nOffice will have a special role in bridging the gap that now exists \nbetween the more conventional energy technology R programs now in \nplace at DOE and the necessary research that is pointing the way to \nbreakthrough technologies that could have a pronounced effect on our \nability to meet the climate change challenge. The substantial increase \nin authorization for this function that was contained in S. 1008 is \nmaintained.\n  Third, we have come to agreement on how to improve the structure of \ncoordination of climate change science and monitoring programs across \ngovernment, including the creation of a mechanism to fill gaps in \nresearch efforts among the various agency programs. Substantial \nportions of a bipartisan Commerce Committee bill, S. 1716, the Global \nClimate Change Act of 2001, introduced by Senators Kerry, Stevens, \nHollings, Inouye and Akaka, are included in these sections. This bill \nemerged from a series of hearings held by the Committee during the \n107th Congress on the state of scientific knowledge of climate change \nand its impacts and possible technological means to address the \nproblem. These Commerce Committee provisions include amendments to the \nGlobal Change Research Act, as well as language that ensures the \nprograms and capabilities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration and the National Institute of Standards and Technology \nto monitor, measure, understand, and respond to climate change and \nclimate variability.\n\n  The one area of remaining disagreement in Title X relates to the \nproposed White House Office of National Climate Change Policy, in \nSection 1013 of the proposed text for Title X. I believe that it would \nbe true to say that the co-sponsors of this amendment, at a minimum, \nall support having a locus of accountability for the development and \nimplementation of climate change policy in the Executive Office of the \nPresident. All of us believe that it should be headed by a Senate-\nconfirmed appointee. We did not, however, reach consensus on how this \nposition should be structured and whether the appointee should be a new \nor existing position. We have agreed to move forward to conference with \nthe language of S. 1008, with the expectation that we would be able to \nengage the White House at that point and come to a final resolution of \nhow to provide for the central accountability in the Executive Office \nof the President that is acceptable to all parties.\n  On all other issues in Titles X and XIII aside from Section 1013, \nthough, we are in agreement. We recommend their acceptance to our \ncolleagues here in the Senate and, if adopted, plan to support these \nprovisions strongly in conference.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to thank my colleague for his statement \nand indicate my support for the agreement that we have reached. These \ntwo titles of Senate Amendment 2917 lay the foundation for a sensible \napproach to managing the risk of climate change while providing the \nenergy we will need for continued economic growth. The elements \ncontained in these titles--improved scientific research, investment in \ndevelopment of improved energy technology, transfer of these \ntechnologies to markets at home and overseas, and coordinated climate \npolicy development--are the same elements that were contained in S. 882 \nand S. 1776 in the 106th Congress, and S. 1294\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\nin the 107th Congress, legislation that I was pleased to sponsor or \ncosponsor along with others. Title XIII also contains the elements of \nmy legislation, S. 815, to improve research in the Arctic, including on \ntopics of climate change. I want to thank Senator Bingaman and his \nstaff for their leadership on forging this important bipartisan \napproach to our Nation's climate policy, and I want to thank all those \nSenators and staff who helped to bring these Titles into being.\n  Mr. BYRD. I would like to thank my colleagues for their statements \nand indicate my support for the agreement that we have reached. I would \nalso note the historic nature of what has been negotiated, refined, and \nsupported by the Senate here today. The passage of a national climate \nchange strategy, along with the improved integration of science and \ntechnology programs, is critical to our Nation's long-term energy \npolicy. I appreciate that other Members also believe that, at a \nminimum, there needs to be a Senate-confirmed appointee in the White \nHouse to oversee climate change policy. While I understand that there \nis not full agreement on this issue at this time, I believe that it is \nimportant to have a new, separate office in the White House to serve as \na focal point for this multifaceted, multidimensional, long-term issue. \nAfter further discussion, I hope that these important provisions will \nbe supported by the House energy conferees and the White House as a \npart of a national energy policy.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would like to thank my colleagues for their statements \nand indicate my support for the agreement that we have reached. Title \nX, of Senate Amendment 2917, will address an immediate need to \nstimulate our Nation's research and development in innovative \ntechnologies and attempt to resolve any remaining uncertainties on the \ncauses of climate change. Title XIII will provide the mechanisms to \nbetter assess coastal vulnerability from climate variances and improve \nclimate monitoring, observing and prediction. The Barrow Arctic \nResearch Center, authorized in Title XIII, is intended to replace the \ndecades old and poorly equipped Naval Arctic Research Laboratory in \nBarrow and will perform the desperately needed scientific research on \nclimate change that is already impacting America's Arctic.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would like to thank my colleagues for their \nstatements and indicate my support for the agreement that we have \nreached. As Senator Bingaman has indicated, this language incorporates \nthe essential components of S. 1008, the Climate Change Strategy and \nTechnology Innovation Act of 2001. Senators Byrd and Stevens introduced \nthis important legislation, and I am proud that the Governmental \nAffairs Committee which I chair quickly endorsed the bill. The \ncommittee report accompanying the bill explains the reasoning behind \nthe legislation and, as Senator Bingaman stated, should provide \ndirection to those charged with executing the provisions of Title X. \nBut I would like to summarize a few key points about why this is such \nan important contribution by Senators Byrd and Stevens. First, they \nhave found a constructive way to move forward in a bipartisan fashion \non the issue of climate change, one of the most profound and daunting \nchallenges we face as a Nation and, indeed, a world community. Second, \nthe bill establishes a regime of accountability on climate change--\nunder the legislation, the administration would be required to \narticulate a strategy to reach the long-agreed upon goal of stabilizing \ngreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Third, the bill \nprovides support for the innovative technologies that will be essential \nto meet the challenge of climate change. This legislation is an \nimportant step forward on climate change, and I thank my colleagues for \ntheir work on this provision.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I would like to thank my colleagues for their \nstatements and indicate my support for the agreement that we have \nreached with regard to Title X. A lot of hard work has gone into this \nagreement. It is my belief that there are still many uncertainties with \nregard to climate change. However, I also believe that the potential \nrisks of climate change warrant study, research and technological \ndevelopment. This substitute to Title X goes a long way towards \nachieving those goals. This amendment also recognizes that there are \nmany contributors to climate change beyond CO2 and I \nappreciate that black soot is included. My biggest concern with the \nsubstitute is the creation of a White House Office on Climate Change. \nAs ranking member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, I have \ngreat concerns about duplication and overlayering in government. I hope \nwe can work this out in conference and I look forward to the White \nHouse weighing in on this important issue.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would like to thank my colleagues for their \nstatements and indicate my support for this bipartisan agreement on \nclimate science and technology policy. The Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation over the years has developed and \nimplemented the key statutes governing these matters. These include \nstatutes establishing interagency science and research programs like \nthe Global Climate Change Act, a coordinated Federal science and \ntechnology policy, such as is called for in the National Science and \nTechnology Policy, Organization and Priorities Act, and those \nestablishing the first tier atmospheric science and technology programs \nwithin NOAA and NIST. I fully agree that responsibility for policy \nrelating to climate issues should rest with an individual who is \naccountable to Congress, much as we have done for overall science and \ntechnology policy by exercising our oversight authority over the White \nHouse Office of Science Technology Policy, which will shoulder \nsubstantial responsibilities under this agreement.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I would like to thank my colleagues for their statements \nand indicate my support for the agreement that we have reached. \nIncluded in that agreement is a Sense of the Congress on the \ninternational climate change negotiations. The resolution originally \npassed the Foreign Relations Committee in August of 2001. At that time, \nSenator Biden and Senator Rockefeller played an important role in \ncrafting it. The text as passed out of Committee called on President \nBush to engage in the international negotiations and to present a \nproposal to the Conference of the Parties by October 2001 for a revised \nKyoto Protocol or other binding agreement. However, since the Committee \nacted the state of the international negotiations has fundamentally \nchanged. The revised text, as included in this legislation, reflects \nthose important changes. I appreciate the work of Senators Biden and \nHagel in crafting the updated text.\n  I believe that the bipartisan consensus also strengthens the \nscientific and technical work that needs to be carried out and improves \nupon the structure for doing so. I am particularly pleased that the \nagreement incorporates provisions from the Commerce Committee's bill \nthat will bring the world-class science, technology, and planning \nexpertise of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n(NOAA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and \nother Department of Commerce programs to bear on this problem--whether \nit is in climate observation, measurement and verification, information \nmanagement, modeling and monitoring, technology development and \ntransfer, or hazards planning and prevention. I am also pleased to see \nthe bill includes language to establish a framework for a national \ncoastal and ocean observing system, which is essential for climate \nprediction and coastal response planning.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I would like to thank Chairman Bingaman and Senator \nMurkowski, and their staff, for their leadership in reaching an \nagreement on Title X. I would also like to thank my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle for their efforts, particularly Senators Byrd and \nStevens who authored many of the original provisions included in Title \nX. This agreement represents the hard work of reaching a bipartisan \nconsensus on a very challenging and difficult issue. While recognizing \nthe need for greater coordination of climate change policy, I share \nSenator Thompson's concerns regarding the overlapping bureaucracy \ncreated by a new White House office and look forward to addressing this \nissue more fully in conference. Nonetheless, through the agreement \nreached on Title X we have made considerable progress in advancing \nclimate change policy on a bipartisan foundation.\n\n[[Page S3156]]\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank my esteemed colleagues, Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Murkowski, and those Senators who have taken part in this \ncolloquy today as it shows an unprecedented effort to forge a \nbipartisan agreement to address the various issues relating to climate \nchange and what our domestic approach and strategy should be for short \nand long term goals for stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations \nthrough U.S. actions. In addition, it will help the nation continue its \nefforts to carry out the objectives of the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change signed by President George H.W. Bush in \n1992 and ratified by the U.S. Senate. The major objective of the \nConference is for the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in \nthe atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic, \nor manmade, interference with the climate system.\n\n  I am pleased that Title X calls for an Office of National Climate \nChange Policy in the White House and hope this direction is pursued as \nlast year I expressed my concerns to the Administration that the \nnational energy policy being developed in the White House should not be \ndeveloped independently of our U.S. climate change policy. These \npolicies should be seamlessly coordinated across a number of our \nfederal agencies through a broad range of research activities and \nactions that begin to reduce our Nation's greenhouse gas emissions in \nan environmentally and technologically sound and economically feasible \nmanner.\n  I am particularly pleased that Title XIII calls for an ocean and \ncoastal observing system that will give us real time observations to \nhelp those of us on the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on \nAtmosphere, Oceans and Fisheries greater understand, assess and respond \nto both human-induced and natural processes of climate change and \nsupport efforts to restore the health of and manage coastal and marine \necosystems and living resources. Activities will also include research \non abrupt climate change urged in December 2001 by the National \nAcademies for NOAA research to identify the likelihood and potential \nimpact of a sudden change in climate in response to global warming. I \nlook forward to working with my colleague sand the White House on this \nissue of great importance not only to me, but to the Nation, to the \ninternational community, and to those generations to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3156-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

LACAVERA, U.S. NAVY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize \nand say farewell to an outstanding Naval Officer, Captain, select, Tara \nL. LaCavera, upon her change of command from Naval Station Pascagoula. \nThroughout her career, Captain, select, LaCavera has served with \ndistinction. It is my privilege to recognize her many accomplishments \nand to commend her for the superb service she has provided the Navy, \nthe great State of Mississippi, and our Nation.\n  Captain, Select, LaCavera began her career as a Fleet Support Officer \nin 1980 after completing a Bachelor of Arts in Journalism from the \nUniversity of Georgia and attending the Officer Candidate School in \nNewport, RI. She served with distinction early in her career as Message \nCenter Officer on the staff of Commander, Oceanographic Systems Command \nAtlantic; Regional Evaluation Center Watch Officer and Surveillance \nTraining Operational Procedures Standardization at Naval Facility \nBrawdy, Wales, UK; Fleet Telecommunications Officer, Naval \nTelecommunications Area Master Station, Naples, Italy; and Intelligence \nOfficer at Commander Naval Allied Forces Mediterranean, Naples, Italy. \nLater assignments included Administrative Department Head and Public \nAffairs Officer at NAS Whiting Field, FL; Protocol Officer and Special \nAssistant to the Commander, Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet; \nand Executive Officer, Naval Station Norfolk, VA. She received a Master \nof Science degree in International Affairs from Troy State University \nin 1990 and was selected as a 1994 Federal Executive Fellow at the John \nF. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.\n  As Commanding Officer, Naval Station Pascagoula, Captain, select, \nLaCavera's foresight during the planning and execution of numerous \nconstruction projects greatly enhanced the quality of life for the many \nSailors of the home ported ships and tenant commands. The results \ninclude construction of a new Gulf Coast USO and Learning Resource \nCenter, major expansions of the Fire Department and cardio-fitness \ncenter/gymnasium, addition of an on-base service station, and site \nselection for an off-base military housing project. She was responsible \nfor the intense coordination and certification procedures required for \nthe unprecedented full weapons off-load of the USS COLE, DDG 67, that \nentailed the safe handling of 86.3 thousand pounds of explosives from \nthe severely damaged destroyer. After the terrorist attack of September \n11, 2001, Captain, select, LaCavera immediately executed an increased \nsecurity posture, utilizing recalled reservist, auxiliary security \nforce personnel, and available base assets to provide harbor patrol and \nprotection for home ported ships and other pre-commissioning units \nlocated at Ingalls Shipyard. Her strong guidance and leadership ensured \nthat Naval Station Pascagoula's personnel, facilities, and weapons \nplatforms were well protected.\n  Throughout her distinguished career, Captain, select, LaCavera has \nserved the United States Navy and the nation with pride and excellence. \nShe has been an integral member of, and contributed greatly to, the \nbest-trained, best-equipped, and best-prepared naval force in the \nhistory of the world. Captain, select, LaCavera's superb leadership, \nintegrity, and limitless energy have had a profound impact on Naval \nStation Pascagoula and will continue to positively impact the United \nStates Navy and our nation. Captain, select, LaCavera relinquishes her \ncommand on April 25, 2002 and reports as Chief Staff Officer, Naval \nSurface Warfare Center, Dahlgren, VA where she will continue her \nsuccessful career. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, I wish Captain, select, LaCavera ``Fair Winds and Following \nSeas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3156-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3156-S3157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SCOTTIE STEPHENSON\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this past week a deep sense of sadness \nsettled in on the Helms family--and countless other families as well. \nScottie Stephenson's life was finally ended at age 80 by an unyielding \nillness.\n  Scottie had gone on to her reward after 80 years of loving and being \nloved by everybody around her. For various reasons, I had to cancel my \nplans to be there when the final tributes were being paid to this \nremarkable lady who was declared many times to be the First Lady of \nCapitol Broadcasting Company in Raleigh--which, is where I began my \nyears in broadcasting--and where I ended them when in 1972 I allowed \nmyself to be talked into seeking election to the U.S. Senate.\n  Mrs. Louise ``Scottie'' Stephenson never quite accepted the death of \nher handsome husband, Nelson W. Stephenson, whom she married in 1948 \nbut who died in 1961.\n  Scottie knew the end was approaching early this year. We discussed it \na number of times always with the conclusion that when it happened, she \nwould probably be the No. One Gate Keeper serving Saint Peter. As her \ncondition worsened, I set aside a time each day to be devoted to \ndiscussions with Scottie about those years gone by when she and I were \nofficers of Capitol Broadcasting Company. Those, she used to remark, \nwere the ``salad days''.\n  Then came that inevitable morning when I called and a tape responded. \nScottie had mentioned that she would arrange that.\n  Jim Goodmon, now president and CEO of Capitol Broadcasting Company, \nwas in high school when he began working nights at Capitol \nBroadcasting.\n  Our hometown morning paper, the News and Observer, published in its \nApril 17 editions a comprehensive obituary outlining many of the \naspects of\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\nScottie's remarkable life. I ask unanimous consent that it and an \neditorial from the same paper be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [The News & Observer, Wed., Apr. 17 2002]\n\nLouise `Sottie' Stephenson--`First Lady of Capitol Broadcasting' Worked \n                             There 58 Years\n\n                       (By Sarah Lindenfeld Hall)\n\n       Louise ``Scottie'' Stephenson, known as the first lady of \n     Capitol Broadcasting Co., who helped win the original license \n     for WRAL-TV, died Monday morning after a long illness. She \n     was 80.\n       Stephenson starting working for Capitol 58 years ago and \n     was the communications company's longest-serving employee, \n     with a tenure even longer than that of its founder, A.J. \n     Fletcher. She spent at least three days a week at work until \n     October, when she became ill, but continued to work at home. \n     In February, she attended a board meeting of the A.J. \n     Fletcher Foundation, held at Springmoor retirement community \n     where she lived so she could participate.\n       ``She was a great lady, and she had the respect of \n     everybody that's ever worked for Capitol, and we're going to \n     really miss her personally and we're going to miss her \n     professionally,'' said James F. Goodmon, president and CEO of \n     Capitol Broadcasting Co. ``Scottie was sort of our contact \n     with who we are and what we stand for and was an important \n     continuity beginning with the founding of the TV station. She \n     was there when it started.''\n       Stephenson started her career as a receptionist, secretary \n     and record librarian for what was then WRAL-AM. She answered \n     the phones for the popular radio show ``The Trading Post,'' \n     with Fred Fletcher as host, where listeners could swap and \n     sell goods over the air. She became the company's corporate \n     secretary and member of the board of directors in 1953.\n       She was the only woman on a five-member team seeking a \n     television station license for WRAL.\n       She helped prepare 3,000 pages of paperwork and testified \n     before the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, \n     D.C., during the 75-day hearing, according to a Capitol press \n     release. The company received its license in December 1956.\n       Stephenson, a native of Goldsboro, graduated from Broughton \n     High School and took classes at N.C. State University. She \n     married Nelson W. ``Steve'' Stephenson in May 1948. He died \n     in 1961, and she never remarried.\n       Stephenson served on the board of the Fletcher Foundation \n     and volunteered with local arts groups. For more than four \n     decades, she coordinated the Golden Agers Club Christmas \n     parties in Raleigh. And for a half-century, Stephenson had \n     lunch once a week with her good friend Pota Vallas, whose \n     family founded National Art Interiors at Hillsborough Street \n     and Glenwood Avenue.\n       Scottie was active in the Triangle community as well, \n     serving on the board of the A.J. Fletcher Foundation and \n     supporting the arts through volunteer work with the Raleigh \n     Fine Arts Society and the North Carolina Symphony. She \n     coordinated the Golden Age Club of Raleigh's annual Christmas \n     luncheon for over four decades and saw that luncheon grow \n     from 50 to over 1,500 people. Scottie served on the Board of \n     Directors and as Secretary of the Tammy Lynn Center, a \n     resident care facility for severely retarded children, and \n     worked with a variety of other community organizations.\n       In 1992, she was named Business and Professional Woman of \n     the Year of the Wake County Academy of Women, sponsored by \n     the YWCA. She was also the first recipient of the Junior \n     Women's Club Outstanding Working Member award.\n       Scottie most recently resided at Springmoor where she was \n     once again a leader and an inspiration to many. She organized \n     and coordinated outings for her friends to everything from \n     dinner parties to Durham Bulls games.\n       She was preceded in death by her husband, Nelson W. \n     ``Steve'' Stephenson, in 1961. Her brother, Sam D. Scott, \n     Jr.; sister, Nancy Scott Reid; and niece, Betty Scott Toomes, \n     also preceded her in death.\n       Funeral services will be 10 a.m. Thursday, April 18 at St. \n     Michael's Episcopal Church in Raleigh. Burial will be at \n     Montlawn Memorial Park.\n       Surviving family members include niece, Alice Reid Ritter \n     and husband, Doug of Severna Park, MD; nephew, Samuel Scott \n     Reid and wife, Kathy of Raleigh, NC; niece, Nancy Scott Young \n     and husband, Gary of Manhattan, KS; nephew, Sam D. Scott III \n     and wife, Carolyn of Lousville, KY; great-nephew, Christopher \n     James Stephenson and wife, Ann; and many great nieces and \n     nephews. She is also survived by longtime friend, Roberta \n     Glover.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       [From the News & Observer]\n\n                            Always on the Go\n\n       Even after she moved to the Springmoor retirement community \n     in Raleigh, Scottie Stephenson had not retired from her \n     vocation, and avocation, of getting things done. At \n     Springmoor, she organized her neighbors in all sorts of \n     activities, getting them out and about.\n       For 58 years, Stephenson, who died Monday at the age of 80, \n     served Raleigh's Capitol Broadcasting Company--the first \n     employee and the one who worked there longer than anyone, \n     including the founder, the late A.J. Fletcher. She was out \n     and about there, too--from helping the company obtain the \n     first television station license in Raleigh for WRAL-TV, to \n     writing commercials, to filing complicated federal reports. \n     Stephenson, a gracious and merry person, also served in a \n     multitude of community endeavors through volunteer work in \n     the arts and as a board member of the A.J. Fletcher \n     Foundation. For thousands of citizens in the Capital City, \n     she'll be remembered as coordinating the Golden Age Club's \n     annual Christmas luncheon.\n       Pillars of the community, such people are called, and too \n     often as they become older their accomplishments seem to fade \n     in memory. It should not be so, for those accomplishments, by \n     one person at a time, build a city. And thankfully, it was \n     not so with Scottie Stephenson, who was acclaimed after her \n     death in on-air tributes from her latest generation of \n     admirers at WRAL. She would have appreciated them. And they \n     were well-earned.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3157-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                RECOGNITION OF REVEREND KENNETH DYKSTRA\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I rise in recognition of the \nsteadfast service and commitment of a principled man of God, Reverend \nKenneth Dykstra of Pella, IA. Reverend Dykstra served in the capacity \nas Senior Pastor of Third Reformed Church in Pella from 1969 to 1979. \nDuring this period he was involved and actively participated in two \nextremely consequential missionary trips, one to India and the other to \nMexico--both with the Reformed Churches of America.\n  Kenneth Dykstra devoted the next 8 years of his admirable career to \nprison inmates through a Bible study ministry as the Senior Pastor with \nthe Worthington Reformed Church in Worthington, MN.\n  Reverend Dykstra returned home to the beautiful state of Iowa in 1987 \nto retire in the Dutch community of historic Pella. Knowing ``true'' \nretirement for a pastor is rarely an option, he served in a variety of \nroles including mentor for a church's new pastor and as a Minister of \nCalling with focused attention on visitations to shut-ins and nursing \nhome residents.\n  Kenneth Dykstra's significant contribution to not only those his \nministry touched, but also the entire State of Iowa, in no way goes \nunnoticed. I thank and commend him today for all of his dedication, \ncommitment and positive influence on those fortunate enough to know \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3157-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3157-S3158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           OUR WESTERN AGENDA\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as I sit here and look around at my \nsurroundings, there is a dominant feature, our Nation's Capitol. The \nRotunda is a landmark that is recognized throughout our country.\n  What is noticeably missing from this landscape is Idaho!\n  Our Nation's Capitol is vastly different from Idaho. Each day, \nCongressmen come to work and see the historical landmarks of the \nCapitol. They do not see Idaho's vast mountains, rural countrysides, \nexpansive farmland, or raging rivers, the landmarks we all feel in part \ndefine Idaho.\n  Every day, I work to promote and advocate for our Western principles \nand our Western lifestyle. These Western principles are the touchstone \nfor my service in Congress.\n  And every day, my goal is to work to establish Federal policies that \nare responsive to the needs and interests of Idaho and the West, as \nwell as to lead in developing natural resource and energy policies that \nprotect Western water and ensure a clean, safe environment, consistent \nwith sound science, community stability, economic growth and the \nprinciple of multiple use.\n  I am a fiscal conservative who believes in the principles of multiple \nuse, conservation, and management at the local level. I believe these \nfundamental ideas should guide all natural resource decisions. Natural \nresource management is about balancing the needs of the people with the \nneeds of the land. I have never met someone who wants dirty air, \nundrinkable water, or devastated forests. We all want a livable \nenvironment. Where people differ is over how these goals will be \naccomplished.\n  That being said, I have compiled all of my thoughts and feelings on \nWestern issues to create what I call ``Our Western Agenda.''\n\n[[Page S3158]]\n\n  ``Our Western Agenda'' is designed to provide suggestions on specific \nIdaho and Western issues. It proposes a compass for how our natural \nresource policy should address these issues.\n  While the list of issues that touch the West is much longer than \nthis, I believe the following ideas comprise the core. First, I believe \naccess must be guaranteed to our public lands for multiple uses, \nincluding ranching, mining, and recreation.\n  In order to maintain the values of public lands, I believe the most \ncritical characteristic that needs to be preserved is access. \nConservation and multiple use, for a century now the dominant policy of \nour public lands, require access. Only by accessing these areas can \nactive management take place, providing protection for our public lands \nagainst disease, wildfire, and insect epidemics.\n  Next, the long struggle over public access to our lands has left many \nwith battle fatigue and I believe through collaborative conservation, \nmutual goals of various user groups can be accomplished. Clearly, we \nneed a new approach to solving natural resource conflicts, user \nconflicts, and management conflicts.\n  In order to resolve conflict, all the players need to come ``to the \ntable'' to explore our shared ideals instead of reinforcing our \ndisagreements.\n  I think we should adopt the strategies of some local activists who \nhave turned away from the existing national standoff. Instead, they are \nworking to bridge differences, to find a common solution that reflects \nthe national environmental ethic. In a phrase: collaborative \nconservation.\n  I believe collaborative conservation should include the following. We \nmust discard the doctrine of national communities of interest, where \ndecision makers are selected from national organizations, and return to \na doctrine of local community interest. We should not allow Federal \nbureaucracies and national organizations to upset the fragile process \nof local consensus making.\n  We need a process of continuous improvement in reducing our impacts \non the land. We must stipulate that for all the progress made by \ncommodity-producing industries, loggers and ranchers, and \nrecreationists, we can always do better.\n  Federal Government policies desperately need modernization. The \nGovernment needs to manage better. It must not allow restrictive \napproaches based upon inflexible national mandates to trump what would \notherwise be environmentally sound activities and shut out local people \nwho have to live with the consequences of Federal decisions.\n  As a community, we need to come together to solve the challenges of \nmultiple-use in order to achieve conservation and balance on our public \nlands. I also believe as our Nation's energy policy continues to \ndevelop, we will continue to look to have access to our public lands to \nprovide resources.\n  During the past decade, we have heard a chorus of energy marketers \nand environmentalists sing the praises of natural gas as a cost-\neffective and environmentally sensitive energy source. The past \nadministration hailed natural gas as the cleanest fuel for home heating \nand aggressively pushed utility companies to convert oil and coal-fired \nelectric plants to gas.\n  The irony is that all this aggressive promotion has not been backed \nby commensurate efforts to ensure supply. Indeed, the Clinton \nadministration complicated our ability to retrieve adequate supplies of \ngas by locking up Federal land deposits of this valuable energy source, \nwith an estimated 40 percent of potential gas resources in the United \nStates on Federal lands that are either closed to exploration or \ncovered by severe restrictions.\n  Increases in Federal red tape and bureaucratic inefficiency raised \nconsumer costs while denying consumers the choices they were promised. \nThe fact of the matter is as the United States enters the 21st century, \nour Nation lacks a readily available and sufficient supply of natural \ngas to satisfy current demand, let alone the increasing demand that we \nexpect in the immediate future. Consequently, natural gas prices are \nhigh and will likely rise in the future.\n  This will not change until we reverse government policies that have \nforeclosed opportunities for choice of fuels.\n  Furthermore, failure to encourage investment in the transmission of \nelectricity has threatened the reliability of service throughout the \ncountry.\n  The Department of Energy has estimated that we will need to construct \nover the next several years an additional 255,000 miles of distribution \nlines, at an estimated cost of $120 to $150 billion, to ensure that our \nelectric system remains the most reliable in the world.\n  The notion that our Nation can rely so heavily on natural gas, \nmaintain severe restrictions on exploration and production, and still \nenjoy low prices is, as Secretary Abraham has stated, ``a dangerous \nassumption.''\n  Last, I believe a common sense approach will protect our public lands \nagainst catastrophic fires, weeds, and exclusive policies. Fire is a \nnatural component of any ecosystem. It stimulates plant growth, \nmaintains a plant understory, and creates diversity. All of these \naspects are healthy characteristics of a thriving forest.\n  However, when fire is suppressed and active forest management \nactivities--thinning, prescribed burns, etc.--that mimic fire behavior \nare ignored, this is a prescription for disaster.\n  The neglectful management practices of the past will continue to \nplague our public lands unless we pursue active management practices \nthat result in a balanced ecosystem. In order to prevent devastating \nfires, the agencies need the resources and flexibility to make \nmanagement decisions that maintain our public lands.\n  Increased fuel loads create catastrophic fires, contribute to \ndeclining watersheds, increase sedimentation and decrease water \nquality, and lead to the demise of fisheries.\n  This disastrous spiral must be stopped. Non-native weeds are a \nserious problem on both public and private lands across the Nation. \nThey are particularly troublesome in the West, where much of our land \nis entrusted to the management of the Federal Government.\n  Like a ``slow burning wildfire,'' noxious weeds take land out of \nproduction, force native species off the land, and interrupt the \ncommerce and activities of all those who rely on the land for their \nlivelihoods, including farmers, ranchers, recreationists, and others.\n  Forests and rangelands are dynamic systems that constantly change in \nresponse to both natural and man-made events. They are never static. \nAny scientist will tell you that a healthy forest or rangeland requires \nactive management. Like your backyard garden, you can't just let it go \nand expect it to be productive and healthy. You have to actively manage \nthe resource by doing everything from thinning trees, to spraying for \nweeds, to maintaining roads.\n  Without access to our lands, it is impossible to manage our public \nlands properly. Without access, we will end up with unhealthy lands \nthat are prime candidates for catastrophic wildfires and insect \ninfestations of epic proportions.\n  It is time to move our public lands management agencies away from a \n``one-size-fits all'' management policy and back toward their original \nmissions.\n  As set forth in law, the missions are to achieve high-quality land \nmanagement under the sustainable multiple-use management concept to \nmeet the diverse needs of all users.\n  In all of this, I believe we still have an Old West, a rural society \ncentered on the original commodity-producing industries and \nagriculture, and then there is a New West, centered on the vigorous \nquest for a quality of life that includes the enjoyment of the \noutdoors.\n  What ties ``the old'' and ``the new'' together is an appreciation for \nthe resources and the value that multiple uses contribute to our \nlivelihoods and communities.\n  Natural resource management is about bringing the Old West and the \nNew West together to balance the needs of all the people with the needs \nof the land.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3158-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3158-S3159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HADASSAH'S 90TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SCHUMER.

Hadassah, the largest Zionist, largest\n\n[[Page S3159]]\n\nJewish, and largest women's membership organization in the country, was \nfounded in 1912 by Henrietta Szold to help meet medical needs in what \nwas then Palestine.\n  Since that time, Hadassah has been a leading force in Israel's \nmedical needs through Mt. Scopus Hospital, Ein Karem Hospital, and \nvarious clinics across the country. Hadassah hospitals, in addition to \nserving as a model of peaceful coexistence in the Middle East, provide \nstate-of-the-art health care to 600,000 patients a year--regardless of \nrace, religion, creed or national origin--and often treat the most \ncritically wounded in the region's ongoing conflicts.\n  Through the College of Technology, the Career Counseling Institute, \nand Youth Villages in Israel and through Young Judaea and the Hadassah \nLeadership Academy in the United States, Hadassah has been critical in \nupgrading the educational and learning opportunities for the people of \nIsrael.\n  In the United States, Hadassah women sold $200 million in US World \nWar II bonds as its first national domestic effort. Since then, \nHadassah women have been actively engaged in health education programs \non breast cancer and osteoporosis; voter registration efforts; Jewish \neducation; grassroots advocacy on US-Israel relations, Jewish communal \nconcerns; women's issues; humanitarian relief to distressed communities \nand countries; and volunteer work in literacy programs and at domestic \nviolence shelters.\n  In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the continued efforts of \nHadassah members and their ninety year history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3159-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO FREDERICK BISHOP\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join as a \ncosponsor of this extremely important legislation, S. 2189, the Steel \nIndustry Retiree Benefits Protection Act of 2002. This legislation is \ncoming none too soon, for hardworking steelworker retirees who, through \nno fault of their own are facing the loss of health and death benefits, \nand for the industry itself that needs this relief in order to \nrevitalize itself and remain competitive.\n  In particular, the act would preserve the health and death benefits \nfor the retirees of steel, iron ore, and coke companies facing \nconsolidation or liquidation. The bill establishes a health benefits \nprogram for steel retirees of acquired or shuttered steel companies \nmodeled on health plans available for Federal workers. Like its model, \nthe new program will require retirees to pay reasonable monthly \npremiums, will provide coverage for prescription drugs, and will \ndeliver medical care through preferred provider organizations. In \naddition to health coverage, the proposed legislation extends a $5,000 \ndeath benefit to the designated beneficiary of each enrolled retiree.\n  The hard working families of the Iron Range of Minnesota are facing \nexcruciatingly tough times. Their situation is truly desperate and they \nneed our help.\n  The taconite industry in which generations of workers have proudly \nlabored has been ravaged by surges of semi-finished steel slab dumped \nin this country by our trading partners. Many have lost their jobs, \njust last year 1,400 workers were laid off when LTV Steel Mining closed \nits doors. Now, 10,000 former employees, their spouses and dependents \nface loss of health insurance and many are finding that they stand to \nlose a good portion of the pensions the company had promised.\n  Last month, the HELP Committee held hearings on the need for legacy \ncost legislation both for retirees and for the industry. The testimony \nwas riveting. The need compelling. My good friend, Jerry Fallos, \npresident of Local 4108 of the United Steelworkers of America, \ntestified at those hearings. The stories he had to tell were grim \nindeed.\n  As Jerry said, the people of the Iron Range are used to hard times. \nThey have weathered any number of challenges over the years. They are \ngood people, proud, hard-working, the best you can find anywhere. They \nare survivors, and they will get through these difficult times as well. \nThey have given much to their country, and now they need our help.\n  I am determined to give them that help. The good people of the range \nhave responded to their country in its times of needs. Over the years \nour Nation's economy flourished and our manufacturing industries boomed \nfrom the iron ore produced through the labors of steelworkers on the \nrange.\n  There is both a moral imperative to meeting this challenge as well as \na business necessity in doing so.\n  As a matter of fairness and economic justice, we must help the \nworking families who gave their all to this industry and who, through \nno fault of their own, indeed because of the unfair practices of our \ntrading partners, find themselves without jobs, health care or adequate \npensions. In the last 2 years, 32 U.S. steel companies have filed for \nbankruptcy, and these companies represent nearly 30 percent of our \ndomestic steel making capacity. These failures were not the fault of \nthe workers at these companies. These failures resulted from unfair and \npredatory practices of our trading partners over an extended period.\n  Equally as important, our domestic steel industry will simply not be \nable to revitalize itself and remain competitive while shouldering the \nmassive legacy cost burdens that exist. With on average three retirees \nfor every active employee, the industry faces virtually insurmountable \nbarriers. Government assistance is essential and we will need the \nPresident's active support for legacy cost legislation if we are to \nprevail.\n  Unfortunately, however, the President appears to have washed his \nhands of this problem. He claims to have done his part by providing \nsection 201 relief to the industry. The issue of legacy costs, he says, \nfor the sake of retirees and to permit industry consolidation, is \nsomeone else's problem.\n  It is not, however, as simple as that. First, the jury is still out \non whether the section 201 relief will in fact be that meaningful. \nAccording to recent accounts, there are over 1,000 exceptions to the \nPresident's section 201 decisions being considered. And, Secretary \nO'Neill is reported as saying that he suspects ``a significant \nproportion of them will be favorably decided.'' Moreover, the \nPresident's section 201 decision did nothing for the iron workers in \nMinnesota and Michigan. While the President imposed a fairly \nsignificant tariff on every other product category for which the \nInternational Trade Commission found injury, for steel slab he decided \nto impose ``tariff rate quotas.'' This brings us virtually no relief. \nNearly 7 million tons of steel slab can continue to be dumped on our \nshores before any tariff is assessed. The injury will continue.\n\n[[Page S3160]]\n\n  Second, by ignoring the legacy cost issue, the President is walking \naway from the hard work that must be done to promote industry \nconsolidation and re-vitalization, an objective this administration has \nbeen advancing from the start.\n  We need serious legacy cost legislation and that is precisely what \nthis bill represents. I urge my colleagues in the Senate and the House \nto support its passage. And I urge the President to take another look \nat this issue and work with us on a meaningful solution.\n  The viability of our domestic steel industry, and our national \nsecurity, are at stake here. We must act, and we must act soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3160-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF MR.

Organized in 1935, Delta \nCouncil brings together the agricultural, business, and professional \nleadership of the area to solve common problems and promote the \neconomic development of the Mississippi Delta region.\n  As President of Delta Council, Ben has been an effective leader in \npromoting sound agricultural policy in a year when that issue has been \nso vital to rural America. His insights and experience have been of \ninvaluable assistance to my staff and me as we addressed policies to \nmake American agriculture stronger.\n  Ben also distinguished himself in other areas of public policy that \nhave impacted on his beloved Mississippi Delta region. He has been a \nproponent for better schools and innovative educational models; he has \nsupported transportation and water resource projects that are vital to \nthe future of Northwest Mississippi; his personal farming practices \nhave served as an example for sound conservation and environmental \nmeasures, and he has been a leader in defining and shaping alliances in \nhealth care that can have both an immediate and long-term impact on the \nwell-being of citizens in the Delta.\n  The level of Ben's commitment to Mississippi and its people has been \nevident since he returned home to Cary after graduating from \nMississippi State University. In addition to operating a cotton, \nsoybean, wheat, and pecan farm in Sharkey and Issaquena Counties, he \nowns and operate Grundfest and Klaus Gin.\n  Ben serves as a chairman of the board for the Bank of Anguilla. He is \na member of the Anshe Chesed Temple in Vicksburg and serves on the \nboard of the Institute of Southern Jewish Life. A Founding Director and \ncurrent Board member of Delta wildlife. Ben has also served as a member \nof the Sharkey-Iaasquena Soil and Water Commission.\n  I congratulate Ben Lamensdorf for his contributions to the Delta \nregion Mississippi and the Nation, and I look forward to his future \ncontributions in improving the quality of life for our \ncitizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3160-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXPEDITED BANKRUPTCY PROCEDURES\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to explain my \nopposition to the Murkowski and Stevens amendments to S. 517, the \nEnergy Reform bill.\n  Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not the only \nsolution to our dependence on foreign oil. I am opposed to drilling in \nthe Arctic Refuge because I believe there should be a comprehensive \nnational energy policy.\n  During the Senate's ongoing consideration of S. 517, I have voted in \nfavor of strengthening Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards \nfor SUVs and light trucks. By increasing oil savings, stronger CAFE \nstandards would make us less dependent on foreign fuel and demonstrate \na real commitment to conservation. The CAFE amendment failed. I voted \nin support of increasing the amount of renewable fuels in our energy \nportfolio. This provision failed. I have also supported tax credits for \ndomestic marginal well production and providing incentives to consumers \nfor purchasing alternative technology vehicles and improving the \nefficiency of their homes and offices. I am optimistic that these \nefforts will be successful.\n  I am prepared to support a national energy policy that balances our \nenergy needs with strong environmental protection. Reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil is a national priority, but should not come \nsolely at the expense of our nation's precious natural resources.\n  First established by President Eisenhower in 1960, the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge was created and later expanded to preserve the \narea's unique wilderness and wildlife values by protecting fish and \nwildlife populations in their natural diversity. The 1.5 million acres \nof the Refuge's coastal plain proposed for oil exploration and \ndrilling, known as the ``1002'' area, is the most biologically \nproductive part of the Refuge. The coastal plain is home to a diverse \ncollection of wildlife including polar and grizzly bear populations, \nmusk oxen, 180 bird species, and one of the largest caribou herds in \nNorth America.\n  Each year, the Porcupine Caribou herd--over 129,000 members strong--\nmigrates 400 miles from wintering grounds in the north central Canadian \nYukon to the Arctic Refuge coastal plain where they give birth to their \nyoung. In a typical year, the herd can birth up to 40-50,000 calves.\n  The importance of the Porcupine Caribou herd can best be illustrated \nby a 1987 Conservation Agreement between the Governments of Canada and \nthe United States. The Agreement recognizes the value of the Porcupine \nherd and the importance of protecting their birthing grounds to ensure \nthe future sustainability of the population as a vital part of the \nRefuge's ecological system. In Canada, land north of the Porcupine \nRiver was withdrawn from development in 1978. Oil exploration and \ndrilling in the Porcupine Caribou herd's prime calving grounds remains \nan item of contention between the United States and Canada and \nthreatens the future of the Conservation Agreement.\n  I am prepared to support a national energy policy that balances our \nenergy needs with strong environmental protection. Reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil is a national priority, but should not come \nat the expense of our nation's precious natural resources. Allowing oil \nand gas development in the coastal plain promises only short-term \nbenefits that may irreparably damage the wildlife values and unique \nvitality of the Arctic Refuge.\n  Opening the Arctic Refuge to oil exploration and drilling should not \nbe the primary component of the effort to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil. There are other steps we should take that would provide \nmore benefits in the long term.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3160-4", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3160-S3161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMS RIGHTS WEEK\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, statistics show that a woman is \nraped every 5 minutes in the United States and that one in every three \nadult women experiences at least one physical assault by a partner \nduring adulthood. In fact, more women are injured by domestic violence \neach year than by automobile accidents and cancer deaths combined. \nStatistics that report the abuse of our children are equally \nstaggering. Nationwide, an estimated 826,000 children are victims of \nabuse and neglect, a number greater than the population of my home \nState of South Dakota.\n  April is recognized as both Child Abuse Prevention Month and Sexual \nAssault Awareness Month. This week,\n\n[[Page S3161]]\n\nthe week of April 21-27, is National Crime Victims Rights Week and is a \ngood time to take a serious look at the progress we have made in \naddressing the problem of abuse against women and children in our \ncommunities. In 1983, I introduced legislation in the South Dakota \nState Legislature to use marriage license fees to help fund domestic \nabuse shelters. At that time, thousands of South Dakota women and \nchildren were in need of shelters and programs to help them. However, \nfew people wanted to acknowledge that domestic abuse occurred in their \ncommunities, or even in their homes.\n  During the last 7 years, I have led efforts in the U.S. Congress to \nauthorize the original Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, and, most \nrecently, expand and improve the program to assist rural communities. \nSouth Dakota has received over $8 million in VAWA funds for women's \nshelters and family violence prevention services. In addition, the law \nhas doubled prison time for repeat sex offenders, established mandatory \nrestitution to victims of violence against women, and strengthened \ninterstate enforcement of violent crimes against women. South Dakotans \ncan also call a nationwide toll-free hotline for immediate crisis \nintervention help and free referrals to local services. The number to \ncall for help is 1-800-799-SAFE.\n  In South Dakota last year, over 5,500 women were provided assistance \nin domestic violence shelters and outreach centers thanks, in part, to \nVAWA funds. While I am pleased that we have made significant progress \nin getting resources to thousands of South Dakota women in need, it is \nimportant to look beyond the numbers. Mr. President, 5,500 neighbors, \nsisters, daughters, and wives in South Dakota were victimized by abuse \nlast year. Thousands of other women are abused and do not seek help. We \nmust also recognize that the problem is multiplied on the reservations \nwhere Native American women are abused at two-and-a-half times the \nnational rate and are more than twice as likely to be rape victims as \nany other race of women.\n  The words of a domestic abuse survivor may best illustrate the need \nto remain vigilant in Congress and in our communities on preventing \ndomestic abuse. A woman from my State wrote me and explained that she \nwas abused as a child, raped as a teenager, and emotionally abused as a \nwife. Her grandchildren were also abused. In her letter, she pleaded:\n\n       Don't let another woman go through what I went through, and \n     please don't let another child go through what my \n     grandchildren have gone through. You can make a difference.\n\n  We all can make a difference by protecting women and children from \nviolence and abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3161-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  GREEK SUPPORT FOR THE WAR ON TERROR\n\n Mr. WARNER.

ADAMS, JR.\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on May 3, 2002, the Delaware State \nBar Association will present its prestigious Liberty Bell Award to \nThurman G. Adams, Jr.\n  I could introduce Thurman Adams to my colleagues in any number of \nways, he is the dean of the Delaware State Senate, the majority leader, \nand by the time his current term ends, he will have served longer than \nany Delaware State Senator in history. And Delaware has a long history.\n  Senator Adams has served on and, in fact, chaired virtually every \nmajor committee, including 25 years-and-counting as chairman of the \nExecutive Committee, current chairmanship of the Banking Committee, \npast chairmanship of the Agriculture Committee, and current service on \nthe Judiciary, Administrative Services, Permanent Rules and Ethics \nCommittees, as well as his role in the Senate leadership.\n  I could also introduce Thurman Adams as, in many ways, the \nquintessential Delawarean, I should add Sussex Countian, and I can \npinpoint it even more to his beloved town of Bridgeville.\n  Like his father, Thurman was born on the family farm on the road now \nknown as Adams Road. His grandson lives there now, and runs the farming \noperations day-to-day. Thurman graduated from Bridgeville High School, \nand then from the University of Delaware. After college, he joined the \nfamily feed, grain and farm business, T.G. Adams & Sons, which he now \nserves as president.\n  So, I could introduce Thurman Adams as one of the longest serving and \nmost influential leaders of our State. I could introduce him as \nrepresenting the great tradition of Delaware agriculture, Delaware \ntowns, Delaware small business and Delaware families.\n  I also have the very great privilege of being able to introduce \nThurman Adams as my friend, a friend I deeply admire as a man of his \nword, a man of conviction, a man of values and of principle.\n  And in a much higher tribute to him, I could introduce Thurman as the \nhusband of one of the truly great ladies I have met in my life, Hilda \nMcCabe Adams.\n  I have been with Hilda and Thurman Adams in times of victory and \ncelebration, and I have been with them in times of tragedy and loss. In \nevery circumstance, they have been the definition of class, and they \nhave more integrity in their little fingers than most of us will be \nable to summon in our lifetimes.\n  Their journey together has been inspiring to those of us who are \nlucky enough to be around them, but it has not always been easy. They \nendured the loss of an infant grandchild, and then tragically in May of \n2000, the death of that baby's father, their son, Brent McCabe Adams, \nSr., at the age of 45. And now they are facing, with characteristic \nstrength and courage, a serious illness for Hilda.\n  In honoring Thurman Adams, the Delaware Bar Association will, \nrightly, pay tribute to his decades of service to our State, his \nparticular contribution as a leader on the Judiciary Committee, and his \nrole in leading the Senate confirmation process, never as a mere matter \nof procedure, but thoughtfully and skillfully, for so many members of \nthe Bar, and other Delawareans, who have been appointed to positions \nwithin our State government.\n  For my part, I would like to pay tribute to Thurman and Hilda Adams \nas, simply, exceptional and inspiring human beings, the best of \ncitizens, the best of neighbors, and the best friends anyone could ask \nfor. They just don't make them like Hilda and Thurman very often. We in \nDelaware are very lucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3161-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3161-S3162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure I rise \ntoday to call my colleagues' attention to Jewish Heritage Week, which \nwas recognized from April 14 through 21, 2002.\n  Every spring since 1976, during the season in which Jewish people \ncommemorate Passover, Yom Hashoah (Holocaust Memorial Day) and Yom \nHa'atzmaut (Israel Independence Day), a week is set aside to promote \nand encourage all Americans to learn about the history of Jewish \nAmericans and to participate in activities that highlight the \naccomplishments of these citizens. It is in light of that charge I come \nto the Senate floor to highlight this important week.\n  For centuries, Jews from across the globe have come to America \nseeking the ability to worship in freedom and to pursue their \nindividual and hopes and dreams in peace. Throughout the many years, \nnearly every facet of American culture has been cultivated and enriched \nby the talents of Jewish people, including business, education, \nresearch, fine arts, and government. In fact many of their names and \naccomplishments are found in the textbooks of students across this \ncountry. Their contributions to our character and culture help make \nAmerica a better place.\n  We also commend our friends in Israel as they celebrated the 54th \nanniversary of the founding of the modern State of Israel. This \nmilestone is a tribute to the strength and resilience of the Jewish \nspirit in the face of great adversity. At this time, it is imperative \nthat freedom loving people from around the world stand with the people \nof Israel in affirming Israel's right of existence and its right to \ndefend itself against those who would use terror to achieve their \ngoals.\n  I know my Senate colleagues will join with me and the millions of \nAmericans to mark this special week to pay tribute to the countless \npeople of Jewish faith and descent who have contributed so much to the \ndefinition of our nation and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3162-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3162-S3164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  CLINTON ADMINISTRATION ROAD- LESS POLICY: STILL AND ALWAYS A BAD IDEA\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the issue of \nroadless areas in our national forests and to discuss the manner in \nwhich the last administration developed their roadless area \nconservation rule. Recently, the OMB released a draft report on the \ncosts and benefits of Federal regulations. In this report, the Clinton \nroadless rule is estimated at costing $164 million and saving only \n$219,000. I find these numbers outrageous and add this to the extensive \nlist of reasons why this rule would hinder our rural economies. With \nthis, I would like to again express my objections to the Clinton \nroadless rule and explain why I feel it is still a bad idea.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Lands of the \nEnergy and Natural Resource Committee I held a series of five hearings \nbetween November 1999 and March 2001 to examine the development and \npotential consequences of the Clinton administration's roadless area \nconservation rulemaking. Our hearing record details numerous questions \nabout the process and data used to develop the roadless area \nconservation rule. While I will not recite the entire history of this \ncontroversy, I do want to highlight some of the key dates and events to \nhelp my colleagues better understand this issue.\n  To begin, the issue of roadless has been around for more than 30 \nyears. In 1972, the Forest Service began Roadless Area Review and \nEvaluation One, RARE I, to examine how much land should be set aside \nand recommended for potential Wilderness.\n  A more comprehensive RARE II inventory was undertaken in 1982. That \nreview examined a little more than 62 million acres. A variety of \nwilderness bills passed by Congress allocated 24 percent of the RARE II \nlands to Wilderness. The forest plans completed by the Forest Service \nbetween 1983 and 1998 recommended--10 percent of the 62 million acres \nfor wilderness; 17 percent of the land for future wilderness study; 38 \npercent of the land for other multiple-uses that excludes timber \nharvesting; and 14 percent of the 62 million acres to be considered as \npotentially available for timber harvesting.\n  It is important to know that from the time RARE I was completed, \nthrough 1998, that less than 1.1 million acres of the original 62 \nmillion RARE II acres were utilized for timber harvesting. Thus, less \nthan 2 percent of the entire 62 million acres had been entered, or \nwould be entered in the next 5 years, for timber harvesting.\n  In 1998, after an Interior Appropriations vote on funding for Forest \nService road construction, I invited then chief of the Forest Service \nMike Dombeck to my office to discuss the roadless issue. I offered the \nchief my help in working to legislatively resolve this thorny issue. I \nwas politely informed by Chief Dombeck that they would rather resolve \nthe issue administratively.\n  In May of 1999, then Vice President Al Gore, during a speech to the \nLeague of Conservation Voters stated that not only would he eliminate \nall road building, but he would prohibit all timber harvesting in \nroadless areas. In effect he announced the selection of the final \nalternative for the Clinton roadless area conservation rule before the \ndraft rulemaking had even begun.\n  On October 13, 1999, President Clinton, speaking at Reddish Knob, VA, \ndirected the Forest Service to develop regulations to end road \nconstruction and to protect inventoried and un-inventoried roadless \nareas across the National Forest System.\n  On October 19, 1999, the Forest Service published a notice of intent \nto prepare an environmental impact statement to propose protection of \ncertain roadless areas.\n  In June of 2000, Chief Dombeck, in a letter to his employees on the \nroadless issue, stated that ``Collaboration does not alleviate our \nresponsibility to make decisions that we believe are in the best long-\nterm interests of the land or the people who depend on and enjoy it.'' \nMr. Dombeck made it very clear to me that Mr. Gore's desires would be \ncarried out.\n  In the 2000 State of the Union Address, nearly 11 months before the \nfinal roadless area conservation plan was published, President Clinton \nsaid that together, the Vice President and he had ``in the last three \nmonths alone helped preserve 40 million acres of roadless in the \nnational forests.''\n  On November 13, 2000, the final EIS for the roadless rrea \nconservation plan was published. And on January 12, 2001 the final \nroadless area conservation rule was published in the Federal Register. \nThis meant that over the Christmas holiday the agency read, absorbed \nand responded to more than 1.2 million public comments in a little less \nthan 2 months.\n  The Public Lands and Forest Subcommittee hearings that were held, \nmade it clear to me that the decision on what to do about the roadless \nissue was sealed on October 13, 1999 when the President spoke at \nReddish Knob and the rest of this effort was little more than window \ndressing.\n  It was also no surprise to me when U.S. Federal District Court Judge \nEdward Lodge stayed the implementation of this rule in May of 2001. \nWhile Judge Lodge's stay has been appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals, the fact remains that no administration, not the Bush \nadministration, not the Clinton administration, nor any future \nadministration can ignore Judge Lodge's ruling.\n  I know that many in the environmental community, proponents of the \nRoadless Rule, would like to convince us that the Bush administration \nis somehow skirting the law by refusing to fully implement the roadless \narea conservation rule. But, the simple fact is that Judge Lodge \nENJOINED all aspects of the roadless area conservation rule.\n  Some have decried the fact that the Bush administration chose not to \ncontest Judge Lodge's decision in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nThey claim this action by the Bush administration is an attempt to \nrollback a much-needed environmental rule. I think we would be wrong to \ndraw this conclusion. The fact is that every administration faced with \ndefending agency decisions in court examines each case on its merit and \nthen decides which course of action is best for the government.\n\n[[Page S3163]]\n\n  In April of 2001 the Washington Legal Foundation provided an analysis \nof the Clinton administration's failure to defend or appeal cases that \nwent against its natural resource agencies during its 8 long years in \noffice.\n  They found ``13 occasions when the Clinton administration refused to \ndefend resource management decisions of its predecessors, choosing to \naccept an injunction or remand from a U.S. District Court rather than \ndefend those decisions in a U.S. court of appeals.'' [There are] ``at \nleast 28 other occasions, when the Clinton administration refused to \ndefend its own resource management decisions in a court of appeals \nafter receiving an injunction or remand from a U.S. district court.'' \nIn the past, many of the last-minute rules promulgated by a variety of \ndepartments and agencies have been pulled-back and reviewed. We must \nrealize that this is normal and rational behavior when the White House \nchanges hands.\n  So when it came to the roadless area conservation rule, the Bush \nadministration faced a rule that was rushed through the process, that \nimpacted a tremendous amount of land and people, which had been, at \nleast temporarily, struck down by the courts.\n  I want to shift gears here and help my colleagues better understand \nwhat makes this issue so contentious. Beyond the obvious questions of \nwhether or not the process used to develop this rule was honest and \nfair, we have to remember that every rule and regulation any \nadministration undertakes impacts individuals in some local community \nin our great country. As we have taken the time to learn more about how \nthe Clinton roadless conservation rule was developed, it has become \nincreasingly clear to me how rushed the process was and how completely \nthe Forest Service failed to include a level of detail needed by local \npeople to assess how the policy might affect them on an individual \nbasis.\n  While one might be tempted to think the Forest Service was knowingly \nhiding the details of its proposal, I think we all must understand the \nenormity of the task they undertook. They had a policy that covered \nover 60 million acres of our Nation. The last time they attempted a \nsimilar policy, in RARE II, the environmentalists successfully sued and \nthe courts found that the policy failed to examine the proposal at the \nlocal level and sent the Forest Service back to the drawing board.\n  Last summer, my staff took time to better understand why people are \nso upset over the roadless area conservation rule. We found nearly \n43,500 acres of State lands within the RARE II roadless areas and more \nthan 421,500 acres of privately owned lands within these areas. This is \nimportant because, like any neighborhood, how your neighbor manages his \nor her lands greatly impacts how and when you can manage your land.\n  If implemented, the roadless area conservation rule would convey a \nwilderness like management regime on these lands. Think about States \nthat have one or more roadless areas that the Federal Government is \nmanaging as a quasi-wilderness.\n  Imagine for a moment that the State has a constitution that directs \nState lands be managed to produce revenue to pay for the operation and \nbuilding of the schools in that State. Such as my home, the State of \nIdaho happens to have. Don't you think that the State will, in the face \nof this new roadless area conservation rule, experience a new public \nexpectation that they will manage the State lands in a manner similar \nto the surrounding Forest Service roadless area.\n  Let me take this scenario just one more step. Imagine that when Sally \nand Joe come to Idaho to visit the Panhandle National Forest to hike in \nthe wilderness and roadless areas on that forest. They have absolutely \nno idea, nor do they care, that the State of Idaho has State lands in \nthe Panhandle National Forest that are surrounded by Roadless lands. \nThey have no idea, nor do they care, that the State of Idaho by law \nmust manage those lands to generate a revenue stream to support its \neducational system. They arrive in the area knowing they are going into \na roadless area where no timber harvesting, or mining, or any other \nactivities are allowed, and they stumble upon a timber harvesting \noperation on State lands. Most likely they don't even take the time to \nfind out who's land they are looking at. And why should they, they came \nto the Panhandle National Forest to hike in the wilderness.\n  If they are like most Americans they don't know that national forests \nhave a different set of rules than National Parks. Then we are off to \nthe races. They go home to New Jersey or California knowing in their \nhearts that the U.S. Forest Service is carrying out a secret timber \nsale program to circumvent the hard fought roadless area conservation \nrule that they have read so much about in their monthly Sierra Club \nmagazine.\n  They then mount a campaign to end all commodity management on any \nlands within the bounds of roadless areas, no matter who owns those \nlands and no matter what the legitimate goals of that State or private \nlandowner might be.\n  If a local government were going to change the zoning around your \nhome and failed to notify you of the change or what it might mean, I \nimagine you would be skeptical about the process used to develop the \nzoning rule. This is no different. The Forest Service developed this \nrule in a very compressed time frame, with little or no description of \nthe potential impacts of the rule at the local level. As a result a \nnumber of local communities and States became so upset that they have \ngone to court to get this rule overturned. To date there are at least \nnine cases that have been brought to challenge the Clinton \nadministration's roadless area conservation rule.\n  I want to finish up with a series of examples of the types of land \nand infrastructure we have found in some of the national forest \nroadless areas that we examined. Interestingly, we found little or no \nevidence in the Forest Service EIS to suggest that State, private, and \nother Federal landowners were notified by either national or local \nForest Service officials that this policy could affect the National \nForests that surround their lands.\n  Our staff analysis found some very disturbing information. For \ninstance, on the Boise National Forest we found five roadless areas \nwith forest development roads within them. We also found a fire tower \nand an FAA radar site in a RARE II roadless area, and as a result road \nmaintenance and reconstruction will no longer be allowed.\n  On the Panhandle National Forest in Idaho, we found 13 roadless areas \nwith National Forest System Roads within them, along with at least \nthree mines, one Forest Service campground and one power line in one or \nmore of the roadless areas.\n  On the Superior National Forest in the State of Minnesota, we found \nthree roadless areas with National Forest System roads in them, along \nwith four public boat ramps, three Forest Service campgrounds, and one \nmine in the roadless areas.\n  On the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forests in northern Wisconsin we \nfound 1,317 acres of private land and 2,886 acres of State lands within \nthe RARE II roadless areas.\n  On the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia we found 10 RARE \nII roadless areas that contain national forest system roads, along with \na pipeline and parts of a railroad right-of-way within the roadless \nareas. One roadless area that we examined was made up of 75 percent \nprivate property.\n  On the Dixie National Forest in the State of Utah we found 14 RARE II \nroadless areas with national forest system roads within them, as well \nas one reservoir and one water pipeline in a roadless area.\n  On the Gila National Forest, in the State of New Mexico, 11 of the \nRARE II roadless areas on that forest have national forest system roads \nwithin them, as well as one that had a water pipeline within it.\n  I will finish with the Pisgah National Forest in North Carolina, \nwhere we found five areas with one or more national forest system roads \nwithin them, and one roadless area with a Federal Aviation Agency, FAA, \nmicrowave tower site in it.\n  The point of going through this litany is to help my Senate \ncolleagues better understand why national policy, such as this, can be \nbetter developed at the local level, and to help put Judge Edward \nLodge's decision, to stay the implementation of this wrongheaded rule, \nin a better context.\n  We can, and will, continue to argue over the environmental policies \nof this\n\n[[Page S3164]]\n\ncountry in this body. There is room in this debate for opposing views. \nBut in the case of the environmentalist concerns on the Bush \nadministrations new look at the roadless area conservation rule and \ntheir efforts to gain political support to ignore the courts on this \nissue, I would hope that none of us would want this, or any future \nadministration to ignore decisions made by the Federal courts.\n  In closing, I applaud the efforts undertaken by this administration \nto take a careful look at this wrongheaded rule. I hope they listen to \nJudge Lodge and any other court rulings that result from the other \ncases. I am happy to see that the new chief of the Forest Service is \nmore sensitive to local communities and the private and State \nlandowners who will be affected by this or any new roadless area \npolicy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3162-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3162-S3164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  CLINTON ADMINISTRATION ROAD- LESS POLICY: STILL AND ALWAYS A BAD IDEA\n Mr. CRAIG.

We must \nrealize that this is normal and rational behavior when the White House \nchanges hands.\n  So when it came to the roadless area conservation rule, the Bush \nadministration faced a rule that was rushed through the process, that \nimpacted a tremendous amount of land and people, which had been, at \nleast temporarily, struck down by the courts.\n  I want to shift gears here and help my colleagues better understand \nwhat makes this issue so contentious. Beyond the obvious questions of \nwhether or not the process used to develop this rule was honest and \nfair, we have to remember that every rule and regulation any \nadministration undertakes impacts individuals in some local community \nin our great country. As we have taken the time to learn more about how \nthe Clinton roadless conservation rule was developed, it has become \nincreasingly clear to me how rushed the process was and how completely \nthe Forest Service failed to include a level of detail needed by local \npeople to assess how the policy might affect them on an individual \nbasis.\n  While one might be tempted to think the Forest Service was knowingly \nhiding the details of its proposal, I think we all must understand the \nenormity of the task they undertook. They had a policy that covered \nover 60 million acres of our Nation. The last time they attempted a \nsimilar policy, in RARE II, the environmentalists successfully sued and \nthe courts found that the policy failed to examine the proposal at the \nlocal level and sent the Forest Service back to the drawing board.\n  Last summer, my staff took time to better understand why people are \nso upset over the roadless area conservation rule. We found nearly \n43,500 acres of State lands within the RARE II roadless areas and more \nthan 421,500 acres of privately owned lands within these areas. This is \nimportant because, like any neighborhood, how your neighbor manages his \nor her lands greatly impacts how and when you can manage your land.\n  If implemented, the roadless area conservation rule would convey a \nwilderness like management regime on these lands. Think about States \nthat have one or more roadless areas that the Federal Government is \nmanaging as a quasi-wilderness.\n  Imagine for a moment that the State has a constitution that directs \nState lands be managed to produce revenue to pay for the operation and \nbuilding of the schools in that State. Such as my home, the State of \nIdaho happens to have. Don't you think that the State will, in the face \nof this new roadless area conservation rule, experience a new public \nexpectation that they will manage the State lands in a manner similar \nto the surrounding Forest Service roadless area.\n  Let me take this scenario just one more step. Imagine that when Sally \nand Joe come to Idaho to visit the Panhandle National Forest to hike in \nthe wilderness and roadless areas on that forest. They have absolutely \nno idea, nor do they care, that the State of Idaho has State lands in \nthe Panhandle National Forest that are surrounded by Roadless lands. \nThey have no idea, nor do they care, that the State of Idaho by law \nmust manage those lands to generate a revenue stream to support its \neducational system. They arrive in the area knowing they are going into \na roadless area where no timber harvesting, or mining, or any other \nactivities are allowed, and they stumble upon a timber harvesting \noperation on State lands. Most likely they don't even take the time to \nfind out who's land they are looking at. And why should they, they came \nto the Panhandle National Forest to hike in the wilderness.\n  If they are like most Americans they don't know that national forests \nhave a different set of rules than National Parks. Then we are off to \nthe races. They go home to New Jersey or California knowing in their \nhearts that the U.S. Forest Service is carrying out a secret timber \nsale program to circumvent the hard fought roadless area conservation \nrule that they have read so much about in their monthly Sierra Club \nmagazine.\n  They then mount a campaign to end all commodity management on any \nlands within the bounds of roadless areas, no matter who owns those \nlands and no matter what the legitimate goals of that State or private \nlandowner might be.\n  If a local government were going to change the zoning around your \nhome and failed to notify you of the change or what it might mean, I \nimagine you would be skeptical about the process used to develop the \nzoning rule. This is no different. The Forest Service developed this \nrule in a very compressed time frame, with little or no description of \nthe potential impacts of the rule at the local level. As a result a \nnumber of local communities and States became so upset that they have \ngone to court to get this rule overturned. To date there are at least \nnine cases that have been brought to challenge the Clinton \nadministration's roadless area conservation rule.\n  I want to finish up with a series of examples of the types of land \nand infrastructure we have found in some of the national forest \nroadless areas that we examined. Interestingly, we found little or no \nevidence in the Forest Service EIS to suggest that State, private, and \nother Federal landowners were notified by either national or local \nForest Service officials that this policy could affect the National \nForests that surround their lands.\n  Our staff analysis found some very disturbing information. For \ninstance, on the Boise National Forest we found five roadless areas \nwith forest development roads within them. We also found a fire tower \nand an FAA radar site in a RARE II roadless area, and as a result road \nmaintenance and reconstruction will no longer be allowed.\n  On the Panhandle National Forest in Idaho, we found 13 roadless areas \nwith National Forest System Roads within them, along with at least \nthree mines, one Forest Service campground and one power line in one or \nmore of the roadless areas.\n  On the Superior National Forest in the State of Minnesota, we found \nthree roadless areas with National Forest System roads in them, along \nwith four public boat ramps, three Forest Service campgrounds, and one \nmine in the roadless areas.\n  On the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forests in northern Wisconsin we \nfound 1,317 acres of private land and 2,886 acres of State lands within \nthe RARE II roadless areas.\n  On the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia we found 10 RARE \nII roadless areas that contain national forest system roads, along with \na pipeline and parts of a railroad right-of-way within the roadless \nareas. One roadless area that we examined was made up of 75 percent \nprivate property.\n  On the Dixie National Forest in the State of Utah we found 14 RARE II \nroadless areas with national forest system roads within them, as well \nas one reservoir and one water pipeline in a roadless area.\n  On the Gila National Forest, in the State of New Mexico, 11 of the \nRARE II roadless areas on that forest have national forest system roads \nwithin them, as well as one that had a water pipeline within it.\n  I will finish with the Pisgah National Forest in North Carolina, \nwhere we found five areas with one or more national forest system roads \nwithin them, and one roadless area with a Federal Aviation Agency, FAA, \nmicrowave tower site in it.\n  The point of going through this litany is to help my Senate \ncolleagues better understand why national policy, such as this, can be \nbetter developed at the local level, and to help put Judge Edward \nLodge's decision, to stay the implementation of this wrongheaded rule, \nin a better context.\n  We can, and will, continue to argue over the environmental policies \nof this\n\n[[Page S3164]]\n\ncountry in this body. There is room in this debate for opposing views. \nBut in the case of the environmentalist concerns on the Bush \nadministrations new look at the roadless area conservation rule and \ntheir efforts to gain political support to ignore the courts on this \nissue, I would hope that none of us would want this, or any future \nadministration to ignore decisions made by the Federal courts.\n  In closing, I applaud the efforts undertaken by this administration \nto take a careful look at this wrongheaded rule. I hope they listen to \nJudge Lodge and any other court rulings that result from the other \ncases. I am happy to see that the new chief of the Forest Service is \nmore sensitive to local communities and the private and State \nlandowners who will be affected by this or any new roadless area \npolicy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3162-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3162-S3164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  CLINTON ADMINISTRATION ROAD- LESS POLICY: STILL AND ALWAYS A BAD IDEA\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the issue of \nroadless areas in our national forests and to discuss the manner in \nwhich the last administration developed their roadless area \nconservation rule. Recently, the OMB released a draft report on the \ncosts and benefits of Federal regulations. In this report, the Clinton \nroadless rule is estimated at costing $164 million and saving only \n$219,000. I find these numbers outrageous and add this to the extensive \nlist of reasons why this rule would hinder our rural economies. With \nthis, I would like to again express my objections to the Clinton \nroadless rule and explain why I feel it is still a bad idea.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Lands of the \nEnergy and Natural Resource Committee I held a series of five hearings \nbetween November 1999 and March 2001 to examine the development and \npotential consequences of the Clinton administration's roadless area \nconservation rulemaking. Our hearing record details numerous questions \nabout the process and data used to develop the roadless area \nconservation rule. While I will not recite the entire history of this \ncontroversy, I do want to highlight some of the key dates and events to \nhelp my colleagues better understand this issue.\n  To begin, the issue of roadless has been around for more than 30 \nyears. In 1972, the Forest Service began Roadless Area Review and \nEvaluation One, RARE I, to examine how much land should be set aside \nand recommended for potential Wilderness.\n  A more comprehensive RARE II inventory was undertaken in 1982. That \nreview examined a little more than 62 million acres. A variety of \nwilderness bills passed by Congress allocated 24 percent of the RARE II \nlands to Wilderness. The forest plans completed by the Forest Service \nbetween 1983 and 1998 recommended--10 percent of the 62 million acres \nfor wilderness; 17 percent of the land for future wilderness study; 38 \npercent of the land for other multiple-uses that excludes timber \nharvesting; and 14 percent of the 62 million acres to be considered as \npotentially available for timber harvesting.\n  It is important to know that from the time RARE I was completed, \nthrough 1998, that less than 1.1 million acres of the original 62 \nmillion RARE II acres were utilized for timber harvesting. Thus, less \nthan 2 percent of the entire 62 million acres had been entered, or \nwould be entered in the next 5 years, for timber harvesting.\n  In 1998, after an Interior Appropriations vote on funding for Forest \nService road construction, I invited then chief of the Forest Service \nMike Dombeck to my office to discuss the roadless issue. I offered the \nchief my help in working to legislatively resolve this thorny issue. I \nwas politely informed by Chief Dombeck that they would rather resolve \nthe issue administratively.\n  In May of 1999, then Vice President Al Gore, during a speech to the \nLeague of Conservation Voters stated that not only would he eliminate \nall road building, but he would prohibit all timber harvesting in \nroadless areas. In effect he announced the selection of the final \nalternative for the Clinton roadless area conservation rule before the \ndraft rulemaking had even begun.\n  On October 13, 1999, President Clinton, speaking at Reddish Knob, VA, \ndirected the Forest Service to develop regulations to end road \nconstruction and to protect inventoried and un-inventoried roadless \nareas across the National Forest System.\n  On October 19, 1999, the Forest Service published a notice of intent \nto prepare an environmental impact statement to propose protection of \ncertain roadless areas.\n  In June of 2000, Chief Dombeck, in a letter to his employees on the \nroadless issue, stated that ``Collaboration does not alleviate our \nresponsibility to make decisions that we believe are in the best long-\nterm interests of the land or the people who depend on and enjoy it.'' \nMr. Dombeck made it very clear to me that Mr. Gore's desires would be \ncarried out.\n  In the 2000 State of the Union Address, nearly 11 months before the \nfinal roadless area conservation plan was published, President Clinton \nsaid that together, the Vice President and he had ``in the last three \nmonths alone helped preserve 40 million acres of roadless in the \nnational forests.''\n  On November 13, 2000, the final EIS for the roadless rrea \nconservation plan was published. And on January 12, 2001 the final \nroadless area conservation rule was published in the Federal Register. \nThis meant that over the Christmas holiday the agency read, absorbed \nand responded to more than 1.2 million public comments in a little less \nthan 2 months.\n  The Public Lands and Forest Subcommittee hearings that were held, \nmade it clear to me that the decision on what to do about the roadless \nissue was sealed on October 13, 1999 when the President spoke at \nReddish Knob and the rest of this effort was little more than window \ndressing.\n  It was also no surprise to me when U.S. Federal District Court Judge \nEdward Lodge stayed the implementation of this rule in May of 2001. \nWhile Judge Lodge's stay has been appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals, the fact remains that no administration, not the Bush \nadministration, not the Clinton administration, nor any future \nadministration can ignore Judge Lodge's ruling.\n  I know that many in the environmental community, proponents of the \nRoadless Rule, would like to convince us that the Bush administration \nis somehow skirting the law by refusing to fully implement the roadless \narea conservation rule. But, the simple fact is that Judge Lodge \nENJOINED all aspects of the roadless area conservation rule.\n  Some have decried the fact that the Bush administration chose not to \ncontest Judge Lodge's decision in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nThey claim this action by the Bush administration is an attempt to \nrollback a much-needed environmental rule. I think we would be wrong to \ndraw this conclusion. The fact is that every administration faced with \ndefending agency decisions in court examines each case on its merit and \nthen decides which course of action is best for the government.\n\n[[Page S3163]]\n\n  In April of 2001 the Washington Legal Foundation provided an analysis \nof the Clinton administration's failure to defend or appeal cases that \nwent against its natural resource agencies during its 8 long years in \noffice.\n  They found ``13 occasions when the Clinton administration refused to \ndefend resource management decisions of its predecessors, choosing to \naccept an injunction or remand from a U.S. District Court rather than \ndefend those decisions in a U.S. court of appeals.''

Mr. President, tomorrow marks the 87th \nanniversary of the start of the Armenian genocide, and I rise today to \nhonor the victims of this horrific event.\n  As we take time to reflect on this dark chapter of world history, I \nam not sure what is more troubling: The fact that so many people no \nlonger remember the Armenian genocide, or that there are still people \nwho deny it ever took place. To those who would deny it, I refer them \nto the U.S. National Archives which contains thousands of pages of \nsource material proving the Armenian genocide did occur. To those who \nno longer remember, we must tell the story or face the possibility that \nhistory may repeat itself.\n  On April 24, 1915, approximately 200 Armenian religious, political, \nand intellectual leaders were arrested in Constantinople and \nsubsequently killed. Shortly afterward, the entire Armenian people were \nforcibly removed from their homeland in present-day eastern Turkey and \ndeported. Over a million and a half Armenians were killed or died as a \nresult of the deportation between 1915 and 1923, and another 500,000 \nwere forced into exile. All told, one-third of the Armenian population \nwas killed during this brutal episode.\n  Despite having their population decimated and scattered into exile, \nthe Armenian people have been able to maintain a rich culture and a \nstrong sense of their own history. They should be proud of their many \naccomplishments in the nearly nine decades since the genocide. It is \nwith this strong sense of the past that the Armenian people today are \nbuilding a brighter future.\n  As we know all too well, the Armenian genocide was the first, but not \nthe last, genocide of the 20th Century. We join with the Armenian \npeople to remember the victims and to keep alive the memory to ensure \nsuch a tragic event never occurs again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3164-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PERIODIC REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT \n           NARCOTICS TRAFFICKERS CENTERED IN COLOMBIA--PM 81\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\n       To the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c) and 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a 6-month periodic \nreport that my Administration has prepared on the national emergency \nwith respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia \nthat was declared in Executive Order 12978 of October 21, 1995.\n                                                         George Bush.  \nThe White House, April 23, 2002.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3164-3", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:28 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to 15 \nU.S.C. 1024(a), the Speaker appoints the following Member of the House \nof Representatives to the Joint Economic Committee: Mr. Hill of \nIndiana.\n  The message also announced that pursuant to section 801 of title 2 of \nthe United States Code, the minority leader appoints the following \nMembers to the Congressional Recognition for Excellence in Arts \nEducation Awards Board: Mr. Hinchey of New York and Ms. McCollum of \nMinnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3164-4", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3164-S3165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-6554.

A bill to resolve certain conveyances and provide for \nalternative land selections under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \nAct related to Cape Fox Corporation and Sealaska Corporation, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will address an equity issue for one of Alaska'a rural village \ncorporations.\n\n[[Page S3167]]\n\n  Cape Fox Corporation is an Alaska Village Corporation organized \npursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, ANCSA, by the \nNative Village of Saxman, near Ketchikan, AK. As with other ANCSA \nvillage corporations in Southeast Alaska, Cape Fox was limited to \nselecting 23,040 acres under Section 16 of ANCSA. However, unlike other \nvillage corporations, Cape Fox was further restricted from selecting \nlands within six miles of the boundary of the home rule City of \nKetchikan. All other ANCSA corporations were restricted from selecting \nwithin two miles of such a home rule city.\n  The six mile restriction went beyond protecting Ketchikan's watershed \nand damaged Cape Fox by preventing the corporation from selecting \nvaluable timber lands, industrial sites, and other commercial property, \nnot only in its core township but in surrounding lands far removed from \nKetchikan and its watershed. As a result of the six mile restriction, \nonly the mountainous northeast corner of Cape Fox's core township, \nwhich is nonproductive and of no economic value, was available for \nselection by the corporation. Under ANCSA, however, Cape Fox was \nrequired to select this parcel.\n  Cape Fox's land selections were further limited by the fact that the \nAnnette Island Indian Reservation is within its selection area, and \nthose lands were unavailable for ANCSA selection. Cape Fox is the only \nANCSA village corporation affected by this restriction.\n  Clearly, Cape Fox was placed on unequal economic footing relative to \nother village corporations in Southeast Alaska. Despite its best \nefforts during the years since ANCSA was signed into law, Cape Fox has \nbeen unable to overcome the disadvantage the law built into its land \nselection opportunities by this inequitable treatment.\n  To address the inequity, I have introduced the ``Cape Fox Land \nEntitlement Adjustment Act of 2002.'' This bill will address the Cape \nFox problem by providing three interrelated remedies.\n  1. The obligation of Cape Fox to select and seek conveyance of the \napproximately 160 acres of unusable land in the mountainous northeast \ncorner of Cape Fox's core township will be annulled.\n  2. Cape Fox will be allowed to select and the Secretary of \nAgriculture will be directed to convey 99 acres of timber land adjacent \nto Cape Fox's current holdings on Revilla Island.\n  3. Cape Fox and the Secretary of Agriculture will be authorized to \nenter into an equal value exchange of lands in southeast Alaska that \nwill be of mutual benefit to the Corporation and the U.S. Forest \nService. Lands conveyed to Cape Fox in this exchange will not be \ntimberlands, but will be associated with a mining property containing \nexisting Federal mining claims, some of which are patented. Lands \nanticipated to be returned to Forest Service ownership will be of \nwildlife habitat value and will consolidate Forest Service holdings in \nthe George Inlet area of Revilla Island. The Forest Service supports \nthe transfer of these lands back to Federal ownership.\n  The land exchange provisions of this bill will help rectify the long-\nstanding inequities associated with restrictions placed on Cape Fox in \nANCSA. It will help allow this Native village corporation to make the \ntransition from its major dependence on timber harvest to a more \ndiversified portfolio of income-producing lands.\n  The bill also provides for the resolution of a long-standing land \nownership problem within the Tongass National Forest. The predominant \nprivate landowner in the region, Sealaska Corporation, holds the \nsubsurface estate on several thousand acres of National Forest System \nlands. This split estate poses a management problem which the Forest \nService has long sought to resolve. Efforts to address this issue go \nback more than a decade. Provisions in the Cape Fox Land Entitlement \nAdjustment Act of 2002 will allow the agency to consolidate its surface \nand subsurface estate and greatly enhance its management effectiveness \nand efficiency in the Tongass National Forest.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 2223. A bill to provide for the duty-free entry of certain tramway \ncars for use by the city of Portland, Oregon; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nextend an import duty suspension for the Central City Streetcar in the \nCity of Portland, OR. The City of Portland purchases the streetcars \nfrom a manufacturer in the Czech Republic. Previous streetcar shipments \nwere duty-free under legislation granting special status to the \nexporting nation, the Czech Republic. The City has ordered two new \nstreetcars which will be shipped on May 1, 2002. However, that duty-\nfree exemption has expired, adding $130,000 to the price of these \nstreetcars. This legislation will provide duty-free entry for those two \nstreetcars ordered by the City of Portland, thus saving the City of \nPortland $130,000.\n  I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, \nin introducing this bipartisan legislation to provide this duty \nsuspension for the City of Portland's Central City Streetcar. I urge \nall my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2227. A bill to clarify the effective date of the modification of \ntreatment for retirement annuity purposes of part-time services before \nApril 7, 1986, of certain Department of Veterans Affairs health-care \nprofessionals; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I introduce legislation today to fix \na long-standing inequity.\n  Last December, Congress passed the Department of Veterans Affairs \nHealth Care Programs Enhancement Act of 2001. Enacted as Public Law \n107-135, this legislation gave VA several tools to respond to the \nlooming nurse crisis. In addition, it altered how part-time service \nperformed by certain title 38 employees would be considered when \ngranting retirement credit.\n  Previously, the law required that title 38 employees' part-time \nservices prior to April 7, 1986, be prorated when calculating \nretirement annuities, resulting in lower annuities for these employees. \nSection 132 of the VA Health Programs Enhancement Act was intended to \nexempt all previously retired registered nurses, physician assistants, \nand expanded-function dental auxiliaries from this requirement. \nHowever, the Office of Personnel Management has interpreted this \nprovision to only apply to those health care professionals who retire \nafter its enactment date.\n  The legislation I introduce today would require OPM to comply with \nthe original intent of the VA Health Programs Enhancement Act, and \ntherefore to recalculate the annuities for these retired health care \nprofessionals. This clarification would not extend retirement benefits \nretroactively to the date of retirement, but would ensure that \nannuities are calculated fairly from now on for eligible employees who \nretired between April 7, 1986, and January 23, 2002.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in restoring our original legislative \nintent to this issue of fairness for retired VA health care \nprofessionals, and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2227\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF MODIFICATION OF TREATMENT FOR \n                   RETIREMENT ANNUITY PURPOSES OF CERTAIN PART-\n                   TIME SERVICE OF CERTAIN DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                   AFFAIRS HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS.\n\n       (a) Effective Date.--The effective date of the amendment \n     made by section 132 of the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Health Care Programs Enhancement Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-\n     135; 115 Stat. 2454) shall be as follows:\n       (1) January 23, 2002, in the case of health care \n     professionals referred to in subsection (c) of section 7426 \n     of title 38, United States Code (as so amended), who retire \n     on or after that date.\n       (2) The date of the enactment of this Act, in the case of \n     health care professionals referred to in such subsection (c) \n     who retired before January 23, 2002, but after April 7, 1986.\n       (b) Recomputation of Annuity.--The Office of Personnel \n     Management shall recompute the annuity of each health-care \n     professional described in the first sentence of subsection \n     (c) of section 7426 of title 38, United States Code (as so \n     amended), who retired before January 23, 2002, but after \n     April 7, 1986,\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\n     in order to take into account the amendment made by section \n     132 of the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care \n     Programs Enhancement Act of 2001. Such recomputation shall be \n     effective only with respect to annuities paid after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, and shall apply beginning the \n     first day of the first month beginning after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n\n  S. 2228. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs to operate up to 15 centers for \nmental illness research, education, and clinical activities; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I introduce legislation today to \nallow researchers and clinicians in the Department of Veterans Affairs \nto establish up to ten more centers to study and treat mental \nillnesses.\n  Historically, as many as one-third of veterans seeking care at VA \nhave received mental health treatment, and research suggests that \nserious mental illnesses affect at least one-fifth of veterans who use \nthe VA health care system. About 450,000 of the approximately 2.3 \nmillion veterans who receive compensation from VA have service-\nconnected psychiatric and neurological disorders. These statistics do \nnot reflect problems that affect veterans alone: in 1999, the Surgeon \nGeneral of the United States reported that mental disorders account for \nmore than 15 percent of the overall burden of disease from all causes, \nslightly more than all forms of cancer. Major depression alone ranked \nsecond only to heart disease in impact.\n  In 1996, Congress authorized VA to establish five centers dedicated \nto mental illness research, education, and clinical activities. These \nMental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Centers, called \n``MIRECCs'' by VA, integrate basic and clinical research with a \ntraining mission that allows VA to translate new findings into improved \npatient care. Research undertaken within these centers has helped to \nincrease our fundamental understanding of mental illnesses, and has \ngiven VA caregivers more and better tools to treat patients with mental \ndisorders so they can function more easily within their communities.\n  Because they have proved so effective at fostering scientific, \nclinical, and educational improvements in mental health care, I have \nintroduced legislation today that would allow VA to expand the number \nof these centers from the five authorized programs to a possible total \nof fifteen. Based on the programs' success, VA researchers have already \nstarted three more centers, expanding the number of existing programs \nto eight, and have demonstrated their willingness to open more in the \nnear future. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nexpansion of this program, which benefits not only veterans but the \nentire mental health care community.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2228\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORITY OF SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO \n                   OPERATE ADDITIONAL CENTERS FOR MENTAL ILLNESS \n                   RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND CLINICAL ACTIVITIES.\n\n       Section 7320(b)(3) of title 38, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``five centers'' and inserting ``15 \n     centers''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (by request):\n  S. 2229. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize a \ncost-of-living increase in rates of disability compensation and \ndependency and indemnity compensation, and to revise the requirement \nfor maintaining levels of extended-care services to veterans; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \nrequested by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as a courtesy to the \nSecretary and the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA. Except in unusual \ncircumstances, it is my practice to introduce legislation requested by \nthe Administration so that such measures will be available for review \nand consideration.\n  This ``by-request'' bill contains two sections. The first would \nauthorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase \nadministratively the rates of compensation for service-disabled \nveterans, and for the dependent survivors of veterans whose deaths were \nservice-related, beginning this December. The rate of increase, as \nrequested by VA in its proposed budget for FY 2003, would be the same \nas the cost-of-living adjustment provided under current law to \nveterans' pension and Social Security recipients.\n  The second section of this bill would allow VA to change the way that \nit calculates the number of veterans receiving VA long-term care. In \n1999, Congress passed the Veterans Millennium Health Care Benefits Act, \nwhich required VA to maintain the level of extended care services \noffered to veterans at the 1998 level. VA has argued that this law, \nbased on the average daily census in VA-operated nursing homes, \nunfairly ignores care provided through contracts with private nursing \nhomes and by VA-subsidized State nursing homes. The requested bill \nwould amend the law to include nursing home care furnished by community \nproviders and State veterans homes when determining whether VA has \nmaintained extended care services at the mandated 1998 level.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and Secretary \nPrincipi's transmittal letter that accompanied the draft legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2229\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES TO TITLE 38, UNITED STATES \n                   CODE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans \n     Benefits Improvement Act of 2002''.\n       (b) References.--Except as otherwise expressly provided, \n     whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in \n     terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other \n     provision, the reference shall be considered to be made to a \n     section or other provision of title 38, United States Code.\n\n        TITLE I--INCREASE IN COMPENSATION RATES AND LIMITATIONS\n\n     SEC. 101.

Richard B. Cheney,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is a draft bill containing two \n     very important components of the President's FY 2003 budget \n     request for the Department of Veterans Affairs: legislation \n     to (1) authorize a cost of living increase in rates of \n     disability compensation and dependency and indemnity \n     compensation, and (2) revise the requirement for maintaining \n     levels of extended-care services to veterans. I request that \n     this bill be referred to the appropriate committee for prompt \n     consideration and enactment.\n       Section 101 of the draft bill would direct the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs to increase administratively the rates of \n     compensation for service-disabled veterans and of dependency \n     and indemnity compensation (DIC) for the survivors of \n     veterans whose deaths are service related, effective December \n     1, 2002. As provided in the President's FY 2003 budget \n     request, the rate of increase would be the same as the cost-\n     of-living adjustment (COLA) that will be provided under \n     current law to veterans' pension and Social Security \n     recipients, which is currently estimated to be 1.8 percent.\n       We estimate that enactment of this section would cost $279 \n     million during FY 2003, $1.66 billion over the period FY \n     2003-2007 and $3.45 billion over the period FY 2003-2012. \n     Although this section is subject to the pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) \n     requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 \n     (OBRA), the PAYGO effect would be zero because OBRA requires \n     that the full compensation COLA be assumed in the baseline. \n     We believe this proposed COLA is necessary and appropriate in \n     order to protect the benefits of affected veterans and their \n     survivors from the eroding effects of inflation. These worthy \n     beneficiaries deserve no less.\n       Section 201 of the draft bill would amend section 1710B(b) \n     of title 38, United States Code, to revise the statutory \n     requirement that the Secretary continue to provide veterans \n     with extended care services at 1998 levels. Current law, \n     established in the 1999 Veterans Millennium and Health Care \n     Benefits Act, requires VA to maintain the staffing and level \n     of extended care services provided by the Department \n     nationally in facilities of the Department at levels not less \n     than the staffing and level of such services provided \n     nationally during FY 1998. We propose to amend the law as \n     it applies to nursing home care to allow VA to also count \n     nursing home care VA procures in the community, and \n     supports in State nursing homes, when determining whether \n     the Department is maintaining its level of effort in \n     providing such care.\n       For more than 30 years, VA has provided veterans with \n     nursing home care through contracts with private sector \n     nursing homes and by paying states per diem for nursing home \n     care furnished in State nursing homes. Of the total amount of \n     VA-supported nursing home care in FY 2000, VA furnished \n     approximately thirty-eight percent directly in VA-operated, \n     nursing homes. VA supported approximately twelve percent \n     through contracts with private nursing homes, and fifty \n     percent through care furnished in State nursing homes.\n       VA also provides up to sixty-five percent of the cost of \n     construction of State nursing homes. That has encouraged the \n     expansion of the State Home Program to the point that there \n     are currently 108 such homes nationwide. The availability of \n     the State Home Program and the contract program has improved \n     veterans' access to nursing home care, and has provided \n     veterans with greater choice to meet both clinical needs and \n     preferences of placement near family. We believe it is \n     appropriate and these two sources of nursing home care be \n     counted when assessing the effort VA puts into nursing home \n     care.\n       Increasing the FY 2002 average daily census in VA nursing \n     homes to 1998 levels would require us to divert to that \n     program large amount of funds VA currently devotes to other \n     health-care purposes, including payments for community \n     nursing-home care, and grants to construct State nursing \n     homes. However, as stated above, the community and State \n     nursing home programs enable VA to offer veterans both choice \n     and access to care closer to loved ones, values that VA does \n     not want to jeopardize. Using other extended care funds to \n     immediately move to achieve 1998 levels could jeopardize the \n     excellent mix of those other services that VA now offers. The \n     Department now provides veterans a balanced program of \n     extended care services that best meets their needs. It would \n     greatly disserve veterans to dramatically shift funding to \n     meet the strictures of the current requirement for provision \n     of care in VA-operated nursing homes, particularly when the \n     cost of contract nursing homes care is significantly less \n     than the cost of providing care in VA facilities.\n       Enactment of our proposal would permit us to continue the \n     overall FY 1998 level of effort for this care as measured by \n     average daily census, without the need to divert an estimated \n     $161.2 million by the end of FY 2004 from resources which \n     would otherwise be available to meet other critical health-\n     care needs.\n       We are advised by the Office of Management and Budget that \n     there is no objection to the transmittal of this draft bill \n     to the Congress and its enactment would be in accord with the \n     program of the President.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              Anthony J. Principi.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 2230. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to make \npermanent the authority of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nguarantee adjustable rate mortgages, to authorize the guarantee of \nhybrid adjustable rate mortgages, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \ncomment briefly on legislation I am introducing which will help many \nveterans achieve the dream of home ownership. The legislation would \npermit the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, to guarantee adjustable \nrate mortgage, ARM, loans as part of its loan guaranty program. The \nlegislation would also give VA the authority to guarantee a relatively \nnew type of ARM financing, ``hybird'' ARM loans. Hybrid ARM's provide a \nfixed rate of interest during the first three to ten years of the loan, \nand an annual interest rate adjustment thereafter. Both conventional \nARM's and hybrid ARM's would expand the financing options available to \nveterans, options which are currently available under Federal Housing \nAdministration, FHA, insured loan programs for non-veterans.\n  The VA loan guaranty benefit has helped millions of active duty \nservice members and veterans to purchase homes without a down payment. \nVA currently provides a guaranty only on loans applying a fixed rate of \ninterest over a thirty year period, so-called ``30-year conventional'' \nloans. While a 30-year conventional loan makes sense for some home \nbuyers, it does not provide the flexibility others need given differing \npersonal circumstances. ARM loans and hybrid ARM loans provide that \nflexibility.\n  Traditional ARM and hybrid ARM loans provide flexibility by offering \nlower rates of interest during an initial period, one year for \ntraditional ARM's and three, five, seven, or ten years for hybrid \nARM's, as compared to 30-year conventional rates. Lower rates translate \ninto lower monthly payments, often making a home more affordable and \npermitting home buyers to qualify for loans. In addition, hybrid ARM's \nhave another attractive aspect in that they provide the security of a \nlower interest rate for a fixed number of years prior to the annual \nadjustment period. Service members and veterans who know beforehand \nthey will be moving out of their homes in a set number of years may \nfind hybrid ARM's make financial sense given their circumstances. While \nhome buyers must be prudent in choosing to use ARM financing, \nforeclosing the option to veterans, in my estimation, smacks of \npaternalism. ARM loans are insured by FHA; my legislation would simply \napply to the VA loan guaranty program a principle already embraced by \nFHA and the commercial lending sector: one type of financing does not \nmeet all home buyer needs.\n\n  This bill would also extend certain protections to veterans who use \nARM financing. During an annual interest rate adjustment period, rates \nwould not be permitted to increase more than one percent. Further, \ninterest rates would not be permitted to exceed more than five \npercentage points above the initial fixed rate. These are standards \nthat have evolved in the marketplace over the past 20 years; veterans, \nlike other home purchasers, should gain the benefit of these \nprotections\n\n[[Page S3170]]\n\n  The VA supports the addition of an ARM option to its loan guaranty \nprogram. It administered a successful, and popular, ARM pilot program \nin the mid 1990's; the program was so popular that ARM's constituted up \nto 21 percent in 1995, of VA-guaranteed home loans. Unfortunately,the \nprogram was not reauthorized by Congress. The time has arrived to \nrectify that oversight. I ask my colleagues for their support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2230\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide an \nincremental increase in amounts of educational assistance for survivors \nand dependents of veterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly on legislation I have introduced today which would increase \neducational assistance benefits for two highly worthy groups: survivors \nof service members who were killed on active duty or who died after \nservice as consequence of service-related disabilities; and immediate \nfamily members of veterans who survived service but who are living with \npermanent and total disabilities.\n  No one can doubt that spouses and children of service-deceased \nmembers of the armed forces are worthy of our Nation's gratitude. No \nless worthy are those whose veteran-spouse returned from service in a \nprofoundly disabled state and, in many cases, later died as a direct \nresult of that same disability. It is entirely proper that the Nation \nprovide these worthy people with sufficient educational assistance \nbenefits to offset the loss of support that would have been provided by \nthe veteran but for his or her service-related wounds.\n  The legislation I introduce today would increase the rate of monthly \nSurvivors' and Dependents' Education Assistance, DEA, benefits from \n$670 to $985. The increase would be phased in over a two-year period, \nand would reflect the same phased-in increase provided to veterans \neligible for Montgomery GI Bill, MGIB, benefits under Public Law 107-\n103, the recently-enacted ``Veterans Education and Benefits Expansion \nAct of 2001.'' Under my bill, DEA benefits would first increase from \n$670 to $900 per month on October 1, 2002, and to $985 per month on \nOctober 1, 2003. In addition, the legislation would equalize with MGIB \nbenefits the number of months, at 36, an eligible person would be \nallowed to use his or her benefit.\n  This legislation would create parity between DEA and MGIB monthly \nbenefits as recommended by a recent Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, \nprogram evaluation. Both programs would provide an aggregate of $35,460 \nworth of education benefits. Thus, both veterans and survivors would \nhave the resources necessary to meet the average cost of tuition, fees, \nroom, and board at four-year, public institutions of higher learning. \nAs was stated by VA's Deputy Secretary, Dr. Leo Mackay, in connection \nwith a Committee on Veterans Affairs hearing on June 28, 2001, VA \n``believe[s] it is only fair that these benefits should be at the same \nlevel as those provided to veterans.'' VA estimates that a monthly \nbenefit at that level will entice 90% of eligible persons to use the \nbenefit.\n\n  In addition to increasing DEA benefits, the legislation I have \nintroduced today would provide a $4 million funding increase for State \nApproving Agencies, SAA, State educational program certifying offices \nwhich are funded by VA grants. These offices protect the integrity of \nVA educational assistance and job-training programs and protect \nveterans and survivors, and, not unimportantly, taxpayers, from \nfraudulent ``providers'' of education and training opportunities. Since \n1989, funding for SAAs has been nearly flat, but SAA responsibilities \nhave grown. Most recently, Public Law 107-103 tasked the SAAs with \nveteran and servicemember outreach in each state, and expanded the \nscope of education programs which SAAs must review and approve. My \nlegislation would provide an increase, from $14 million to $18 million \nin fiscal year 2003, to address the loss of purchasing power absorbed \nby SAAs over the last decade, and to adequately fund the additional \nresponsibilities SAAs have been given.\n  I hope there will be unanimous support for this legislation. Our \ntroops in Afghanistan and elsewhere need to know that if they die or \nare seriously injured on the battlefield, their loved ones will be \ncared for. This legislation will assure that survivors' needs in the \ncritical area of education will be met.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2231\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish a medicare subvention demonstration project for veterans; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe Medicare Equity for Veterans Act of 2002 with Senators Rockefeller, \nJeffords, Specter, Carnahan, Snowe, and Cleland. This legislation, \nknown as Medicare Subvention, will require the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, (CMS), to reimburse VA facilities for services \nprovided to certain Medicare-eligible veterans. These servicemen and \nwomen have paid into the Medicare system over the course of their \ncareers, just as every other American has done, but are prohibited from \nutilizing the program when treated at a VA facility. It is only fair \nthat they be allowed to use their Medicare coverage in the private \nsector or at a VA facility.\n  The number of veterans enrolled in the VA health system has more than \ndoubled since 1996. In many VA facilities, Medicare-eligible veterans, \ncalled Priority 7 or Category C veterans, compose the largest increase \nin patient caseloads. At the VA facility in Cheyenne, WY, only 131 \nPriority 7 veterans were treated in fiscal year 1997. However, in \nfiscal year 2001 the same facility treated over 2,200 Priority 7 \nveterans. Clearly, the VA is experiencing substantial growth and even \nmore obvious is the fact that veterans want to receive their health \ncare services at a VA facility. Unfortunately, funding for the VA \nhealth care system has not kept pace. In my state, Medicare Subvention \nwould expand access to services as most communities are designated \nprimary care health professional shortage areas. Private sector \nphysicians and other primary care providers are not as readily \navailable as they are in other part of the country, which means that \nthe VA is sometimes the only option.\n  Specifically, the Medicare Equity for Veterans Act of 2002 \nestablishes a three-year demonstration program at ten VA sites, three \nof which must be in rural areas. The Secretaries of VA and HHS may \neither choose Medicare+Choice or Preferred Provider Option model for \nthe sites. These options give the Secretaries flexibility to determine \nwhich model works best for each particular site--ensuring veterans \nreceive quality and timely care.\n  The VA can provide Medicare covered services more efficiently and \ncost effectively than the private sector, which could potentially save \nthe Medicare program money. Under the Preferred Provider Option, the VA \nwould be reimbursed at 95 percent of the comparable private sector rate \nand 100 percent of the Medicare+Choice applicable rate, after excluding \nsuch targeted private hospital adjustments as Medicare Disproportionate \nShare Hospital payments, Graduate Medical Education, Indirect Medical \nEducation and capital-related costs.\n  The VA will be responsible for continuing to pay for services \nprovided to Medicare-eligible veterans who have been treated prior to \nfiscal year 1998. This ensures a good faith effort on the part of the \nVA, but will also allow the agency to immediately begin billing \nMedicare for services provided to Medicare-eligible veterans after \nfiscal year 1998. Additionally, this bill protects the Medicare Trust \nFund by capping Medicare payments to the VA at $75 million a year for \nthe duration of the three-year demonstration.\n  Prior to the end of the demonstration, the Government Accounting \nOffice, GAO, must conduct a thorough program evaluation. The GAO report \nensures the demonstration met its goal of providing quality and cost \neffective care to our nation's veterans. The GAO is further required to \nprovide specific recommendations to the Secretaries of VA and HHS on \nhow best to expand Medicare Subvention nationwide.\n  Veterans deserve quality, efficient and equitable health care \ntreatment. Enactment of this legislation is the first step toward \nattaining that goal. I urge all my colleagues to consider cosponsoring \nthe Medicare Equity for Veterans Act of 2002.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators \nThomas and Jeffords to introduce the Medicare Equity for Veterans Act \nof 2002. This bill will authorize a demonstration project to allow VA \nto bill Medicare for health care services provided to certain dual \neligible beneficiaries. The legislation, known as VA subvention, is a \nconcept that has been discussed over the years by many of us in \nCongress, by veterans service organizations, and by advisory bodies \nstudying the VA health care system. Although the VA subvention proposal \nis a small effort compared to the other changes that must be made to \nthe Medicare program, it is enormously important to our veterans and \nthe health care system they depend upon.\n  Until recently, when we looked at the VA health care budget, we \nfocused on the declining veteran population and declining demand. We \nare in a totally different predicament today. More and more veterans \nare turning to the VA health care system, and that is a success story. \nMore than 38 percent of all veterans are Medicare eligible; \nunfortunately, many of these veterans are seeking VA care because of \nthe lack of drug benefits in the Medicare program. An uncertain economy \nand the collapse of many HMOs have also contributed to the rising \nnumber of veterans turning to VA. While I will continue to push for \nMedicare prescription drug benefits, something must be done to \nalleviate the pressure on the VA health care system. VA simply does not \nhave unlimited resources to meet this demand.\n\n[[Page S3172]]\n\n  VA now has more than 6 million veterans enrolled in health care \nservices. That's more than double the figure in 1996. Not surprisingly, \naccess to care has been affected by the high demand for services. It is \nnot unusual for some veterans in certain pockets of the country to have \nto wait for more than a year to have their initial appointment with a \nVA primary care physician. Because of concerns about access and quality \nof care, last fall the VA was prepared to cease enrolling new higher \nincome veterans, so called Category C or Priority 7 veterans, into the \nVA health care system. Their decision was based simply upon budgetary \nconstraints, as VA suffered from a $400 million shortfall. Except for a \nlast minute approval of supplemental funding, veterans would have been \nturned away from VA health care services.\n  This legislation would allow VA and HHS to either choose a Medi- \ncare+Choice or Preferred Provider Option at ten VA sites, three of \nthese sites must be in rural areas. Several years ago the Department of \nDefense attempted a Medicare subvention pilot and lost money, primarily \non the restrictive nature of the capitation model they set up. This \nproposal will give VA the opportunity to look at both the preferred \nprovider and Medicare+Choice model, and in the end select the model \nthat works best for them.\n  For veterans, approval of this veterans subvention would mean the \ninfusion of new revenue to their health care system and, thus, greater \naccess to care. For the Department of Health and Human Services, a VA \nsubvention demonstration project will provide the opportunity to assess \nthe effects of coordination on improving efficiency, access, and \nquality of care for dual-eligible beneficiaries. In addition, it would \nalso present an opportunity to reduce Medicare expenditures. Under the \nMedicare+Choice option in our legislation, the reimbursable rate will \nbe 100 percent of the rate normally paid to a Medicare+Choice provider. \nHowever, under the Preferred Provider Option, reimbursement rates would \nbe 95 percent of otherwise applicable rates. For both options the rates \nwould be further discounted by excluding Disproportionate Hospital \nShare adjustments, VA's direct graduate medical education costs, its \nindirect medical education costs, and 67 percent of capital-related \ncosts. As a further way to limit exposure to the Trust Fund during the \nthree year demonstration portion of this bill, this proposal caps all \nMedicare payments to the VA at $75 million per year. Allowing VA to \nbill Medicare is good for the Federal health care system overall. It's \na classic ``win-win'' situation.\n  VA would also be required to maintain its current level of services \nto Medicare-eligible veterans who have been served prior to 1998, and \nwould be effectively limited to reimbursement for care provided to new \npatients since then. In 1998, Congress allowed all veterans to enroll \nfor VA care and receive a standard benefits package, which includes \nprescription drugs.\n  Prior to the end of the three year demonstration, GAO will do a \nthorough evaluation of the program and submit a report to Congress, \ncomplete with details on performance measures and justification for \nplanned expansion. Based upon the GAO recommendations, VA and HHS will \njointly determine the most appropriate health care delivery models for \nthe expansion of the program through the entire VA health care system. \nGAO will continue to evaluate the expansion of the program for an \nadditional six years.\n  During the first session of the 106th Congress, Senator Jeffords and \nI successfully pushed a similar proposal through the Senate Finance \nCommittee. Indeed, over the last couple years, we have tried to enact \nthis proposal several times. Unfortunately, we have continually met \nresistance. Our goal is to overcome this resistance and enact this \nproposal without delay. I believe that without enactment of a Medicare \nsubvention program, VA may well choose to bar middle-income veterans \nwithout a service-connected disability from coming to the VA for care. \nI think we all want to avoid that prospect.\n  There are over 33 thousand Medicare eligible veterans enrolled in the \nVA health benefits program in my State of West Virginia. The VA spent \nalmost $116 million providing health care to them last year. Though \nthis is telling information, I cannot provide my colleagues with the \ntruly crucial piece of the story, that is, the number of these \nMedicare-eligible veterans who aren't coming to VA because of long \nwaiting lines and lack of adequate resources. This demonstration \nproject would encourage these eligible veterans, who have not \npreviously received care from the Huntington, Beckley, Martinsburg, and \nClarksburg VAMCs, to do so.\n  Truly, this VA/Medicare proposal is a way to provide quality health \ncare to veterans who are eligible for both systems of care, while at \nthe same time preserving and protecting the Medicare Trust Fund. Let us \nnot delay any longer.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues of the burden VA now carries in \nproviding health care to Medicare-eligible veterans. Many Senators have \nasked me for a solution to the financial woes of the hospitals in their \nStates. Enacting this proposal is part of the answer.\n  Veterans deserve the opportunity to come to VA facilities for their \ncare and bring their Medicare coverage with them. It makes sense for \nall parties.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, Senator Thomas has introduced a \nbill to establish a medicare subvention demonstration project for \nveterans and I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words \nabout the issue of medicare subvention for Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) health care. I have heard from many Iowa veterans who are \nfrustrated that Medicare does not reimburse for medical care provided \nby the VA. While veterans who have a disability connected to military \nservice have their health care paid for in whole or in part by the VA, \nveterans who do not have a service connected disability are listed as \n``priority 7'' and are required to pay co-payments for the receipt of \nVA health care. Many of these priority 7 veterans are Medicare \neligible, yet they cannot use their Medicare benefits to pay for VA \nhealth care.\n  The number of priority 7 veterans enrolled in VA health care has \nincreased greatly in recent years, especially in my state of Iowa. This \nis only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the number of veterans \neligible to enroll in the VA health system as priority 7. However, the \ncurrent VA funding formula does not allocate resources to pay for the \ncare of priority 7 veterans. These costs are intended to be recouped by \nbilling private insurance or through out-of-pocket co-pays charged to \nthe veteran, which in fact fall far short of covering the additional \ncosts to the VA system of serving priority 7 veterans. Allowing \nMedicare to reimburse for health care provided in VA facilities would \nhelp alleviate this funding short-fall in the VA system while giving \nMedicare eligible veterans greater choice and flexibilty in meeting \ntheir health care needs. Medicare subvention for VA health care would \nbe a win-win situation for veterans, which is why I strongly support \nthe concept of Medicare subvention for VA health care.\n  Questions remain about what effect Medicare subvention for VA health \ncare could have on the Medicare trust fund. It is possible that \nMedicare outlays will increase if Medicare begins to pay for health \ncare at VA facilities for Medicare eligible veterans currently using \nthe VA. However, if veterans who are covered by Medicare begin to use \nthe VA in lieu of private health care and the VA is able to provide \nthose services at a lower cost, Medicare could actually see savings.\n  In the 106th Congress, the Senate Finance Committee reported a bill, \nS. 1928, which included a Medicare subvention demonstration program \nsimilar to the one introduced by Senator Thomas today. The CBO scored \nthe Medicare subvention portion of this bill as costing Medicare $70 \nmillion over five years. This is a matter that should be studied \nfurther and is an issue that would be closely examined in a \ndemonstration program such as the one Senator Thomas has proposed.\n  At the end of the day, Medicare subvention for VA health care is a \ngood idea. I believe that Senator Thomas is on the right track with his \nproposed Medicare subvention demonstration program and I look forward \nto working with him and other members of the Senate Finance Committee \nto move forward on this important issue.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3173-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3173]]\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 248--CONCERNING THE RISE OF ANTI-SEMITISM IN EUROPE\n\n  Mr. CORZINE submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 248\n\n       Whereas there has been a significant rise in anti-Semitic \n     attacks on Jewish people and Jewish institutions in Europe \n     during the last 18 months;\n       Whereas the continued violence in the Middle East has \n     fueled anti-Semitic sentiments in Europe;\n       Whereas on March 31, 2002, the Or Aviv synagogue in \n     Marseille, France, was burned to the ground by anti-Semitic \n     arsonists;\n       Whereas on March 30, 2002, Shneur Zalman Teldon and Zev \n     Goldberg, Yeshiva students from New Jersey, were brutally \n     beaten on the streets of Berlin, Germany, in an anti-Semitic \n     attack;\n       Whereas in April 2002, supporters of Swiss Ambassador to \n     Germany, Thomas Borer, alleged that he was removed from his \n     post as a result of a ``Jewish plot'' against him;\n       Whereas in Belgium, many anti-Semitic attacks have been \n     reported against Jewish institutions, including a gasoline \n     bomb attack on a Brussels synagogue;\n       Whereas on April 11, 2002, in Bondy, France, 15 hooded \n     attackers wielding sticks and metal bars assaulted a teen-age \n     soccer team from the Maccabi Bondy association after making \n     anti-Semitic remarks; and\n       Whereas anti-Semitic attacks have impacted every nation in \n     Europe: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     governments of Europe should--\n       (1) take all necessary steps to protect the safety and \n     well-being of their respective Jewish communities; and\n       (2) make a concerted effort to cultivate an atmosphere of \n     cooperation and reconciliation among the Jewish and non-\n     Jewish residents of Europe.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ncalling upon the governments of Europe to take all necessary steps to \nprotect the safety and well being of the European Jewish Community and \nto make an effort to foster cooperation and reconciliation between \nJewish and non-Jewish residents.\n  The recent success in the first round of the French Presidential \nelection of Jean-Marie LePen, a candidate who once dismissed the \nhorrific atrocities committed against the Jews and others by the Nazis \nas ``a detail in history'', stands as the latest and perhaps the most \ntroubling sign of a growing tide of anti-Semitism in France. As the \nsecond-highest vote getter in France's multi-candidate presidential \nelection, Le Pen will face Jacques Chirac in the upcoming runoff. The \nelection of LePen has sent shockwaves throughout the Jewish community, \nwhich has watched as a nascent but virulent strain of anti-Semitism has \ngained momentum in France, a county with nearly 600,000 Jews.\n  But, France is not the only country that has experienced a surge in \nanti-Semitism in the last few months. There has been a horrifying \nincrease in the number of anti-Semitic acts throughout Europe, with \nmajor incidents in Belgium, Switzerland, and Germany, as well as \nFrance, Synagogues in Brussels and Marseille have been burned. Jews \nhave been physically assaulted in Berlin and in Bondy, an eastern \nsuburb of Paris. Community Centers, school buses, and Jewish sites have \nbeen vandalized throughout the region. And the Jewish community has \nfaced a persistent barrage of anti-Semitic propaganda and libel.\n  This is not a trifling matter. In France alone, police estimate that \nthere are 10 to 12 anti-Semitic incidents each day. Germany, which has \nmade historic strides since the Second World War to reduce anti-\nSemitism, has experienced a troubling surge in hate crimes against the \nJewish Community. Anti-Semites in Germany, for example, have spray-\npainted swastikas on a monument memorializing Jews murdered during the \nHolocaust, and have attacked Jewish youths returning home from a \nPassover seder. The unrelenting wave of anti-Semitic activities has \nterrorized the European Jewish community and dredged up memories of \nEurope's anti-Semitic past.\n  The international community must not allow this situation to \nintensify before significant action is taken. It was only a short time \nago that the bigotry of a few evil people snowballed into an \ninternational phenomenon of tragic proportions. There are disturbing \nsimilarities between the recent proliferation of anti-Semitism and the \nincrease in anti-Semitism in interwar Europe. The Holocaust also began \nwith small, seemingly isolated events, but developed into a methodical \ncampaign to exterminate an entire people. It is imperative that \nsomething be done immediately to quell the pernicious tide of anti-\nSemitism throughout the continent.\n  Anti-Semitism is an abomination against civilized society and must be \ncondemned in the strongest possible terms. The international community \nmust not stand idly by as this problem worsens. Europe has a \nfundamental responsibility to encourage toleration and understanding \nbetween all of its citizens, Jew and non-Jew alike.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution as an \nimportant message to Europe's Jews that we stand with them and to \nEurope's leaders that more needs to be done to guarantee peaceful \ncoexistence for all of its citizens. I hope it can be adopted without \ndelay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3173-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3173-S3174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 249--DESIGNATING APRIL 30, 2002, AS ``DIA DE LOS \n      NINOS: CELEBRATING YOUNG AMERICANS'', AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. HATCH submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress hereby finds that:\n       (1) Many corporate tax shelter transactions are complicated \n     ways of accomplishing nothing aside from claimed tax \n     benefits, and the legal opinions justifying those \n     transactions take an inappropriately narrow and restrictive \n     view of well-developed court doctrines under which--\n       (A) the taxation of a transaction is determined in \n     accordance with its substance and not merely its form,\n       (B) transactions which have no significant effect on the \n     taxpayer's economic or beneficial interests except for tax \n     benefits are treated as sham transactions and disregarded,\n       (C) transactions involving multiple steps are collapsed \n     when those steps have no substantial economic meaning and are \n     merely designed to create tax benefits,\n       (D) transactions with no business purpose are not given \n     effect, and\n       (E) in the absence of a specific congressional \n     authorization, it is presumed that Congress did not intend a \n     transaction to result in a negative tax where the taxpayer's \n     economic position or rate of return is better after tax than \n     before tax.\n       (2) Permitting aggressive and abusive tax shelters not only \n     results in large revenue losses but also undermines voluntary \n     compliance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to eliminate \n     abusive tax shelters by denying tax attributes claimed to \n     arise from transactions that do not meet a heightened \n     economic substance requirement and by repealing the provision \n     that permits legal opinions to be used to avoid penalties on \n     tax underpayments resulting from transactions without \n     significant economic substance or business purpose.\n\n          PART I--CLARIFICATION OF ECONOMIC SUBSTANCE DOCTRINE\n\n     SEC. ____11.

Mr. President, it is my understanding H.R. 4167, received \nfrom the House, is at the desk. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4167) to extend for 8 additional months the \n     period for which chapter 12 title 11 of the United States \n     Code is reenacted.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will pass H.R. \n4167, to retroactively renew family farmer bankruptcy protection until \nJune 1, 2002. After months of inaction, the House of Representatives \nfinally passed this legislation two days ago to reinstate Chapter 12 of \nthe Bankruptcy Code. It is past time for Congress to act to restore \nthis basic safety net for America's family farmers.\n  Unfortunately, too many family farmers have been left in legal limbo \nin bankruptcy courts across the country since Chapter 12 of the \nBankruptcy Code expired on October 1, 2001. Since last November, \nSenator Carnahan and I have tried to pass S. 1630, a Carnahan-Grassley \nbipartisan bill to retroactively restore chapter 12. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee unanimously reported the bill to the Senate on \nNovember 8, 2001, but it has been subject to a secret hold by the \nminority for the last six months.\n  This is the third time in the last year that this Congress must act \nto retroactively restore basic bankruptcy safeguards for family farmers \nbecause Chapter 12 is still a temporary provision despite its first \npassage into law in 1986. Our family farmers do not deserve these \nlapses in bankruptcy law that could mean the difference between \nforeclosure and farming.\n  In 2000 and into last year, for example, the Senate, then controlled \nby the other party, failed to take up a House-passed bill to \nretroactively renew chapter 12 and, as a result, family farmers lost \nchapter 12 bankruptcy protection for 8 months. The current lapse of \nchapter 12 has lasted more than 6 months. Enough is enough.\n  Our family farmers do not deserve these lapses in bankruptcy law that \ncould mean the difference between foreclosure and farming. It is time \nfor Congress to make chapter 12 a permanent part of the Bankruptcy Code \nto provide a stable safety net for our nation's family farmers.\n  I strongly support Senator Carnahan's bipartisan amendment to make \nchapter 12 a permanent part of the Bankruptcy Code that is part of the \nSenate-passed farm bill. The Senate unanimously approved the Carnahan \namendment by a 93-0 vote. Unfortunately, the House majority is \nobjecting to including the Carnahan amendment in the farm bill \nconference report.\n  In the current bankruptcy reform conference, I am hopeful Congress \nwill update and expand the coverage of chapter 12. In the meantime, the \nfarm bill conference should make permanent basic bankruptcy protection \nfor our family farmers across the country by adopting the Carnahan \namendment.\n  I commend Senator Carnahan for her continued leadership in protecting \nfamily farms across the country.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements related thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4167) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/23/senate-section/article/S3225-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EXTENDING SYMPATHY AND CONDOLENCES TO FAMILIES OF CANADIAN SOLDIERS \n                   KILLED AND WOUNDED IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 250 submitted earlier today by \nSenator Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a rather \nunpleasant subject.\n  I wish to offer a resolution offering the condolences of the United \nStates Senate to the families and loved ones of those Canadian \nservicemen who were killed and wounded in Afghanistan last week.\n  The Canadian and American armies have fought side-by-side since the \nfirst world war and that tradition has continued during our current war \non terrorism. The servicemen and women of Canada have always proven to \nbe brave and courageous fighters and they are certainly keeping up that \nreputation in engagements such as Operation Anaconda. Without the \nassistance of our Canadian allies, the burden of this present war would \nbe much heavier on our own Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines.\n  It is with heavy heart that I offer this measure. Not since the \nKorean War has a Canadian soldier died in a combat zone. It is my hope \nthat Canadian servicemen and women will not be again called upon to \nmake the ultimate sacrifice for a long time.\n  I would like to honor today the Canadian soldiers of the 3rd \nBattalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry Battle Group, \nwho have been in Afghanistan since late January as part of Operation \nApollo and have distinguished themselves for their heroism and \nprofessionalism. No doubt today is a sad day amongst that unit as they \nmourn the loss of their comrades. Despite this horrible setback, the \nCanadian Army is focusing on the task at hand and is still fully \nengaged in its mission.\n  For these reasons and for the countless acts of friendship between \nour two nations, I offer this resolution to extend the sympathy of this \nSenate to the people and fighting forces of Canada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and preamble be \nagreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nany statements related to the resolution be printed in the Record, \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 250) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Federal agencies cannot be run effectively if those \n     agencies practice or tolerate discrimination;\n       (2) Congress has heard testimony from individuals, \n     including representatives of the National Association for the \n     Advancement of Colored People and the American Federation of \n     Government Employees, that point to chronic problems of \n     discrimination and retaliation against Federal employees;\n       (3) in August 2000, a jury found that the Environmental \n     Protection Agency had discriminated against a senior social \n     scientist, and awarded that scientist $600,000;\n       (4) in October 2000, an Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration investigation found that the Environmental \n     Protection Agency had retaliated against a senior scientist \n     for disagreeing with that agency on a matter of science and \n     for helping Congress to carry out its oversight \n     responsibilities;\n       (5) there have been several recent class action suits based \n     on discrimination brought against Federal agencies, including \n     the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, \n     Tobacco, and Firearms, the Drug Enforcement Administration, \n     the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United States \n     Marshals Service, the Department of Agriculture, the United \n     States Information Agency, and the Social Security \n     Administration;\n       (6) notifying Federal employees of their rights under \n     discrimination and whistleblower laws should increase Federal \n     agency compliance with the law;\n       (7) requiring annual reports to Congress on the number and \n     severity of discrimination and whistleblower cases brought \n     against each Federal agency should enable Congress to improve \n     its oversight over compliance by agencies with the law; \n     and\n       (8) requiring Federal agencies to pay for any \n     discrimination or whistleblower judgment, award, or \n     settlement should improve agency accountability with respect \n     to discrimination and whistleblower laws.\n\n     SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Federal agencies should not retaliate for court \n     judgments or settlements relating to discrimination and \n     whistleblower laws by targeting the claimant or other \n     employees with reductions in compensation, benefits, or \n     workforce to pay for such judgments or settlements;\n       (2) the mission of the Federal agency and the employment \n     security of employees who are blameless in a whistleblower \n     incident should not be compromised;\n       (3) Federal agencies should not use a reduction in force or \n     furloughs as means of funding a reimbursement under this Act;\n       (4)(A) accountability in the enforcement of employee rights \n     is not furthered by terminating--\n       (i) the employment of other employees; or\n       (ii) the benefits to which those employees are entitled \n     through statute or contract; and\n       (B) this Act is not intended to authorize those actions;\n       (5)(A) nor is accountability furthered if Federal agencies \n     react to the increased accountability under this Act by \n     taking unfounded disciplinary actions against managers or by \n     violating the procedural rights of managers who have been \n     accused of discrimination; and\n       (B) Federal agencies should ensure that managers have \n     adequate training in the management of a diverse workforce \n     and in dispute resolution and other essential communication \n     skills; and\n       (6)(A) Federal agencies are expected to reimburse the \n     General Fund of the Treasury within a reasonable time under \n     this Act; and\n       (B) a Federal agency, particularly if the amount of \n     reimbursement under this Act is large relative to annual \n     appropriations for that agency, may need to extend \n     reimbursement over several years in order to avoid--\n       (i) reductions in force;\n       (ii) furloughs;\n\n[[Page S3227]]\n\n       (iii) other reductions in compensation or benefits for the \n     workforce of the agency; or\n       (iv) an adverse effect on the mission of the agency.\n\n     SEC.

The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3327 and 3328) were agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I support H.R. 169, the Notification and \nFederal Employee Anti-Discrimination Act. This historic bill--the first \ncivil rights bill of the new century--strengthens existing laws \nprotecting Federal employees from discrimination and harassment in the \nworkplace.\n  H.R. 169 will create a more productive work environment by ensuring \nthat agencies enforce the laws intended to protect Federal employees \nfrom harassment, discrimination and retaliation for whistleblowing.\n  I thank the chairman of the Government Affairs Committee, Senator \nLieberman, as well as Ranking Member Thompson and Senator Akaka for \ntheir leadership on this issue in committee. Their dedication to the \npassage of this ground-breaking initiative has proven to be of \nmonumental importance.\n  I applaud the leadership of Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner for \nintroducing this important legislation. Working with Congressman \nSensenbrenner, I introduced a similar bill in the Senate S. 201, the \nFederal Employee Protection Act. After the House passed H.R. 169 by a \nvote of 420 to 0, I urged the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs \nto act on H.R. 169 rather than my bill in the interest of moving the \nprocess forward.\n  Finally, I recognize the work of the No Fear Coalition led by Marsha-\nColeman Adebayo on this bill. Their efforts have been incredible.\n  The Notification and Federal Employee Anti-discrimination Act \ncontains three main provisions: one, when agencies lose judgments or \nmake settlements in harassment, discrimination and whistleblower cases, \nthe responsible Federal agency would pay any financial penalty out of \nits own budget, rather than out of a general Federal judgment fund; \ntwo, Federal agencies are required to notify their employees about any \napplicable discrimination, harassment and whistleblower protection \nlaws; and three, each Federal agency is required to send an annual \nreport to Congress and the Attorney General.\n  Under current law, agencies are not accountable financially when they \nlose harassment, discrimination and retaliation cases because any \nfinancial penalties are paid out of a Government-wide fund and not the \nagency's budget. I firmly believe that because there is no financial \nconsequence to their actions, Federal agencies are essentially able to \nescape responsibility when they fail to comply with the law and are \nunresponsive to their employees' concerns.\n  Reports that Federal agencies are indifferent or hostile to \ncomplaints of sexual harassment and racial discrimination undermine the \nability of the Federal Government to enforce civil rights laws, and \nhamper efforts to recruit talented individuals for Federal employment. \nRetaliation against whistleblowers creates a climate in which those \npeople best able to provide accountability to the Government--and to \nthe taxpayer--are unwilling to speak out.\n  The Federal Government must set an example for the private sector by \npromoting a workplace that does not tolerate harassment or \ndiscrimination of any kind but encourages employees to report illegal \nactivity and mismanagement without fear of reprisal. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this meaningful legislation.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the bill, as amended, be read the \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate, and any statements relating \nthereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 169), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n         Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 169) entitled ``An Act to require that Federal agencies \n     be accountable for violations of antidiscrimination and \n     whistleblower protection laws; to require that each Federal \n     agency post quarterly on its public Web site, certain \n     statistical data relating to Federal sector equal employment \n     opportunity complaints filed with such agency; and for other \n     purposes.'', do pass with the following amendments:\n     (1)Page 2, line 6, strike out [2001] and insert: 2002\n\n     (2)Page 2, in the table of contents, strike out\n\n                     [TITLE I--GENERAL PROVISIONS]\n\n[Sec. 101.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Federal agencies cannot be run effectively if those \n     agencies practice or tolerate discrimination;\n       (2) Congress has heard testimony from individuals, \n     including representatives of the National Association for the \n     Advancement of Colored People and the American Federation of \n     Government Employees, that point to chronic problems of \n     discrimination and retaliation against Federal employees;\n       (3) in August 2000, a jury found that the Environmental \n     Protection Agency had discriminated against a senior social \n     scientist, and awarded that scientist $600,000;\n       (4) in October 2000, an Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration investigation found that the Environmental \n     Protection Agency had retaliated against a senior scientist \n     for disagreeing with that agency on a matter of science and \n     for helping Congress to carry out its oversight \n     responsibilities;\n       (5) there have been several recent class action suits based \n     on discrimination brought against Federal agencies, including \n     the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, \n     Tobacco, and Firearms, the Drug Enforcement Administration, \n     the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United States \n     Marshals Service, the Department of Agriculture, the United \n     States Information Agency, and the Social Security \n     Administration;\n       (6) notifying Federal employees of their rights under \n     discrimination and whistleblower laws should increase Federal \n     agency compliance with the law;\n       (7) requiring annual reports to Congress on the number and \n     severity of discrimination and whistleblower cases brought \n     against each Federal agency should enable Congress to improve \n     its oversight over compliance by agencies with the law; and\n       (8) requiring Federal agencies to pay for any \n     discrimination or whistleblower judgment, award, or \n     settlement should improve agency accountability with respect \n     to discrimination and whistleblower laws.\n\n     SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Federal agencies should not retaliate for court \n     judgments or settlements relating to discrimination and \n     whistleblower laws by targeting the claimant or other \n     employees with reductions in compensation, benefits, or \n     workforce to pay for such judgments or settlements;\n       (2) the mission of the Federal agency and the employment \n     security of employees who are blameless in a whistleblower \n     incident should not be compromised;\n       (3) Federal agencies should not use a reduction in force or \n     furloughs as means of funding a reimbursement under this Act;\n       (4)(A) accountability in the enforcement of employee rights \n     is not furthered by terminating--\n       (i) the employment of other employees; or\n       (ii) the benefits to which those employees are entitled \n     through statute or contract; and\n       (B) this Act is not intended to authorize those actions;\n       (5)(A) nor is accountability furthered if Federal agencies \n     react to the increased accountability under this Act by \n     taking unfounded disciplinary actions against managers or by \n     violating the procedural rights of managers who have been \n     accused of discrimination;
