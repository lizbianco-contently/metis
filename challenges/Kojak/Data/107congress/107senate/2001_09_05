Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 149, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 149) to provide authority to control exports, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate is going to be working today on \nthe export administration bill. Senator Daschle called a joint \nleadership meeting today, and he and Senator Lott, among others, \nindicated a real desire to move on to the many things we have to do in \nthis month, especially appropriations bills.\n  Senator Sarbanes is certainly one of the most skilled legislators, \nand I know he is doing everything in his power, as is Senator Gramm, to \nmove this export administration bill as quickly as possible. We had an \noverwhelming vote yesterday on an amendment. The opposition to moving \nthis bill forward I think got 18 votes. From my personal perspective, \nthat is a high water mark. I certainly hope the few Senators who oppose \nthis legislation will recognize the need to move forward with the \nlegislation not only for the Senate but, more importantly, for this \ncountry.\n  We have eight appropriations bills we need to complete by the end of \nthe month. Using the numbers we have, we probably only have about 12 \nlegislative days this month, with the Jewish holidays and the big \nconference being held late in the month that will take a day away from \nus. We just need to move expeditiously.\n  I repeat, I hope those people who oppose this legislation will \nrecognize that we are going to pass this bill. It is just a question of \nwhen. Their holding this up isn't to the good of this country. I know \nthat the people who oppose this legislation believe they are doing the \nright thing. I hope they will recognize that just a few Senators are \nopposing this bill. We need to move forward. We have a fiscal year that \nis coming to an end in just a few weeks. We have not completed a single \nconference on the five appropriations bills that have passed.\n  The leadership has committed 1 week to Defense authorization, which \ntakes away more time from our appropriating process. Whether people \nlike it or not, the 13 appropriations bills have to be passed or we are \ngoing to wind up with a big fat omnibus bill called a continuing \nresolution that doesn't help anybody, especially the country.\n  So I am confident there will be rollcall votes on amendments \nthroughout the day. The Senate is going to recess from 12:30 to 2:15 \nfor the weekly party conferences today. Again--and I think I speak for \nthe joint leadership--we need to move past this bill and get on to the \nappropriations bills. On appropriations bills, we have to have a way of \nmoving them more quickly. I think that is the belief the leadership has \nin trying to move to the Commerce-State-Justice bill just as quickly as \npossible.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Maryland, Mr. \nSarbanes, is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I echo what my colleague, Senator Reid, \njust had to say. We are back on the bill. We did a number of opening \nstatements yesterday. I know there were a couple Members who indicated \nthat they want to be able to just speak on the bill briefly. I invite \nthem to come over. Anyone who has amendments, we are open to consider \nthem. I hope we can possibly finish this bill today and thereby enable \nthe Senate to move on to other business for the remainder of\n\n[[Page S9092]]\n\nthe week. I frankly say that ought to be our objective. Hopefully, we \ncan reach it. I do know there is a state dinner this evening that may \nimpact on the Senate's schedule.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, all of us haven't been invited \nto the state dinner, so some of us can still work.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I implore my colleagues who are within earshot, if they \nwish to make a statement on this bill, to come to the floor and get \nthat done this morning before we go to the two weekly conferences. I \nalso hope that at some point shortly we could have an amendment laid \ndown and proceed to move through the amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nThompson, is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to the distinguished majority whip \nthis morning expressing concern that we move on with this bill. I think \nwe can do that. We had a good discussion yesterday. We had a vote on \none amendment that was a pretty definitive vote. We all get to the \npoint where we can count votes around here, and we know which way the \ndie is cast as far as this bill is concerned.\n  The administration supports this bill. Apparently, the administration \nis going to oppose any and all amendments. That is unfortunate. That \nis, frankly, shortsighted, but that is the way it is. I do not think we \nwant to belabor the matter any more than necessary.\n  I must say, we have had some very good discussions this morning on \nboth sides of export administration in this country. We are still \ntalking, and we may be able to come together on some things that will \nhelp the bill and help some of us who have concerns about this bill. I \nknow Senator Kyl from Arizona is on his way to the Chamber and would \nlike to make an opening statement, and then we will move on from there \nand see where we are.\n  Until Senator Kyl gets here, I will reiterate some of the bases for \nour concern. We make no apologies for bringing these amendments up \nregardless of the fact we have an appropriations bill pending. As \nimportant as these appropriations bills are, the national security of \nthis country is even more important. That is what we are dealing with \nhere, the issue of national security. We all have the same thing as our \nultimate goal for the protection of this country, but we have some \nquite distinct and different ideas about how to get there.\n  Export administration legislation in this country traditionally has \nbeen designed not to facilitate business but to help protect the \nnational security interests of this country. If one looks at the \npurpose that is set out in this legislation, it does not say anything \nabout expediting business.\n  No one wants to bog these exports down, but the fact of the matter \nis, they are not being bogged down. It was said yesterday for a broad \ncategory of items, the average processing time is 13 days, I believe--\n13 days. What it does set out and the purpose for this legislation, as \nsimilar legislation in the past has set out, is that we want to make \nsure we are not assisting the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. We want to make sure that in our haste to do business--\nthere is no greater freetrader in this body than I am--and to export \nthat we do not make mistakes. That is what the export administration \nlegislation is all about.\n  We are living in a different time than the last time we addressed \nthis issue. We are living in a world where we do not have the old \nSoviet Union and the massive European assault that we all feared \nlooming over our heads. But what we do have is many different threats, \nmore insidious threats in many respects and more dangerous in many \nrespects because those threats are in the hands of totally \nirresponsible individuals in other parts of the world.\n  We get these reports from Presidential commissions. We get these \nreports from our intelligence community warning us, time and time \nagain, that it is growing, that it is based on technology, that the \nthreats are great--nuclear, biological, chemical threats--and the \nability to deliver those threats to our soil is growing year by year. \nEven a country such as North Korea, which is starving it's people to \ndeath, can pose a mortal threat to major American cities, having \nalready launched a three-stage rocket over Japan just to demonstrate \nwhat they can do, while a million people are starving in North Korea.\n\n  That is the nature of the growing threat based on technology. Our \nintelligence agencies point out to us that a lot of this technology is \nderived from countries such as Russia and China, which our intelligence \nagencies still say are massive proliferators of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Here we are getting ready to pass legislation to make exports of \ndual-use items, which can possibly be used for military purposes, to \ncountries such as Russia and China easier.\n  When Mr. Cox and others on the commission tell us that the Chinese, \nfor example, are diverting products imported for civilian reasons to \nmilitary purposes, and they also tell us that part of the problem has \nbeen created by our own laxity in our export laws, I do not know how \nmuch more definitive the record needs to be for us to be concerned, \nwhen we sit down to write an export administration bill, that we not \nmake any significant mistakes in the bill with regard to contributing \nto the growing threat to the national security of this country.\n  There are great commercial interests involved. There is substantial \ncommercial interest. They are substantially involved in the political \nprocess, but in terms of the trade welfare to this country, they \nconstitute about 3 percent of our total exports. The exports to these \ncontrolled countries constitute about 3 percent of our total exports; \n90-some-odd percent of those export applications to those countries are \napproved, so we are talking about a small fraction of 3 percent of our \nexports that we are dealing with.\n  Some make it sound as if we are trying to shut down exports or we are \ntrying to close the borders. We are not. It is important, and it is \ngrowing. The interest here is not what can happen today. The interest \nis the potential, and the potential is great, but therein lies the \npotential problem.\n  Even though the technological genie is somewhat out of the bottle, to \nbe sure, but not totally out of the bottle or we still would not be \ntrying to keep things out of the hands of Saddam Hussein, Iran, and \nNorth Korea, we implicitly acknowledge some control is doable. But \nlet's just say for the sake of argument the genie is out of the bottle \nand eventually everybody is going to get everything.\n  Does it not benefit our country somewhat to say with regard to these \nmost sensitive items we need to slow certain countries down while we \nare trying to come together on a consensus on things such as national \nmissile defense? We are expending great political capital in this \ncountry and will be spending, I think, great monetary capital, as it \nwere, on a missile defense system. I think that is an appropriate thing \nto do.\n  We are willing to go to our European friends, Russia, China, and have \na debate here based upon this threat about which I am talking. Does it \nmake sense when we are so concerned about this threat, and we do not \nhave a missile defense system off the drawing board yet, for us to be \nhustling to make sure that potential adversaries a few years down the \nroad are caught up to date, technologically, to be even with us or to \nimprove themselves to a point where they can be competitive with us?\n  Does it make sense for us to be helter-skelter assisting as much as \nwe can while we are in this stage over here and trying to defend \nourselves against these same technological challenges? That is what \nthis is all about.\n  We may have appropriations bills we want to get passed and we may \nsay: We had a big vote yesterday and the die is cast; get away, son, \nyou bother me.\n  It is not going to be quite that easy. This issue is not going to go \naway. I understand those of us who comprise the committees that have to \ndo with intelligence and national defense matters form a distinct \nminority. When we first started debating this issue, I was chairman of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee that has jurisdiction over matters \nof proliferation, as well as other things.\n  The chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, and the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee,\n\n[[Page S9093]]\n\nall of us were as one in expressing the concerns I have laid out today. \nWe still have those concerns, although we are ranking members now \ninstead of chairmen of the various committees, but we also recognize we \nare in a distinct minority. We have been unsuccessful in persuading \nenough of our colleagues these concerns are so great we ought to at \nleast have some amendments to address some of these concerns.\n  I am still hopeful. We have had some good discussions recently, as \ndiscussions tend to come about once we are considering an issue. With \nregard to things like a Presidential commission, for example, that is \nan idea that Senator Shelby, who was chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, now ranking member, has espoused for a long time and one \nthat we have all supported at one time or another. The idea is we have \na blue ribbon commission established. We know some of these commissions \ndo a good job and some do not, but we had such a good experience with \nthe Rumsfeld commission, a bipartisan commission made up of experts, \nsome from a more liberal persuasion, some more conservative, but people \nof unimpeachable expertise who were appointed and took a look at the \nkinds of issues I have been talking about this morning, why can't we do \nsomething along those lines to answer some of these questions we have \nposed, such as what effect are our export policies having on national \nsecurity?\n  As I talk about it, I am very well aware the distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia, who now presides, has been a leader on this \nvery issue and he is responsible for a commission that is doing some \ngood things in this same area but perhaps targeted a little bit more on \nanswering some of these questions. The problem, as I see it, is not \nthat I have the answers that we are definitely doing something that is \ngoing to be hurting national security or it is not that my colleagues \non the other side of this issue have the answers that they are \ndefinitely sure we are not doing anything that is going to be harming \nnational security. I am afraid the point is, we do not really know. We \ndo not know the effect of what we are doing. We do not really know, now \nthat we are about to pass this bill, what the effect of this bill is \ngoing to be or what it might look like a year from now.\n  As a part of the Defense appropriations bill in 1998, there was a \nprovision which acknowledged, first of all, that there was a massive \ndecontrolling of our supercomputers going on in the Clinton \nadministration. They changed the MTOPS level rapidly so more and more \nsupercomputers could be exported. There has been a growing concensus \nalmost, I would say, among a lot of the people who follow these matters \nin the country that perhaps MTOPS is not the best way to decide what \nshould be controlled in terms of these supercomputers. Maybe we need to \nlook at something else. We did not really look at something else. We \ndecontrolled, and now what we are doing in this legislation, in terms \nof MTOPS, is totally decontrolling and doing away with it. So it is an \nextension of the Clinton policy.\n  Also in that 1998 legislation, there is a provision that says, as we \ndo that we must do a national security assessment of the effect of \ndoing this. That was never done. It has never been done.\n  It is bad enough we are not following our own laws, but it is doubly \nbad we do not know the answer. So we are having some discussions now \nabout can we not get together and come up with an independent \nassessment, over a period of time, as to what the effect of this might \nbe?\n  Another issue we are discussing is the so-called deemed export rules. \nAs I am sure the Presiding Officer knows, we have a system in this \ncountry that basically says if you export a certain item or information \nto another country, you need a license for certain kinds of things. \nAlso, if you give that same information to a foreign student, a foreign \nnational, who is over here working in, say, one of our laboratories, or \none of our businesses, if you give him that same information, that is \nthe equivalent, potentially, of exporting the matter. It is called a \ndeemed export, and we need to look at that carefully also.\n  We had hearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee a year or so \nago, and we found out that the law is being universally ignored by our \nlaboratories. Private business is doing a much better job of complying \nwith the deemed export rules and seeking licenses for these transfers \nof information than is the Government. Of course, they have a \nproprietary interest in doing so, but for whatever reason they are \ndoing a much better job. Our laboratories have done a very poor job and \nnow, of course, we know that valuable information has been taken, \nillegally and improperly, from our laboratories, which is the \nrepository of some of the most sensitive information, if not the most \nsensitive information, our country possesses. We need to do something \nabout that.\n  This bill does not address that. These are as much exports or \npotential exports as some of the goods flying to another country.\n  My understanding is the administration has expressed some concern \nthat this is a complicated subject which they have not had an \nopportunity to address yet and would prefer to have the opportunity to \naddress, and I understand that. A lot has been laid on their plate in a \nshort period of time. We came to them with this whole export business, \nthis whole overhaul issue, when they were still trying to get draperies \nin their office. Getting any modern President's team together now is a \nlong, drawn out process. Some say it will be 12, 14, or 16 months \nbefore this administration gets its team together. We are laying this \nhighly technical stuff on them at a time when many of the important \ndepartments do not have their team together. I prefer to put this off \nuntil later, until they have had the opportunity to get their team \ntogether, but they have seen fit to agree to have this go forward. It \nmakes a certain amount of sense.\n\n  We do not want to discourage foreign students from coming to the \nUnited States. It is important for many different reasons. We do not \nwant to close our borders. With as many problems as we have had with \nthe People's Republic of China over the last few years, they have \n54,000 students here now. We do not want to reverse that process. Many \nmake valuable contributions to us and what we are doing. Many choose to \nstay here. However, in the process we have to learn to protect \nourselves. Because we have peace and prosperity today does not mean we \nwill have it forever.\n  I just finished reading a book called ``While America Sleeps'' in \nwhich the Kagans were drawing a parallel between the United States \ntoday and England after World War I. This book is based on Winston \nChurchill's ``While England Slept.'' They talk about when a country \nwins a war or skirmish, the tendency is to allow your military to go \ndown, to have a higher threshold for engagement elsewhere. You want a \npeace dividend. You want to come back home and enjoy the peace dividend \nand forget about the unpleasantness. By doing that, you encourage \nproblems here, there, around the world. They are very small at first, \nand they grow into major problems that ultimately a democracy has to \naddress. We do not want to do that. That is what we are trying to \navoid.\n  These are a couple of areas on which I think we might still have come \ntogether, even at this date. I am hopeful of that. Again, I reiterate, \nthis is not foolish business we are engaged in. These are not dilatory \ntactics. These are not things to get on with while we wait to get on \nwith the more important business of spending money. It is not about \nmoney but about the national security of this country. I do not care if \nwe have to have 95-5 votes on some of these issues. Time will tell the \ncorrectness of the various positions. Some Members believe it is very \nimportant to lay them on the table, require deliberate consideration, \nand see whether or not even at this stage of the game we cannot come \ntogether at least on some things that might make this a better bill and \nensure the enhanced security of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I am hopeful we can work out some of \nthese matters which he discussed. I think the idea of a presidentially \nappointed independent advisory committee to review the matter and \nsubmit its findings to the Congress at an\n\n[[Page S9094]]\n\nappropriate time is a good idea. It may well prove of significant \nbenefit.\n  I repeat what I said yesterday. I think all 100 Members of the Senate \nare concerned that our national security is effectively protected. I \nhope what we went over yesterday, provisions of the bill and some of \nthe authority given to the President, provided some reassurance in \nterms of ultimate authority to act on behalf of important national \nsecurity and foreign policy interests. I hope in the course of the day \nwe can work through some of these matters and perhaps move to a \nconclusion.\n  Again, I state my appreciation to the Senator for the questions he \nraised and focusing our attention on them. He has done that \nconsistently as we have moved through the process. I know my very able \ncolleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, has interacted throughout. What \nis before the Senate in this legislation has been shaped in part by \nquestions and concerns the Senator has raised. It is not as though \nthere has not been a response to some of the matters brought forward, \nand that is reflected already in the legislation before the Senate.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If the Senator will yield, I certainly agree with that. \nI should not leave the impression that this has been a totally \nadversarial proceeding. We have had discussions, and this bill does \nincorporate some of the points we have discussed at prior times. I \nappreciate that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, this past weekend the Washington Post ran \narticles on a Bush administration decision to impose sanctions on a \nChinese company that it found to be transferring sensitive missile \ntechnology to Pakistan in violation of last November's agreement to \nterminate such transfers. Two of my colleagues, the chairman of the \nHouse Intelligence Committee and the chairman of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, and I just returned from a visit to Pakistan, \nand we expressed concerns about the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction technology in that area of the world. We are very aware of \nthe situation which could easily evolve in that part of the world \nbecause of tensions between different countries that could \ninadvertently result in the use of nuclear weapons, something no one in \nthe world wants to occur. Part of that is because of the willingness of \ncountries such as China to transfer technology to countries that could \nuse those weapons.\n  Sunday's Washington Post article to which I referred noted that the \ndecision to impose sanctions on the Chinese Metallurgical Corporation \ncame over the objections of Asia experts in our State Department who \n``had warned that this could further fray Sino-American relations.''\n  Of course, anytime one enforces a provision which is designed to \nprotect the U.S. national security on a corporation that is violating \nthe terms of agreements or provisions which could prevent the transfer \nof this technology, it will upset someone. They have been caught \ncheating, and to the extent we are willing to enforce it, they are not \ngoing to like the result. However, that is what is at stake: Our \nwillingness to enforce the regime which we have heretofore imposed that \nhopes to at least reduce the amount of transfer of technology to \ncountries that would use that technology in an irresponsible fashion.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article \n``Chinese Arms Firm Faces U.S. Sanctions.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 1, 2001]\n\n                 Chinese Arms Firm Faces U.S. Sanctions\n\n\n                Technology Allegedly Passed to Pakistan\n\n                           (By Alan Sipress)\n\n       The Bush administration will impose sanctions today on a \n     major Chinese arms manufacturer because it transferred \n     sensitive missile technology to Pakistan despite assurances \n     by Beijing last year that it would refrain from these \n     exports, according to the State Department.\n       A department official said yesterday the United States \n     would place sanctions on the China Metallurgical Equipment \n     Corp., A private company that administration officials say \n     works closely with the Chinese government, and at the same \n     time on the National Development Complex of Pakistan, which \n     received the missile technology.\n       The decision to take these punitive measures comes a week \n     after a U.S. delegation to Beijing headed by Deputy Assistant \n     Secretary of State Vann Van Diepen failed to break a deadlock \n     over U.S. demands that China halt the transfer of technology \n     for missiles that can carry nuclear warheads. Last-ditch \n     negotiations in recent days also proved unsuccessful, \n     officials said.\n       The new American measures could further sour relations \n     between the United States and China, which have begun to \n     rebound after a tough spell in the opening months of the Bush \n     administration. With President Bush scheduled to visit China \n     late next month, the two countries have tried to move beyond \n     their dispute this spring when a U.S. Navy surveillance plane \n     and its crew were detained on Hainan Island after colliding \n     with a Chinese jet.\n       Secretary of State Colin L. Powell raised American concerns \n     about missile proliferation during a visit to Beijing in July \n     and warned that the administration might impose sanctions \n     unless China adhered to an agreement reached last November. \n     Under that accord, the United States agreed to issue licenses \n     for American companies to launch satellites on Chinese \n     rockets.\n       Powell and his Chinese counterparts agreed during his trip \n     to resume talks on weapons proliferation. The two sides had \n     not discussed this matter since last November, when China \n     agreed not to help other countries build missiles capable of \n     delivering nuclear weapons. U.S. diplomats had filed formal \n     protests with China alleging that it had violated the \n     agreement numerous times by providing missiles or missile \n     technology to Pakistan and other countries.\n       Both the Chinese and Pakistani officials have denied \n     allegations of missile technology sales.\n       But a State Department official said yesterday that China's \n     transfer of Category 2 technology had contributed to \n     Pakistan's missile program, flouting the international \n     guidelines established to govern the proliferation of missile \n     parts and technology. Under the Missile Technology Control \n     Regime, Category 1 refers to whole missiles while Category 2 \n     includes constituent parts and technology.\n       As a result, the administration has also been considering \n     whether to suspend the issuance of licenses for U.S. \n     companies to place their satellites on Chinese rockets and \n     make it illegal to transfer American technology to China's \n     satellite industry. The Los Angeles Times reported in today's \n     editions that the United States had decided to take these \n     punitive actions.\n       These steps, which could set back China's efforts to \n     develop its industry, may also prove painful for some \n     American companies that have seen Chinese rockets as a \n     relatively inexpensive way to place their satellites into \n     orbit.\n       The Bush administration has said it is worried about recent \n     reports that China was providing sensitive missile technology \n     to Pakistan. Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), Chairman of \n     the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, pressed Beijing \n     during a recent visit there to end these transfers and called \n     for sanctions to be place on Chinese companies that are shown \n     to be helping Pakistan's missile program.\n       U.S. officials have at the same time expressed concern \n     about what they say are Pakistani attempts to develop a \n     nuclear missile program. The United States imposed sanctions \n     on Pakistan and India after both countries tested nuclear \n     weapons in 1998. India and Pakistan have a long-standing \n     border conflict over Kashmir and their development of nuclear \n     weapons, security analysts say, has made South Asia \n     potentially the most dangerous place in the world.\n       While Sino-American relations have been complex and often \n     difficult for decades, the United States long has close \n     relations with Pakistan, especially when it was a crucial \n     Cold War ally. But those ties have grown estranged in recent \n     years and not only because of Pakistan's nuclear program. \n     U.S. officials have also expressed dissatisfaction with the \n     1999 military coup by Gen. Pervez Musharraf that ousted \n     democratically elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and with \n     Pakistan's ties to the Taliban movement ruling much of \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  Mr. KYL. This mentality that enforcing the law could further fray \nrelations with countries such as China, for example, lies at the core \nof much of what we are debating with respect to the legislation before \nthe Senate. It is the continued relevance of robust export controls on \nthe one hand versus legislation that is explicitly designed to weaken \nthose controls in order to enhance trade on the other.\n  While the case that the Washington Post article discussed involves \nChinese technology transfers to Pakistan, these actions on the part of \nforeign countries with records of proliferating militarily sensitive \ntechnologies are central to the overall debate over U.S. controls on \nexports to countries that in turn transfer knowledge and hardware to \nthird countries to which the United States would not currently export \nsuch items or knowhow. In other words, it is the transfer of this \ntechnology through a middleman, so to speak.\n  In addition to this most recent China-related proliferation \ndevelopment, the U.S. Customs Service last\n\n[[Page S9095]]\n\nweek arrested two United States-based Chinese nationals involved in \nsmuggling, and smuggling extremely sensitive military encryption \ntechnology to China--another violation of the Arms Export Control Act.\n  While the encryption case does involve the Arms Export Control Act \nand not the export administration regulations which are the issue \ntoday, it does nevertheless significantly highlight the scale of the \nproblem that confronts the United States in preventing certain \ncountries from either legally or illegally obtaining militarily \nsensitive technologies that could most assuredly be used against the \nUnited States or our allies in a future conflict.\n  There exists a mistaken notion that the end of the cold war \neliminated the national security justification for controlling exports \nin technologies with both civilian and military applications, but \nnothing could be further from the truth.\n  The President, in April, announced his decision to sell to Taiwan $4 \nbillion worth of weaponry to better defend itself against the growing \nmilitary threat from China. That threat, already considerable, involves \nprimarily conventional arms, including the 300 missiles currently \ntargeted against Taiwan, a number that is projected to grow in the \nfuture.\n  A decision to liberalize controls on dual-use technologies, every one \nof which by definition have military applications, while acknowledging, \nas we all do, the very real threat posed by China to Taiwan and to U.S. \ninterests in the Far East, is therefore inconsistent with and clearly \ncontrary to our national interest.\n  Make no mistake, much of this debate is about China. The so-called \nrogue nations are at issue here only to the degree that other nations \nsuch as China, and at times even the United States, end up selling \nmilitary-sensitive items to those countries, either directly or, as I \nsaid before, through third parties. So this is just one example of the \nfact that the end of the cold war has not ended the necessity of \nkeeping an eye on the kind of dual-use technologies sold abroad because \nin the end those technologies could be used against the United States \nor our allies.\n  Let me just give some examples of things that have happened with \nexports in the not too distant past that illustrate this point.\n  In July of 1998, IBM's east Europe/Asia subsidiary entered a guilty \nplea for the unlawful export of computers to Arzamas-16, a Russian \nnuclear weapons laboratory.\n  Silicon Graphics similarly illegally sold high-performance computers \nto Russia's Chelyabinsk-70 nuclear laboratory.\n  This past July a company in my home State, Arizona, settled charges \nthat it had illegally exported diode lasers to Israel, 16 times between \n1995 and 1997.\n  And, of course, there is the 1994 sale by McDonnell to China National \nAero-Technology Import-Export Corporation of an entire warehouse full \nof machine tools for the production of modern military aircraft and \nmissiles continues to represent not just a highly inappropriate export \nbut the problem of diversion of exported dual-use technologies to the \nnoncommercial side of the equation. Some of the machine tools in \nquestion were diverted to a factory that manufactures Silkworm \nmissiles--the very missiles that now line Iran's coastal waters on the \nPersian Gulf.\n  These are just a few examples of what can happen.\n  When the post-World War II export control regime was established in \n1949, there was an explicit recognition of the difficulties that would \nbe faced in regulating militarily sensitive items that also had benign \ncommercial applications and that should not necessarily be denied to \nall potential customers. It is a problem.\n  The principal country at issue then, of course, was the Soviet Union, \nwith China a secondary concern. The success of United States \nunilateral, as well as COCOM multilateral export controls in keeping \nmany vitally important dual-use technologies out of the hands of the \nSoviet Army was an important component in the national strategy that \nultimately resulted in the Soviet Union's demise.\n  There is no denying the gravity of the problems we faced after the \ncold war when sensitive technologies exported by western countries to \nIraq were suddenly threatening United States and allied troops in the \nPersian Gulf war. The lack of a more far-sighted export control \npolicy--and I would be remiss were I to ignore the geopolitical context \nin which legal if questionable sales to Iraq occurred during the Iran-\nIraq war--was instructive as to the nature of the problem we face \ntoday.\n  It must be assumed that nondemocratic regimes will exploit dual-use \ntechnologies for military purposes. So the end of the cold war has not \nreduced the need for us to continue to be concerned about the export of \nthese dual-use items.\n  I would like to take a couple of minutes to review a classic case of \ndual-use technologies being permitted to be sold a nondemocratic regime \nknown to be interested in developing weapons of mass destruction and \nthe means to deliver them: the case of Gerald Bull's Supergun. The \nBritish author James Adams back in 1992 wrote about Iraq's covert \nefforts at acquiring the components with which Canadian ballistics \nexpert Bull was to assemble a cannon capable of firing large nuclear \npayloads to Israel. We can discuss the military utility of that gun, \nhad it not been destroyed during the Persian Gulf war, all we want. \nWhat we can't ignore is the manner in which it was being built. It is \nalso indicative of the type of problem the Customs Service recently \nuncovered with regard to Chinese efforts at attaining United States \nmilitary encryption technology. This Adams described in his book on the \nlife of Gerald Bull:\n\n       British intelligence knew that . . . the Iraqis had already \n     established a vast international procurement effort . . . \n     [I]n information was discovered in Europe that suggested two \n     British companies, Walter Somers and Sheffield \n     Forgemasters, were also implicated in the scheme [in \n     addition to a Spanish company].\n       At the beginning of April, a few weeks after Jerry Bull had \n     been killed, SIS (British intelligence) was tipped off that a \n     shipment of parts destined for the supergun was about to be \n     sent to Iraq . . . On Tuesday, April 10, 1990, customs \n     officers examined a number of crates stored in the warehouse \n     on Quay Seven of Tees Dock . . . Eight wooden cylinders, each \n     twenty-five feet long by three feet wide, were marked \n     ``Republic of Iraq, Ministry of Industry and Minerals, \n     Petrochemical Project, Baghdad, Iraq.'' The crates were about \n     to be loaded onto the Gur Mariner, a ten-thousand-ton \n     Bermudian-registered cargo ship that was due to sail for the \n     Iraqi port of Umm Qasr. The ship had been chartered by the \n     Iraqi Maritime Organization.\n       Inside each crate was a smoothbore barrel that had been \n     carefully machined so that it fit perfectly into the next \n     barrel, with the tube tapering toward one end.\n\n  Adams goes on to write:\n\n       ``We are considering the possibility that the gun was \n     manufactured in Britain for the Iraqis,'' said a spokesman. \n     ``It is capable of firing a nuclear shell, or anything else \n     you wanted to put on top of a one-meter shell, and could \n     easily hit Iran or any other Middle East spot.'' [Note: The \n     gun was, in fact, immobile and constructed against a mountain \n     pointing directly at Israel]\n\n  To conclude the item from the book:\n\n       After the raid on the company premises of Sheffield \n     Forgemasters, customs officials raided another company, \n     Walter Somers . . . the maker of high-technology heavy \n     forgings. They also claimed they had been supplying forgings \n     to an Iraqi petrochemical project. Both companies claimed \n     that the forgings were steel pipes and had no military \n     application . . . The company that had made the pipes, \n     Sheffield Forgemasters, claimed not only that the pipes were \n     for the oil industry but that the company had received \n     permission to export them from the Department of Trade and \n     Industry.\n\n  Finally, on this case, Adams notes that:\n\n       In fairness the DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) was \n     not familiar with the latest intelligence, and neither the \n     intelligence community nor the MOD (Ministry of Defense) was \n     made aware of the petrochemical contract. In addition, the \n     DTI employs ninety-four staff members to vet seventy thousand \n     export applications a year . . . It was precisely this kind \n     of bureaucratic fumbling that had allowed Iraq to build up \n     such an effective military machine in the face of \n     international arms embargoes.\n\n  Forgive the digression onto an 11-year-old case, but it is highly \nrelevant to our discussions on S. 149, the Gramm-Enzi export \nfacilitation bill. S. 149 places inordinate control over dual-use \nexports in the hands of the Federal agency least capable of making \ninformed decisions on the military applications of dual-use \ntechnologies and most interested in increasing U.S. exports, namely the \nDepartment of Commerce.\n\n[[Page S9096]]\n\n  So the point of discussing the case is to illustrate that if you do \nnot have the involvement of the intelligence community, which knows \nwhat is going on, or of the Department of Defense, that if you only \nhave the Department of Commerce approving the export of these items, \nthey are going to look at the face value of the application and assume \nit is for a benign commercial purpose. Without the knowledge of the \nintelligence community or the defense community, it will not \nnecessarily know that in point of fact there is an ongoing specific \neffort to use that technology for very aggressive military purposes.\n  That is why you need an export regime which enables all of the \ncommunities of interest to be able to be a part of the decisionmaking \nprocess: To put the items on the list that need to be reviewed, to \nreview the items that are subject to review, and to grant whatever \nlicenses are appropriate to grant.\n  It is a big mistake to simply assume the department that is in charge \nof commerce is going to be able to make those decisions using all of \nthe criteria that should inform the decision.\n  I go back, then, to this past weekend's stories on the sanctioning of \nthe Chinese company for transferring missile technology to Pakistan, \nbringing this full circle. That simply illustrates the continued \nrelevance of cases such as the one that I described in the story of \nGerald Bull and the Iraqi supergun.\n  Take a look at the web site of the China Metallurgical Equipment \nCorporation (MECC), the company sanctioned. This was the subject of a \nWashington Post story. On the surface, this is a legitimate company \nwith legitimate customers. As its web site states, ``. . . the core \nenterprise of the China Metallurgical Equipment Group, MECC is involved \nin sectors of metallurgy, nonferrous metals, building materials, \nenvironmental protection and light industry.'' It does business around \nthe world and considers itself a private enterprise.\n  While I support trade with China and certainly encourage \nprivatization of its industries, we cannot let this hope that China \nwill privatize industry and that we can expand trade with China get in \nthe way of our national security interests. China Metallurgical may \nqualify as a private-sector company. It operates, however, under the \nthumb of an autocratic regime that is the single worst proliferator of \ntechnologies associated with nuclear weapons and ballistic and cruise \nmissiles, and which as violated numerous agreements that ban such \nproliferation.\n  There should also be no mistaking the fact that we are not talking \nabout technologies that anyone can purchase today at Radio Shack, which \nis something that sometimes you hear. We are talking about technologies \nwith applications for the design and construction of weapons of mass \ndestruction and their means of delivery. Cavalier assertions about the \navailability of these items in your neighborhood electronics store \ntrivialize the gravity of this issue.\n  The case of the Iraqi supergun involved pipe sections forged with \nhighly advanced machine tools for extreme precision. At the end of the \nday, though, they were still something as otherwise seemingly innocuous \nas pipe sections. If supporters of S. 149 have their way, the kinds of \ntechnologies that will be available for export will be far more \nthreatening than the Iraqi supergun.\n  For example, the Commerce Control List, which is maintained by the \nDepartment of Commerce and which lists dual-use items for which a \nlicense may be needed, has 2,400 items on it. The military applications \nof most of them would, in the wrong hands, directly threaten the \nsecurity of the United States.\n  For example, thiodiglycol, which admittedly now falls under the \nChemical Weapons Convention and its production is being phased out, is \nnevertheless a dual-use item. An industrial solvent, 500 tons were sold \nby the Belgian company Phillips Petroleum to the Iraqi State Enterprise \nfor Pesticide Production. In 1988, the United States company Alcolac \nInternational exported over 300 tons of it to Iraq. It is believed that \nthese shipments were diverted for use in the manufacture of mustard \ngas.\n  Aluminum alloy, which has a number of legitimate commercial \nindustrial applications, is also used in the manufacture of rocket \ncasings. China developed a welded aluminum alloy for use in its Yu-3 \ntorpedo.\n  Ceramic composite materials are used in commercial electronics, but \nare also used in the construction of ballistic missile reentry vehicle \nantenna windows.\n  Side-looking airborne radars are on the CCL, yet have a very obvious \napplication for foreign military aircraft against which we may find \nourselves fighting some day.\n  Something as simple as wind tunnels, used in measuring the \naerodynamic performance of airframe designs, are routinely used in the \ndesign of military fighter jets and missiles.\n  The Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control has noted, with respect \nto arguments that we should ``build higher walls around fewer goods,'' \nthat ``Saddam Hussein's scientists were masters at upgrading medium-\ntech items to `chokepoint' level. The Iraqis imported equipment that \nwas dual-use . . . The Iraqis bought dual-use isostatic presses to \nshape A-bomb parts, dual-use mass spectrometers to sample A-bomb fuel, \nand dual-use electron beam welders to increase the range of Scud \nmissiles. One of those Scuds killed U.S. troops sleeping in Saudi \nArabia.'' That was the largest loss of life in any single attack in the \nPersian Gulf war.\n  There are many more examples.\n  A United States company headquartered in Rockville, Maryland, \nAmerican Type Culture Collection, was the most prominent of a long list \nof United States biological laboratories that exported pathogens to \nIraq during the 1980s.\n  Biological pathogens represent the penultimate ``dual-use'' item. \nEven the Biological Weapons Convention permits the possession of \notherwise banned pathogens for the purpose of developing vaccines.\n  We have just seen on the news this morning the breaking news about \nthe work the United States is doing on certain strains of anthrax for \npurely defensive purposes because we understand those were developed \nfor offensive purposes by countries. Without some kind of antidote to \nthem, their use against other people would, of course, be devastating. \nThat is why we need to develop the technology to find a defense \nagainst--a way of inoculating against--these particular pathogens.\n  But common sense should have indicated that the regime of Saddam \nHussein would use the dozens of shipments he received from American \ncommercial laboratories for the development of biological weapons, \nwhich is precisely what happened. Such biological agents as anthrax and \nbotulinum toxin were sold to Iraq by American firms.\n  Gary Milhollin of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control has \nnoted another example of this kind of dual-use proliferation to Iraq. \nIt involved the component of what we refer to as the lithotriptor, \nwhich is a medical device that is used in destroying kidney stones by \nblasting high-energy beams. There are high-precision electronic \nswitches which are part of the lithotriptor. These kinds of switches \nare also needed to detonate nuclear weapons. They would be decontrolled \nhere because they are part of the lithotriptor, a medical device.\n  It is interesting also because of their foreign availability. You can \nbuy them elsewhere, but they would be decontrolled in effect under this \nlegislation. Iraq purchases these lithotriptors. The amount of \nlithotriptors they purchase is interesting.\n  Milhollin has also noted the suspicious nature of the Iraqi purchases \nof lithotriptors, state-of-the-art machines used in breaking up kidney \nstones. Iraq's purchases of the lithotriptors, and far more spare parts \nthan should ever be required, is suspicious because these devises are \nalso used as triggers for nuclear weapons and the number purchased is \nconsistent with the number of assembled weapons--minus the requisite \nfissile material--Iraq is believed to have by former members of UNSCOM.\n  So the point is that we should be highly suspicious of the import of \nthese dual-use technologies by Iraq when they appear to be directly \nrelated to Iraq's nuclear program. Yet under the legislation before us, \nthis shipment would be liberalized, and there is virtually no way to \nstop that kind of export to Iraq.\n\n[[Page S9097]]\n\n  Another case is glass and carbon fibers used in ballistic and cruise \nmissile construction as well as the enrichment of uranium. This would \nbe decontrolled because of their use in the manufacture of items such \nas skis, tennis rackets, boats, and golf clubs. These fibers would also \nfall under the mass market of foreign availability criteria of S. 149.\n  Maraging steel used in the manufacture of solid rocket motor cases, \npropellant tanks, and interstage for missiles, as well as the \nenrichment of uranium, would also be decontrolled because of their \napplication in the commercial rocketry and their availability in other \ncountries.\n  Another example listed is corrosion-resistant valves used in the \nenrichment of uranium for nuclear weapons, yet also used in commercial \nenergy, paper, and cryogenic industries.\n  The list of deadly serious military applications for items this \nlegislation would decontrol is long and sobering. I will later ask \nunanimous consent to put in the Record a list that further illustrates \nthis point.\n  Let's focus on the case that has been discussed in the past about \nfiberoptic cables. All of us know about the situation in which the \nUnited States actually had to destroy Iraqi air defenses because of the \ndevelopment of these air defenses as a threat to the United States and \nBritish aircraft carrying out their mission in Iraq. The systems were \nbeing upgraded through the installation of fiberoptic cable provided \nand installed by the Chinese.\n  Fiberoptic cable is clearly a dual-use item, but it also clearly has \nsignificant strategic importance. And its export to China again would \nbe permissible under S. 149.\n  Allow me to talk for just a moment about the cost of business of \nthese export controls, because the argument is frequently used that the \nreason we have to do this is because there is such a drag on the United \nStates economy from the existence of export controls today, and that is \nwhy we have to liberalize the export of these dual-use technologies. \nMany major corporations are lobbying hard for this legislation based on \nthis argument.\n  While I support free trade and support these appropriations normally, \nI disagree with them on this description of the sense of urgency. The \nfact is that the effect is only negligible from the export controls \nbecause they represent such a minor part of our overall economy. \nAccording to the Department of Commerce figures, the total value of all \nthe goods exported to the control destinations represents less than 3 \npercent of all U.S. exports. We would be talking here about a very \nsmall percentage--less than 3 percent--of all of our exports.\n  Of just over 1,200 applications filed with the Commerce Department in \n1999, for example, for licenses to export control dual-use items to \nChina, the total value of those applications of sales was less than \n$1.5 billion, which is obviously a minuscule number as a percentage of \nour gross domestic product.\n  In short, I don't think we should judge this legislation on the basis \nthat the U.S. economy is going to suffer if we continue to maintain a \nsensible export control regime worthy of the values we represent and \nthe interests we seek to defend. In fact, there is really a critical \nargument being made by some here.\n  On the one hand, they argue there is such a dramatic negative impact \non the American economy that we have to loosen up these exports. On the \nother hand, they assure us nothing much is going to change, that the \nsame kind of items that have been controlled in the past that we \nbelieve are necessary to control will continue to be controlled, so \ndon't worry about national security implications. One of those two \nassertions cannot be true.\n  Now let me discuss for a moment why I think Senate bill S. 149 \nactually makes the problem worse. There is one advantage to the \nlegislation: It increases some penalties for violation by U.S. \ncompanies. That is an important advantage, but it is about the only \nthing that is better than current law.\n  I have spent a long time discussing some of the complexity of dealing \nwith dual-use technologies because it is a complex subject. But that \nfact should not require us to throw up our hands and say we give up; \nthat because some of these things can be mass marketed in the United \nStates and because they are available abroad, we have to throw our \nhands up in the air and forget controlling these items.\n  The question is whether the United States wants to be part of the \nproliferation of technologies that could come back to haunt us in the \nfuture simply because somebody else in the world might do the same.\n  Let me just illustrate the point. I say this with all due respect to \nthe members of these committees. The issue of export controls falls \nunder the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. This creates a \nsituation analogous to that at the executive branch level. The \nDepartment of Commerce, under the provisions of S. 149, would be given \nmost of the influence in the definition of what is on the control list \nand the subsequent regulation and licensing of those items. That is \nessentially at the expense of the involvement of the Department of \nState and the Department of Defense, who heretofore have been much more \ndirectly involved in the decisions made with respect to the export of \nthese items.\n  Remember the case I cited, on which I took some pains to get into \ndetail, of the gun sold to Iraq that could deliver a nuclear weapon. \nThe point was that the Commerce Department of Great Britain did not \nknow what the intelligence community and the defense community knew \nabout the potential use of the item that was being exported, which \ncalls into question a regime which only involves the agency of our \nGovernment which is most interested in seeing that exports are \nincreased.\n  So it should come as no surprise that the Banking Committee, which \nhas this jurisdiction, has produced this bill which gives the Commerce \nDepartment most of the jurisdiction and gives, frankly, what I consider \nshort shrift to the agencies of the Department of Defense, the State \nDepartment, and our intelligence agencies that should have more of a \nrole to play.\n  The House version of this bill, on the other hand, interestingly, \noriginates with the International Relations Committee and will next go \nbefore the Armed Services Committee, and it, of course, is much more \nheavily tilted toward the involvement of the State Department and the \nDefense Department, I would suggest, as a result.\n  So it seems to me we have to be a little more careful in the Senate \nto recognize that there are other committees, that there are other \ndepartments, and that we need to reconcile these differences between \nthe House version and the Senate version of this legislation in the \ninterest of national security.\n\n  Of course, it is true that the White House has endorsed S. 149. But I \nthink it is also recognized that there is the potential for some \nimprovements. They have indicated that in the administration of this \nlegislation, with an Executive order that will implement it, some of \nthe issues we have raised with them will be addressed. I very much \nappreciate their willingness to address these concerns.\n  I must say, I have the highest confidence in the current \nadministration and in the officials who would have the obligation to \nadminister this legislation. So hopefully there will be some \nimprovements made at that time in the execution of the law.\n  It is also my hope--and I will echo what Senator Thompson said a \nmoment ago--that before we conclude the discussion on this legislation, \nit will be possible for us to agree on at least some provisions that \nwould improve the bill from our standpoint.\n  So I will be participating in those negotiations. I hope we can come \nto some conclusions on this matter. I will discuss a couple of the \nitems I think we should address in just a moment. But to move forward \nwith the description of the bill itself and why I think it is \nproblematic, the primary concern is the fact that it will seriously \nweaken controls on literally thousands of items that have a dual-use \ncapability--again, items that have some commercial application but also \nhave some specific military capability.\n  For example, its provision establishing a National Security Control \nList would continue the unfortunate trend of marginalizing those \nagencies that are most responsible for national security--the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of State, as well as the \nintelligence organizations that possess vital knowledge about the \nmilitary significance of some of these items.\n\n[[Page S9098]]\n\n  Specifically, the bill diminishes the role of the Department of \nDefense, the Department of Energy, the State Department, and the \nintelligence community in the license review process. Even the Clinton \nadministration Executive order regulating dual-use exports in the \nabsence of a permanent Export Administration Act authorized the \nDepartments of Defense, State, and Energy to review any license \napplication submitted to Commerce. But S. 149 would leave to the \nSecretary of Commerce the discretion to refer to the national security \nagencies those applications the Secretary of Commerce deems \nappropriate.\n  The bill would also repeal the requirement in the fiscal year 1998 \nNational Defense Authorization Act that computers with certain \ncapabilities be controlled. This is important because this represents \nthe work of the Congress and the signature of the President on \nimportant legislation just 2 years ago, in response, primarily, to the \nbreaking news of the technology transfers to countries such as China \nand the work that different groups did to evaluate the way that was \nhappening, especially the work of the Cox committee which made, in \naddition, a variety of recommendations of how we could tighten up the \nprocess for exporting these kinds of items.\n  This National Defense Authorization Act had a very specific provision \nabout the export of computers. But President Clinton, as he was leaving \nthe White House, loosened significantly the export controls on high-\nperformance computers significantly. Under President Clinton's \nguidelines, computers with a processing speed of fewer than 85,000 \nmillion theoretical operations per second--or MTOPS--no longer require \na license for export to military organizations in so-called tier III \ncountries, countries such as Russia, China, India, and Pakistan. By \ncontrast, in 1997, computers with processing speeds above 2,000 MTOPS \nwere barred from export for military end-users or users in tier III \ncountries.\n\n  Now, to contrast: 85,000 MTOPS computers are extremely powerful. As a \ncomparison, in 1997, some of the initial computers developed in the \nUnited States under our Stockpile Stewardship Program's Accelerated \nStrategic Computing Initiative, the so-called ASCI--and the specific \nproject was called ASCI Red and ASCI Red/1024; very sophisticated \ncomputing programs--these programs had processing speeds of 46,000 and \n76,000 MTOPS, respectively. These computers were used for 3D modeling \nand shock physics simulation for nuclear weapons applications; in other \nwords, the best we had just 3 years ago, used in the most sophisticated \nanalysis in which our country is involved right now, and these are \ncomputers with less capability than those that are now off the list for \ncontrol with respect to export to countries such as China.\n  Under this bill, there are two major exemptions created that permit \nthis to happen. One is the so-called foreign availability, and the \nother is the mass market status exception. Both of these would \neffectively prevent the Federal Government from regulating the export \nof many sensitive technologies that could be used to threaten U.S. \nsecurity. Under these provisions, if a product is available from a \nforeign supplier or is widely available in the United States, it is \nvery unlikely that the President could meet the standards in the bill \nnecessary to maintain export controls on the item.\n  We all know trade is vital to the United States, but I hope that most \nof us would agree that national security concerns do trump trade if \nthere is an irreconcilable conflict; at least it should. U.S. national \nsecurity interests dictate that there are some goods which should not \nbe sold in some markets. Again, I think all of us would agree to that \nproposition, hypothetically at least. The fact that some Western \nEuropean firms, for example, helped Libya construct a chemical weapons \nproduction complex should not justify the involvement of United States \ncompanies in similar ventures. If we don't want that complex to be \nbuilt, then the United States should not sanction the export of U.S. \nproducts which help to develop that chemical weapons production \ncomplex. Nations which threaten our security interests should not be \narmed by the United States. The fight against proliferation and rogue \nregimes must include some degree of self-discipline within our own \nborders.\n  The bill also weakens current export controls by making it very \ndifficult to control the export of a sensitive item if it is \nincorporated or embedded into a larger product.\n  (Mr. CARPER assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KYL. For example, the bill prohibits export controls on items \nthat contain controlled components comprising less than 25 percent of \nthe total value of an item and sets an extremely high standard for the \nPresident to meet in order to control such items. Nations such as Iran \nand Iraq spend millions of dollars to establish elaborate procurement \ncompanies with front companies and shadowy middlemen in order to obtain \nitems that in some cases really only cost a few thousand dollars. These \nnations could easily take advantage of this by purchasing the larger \nitems that contain the desired part.\n  There are a lot of examples of this, where you purchase the larger \nitem, and all you want is the little piece embedded in it. That is what \nyou need for your particular nuclear program or missile program. We all \nknow that the particular item is highly sensitive, that it has military \napplication. But in the bill, if it is only 25 percent of the total \nvalue of the overall item, then it goes, notwithstanding the fact that \nit can be easily taken apart, that the sensitive item can be pulled out \nand put onto a missile or a nuclear weapon or whatever the use of it \nmight be. That doesn't make sense.\n  Finally, the current bill weakens current controls by treating export \ncontrols adopted for foreign policy reasons as a sanction. The bill's \nprovisions in this area subject such export controls to a process that \nis intended to make it as difficult as possible for either the \nPresident or the Congress to impose or maintain sanctions. And it \nrequires that all such export controls sunset every 2 years.\n  Let me describe a little bit further the problems with the foreign \navailability and market exemptions. As I said, the bill calls for the \ncreation of an office at the Commerce Department charged with \nperforming studies of whether products controlled for export by the \nFederal Government are available from foreign suppliers or are widely \navailable in the United States. At least at first blush it would make \nsome sense that if you can get this thing anywhere, then why should the \nUnited States punish its own people for exporting the item, but there \nis more here than meets the eye.\n  The President may only maintain export controls on an item if he \ncertifies--and I am going through the bill--one, that the absence of an \nexport control on the item would be detrimental to the United States \nnational security and, two, there is a high probability that the \nforeign availability of an item will be eliminated through multilateral \nnegotiations within a reasonable period of time. Furthermore, the \nPresident may only maintain controls on an item for 6 months at a time, \nup to a total of 18 months, if he has not reached some agreement with \nthe foreign suppliers to limit availability of the item.\n  The President of the United States, the ultimate person in our \ncountry charged with our national security responsibility, is limited \nby this legislation to only provide three 6-month extensions of a \nlimitation on the export of an item under this provision of the law. \nOtherwise, after that, it goes.\n  The bill has a provision that says the President has an opportunity \nto try to negotiate with the foreign supplier a limitation on the \nexport of the item to a third country. Why would any country have any \nincentive to negotiate that when they know that after 18 months the lid \nis off? It seems to me that it is very important for us to try to \nchange provisions such as this in the legislation to try to tighten up \nthe situation in which there is a finding of foreign availability but \nthere is an important reason for the United States to restrict the \ntransfer of an American component.\n\n  One example of this has to do with comparable quality. There is \nnothing in the legislation as it is written right now that requires \nthere be comparable quality between the products. You can easily have \nsomething called a computer that is available from two or three \ncountries on the foreign market\n\n[[Page S9099]]\n\nand a computer that is available in the United States. They may be \nroughly the same price and they may have roughly the same capacity, but \nthat doesn't mean they are equal in quality in the least.\n  There are many qualitative factors that differentiate products. One \nreason why people want to buy American products is because of that \nbuilt-in quality. Maybe the United States product is less prone to \nbreak down. Maybe it has better service contracts. Maybe it is more \nrobust, it can stand more hustle and jostle.\n  The fact is, there are a lot of different reasons why two roughly \ncomparable products may be of substantially different quality. When we \ngo to the auto dealer to buy a car, some of the things we look at are: \nhow will it stand up? What is its service record? How much do the \nrepairs cost? All of these different things have to do with quality. \nYet there is nothing in this legislation that permits anybody to look \nat the quality aspect. So a company in the United States says: Look, \none of our foreign competitors is beating us out here; they are selling \na product that is roughly comparable to ours in price and capability so \nlift the restriction on us. There is a matter of foreign availability \ninvolved.\n  Somebody in the United States needs to say: Yes, there is a matter of \nforeign availability. But the reason you are being undercut is because \nthat is a product they can sell cheaper that countries will buy because \nit is of lesser quality, but the fact is, they would rather have your \nproduct because they know the quality is better.\n  We can deny them the quality of the United States product for their \nmilitary use if we have serious export controls. If we have nothing but \nthis test of foreign availability, then the sky is the limit.\n  The standards in the bill for maintaining controls on a product are \nalso very difficult to reach. The President may only maintain export \ncontrols if ``decontrolling or failing to control an item constitutes a \nserious threat to the national security of the United States, and \nexport controls on the item would be likely to diminish the threat to, \nand advance the national security interests of the United States.'' \nThere are a lot of items on the list. For the President to have to go \nthrough every one and try to justify meeting a standard such as that is \nunrealistic.\n  By incorporating into law the foreign availability and mass market \ncriteria that ignore both our moral responsibilities and our vital if, \nfor proprietary reasons, difficult to articulate technological \nadvantages, this legislation would open the floodgates to an outpouring \nof highly sensitive goods. Foreign countries want American technology. \nThe fact that they can purchase roughly comparable items elsewhere does \nnot detract from the fact that we are the world leader in most key \ntechnologies and that the United States and its corporations should not \nbe in the business of advancing the military capabilities of potential \nenemies of the United States.\n  This matter of foreign availability is going to be forever subject to \ninterpretation. It is my view that the Department of Defense should \nhave a lot more in the way of a seat at the table to influence this \nprocess.\n\n  The best example--at least one good example--of this situation is the \nexport of high-performance computers. Our technology exceeds that of \nall foreign competitors. Yet our companies are asking for more liberal \ncontrols on this basis of foreign availability. As I said before, the \nClinton administration, for all practical purposes, eliminated \nrestrictions on the sale of these computers. But because of the 18-\nmonth limitation I cited before, the reality is there is almost no way \nto control, at least after 18 months, the export of these items. It is \na very dangerous situation.\n  The Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control to which I referred \nbefore addressed this issue. Let me quote one paragraph:\n\n       This [foreign availability] pushes export control down to \n     the level of the worst abuser.\n\n  Let me restate that:\n\n       This [foreign availability] pushes export control down to \n     the level of the worst abuser. Germany sold Iraq more pieces \n     of dangerous equipment before the Gulf War than all other \n     countries combined. If American policy had been as lax as \n     Germany's, Saddam's bomb program would have advanced much \n     faster. And for exports to Iran, U.S. policy would now have \n     to be relaxed because of sales by Germany, Japan and \n     Switzerland. Moreover, U.S. officials acknowledge that \n     estimates of foreign availability are too imprecise to \n     dictate export policy.\n\n  That is from the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control. They are \ninterested in trying to limit the export of this kind of technology \nthat would spread nuclear technology around the world, nuclear weapons \ntechnology. Their point is that the United States should not be dragged \ndown to the least common denominator. Simply because a country in the \nworld is willing to sell a rogue nation whatever it wants doesn't mean \nthat the United States should permit that same kind of export.\n  More important is the fact that under this bill if Iraq or Iran or \nNorth Korea, for example, seek to sell China high-technology items that \ncan be used in constructing weapons of mass destruction and their means \nof delivery, then U.S. companies would be similarly free to sell such \nitems to China.\n  The bill does nothing to prevent such a situation from occurring. So \nhere you have a case where it is not one of our allies such as Germany; \nit is North Korea, Iran, or Iraq. If they are willing to sell an item \nto a country such as China, the provisions will say the United States \nmust be willing to do so, too. With Iraq and China's penchant for \nconstructing these well-configured front operations to conceal their \nactivities, it is not outside the realm of possibility that they could \nsurreptitiously attain high-tech items to be ``sold'' to China. Indeed, \ncountries such as Germany and France that have sold weapons of mass \ndestruction capabilities to Libya and Iraq should not be setting the \ntone for U.S. export control policy either.\n  If China sells dual-use items to Pakistan, does that qualify as \n``foreign availability'' under this bill? Yes, it does. Is that the \ntest we want to apply here--if a country such as China sells a dual-use \nitem to Pakistan, therefore it is available on the foreign market?\n  China's record as perhaps the worst proliferator in the world does \nnot detract from its value as a market. It will receive dual-use \ntechnologies under the export regime established by this bill. The risk \nof those technologies ending up in countries such as Iraq should not be \nignored.\n  The bill contains a provision, section 301, that would prohibit the \nPresident from placing controls on ``the export from a foreign country \n(whether or not by a United States person) of any item produced or \noriginating in a foreign country that contains parts or components \nproduced or originating in the United States.''\n  Section 301, which is the principal foreign policy control provision \nof the bill, places unreasonable standards for controlling the item of \ntechnology for foreign policy purposes. By statutorily requiring a \nfinding that a ``serious threat''--not just a ``threat''--would be \nposed to U.S. interests by the export of the item in question, the bar \nhas been raised very high indeed.\n  What to do, Mr. President? We are going to offer suggestions how to \nimprove the bill. Some changes have been made based on suggestions we \nmade, but there is far too much that has not been done in response to \nthe concerns we have raised. By ``we,'' I don't hesitate to note that \nwe are talking about the chairmen, primarily, of the committees of \njurisdiction with a concern of national security--chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee and Ranking Member Warner, the ranking member of the \nIntelligence Committee, the ranking member of the Foreign Operations \nCommittee, the ranking member of the Government Operations Committee, I \nchair a Subcommittee on Terrorism and am a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee and Senator McCain, the ranking member on the Commerce \nCommittee. These are people who have expressed concerns about \nprovisions of the bill, as I have today.\n  We have tried to get some changes made in the bill. We will continue \nto work with the sponsors of the bill and the administration to try to \nmake some additional changes that are a little bit more in line with \nwhat we believe are true national security interests and closer to the \nversion passed by the House of Representatives.\n  Eventually, there is going to have to be a compromise between the \nHouse\n\n[[Page S9100]]\n\nand Senate. We have amendments we would like to offer. One I will \ndescribe briefly. I will offer it later on, unless we can work this \nout. There is a possibility that we can work it out. It has to do with \nthe question of how you verify an agreement with another country to \ninspect after the transfer has been made, to make sure that the \nshipment has gone to the place they said it would go. Remember, we are \ntalking about dual-use technologies. They say: We want to buy item X to \nuse in our commercial sector. And you say: If you use it in the \ncommercial sector, that is OK, but it is not OK to use in your defense \nestablishment. They agree, so the item is shipped. Somebody needs to go \ncheck to make sure the use is indeed in the commercial sector, that \nthey haven't surreptitiously sent it across the street to the defense \nplant to be used for illicit purposes.\n\n  Under regimes that exist with China today, there is very little \npostshipment verification permitted by China. If we are going to have a \ntrusting set of export controls, as we have in this legislation, we \nneed to have some way of enforcing the agreement these other countries \nmake when a limitation is placed upon a license that it must be used \nfor commercial, nondefense purposes.\n  The bill, right now, doesn't provide an enforcement mechanism with \nrespect to these countries. It does with respect to companies but not \ncountries. But in the case of China, for example, which has permitted \nless than one-fourth of the transfers with respect to satellites to \nhave postshipment verification, notwithstanding its agreement in 1998 \nthat it would do so, we need to have some kind of enforcement that, in \nfact, when we sell them something for commercial purposes, that is what \nit will be used for.\n  The only way to do that is to change a provision of the law which \nwould enable us to go in and inspect--not have the Chinese do it for \nus, which is sometimes what they do today. They insist on doing their \nown inspection. We need to verify postshipment that the item went where \nit was supposed to go. If a country such as China does not permit that, \nor we find they have violated the terms of the agreement, then we have \nto have the ability to say no to future licenses.\n  Under the bill, the only thing you can say no to is that same kind of \nitem. Clearly, the U.S. Government needs a broader authority. If the \nChinese are cheating on satellites, for example, and then they want to \nbuy nuclear components ostensibly for a powerplant, but we also know it \nhas nuclear weapons capability, we want to have the ability to say no \nuntil they show us they are abiding by the agreement with respect to \nsatellites; we are not going to export something that could be used \nmilitarily by their armed services for a nuclear program.\n  I have suggested language to the proponents, and I hope they will be \nreceptive to a change that would give the U.S. the ability with respect \nto subsequent license decisions to say no if, in fact, the U.S. \nbelieves there is a lack of cooperation by this country.\n  There is so much detail one could get into here, and there are so \nmany changes I think we should make. I hesitate to go further with the \ndescription. I have tried to generally describe some of the aspects we \nthink are wrong. I think it is important for us to have the ability to \noffer some amendments, describe specifically the improvements we think \nshould be made in the bill, and hopefully throughout the course of the \nproceedings we will be able to come to some agreement that will make \nthe bill a little better so we can get on with the work of dealing with \nthe House of Representatives so we can conclude work on this \nlegislation.\n  I know it is important to the administration. I don't want to hold it \nup because of that. If the President says he wants to have a bill on \nthis subject, that is good enough for me. I am willing to try to have \nthat happen. We hope we can get work done on improving the bill in the \nnext day or two. Assuming that we can, my guess is that consideration \nof the legislation will go more quickly.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues. Later, I will discuss \nthe specific amendments I think would be appropriate--not in detail, \nbut by general subject matter--and that will enable us to decide how we \ncan move forward on the legislation at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \ncomments. I feel compelled to comment on a couple of the items he \nraised. There were several mentions of jurisdiction in there. I know \nthere has been some jurisdictional friction during this entire time \nthat we have worked on the bill over the last 3 years. I hope the \nSenators feel they have been included in discussions. We have lists of \na lot of meetings in which we participated. We mentioned the 59 changes \nthat have been made in the bill as a result of those meetings, probably \nthe most significant of which is the enhanced powers. We mentioned \nforeign availability.\n  I have to tell you that the foreign availability in this bill was in \nthe 1979 act, but it has gotten some attention because we put in mass \nmarket this time.\n  Because of comments raised by the Senator from Arizona and several of \nhis colleagues, we have a provision in here that provides for some \nPresidential enhanced powers that trump all of that. We hope the \nPresident won't trump all of that. We hope the President will work to \nhave some multilateral controls over these foreign availability items \ninstead of just the unilateral system that we are working now. \n``Unilateral'' means we are letting the rest of the world sell this \nstuff to anybody they want. ``Multilateral'' means we work together to \nmake sure anybody who makes that item doesn't sell it to the bad guys.\n  We have to have the multilateral control. Unilateral doesn't work. \nUnless we put the foreign availability in there with a suggestion--and \nit becomes a suggestion because of the paragraph we put in at your \nsuggestion with the Presidential enhanced powers--it is only a \nsuggestion because the President can trump that, but hopefully he will \nwork with these other countries and see, if a product that ought to be \ncontrolled is made in a foreign country, if we can get the foreign \ncountry to agree on who the bad guys are and agree they will not sell \nit to them.\n\n  I appreciate the Senator's suggestion on that. I think it is the most \ndramatic change that is in the entire bill.\n  On the jurisdictional question, the 1979 act was written by the \nBanking Committee. It was their jurisdiction back then. It has been \nadvanced a number of times since then, each time by the Banking \nCommittee.\n  Of course, everybody recognizes the world is considerably different \nnow than it was in 1979. We do not have some of the same capability \nbecause COCOM, which was a multilateral agreement, no longer exists. It \nis now a voluntary agreement instead of an enforced agreement.\n  Throughout that whole uncertain time from 1979 until the Iron Curtain \ncame down, the Banking Committee held the jurisdiction over export \ncontrols--not arms controls but export controls. Under the committee's \noversight, the EAA and its predecessor, the Export Control Act, served \nas the key export control authority throughout the cold war and I think \nsignificantly contributed to its demise.\n  In fact, the Banking Committee has long had broad national security \njurisdiction which has been rivaled by few other committees. Among the \nlaws within its jurisdiction are the Trading with the Enemy Act, the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act, the Defense Production \nAct, the Exon-Florio amendment, the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, the \nExport Administration Act.\n  Rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate makes clear that the \nBanking Committee has sole jurisdiction over dual-use export controls. \nParagraph (d)(1) states explicitly that ``all proposed legislation, \nmessages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating to'' export \ncontrols shall be referred to the Banking Committee. Nowhere else in \nthe rules is there any mention of export controls with regard to any \nother committee.\n  The Banking Committee's jurisdiction over export controls is fully \nauthorized and appropriate. That is why we have been doing the work on \nthis bill.\n  The act has expired a number of times. When it expires, the only \naction that can be taken is an Executive order\n\n[[Page S9101]]\n\nby the President under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. \nThat just does not cut it, and I think everybody agrees that does not \ncut it. We need to do something a little more dramatic than that.\n  We can go back to that act of 1979, but pretty much everybody agrees \nthat is inadequate at this point in time and that there should be some \ndifferences made. There have been a number of studies done on that--one \nof them was quoted yesterday--that Secretary Rumsfeld participated in \nbefore he became the Secretary.\n  Yesterday we presented a letter showing that Secretary Rumsfeld \nthinks this bill is an improved version of the 1979 act and will solve \nthe problems about which we have been talking. There are things that \nneed to be done in addition to this.\n  I do think continual review of our export policy is necessary. I \nappreciate the suggestion of the blue ribbon panel. It has some \ncapability to take a look at this in the interim while we operate under \nthis new act so we have something substantial in place that will \nprotect us beyond an Executive order or even beyond the extension of \nthe 1979 act. I will have additional comments later. I did want to \nclear up those things because we debated them a bit yesterday. There is \nsome foreign availability, but we have a Presidential trump done at the \nSenator's suggestion and, again, a number of other changes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes, if I \nmay, to make brief remarks in response to my friend's statements.\n  Foreign availability, one might say, was in the 1979 act, but foreign \navailability has been greatly expanded in this act. In the 1979 act, \nforeign availability was allowed to be considered as one of several \nfactors in determining whether or not to issue a license. That is \nperfectly appropriate.\n  In the current legislation, foreign availability is set up as a total \ndistinct category of items, whereby if there is foreign availability, \nit is totally decontrolled as determined by the Department of Commerce. \nThat is a major difference.\n  Obviously, the proponents of this bill are going to prevail on the \nnotion that this is a good idea, but let's not deceive ourselves into \nthinking we are just continuing on the 1979 policy. We are greatly \nexpanding the 1979 policy on foreign availability.\n  Secondly, I had not mentioned anything on jurisdiction. Apparently my \nfriend from Arizona did and Senator Enzi just did. There is no question \nthat the Banking Committee has jurisdiction. Since the subject has been \nbrought up, I find it somewhat odd that we as a body have decided to \ntake legislation whose purpose is to restrict the export of items that \nwould contribute to the military potential of countries so as to prove \ndetrimental to the national security of the United States, and \nlegislation designed to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and place that in the Banking Committee. We have done it. \nThere is no question about it.\n  I find that kind of odd. The House did not do it. It is not in the \nBanking Committee on the House side, but it is in the Senate. I do not \nknow whether anybody wants to take a look at that. They are welcome to, \nand it will be a fruitless exercise. But since the subject has been \nbrought up, I find it somewhat odd that we would choose to take \nlegislation designed to protect our country from proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction and place that jurisdiction in the Banking \nCommittee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time? The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I know the able Senator from Utah has \nbeen waiting to speak. If he will indulge me a couple minutes, I want \nto get something into the Record in light of the comments that were \nmade by the Senator from Arizona.\n  One of the difficulties I am having, as I hear the critics of this \nbill outline their concerns, I frequently find myself sharing their \nconcerns but then not understanding why they fail to perceive the bill \naddresses their concerns. In other words, we have tried to cover this \nmatter.\n  The Senator from Arizona has spent a good deal of time talking about \nforeign availability but, in fact, the legislation specifically \nprovides a whole procedure whereby the President can set aside a \nforeign availability status determination. That is in section 212. \nThere is a detailed process by which he can set that aside.\n  Furthermore, and much more importantly in a sense, in response to \nsome of the points that were raised, we give the President in section \n201(d) enhanced control authority.\n  Let me read that authority:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title, the \n     President may determine that applying the provisions of \n     section 204 or 211--\n\n  And 211 is the foreign availability mass marketing section--\n\n     with respect to any item on the National Security Control \n     List would constitute a significant threat to the national \n     security of the United States and that such item requires \n     enhanced control. If the President determines that enhanced \n     control should apply to such item, the item may be excluded \n     from the provisions of section 204, section 211, or both, \n     until such time as the President shall determine that such \n     enhanced control should no longer apply to such item.\n\n  No wonder the administration is supportive with that kind of blanket \nauthority placed in the hands of the President. I wanted to underscore \nthat.\n  The other point was raised about ascertaining end users.\n  On page 295 of the legislation, I am going to take a moment to read \nthe provisions because the Secretary shall target postshipment \nverification to exports involving the greatest risk to national \nsecurity. Refusal to allow postshipment verification, which the Senator \nfrom Arizona was just talking about, if an end user refuses to allow \npostshipment verification of a controlled item, the Secretary shall \ndeny a license for the export of any controlled item to such end user \nuntil such postshipment verification occurs.\n  Let me state that section again. If an end user refuses to allow \npostshipment verification of a controlled item, the Secretary shall \ndeny a license for the export of any controlled item to such end user \nuntil such postshipment verification occurs.\n  Furthermore, the point was raised, suppose the country refuses. \nAgain, if the country in which the end user is located refuses to allow \npostshipment verification of a controlled item, the Secretary may deny \na license for the export of that item or any substantially identical or \ndirectly competitive item or class of items to all end users in that \ncountry until such postshipment verification is allowed.\n  So the problem was raised, but in my view the bill clearly addresses \nthe problem. Furthermore, the bill goes on to say on this specific \nissue--I could do a similar exercise with other points that were made \nor issues that were raised, but I am not going to take the time to do \nthat, and the Senator from Utah is being very patient and generous in \nallowing me to proceed.\n  Let me just close with again discussing the end-use verification \nbecause we recognize it is an important challenge, and we need to deal \nwith it. We are not contending it does not need to be addressed. We are \nsimply asserting there are ways we have addressed it in the bill, and \nwe think these ways of addressing it deal with the problem.\n  End-use verification authorization: There is authorized to be \nappropriated for the Department of Commerce $4.5 million and such sums \nas may be necessary to hire 10 additional overseas investigators to be \nposted in the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation, the \nHong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Republic of India, \nSingapore, Egypt, and Taiwan, or any other place the Secretary deems \nappropriate for the purpose of verifying the end use of high-risk, \ndual-use technology.\n  Then there is a provision for a report to the Congress from the \nSecretary on the effectiveness of the end-user verification activities.\n  There is a further provision, in addition to the authorization \nprovided in paragraph 1--that is, the $4.5 million I just mentioned--\nthere is authorized to be appropriated for the Department of Commerce \n$5 million to enhance this program for verifying the end use of items \nsubject to controls under this act. So there is an additional $10 \nmillion we are putting into this specific purpose.\n\n[[Page S9102]]\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator agree the issue is whether or not it \nis good policy to require the Secretary to cut off an end user, if \npostshipment verification is not allowed, but would give the Secretary \ndiscretion to cut off or not cut off a country that denies postshipment \nverification? It seems that is the issue.\n  The point my friend from Arizona was making was in some cases you \nhave a country, such as China, where we have a situation with them \nwhere we request postshipment verifications for various sites, and they \nagree to a few and remain silent on the rest. They never say no; they \njust never say yes. This is a country decision.\n\n  Under the legislation, the Secretary does have the discretion, and I \ncan see an argument for giving him discretion, but I can also see a \nvery good argument, and more persuasive, that as it makes good policy \nsense to require the Secretary to cut off, as a matter of national \npolicy, an end user if they behave in such a way, that the same logic \nwould make it good policy to cut off a country if they are, in fact, \ncalling the shots, as is often the case.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There is some weight to the point the Senator is \nmaking, but it seems to me cutting off the country has a broad range of \nimplications and consequences. Those have to be taken into \nconsideration and, therefore, giving the Secretary a ``may'' authority \nrather than a ``shall'' requirement probably makes sense in that \ninstance. The counterargument can obviously be made that then you may \nconfront a situation in which, because of the host of considerations \nthat are involved, you do not want to actually exercise the authority, \nbut the statute would require you to do so.\n  The way it is worded, the authority is given, it is there to be \nexercised, but exercising is not compelled. We came down on that side \nof it. We are trying to give authority to the executive branch but give \nthem a certain amount of flexibility to deal with the problem.\n  The Senator himself yesterday referred to the unintended consequences \nof consideration. As I commented yesterday, that was a very apt \nperception and, again, we are trying to deal potentially with what \nmight be an unintended consequence.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Utah has been extremely generous, and \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland yields the floor. \nThe Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank my \ncolleagues for an illuminating debate. With some trepidation, I am \ngoing to take a page out of the book of the senior Senator from West \nVirginia and talk about Roman history for a moment because I think it \nis appropriate in this circumstance.\n  The Roman Empire was the dominant military power for many centuries, \nand it was the dominant military power for two reasons: one was \ntechnology and the other was training.\n  In order to become a Roman legionnaire, I understand it took 14 years \nof training to learn the technology. Now, it may sound strange in \ntoday's world to call ``technology'' what the Romans used in their \nmilitary, but the Romans carefully studied the art of war and came up \nwith a technology that was new and unique in their time.\n  They had a large shield with which they could protect themselves \nagainst the initial blow of the enemy, and then they devised a short \nsword which could go around the shield and into the back of the soldier \nwith whom they were involved in close combat. They found the short \nsword was technologically better than the long sword, and the \ncombination of training with the shield and the short sword gave the \nRoman legions military dominance over all the world.\n  Why is that relevant? We are talking about technology. We are not \ntalking about training. We are not talking about the ability of the \nAmerican military and the American planners to use the available \ntechnology better than other people can use it. It is a point which \nmust be made as we go through this debate because we are having the \ndebate as if the technology by itself constitutes military \nsuperiority, as if a single export of a single item of technology to a \ncountry that wishes us ill would automatically and immediately change \nthe military balance between us and that country. That simply is not \ntrue.\n\n  The American military is not at risk because of the potential export \nof computing power from American firms. The American military is as \npowerful as it is because of the combination of the technology that it \nemploys plus the strategic expertise, the military doctrine and the \ntraining and implementing of that doctrine that goes on in the American \nmilitary and that requires years to implement, just as it did back in \nthe days of the Roman Empire and the training of a legionnaire.\n  The barbarians in Roman times could easily duplicate a short sword. \nThat was technology that they could reproduce in their own foundries. \nThey didn't quite know how to use it. They didn't know how to use it in \nconjunction with the shield. The possession of the physical attributes \nof the shield and the sword did not create a military that could attack \nand destroy the Roman legions.\n  The same is true of computer power today. The mere possession of \ncomputer power by a nation that wishes us ill does not automatically \nmean they have the power to take on the American military establishment \nand defeat it. The other factor here that is different from the Romans \nthat we have to focus on has to do with the speed with which technology \nis changing. The Romans dominated the world for centuries with the \nshield and the short sword. But the Senator from Arizona has bemoaned \nthe fact that computer power that would have been improper, indeed \nillegal, to export just 3 years ago, is today being exported all over \nthe world. Three years constitutes two cycles in what is known as \nMoore's law. Computing power doubles every 18 months. That means that \nwhich was considered to be a supercomputer just 3 years ago has been \nreplaced in the normal course of industrial technology by a computer \nthat has doubled and then doubled again, four times as powerful, so \nthat which is now being allowed to be exported without controls, which \nwould have been controlled 3 years ago, is not only being exported, it \nis obsolete. Nobody wants it, except in a way I will describe in just a \nminute.\n  This is the rate of the marketplace in which we are living today. It \nis not slowing down. If anything, it is accelerating.\n  I quote from President Bush: The existing export controls forbid the \nsales abroad of computers with more than a certain amount of computing \npower. With computer power doubling every 18 months, these controls \nhave the shelf life of sliced bread. They don't work.\n  It is interesting the most powerful computer available now in the \nstandard marketplace--and even this statement is now obsolete; it was \ntrue maybe 6 or 9 months ago--the most powerful computer available to \nthe general public came from Japan, not from America, and was available \nin a toy, PlayStation 2. The computing power of PlayStation 2 was \nsufficient to drive the entire missile control system of the Chinese \nmilitary as it existed at the time of the Cox report.\n  Are we going to say we would prohibit American firms from exporting \ncomputers that have the same power as the toy PlayStation 2, in an \neffort to deny that ability to the Chinese, when they can walk into \nToys R Us, anywhere in the world, and pick it up for a few hundred \ndollars.\n  That is what is happening in this world of technology. We turn our \nbacks to that reality if we say somehow we must prevent the Americans \nfrom exporting this kind of thing even though the foreigners are \nproducing it and selling it all over the world.\n\n  John Hamre, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, said to me in a \nconversation about this, toward the end of his term with the Department \nof Defense, and I am paraphrasing: My realization that we are on the \nwrong side of this issue came when it suddenly occurred to me that if \nwe continue to prevent Americans from being in the world market, we are \nhastening the day when the American military will have to go to foreign \nsuppliers for the latest technology because American suppliers have \nbeen damaged.\n  The Senator from Arizona said we must not arm our enemies or that our \nenemies should not be armed by the United States. I say we should not \nget\n\n[[Page S9103]]\n\nourselves into a position where the United States must go to foreign \nsources for the technology it needs to arm itself.\n  But if we say to American manufacturers, you cannot play in the world \nmarket except on a time-delayed basis, you cannot compete with \ncompanies in Germany, Britain, Japan, and, yes, China because there are \ncomputer manufacturers that are making machines with high levels of \nMTOPS in China trying to get into the international market--if we say \nto the Americans, you cannot compete in the international market with \nthese foreign firms except with a delayed time fuse created by the \ngovernment, we are saying, ultimately, that the leadership of \ntechnology will go from the United States overseas, and the American \nmilitary will be faced with a very difficult situation, a very serious \nHobson's choice. They will have to decide either we use American \ntechnology that is behind the curve because the American firms have \nbeen damaged by their inability to compete in the international \nmarketplace and thereby to sell in a larger marketplace and thereby to \ncut their costs by virtue of increased sales or we have to go overseas \nto buy that technology.\n  That is not a choice I want the Secretary of Defense 5 or 10 years \nfrom now to have to make. I want the Secretary of Defense 5 to 10 years \nfrom now to be in the position he is now, to say the leading technology \nsources are American and that is where I will go to buy.\n  The days are over when American technology companies manufacture \nsolely for the Defense Department. They manufacture for dual use \neverywhere. I remember a time when the telephone system in the Pentagon \nwas completely secure because it was run entirely by the Defense \nDepartment. Those days are over. When the Secretary of Defense picks up \nthe telephone now he is connected to Verizon. Why is that the case? \nBecause Verizon has developed better technology using the marketplace \nof both the military and the private sector. It is more reliable than \nthe old defense system was, and it is cheaper.\n  When the Defense Department goes out to buy computer chips, they \ndon't buy them from a source solely dedicated to defense contracting. \nThat was the norm in the 1950s and the 1960s. I remember giant \ncorporations that produced nothing but defense technology. They did all \nof their research for the Defense Department. They had only one \ncustomer and that was the Defense Department and everything was focused \nthere. It was also very expensive.\n  Now when they develop a new chip or a new technology they offer it to \nthe Defense Department the same time they offer it in the civilian \nmarket. It is the profits they make in the civilian market that \nsubsidize the work they do for the defense market, bringing costs down \nfor everybody, and increasing the technical ability of the products \nthey make.\n  If we say to them, artificially, you cannot sell these products \nanywhere but in the United States, even though your principle \ncompetitors in the borderless economies of the world are selling their \nproducts everywhere else, as well as in the United States, we are \nhandicapping these American firms to a point that will ultimately \nbecome a national security issue for the United States, that will \nultimately take us to the situation that Secretary Hamre was worried \nabout where the Defense Department will have to choose between American \nmanufacturers forced to be behind the curve internationally or foreign \nmanufacturers located offshore.\n  We may not like this situation but that is where we are and we are \nnot going to go back. The borderless economy is a reality of the \nfuture. It cannot be turned back. We have to accept this new reality \nand say the best national security step we can take is to keep American \ntechnology firms absolutely in the forefront, and the best way to keep \nthem in the forefront is to give them the opportunity to compete in the \nlargest possible market that they can.\n  That is why this bill is so important. That is why this bill has \nsignificant national security implications that cannot be ignored. But, \nonce again, let us remember as we get concerned about the military \napplications of this technology in other countries, that the American \nmilitary is as strong as it is not solely because of its technology but \nbecause of the entire structure of technology, strategy, and training \nthat has been built around it.\n  There are others who recognize that everything is changing in the way \nthat I have described. We have the letter from Secretary Powell, from \nSecretary Rumsfeld, as well as Secretary Evans, all three of them \nsaying this is the new reality and endorsing the bill.\n  But let me describe how the new reality comes along to make these \npast controls obsolete. This information is available everywhere in the \nworld. Once again, it is a borderless economy. We cannot keep it \nsecret. This is published in Scientific American, an article of August \nof 2000. It is called ``The Do-It-Yourself Supercomputer.''\n\n       Scientists have found a cheaper way to solve tremendously \n     difficult computational problems: connect ordinary PCs so \n     that they can work together.\n\n  It is a wonderful story. The authors of the article describe how they \ncreated what they called the stone soupercomputer, only they spelled it \nS-O-U-P-E-R, after the old fable about stone soup. We all remember \nhearing that as children: two fellows come to town and they are going \nto have a big bowl of soup, and they get a big caldron, put water in it \nand then put stones in it. The villagers gather around and ask: How are \nyou going to get soup out of stones?\n  Oh, they say, this is wonderful. We will have the most wonderful soup \nin the world. Do you want to contribute something to it?\n  Someone says: Is it really going to be that good?\n  Oh, yes. We'll give you some of it.\n  So someone puts in a little carrot to see if that will help the stone \nsoup. And someone says I have a little bit of beef that I can put in. \nAnd at the end you have the wonderful soup that, frankly, didn't cost \nthe makers of the soup anything.\n  They talk about the stone soupercomputer because they were faced with \na computing challenge that would require traditional supercomputers and \nthey could not afford a supercomputer. So they thought, what if we took \nexisting computers and linked them together, like the villagers \nbringing their various vegetables and linking them together? Could we \ncreate a supercomputer? If I can quote from the article:\n\n       In 1996 two of us (Hargrove and Hoffman) encountered such a \n     problem in our work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in \n     Tennessee. We were trying to draw a national map of \n     ecoregions, which are defined by environmental conditions: \n     All areas with the same climate, landforms and soil \n     characteristics fall into the same ecoregion. To create a \n     high resolution map of the continental United States, we \n     divided the country into 7.8 million square cells, each with \n     an area of 1 square kilometer. For each cell we had to \n     consider as many as 25 variables, ranging from average \n     monthly precipitation to the nitrogen content of the soil. \n     A single PC or work station could not accomplish the task. \n     We needed a parallel-processing supercomputer--and one \n     that we could afford.\n\n  So there is the problem. It is the kind of daunting problem that we \nhave learned to solve with computers. What did they do? Going back to \nthe article:\n\n       Our solution was to construct a computing cluster--\n\n  If I can interpolate, listen very carefully to what they used here, \nin view of the comments of the Senator from Arizona about the necessity \nof quality.\n  Back to the quote:\n\n     . . . using obsolete PCs . . . that would otherwise be \n     discarded. Dubbed the Stone SouperComputer because it was \n     built essentially at no cost, our cluster of PCs was powerful \n     enough to produce ecoregion region maps of unprecedented \n     detail. Other research groups have devised even more capable \n     clusters that rival the performance of the world's best \n     supercomputers at a mere fraction of their cost.\n\n  So here is a situation where they not only used PCs rather than a \nsupercomputer, they used PCs that were obsolete, that would otherwise \nhave been discarded. But they were able to string them together in such \na way as to duplicate the power of the supercomputer.\n  I ask unanimous consent the entire article be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n\n[[Page S9104]]\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. How would you feel if you were the manufacturer of a \ncomputer that could compete internationally with the best the Japanese, \nthe Chinese, the Germans, the Dutch or the British could offer and you \nwere told: No, you cannot export that until this long regime of \nanalysis has gone on because it might be used to duplicate the outcome \nof a supercomputer, and you saw that people were using obsolete \ncomputers to produce the same result?\n  The reality is, we find ourselves in an age that, as recently as 5 \nyears ago, and certainly as recently as 10 years ago, we could never \nhave imagined.\n  This bill before us is an attempt to bring the law into some kind of \ncongruity with reality and say we have to make the opportunity for \nAmerican computer and high-tech firms to compete in the world \nmarketplace and thereby prosper as friendly as possible.\n  We have a national security obligation to see to it that the American \nfirms retain their lead, the lead that has been established at great \nexpense and great effort by American research firms, by American \nuniversities, by the inventiveness of American entrepreneurs and \nAmerican programmers. We must not deny them the opportunity to compete \nin the world market on the same basis as every other country's \nentrepreneurs can compete because, if we do, we run the risk of having \nthem fall behind to the point that America will ultimately end up being \nas dependent on foreign technology as we are currently dependent on \nforeign oil.\n  That is not something we want to have happen. That is something that \nhas been driving me, at least, in my analysis and sponsorship of this \nkind of effort.\n  I congratulate my friend from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, for the \nleadership he has taken in the Banking Committee to pull together the \nconcepts that are involved in this into a piece of legislation that \nwill do the job.\n  I have no doubt that we are going to have to visit this again, maybe \nwithin 3, 5, certainly 10 years. Because the technological landscape is \ngoing to change just as dramatically in the next 10 as it has in the \nlast 10. But I listen to those who are opposed to this bill recite \ncircumstances that are 3 years old, 5 years old, 8 years old. I do not \nchallenge their motives, their patriotism, or their determination to do \nthe right thing. They are as determined to do the right thing as I hope \nI am. But I do think that the world is changing so rapidly around us \nand this portion of the economy is changing so rapidly that we must \nrecognize that and respond appropriately and accordingly.\n  Finally, in the report from the General Accounting Office that came \nin December of 2000, which was stimulated by the concerns of the \nSenator from Tennessee, with whom I worked to see that the GAO would \ngive us this report, we read the following:\n\n       The current system of controlling the export of individual \n     machines is ineffective in limiting countries of concern from \n     obtaining high performance computing capabilities for \n     military applications. In addition, . . . using MTOPS to \n     establish export control thresholds is outdated and no longer \n     a valid means for controlling computing capabilities.\n\n  That summarizes my position.\n  We are ineffective with the controls that exist now in limiting rogue \ncountries from getting the technologies they would need. Our security \nis dependent not on this ineffective kind of control; our security is \ndependent upon the overall expertise of the American military, which, \nas the Roman legions, is dependent on training and strategy every bit \nas much as the technology they have.\n  For that reason, I will support this bill as it stands and resist \namendments to it. I appreciate the efforts on the part of the Senator \nfrom Wyoming and the Senator from Maryland as they work to see that \nthis bill becomes law.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 [From Scientific American, Aug. 2001]\n\n                    The Do-It-Yourself Supercomputer\n\n\n  scientists have found a cheaper way to solve tremendously difficult \n  computational problems: connect ordinary pcs so that they can work \n                                together\n\n    (By William W. Hargrove, Forrest M. Hoffman and Thomas Sterling)\n\n       In the well-known stone soup fable, a wandering soldier \n     stops at a poor village and says he will make soup by boiling \n     a cauldron of water containing only a shiny stone. The \n     townspeople are skeptical at first but soon bring small \n     offerings: a head of cabbage, a bunch of carrots, a bit of \n     beef. In the end, the cauldron is filled with enough hearty \n     soup to feed everyone. The moral: cooperation can produce \n     significant achievements, even from meager, seemingly \n     insignificant contributions.\n       Researchers are now using a similar cooperative strategy to \n     build supercomputers, the powerful machines that can perform \n     billions of calculations in a second. Most conventional \n     supercomputers employ parallel processing: they contain \n     arrays of ultrafast microprocessors that work in tandem to \n     solve complex problems such as forecasting the weather or \n     simulating a nuclear explosion. Made by IBM, Cray and other \n     computer vendors, the machines typically cost tens of \n     millions of dollars--far too much for a research team with a \n     modest budget. So over the past few years, scientists at \n     national laboratories and universities have learned how to \n     construct their own supercomputers by linking inexpensive PCs \n     and writing software that allows these ordinary computers to \n     tackle extraordinary problems.\n       In 1996 two of us (Hargrove and Hoffman) encountered such a \n     problem in our work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) \n     in Tennessee. We were trying to draw a national map of \n     ecoregions, which are defined by environmental conditions: \n     all areas with the same climate, landforms and soil \n     characteristics fall into the same ecoregion. To create a \n     high-resolution map of the continental U.S., we divided the \n     country into 7.8 million square cells, each with an area of \n     one square kilometer. For each cell we had to consider as \n     many as 25 variables, ranging from average monthly \n     precipitation to the nitrogen content of the soil. A single \n     PC or workstation could not accomplish the task. We needed a \n     parallel-processing supercomputer--and one that we could \n     afford!\n       Our solution was to construct a computing cluster using \n     obsolete PCs that ORNL would have otherwise discarded. Dubbed \n     the Stone SouperComputer because it was build essentially at \n     no cost, our cluster of PCs was powerful enough to produce \n     ecoregion maps of unprecedented detail. Other research groups \n     have devised even more capable clusters that rival the \n     performance of the world's best supercomputers at a mere \n     fraction of their cost. This advantageous price-to-\n     performance ratio has already attracted the attention of some \n     corporations, which plan to use the clusters for such complex \n     tasks as deciphering the human genome. In fact, the cluster \n     concept promises to revolutionize the computing field by \n     offering tremendous processing power to any research group, \n     school or business that wants it.\n\n\n                          beowulf and grendel\n\n       The notion of linking computers together is not new. In the \n     1950s and 1960s the U.S. Air Force established a network of \n     vacuum-tube computers called SAGE to guard against a Soviet \n     nuclear attack. In the mid-1980s Digital Equipment \n     Corporation coined the term ``cluster'' when it integrated \n     its mid-range VAX minicomputers into larger systems. Networks \n     of workstations--generally less powerful than minicomputers \n     but faster than PCs--soon became common at research \n     institutions. By the early 1990s scientists began to consider \n     building clusters of PCs, partly because their mass-produced \n     microprocessors had become so inexpensive. What made the idea \n     even more appealing was the falling cost of Ethernet, the \n     dominant technology for connecting computers in local-area \n     networks.\n       Advances in software also paved the way for PC clusters. In \n     the 1980s Unix emerged as the dominant operating system for \n     scientific and technical computing. Unfortunately, the \n     operating systems for PCs lacked the power and flexibility of \n     Unix. But in 1991 Finnish college student Linus Torvalds \n     created Linux, a Unix-like operating system that ran on a PC. \n     Torvalds made Linux available free of charge on the Internet, \n     and soon hundreds of programmers began contributing \n     improvements. Now wildly popular as an operating system for \n     stand-alone computers, Linux is also ideal for clustered PCs.\n       The first PC cluster was born in 1994 at the NASA Goddard \n     Space Flight Center. NASA had been searching for a cheaper \n     way to solve the knotty computational problems typically \n     encountered in earth and space science. The space agency \n     needed a machine that could achieve one gigaflops--that is, \n     perform a billion floating-point operations per second. (A \n     floating-point operation is equivalent to a simple \n     calculation such as addition or multiplication.) At the time, \n     however, commercial supercomputers with that level of \n     performance cost about $1 million, which was too expensive to \n     be dedicated to a single group of researchers.\n       One of us (Sterling) decided to pursue the then radical \n     concept of building a computing cluster from PCs. Sterling \n     and his Goddard colleague Donald J. Becker connected 16 PCs, \n     each containing an Intel 486 microprocessor, using Linux and \n     a standard Ethernet network. For scientific applications, the \n     PC cluster delivered sustained performance of 70 megaflops--\n     that is, 70 million floating-point operations per second. \n     Though modest by today's standards, this speed was not much \n     lower than that of some smaller commercial supercomputers \n     available at the time. And the cluster was built for only \n     $40,000, or about one tenth the price of a comparable \n     commercial machine in 1994.\n       NASA researchers named their cluster Beowulf, after the \n     lean, mean hero of medieval legend who defeated the giant \n     monster Grendel by ripping off one of the creature's arms. \n     Since then, the name has been widely\n\n[[Page S9105]]\n\n     adopted to refer to any low-cost cluster constructed from \n     commercially available PCs. In 1996 two successors to the \n     original Beowulf cluster appeared: Hyglac (built by \n     researchers at the California Institute of Technology and the \n     Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and Loki (constructed at Los \n     Alamos National Laboratory). Each cluster integrated 16 Intel \n     Pentium Pro microprocessors and showed sustained performance \n     of over one gigaflops at a cost of less than $50,000, thus \n     satisfying NASA's original goal.\n       The Beowulf approach seemed to be the perfect computational \n     solution to our problem of mapping the ecoregions of the U.S. \n     A single workstation could handle the data for only a few \n     states at most, and we couldn't assign different regions of \n     the country to separate workstations--the environmental data \n     for every section of the country had to be compared and \n     processed simultaneously. In other words, we needed a \n     parallel-processing system. So in 1996 we wrote a proposal to \n     buy 64 new PCs containing Pentium II microprocessors and \n     construct a Beowulf-class supercomputer. Alas, this idea \n     sounded implausible to the reviewers at ORNL, who turned down \n     our proposal.\n       Undeterred, we devised an alternative plan. We knew that \n     obsolete PCs at the U.S. Department of Energy complex at Oak \n     Ridge were frequently replaced with newer models. The old PCs \n     were advertised on an internal Web site and auctioned off as \n     surplus equipment. A quick check revealed hundreds of \n     outdated computers waiting to be discarded this way. Perhaps \n     we could build our Beowulf cluster from machines that we \n     could collect and recycle free of charge. We commandeered a \n     room at ORNL that had previously housed an ancient mainframe \n     computer. Then we began collecting surplus PCs to create the \n     Stone SouperComputer.\n\n\n                          a digital chop shop\n\n       The strategy behind parallel computing is ``divide and \n     conquer.'' A parallel-processing system divides a complex \n     problem into smaller component tasks. The tasks are then \n     assigned to the system's nodes--for example, the PCs in a \n     Beowulf cluster--which tackle the components simultaneously. \n     The efficiency of parallel processing depends largely on the \n     nature of the problem. An important consideration is how \n     often the nodes must communicate to coordinate their work and \n     to share intermediate results. Some problems must be divided \n     into myraid minuscule tasks; because these fine-grained \n     problems require frequent internode communication, they are \n     not well suited for parallel processing. Coarse-grained \n     problems, in contrast, can be divided into relatively large \n     chunks. These problems do not require much communication \n     among the nodes and therefore can be solved very quickly by \n     parallel-processing systems.\n       Anyone building a Beowulf cluster must make several \n     decisions in designing the system. To connect the PCs, \n     researchers can use either standard Ethernet networks or \n     faster, specialized networks, such as Myrinet. Our lack of a \n     budget dictated that we use Ethernet, which is free. We chose \n     one PC to be the front-end node of the cluster and installed \n     two Ethernet cards into the machine. One card was for \n     communicating with outside users, and the other was for \n     talking with the rest of the nodes, which would be linked in \n     their own private network. The PCs coordinate their tasks by \n     sending messages to one another. The two most popular \n     message-passing libraries are message-passing interface (MPI) \n     and parallel virtual machine (PVM), which are both available \n     at no cost on the Internet. We use both systems in the Stone \n     SouperComputer.\n       Many Beowulf clusters are homogeneous, with all the PCs \n     containing identical components and microprocessors. This \n     uniformity simplifies the management and use of the cluster \n     but is not an absolute requirement. Our Stone SouperComputer \n     would have a mix of processor types and speeds because we \n     intended to use whatever surplus equipment we could find. We \n     began with PCs containing Intel 486 processors but later \n     added only Pentium-based machines with at least 32 megabytes \n     of hard-disk storage.\n       It was rare that machines met our minimum criteria on \n     arrival; usually we had to combine the best components from \n     several PCs. We set up the digital equivalent of an \n     automobile thief's chop shop for converting surplus computers \n     into nodes for our cluster. Whenever we opened a machine, we \n     felt the same anticipation that a child feels when opening a \n     birthday present: Would the computer have a big disk, lots of \n     memory or (best of all) an upgraded motherboard donated to us \n     by accident? Often all we found was a tired old veteran with \n     a fan choked with dust.\n       Our room at Oak Ridge turned into a morgue filled with the \n     picked-over carcasses of dead PCs. Once we opened a machine, \n     we recorded its contents on a ``toe tag'' to facilitate the \n     extraction of its parts later on. We developed favorite and \n     least favorite brands, models and cases and became adept at \n     thwarting passwords left by previous owners. On average, we \n     had to collect and process about five PCs to make one good \n     node.\n       As each new node joined the cluster, we loaded the Linux \n     operating system onto the machine. We soon figured out how to \n     eliminate the need to install a keyboard or monitor for each \n     node. We created mobile ``crash carts'' that could be wheeled \n     over and plugged into an ailing node to determine what was \n     wrong with it. Eventually someone who wanted space in our \n     room bought us shelves to consolidate our collection of \n     hardware. The Stone SouperComputer ran its first code in \n     early 1997, and by May 2001 it contained 133 nodes, including \n     75 PCs with Intel 486 microprocessors, 53 faster Pentium-\n     based machines and five still faster Alpha workstations, made \n     by Compaq.\n       Upgrades to the Stone SouperComputer are straightforward: \n     we replace the slowest nodes first. Each node runs a simple \n     speed test every hour as part of the cluster's routine \n     housekeeping tasks. The ranking of the nodes by speed helps \n     us to fine-tune our cluster. Unlike commercial machines, the \n     performance of the stone SouperComputer continually improves, \n     because we have an endless supply of free upgrades.\n\n\n                        parallel problem solving\n\n       Parallel programming requires skill and creativity and may \n     be more challenging than assembling the hardware of a Beowulf \n     system. The most common model for programming Beowulf \n     clusters is a master-slave arrangement. In this model, one \n     node acts as the master, directing the computations \n     performed by one or more tiers of slave nodes. We run the \n     same software on all the machines in the Stone \n     SouperComputer, with separate sections of code devoted to \n     the master and slave nodes. Each microprocessor in the \n     cluster executes only the appropriate section. Programming \n     errors can have dramatic effects, resulting in a digital \n     train wreck as the crash of one node derails the others. \n     Sorting through the wreckage to find the error can be \n     difficult.\n       Another challenge is balancing the processing workload \n     among the cluster's PCs. Because the Stone SouperComputer \n     contains a variety of microprocessors with very different \n     speeds, we cannot divide the workload evenly among the nodes: \n     if we did so, the faster machines would sit idle for long \n     periods as they waited for the slower machines to finish \n     processing. Instead we developed a programming algorithm that \n     allows the master node to send more data to the faster slave \n     nodes as they complete their tasks. In this load-balancing \n     arrangement, the faster PCs do most of the work, but the \n     slower machines still contribute to the system's performance.\n       Our first step in solving the ecoregion mapping problem was \n     to organize the enormous amount of data--the 25 environmental \n     characteristics of the 7.8 million cells of the continental \n     U.S. We created a 25-dimensional data space in which each \n     dimension represented one of the variables (average \n     temperature, precipitiation, soil characteristics and so on). \n     Then we identified each cell with the appropriate point in \n     the data space. Two points close to each other in this data \n     space have, by definition, similar characteristics and thus \n     are classified in the same ecoregion. Geographic proximity is \n     not a factor in this kind of classification; for example, if \n     two mountaintops have very similar environments, their points \n     in the data space are very close to each other, even if the \n     mountaintops are actually thousands of miles apart.\n       Once we organized the data, we had to specify the number of \n     ecoregions that would be shown on the national map. The \n     cluster of PCs gives each ecoregion an initial ``seed \n     position'' in the data space. For each of the 7.8 million \n     data points, the system determines the closest seed position \n     and assigns the point to the corresponding ecoregion. Then \n     the cluster finds the centroid for each ecoregion--the \n     average position of all the points assigned to the region. \n     This centroid replaces the seed position as the defining \n     point for the ecoregion. The cluster then repeats the \n     procedure, reassigning the data points to ecoregions \n     depending on their distances from the centroids. At the end \n     of each iteration, new centroid positions are calculated for \n     each ecoregion. The process continues until fewer than a \n     specified number of data points change their ecoregion \n     assignments. Then the classification is complete.\n       The mapping task is well suited for parallel processing \n     because different nodes in the cluster can work independently \n     on subsets of the 7.8 million data points. After each \n     iteration the slave nodes send the results of their \n     calculations to the master node, which averages the numbers \n     from all the subsets to determine the new centroid positions \n     for each ecoregion. The master node then sends this \n     information back to the slave nodes for the next round of \n     calculations. Parallel processing is also useful for \n     selecting the best seed positions for the ecoregions at the \n     very beginning of the procedure. We devised an algorithm that \n     allows the nodes in the Stone SouperComputer to determine \n     collectively the most widely dispersed data points, which are \n     then chosen as the seed positions. If the cluster starts with \n     well-dispersed seed positions, fewer iterations are needed to \n     map the ecoregions.\n       The result of all our work was a series of maps of the \n     continental U.S. showing each ecoregion in a different color. \n     We produced maps showing the country divided into as few as \n     four ecoregions and as many as 5,000. The maps with fewer \n     ecoregions divided the country into recognizable zones--for \n     example, the Rocky Mountain states and the desert Southwest. \n     In contrast, the maps with thousands of ecoregions are far \n     more complex than any previous classification of the \n     country's environments. Because many plants and animals live \n     in only one or two ecoregions, our maps may be useful to \n     ecologists who study endangered species.\n       In our first maps the colors of the ecoregions were \n     randomly assigned, but we later produced maps in which the \n     colors of\n\n[[Page S9106]]\n\n     the ecoregions reflect the similarly of their respective \n     environments. We statistically combined nine of the \n     environmental variables into three composite characteristics, \n     which we represented on the map with varying levels of red, \n     green and blue. When the map is drawn this way, it shows \n     graduations of color instead of sharp borders: the lush \n     Southeast is mostly green, the cold Northeast is mainly blue, \n     and the arid West is primarily red.\n       Moreover, the Stone SouperComputer was able to show how the \n     ecoregions in the U.S. would shift if there were nationwide \n     changes in environmental conditions as a result of global \n     warming. Using two projected climate scenarios developed by \n     other research groups, we compared the current ecoregion map \n     with the maps predicted for the year 2099. According to these \n     projections, by the end of this century the environment in \n     Pittsburgh will be more like that of present-day Atlanta, and \n     conditions in Minneapolis will resemble those in present-day \n     St. Louis. [see Stone SouperComputer's Global Warming \n     Forecast]\n\n\n                         the future of clusters\n\n       The traditional measure of supercomputer performance is \n     benchmark speed: how fast the system runs a standard program. \n     As scientists, however, we prefer to focus on how well the \n     system can handle practical applications. To evaluate the \n     Stone SouperComputer, we fed the same ecoregion mapping \n     problem to ORNL's Intel Paragon supercomputer shortly before \n     it was retired. At one time, this machine was the \n     laboratory's fastest, with a peak performance of 150 \n     gigaflops. On a per-processor basis, the run time on the \n     Paragon was essentially the same as that on the Stone Souper- \n     Computer. We have never officially clocked our cluster (we \n     are loath to steal computing cycles from real work), but the \n     system has a theoretical peak performance of about 1.2 \n     gigaflops. Ingenuity in parallel algorithm design is more \n     important than raw speed or capacity: in this young science, \n     David and Goliath (or Beowulf and Grendel!) still compete on \n     a level playing field.\n       The Beowulf trend has accelerated since we built the Stone \n     SouperComputer. New clusters with exotic names--Grendel, \n     Naegling, Megalon, Brahma, Avalon, Medusa and the Hive, to \n     mention just a few--have steadily raised the performance \n     curve by delivering higher speeds at lower costs. As of last \n     November, 28 clusters of PCs, workstations or servers were on \n     the list of the world's 500 fastest computers. The LosLobos \n     cluster at the University of New Mexico has 512 Intel Pentium \n     III processors and is the 80th-fastest system in the world, \n     with a performance of 237 gigaflops. The Cplant cluster at \n     Sandia National Laboratories has 580 Compaq Alpha processors \n     and is ranked 84th. The National Science Foundation and the \n     U.S. Department of Energy are planning to build even more \n     advanced clusters that could operate in the teraflops range \n     (one trillion floating-point operations per second), rivaling \n     the speed of the fastest supercomputers on the planet.\n       Beowulf systems are also muscling their way into the \n     corporate world. Major computer vendors are now selling \n     clusters to businesses with large computational needs. IBM, \n     for instance, is building a cluster of 1,250 servers for \n     NuTec Sciences, a biotechnology firm that plans to use the \n     system to identify disease-causing genes. An equally \n     important trend is the development of networks of PCs that \n     contribute their processing power to a collective task. An \n     example is SETI@home, a project launched by researchers at \n     the University of California at Berkeley who are analyzing \n     deep-space radio signals for signs of intelligent life. \n     SETI@home sends chunks of data over the Internet to more than \n     three million PCs, which process the radio-signal data in \n     their idle time. Some experts in the computer industry \n     predict that researchers will eventually be able to tap into \n     a ``computational grid'' that will work like a power grid: \n     users will be able to obtain processing power just as easily \n     as they now get electricity.\n       Above all, the Beowulf concept is an empowering force. It \n     wrests high-level computing away from the privileged few and \n     makes low-cost parallel-processing systems available to those \n     with modest resources. Research groups, high schools, \n     colleges or small businesses can build or buy their own \n     Beowulf clusters, realizing the promise of a supercomputer in \n     every basement. Should you decide to join the parallel-\n     processing proletariat, please contact us through our Web \n     site (http://extremelinux.esd.ornl.gov/) and tell us about \n     your Beowulf-building experiences. We have found the Stone \n     Soup to be hearty indeed.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, let me make one thing clear. Those of \nus who are concerned about certain provisions of this legislation are \nnot denying anyone the right to export. Those of us who have concerns \nabout the direction in which we are going are not advocating that we in \nany way lessen the overall quantity of our exports in this country. The \nSenator from Utah very effectively constructed an elaborate straw man \nand has now beaten him to pieces.\n  We cannot take ourselves out of the world market. We cannot allow our \nexporters, the people who are producing high technology in this \ncountry, to be frozen out of the market and become insular. No one is \nadvocating that. That is not the case now, and that would not be the \ncase of every amendment we thought would be a good one and which \npassed.\n  The people who are advocating this legislation tell us--I am not sure \nthese figures are precisely accurate--that something like 98 percent of \nall of these export applications are approved. It is not as if we are \nholding up anything, except in rare circumstances where there are \nnational security considerations. The problem is not that our exporters \nare being frozen out of the market or that in some way they are victims \nof 19th century thinking; it is that they don't want to have to wait a \nfew days to get a license.\n  We are not saying we need to shut down computer exports or even \nsupercomputer exports. We are just saying that before they go out the \ndoor, somebody ought to take a look at it and make sure it is a good \nidea in terms of the nature of the equipment that is being sent, in \nterms of the end user, or in terms of the potential use of the entity \nto which it is being shipped.\n  This is not a matter of export versus nonexport or export opposition. \nAs I say, the overwhelming number of applications have been approved, \nor will be approved, under any circumstance. The question is, Does the \nDepartment of Commerce predetermine broad categories of things that \nmight prove to be dangerous without even going through a licensing \nprocess where somebody can take a look at it? That is what this is all \nabout.\n  We heard yesterday in broad categories of items that I think the \naverage time it took before the approval was made was 13 days. I have \nread otherwise where there are categories of items that required 40 \ndays for the process to go through. I am sure the exporters would \nrather not wait 24 hours. But we are talking about matters of national \nsecurity.\n  Why do we even have an export law? If in fact everything is out the \ndoor, the genie is totally out of the bottle, and we don't even need \nlicenses for anything to anybody, why do we still restrict exports to \nIraq? Why do we still restrict exports to Iran and Libya and North \nKorea? Wouldn't that be the logical conclusion of the position that \neverything is out there now and no one can restrict anything?\n  Our policy has been, and still is, and will be I think implicit based \non the supposition and the assumption that in some ways, for some \nthings, to some end users, we should and we must and we can exercise \nsome degree of control. The question is, Where do you draw the line? \nYou don't do it foolishly. You don't try to control things that are \nuncontrollable. You don't try to control things to your friends the way \nyou would someone who is a potential enemy. But surely we are not \nsaying that there is no degree of control, and no degree of \nsupervision, where we ought to have somebody in our Government take a \nlook at it for national security purposes. Otherwise, why have any \nrestrictions to Saddam Hussein if he can go next door and get the same \nthing from somebody else? The answer is because we know that is not \ntrue. What this is all about is we have some exporters who are in \nbusiness and who need to be in business. We are all for them. They \ndon't want to have to go through a licensing process. That is what this \nis all about.\n  I think it is true that the key to our success in the future is not \ngoing to be totally reliant on some kind of export control. The more \nimportant part is going to be our ability, as they say in the business, \nto run faster. We must keep our technology at a level that outstrips \nall the rest. We should stay ahead. In order to do that, we need \nvibrant industries. I agree with all of that. But it doesn't totally \nanswer the question. The rest of the question is whether or not we are \ndoing what we need to do to help others run faster in significant ways.\n  Pick a country of concern--a country that is on the upswing \neconomically, a country that is rapidly building up their military, a \ncountry that has already been known to use our technology for its \nmilitary purposes. Is it wise policy to have no consideration for how \nrapidly they may be able to use our technology for their purposes? I am\n\n[[Page S9107]]\n\nnot saying that is an easy question. Do you slow them down by an hour \nor do you slow them down by a year?\n  Those are important answers that I don't have. It would depend on the \ncircumstances that would hopefully be considered by our Government when \na license is on the table and people are sitting around the table \nasking, Is this a good idea or not?\n  Under this bill, if they are foreign available as determined by a \ntechnician over in the Department of Commerce, or if they are mass-\nmarketed under the same determination, you don't have to go through \nthat process; I don't have to wait for 13 days, or the 40 days, or in \nsome cases longer, I am sure, but an average of numbers that we have \nused here. That is the question.\n  It is true that nowadays you can cluster computers to boost the MTOPS \npower. I, for one, have changed my view somewhat about the efficacy of \nregulating, controlling computers based on MTOPS. The GAO report also \nsaid there are possible other ways of controlling computing power that \nmight be questionable, that have never been explored, and that have \nnever been tried. And goodness knows, there is no one outside of \nGovernment who has any motivation to explore or try those other \nmethods.\n\n  They also demonstrated that while you can cluster computers to reach \nhigh MTOPS levels, those clustered computers cannot be used in the same \nway that another, shall we say, unclustered computer could be used with \nthe same MTOPS level. If you want to use a clustered computer situation \nfor research, or something like that, it is perfectly suitable. If you \nwant to use it for military purposes, it is much more questionable.\n  So these are complex issues that have complex answers. And I don't \nthink anybody has all the answers. But we do know that technology is \nexpanding, it is more accessible. That is not the issue; everyone \nunderstands that. But I hope everything we are doing--and the purpose \nof this legislation; it is in the bill --is premised on the notion that \nwe can, by legislation, do something to assist in curbing the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. That is what this is all \nabout. If we do not believe we can do that, if technology is such and \nthe world has changed as such that we can have no control over anything \nat any time for any period of appreciable time, then we might as well \ndo away with the legislation altogether.\n  Our legislation, our policy, is premised on the contrary. So it is \nnot black and white. It is: Where is the balance? And who decides? That \nis the issue. Where is the balance between, we can't do anything, so \nlet's eat, drink, and be happy, and make our money while we are arming \nour adversaries, or that we need to build a wall around the country and \nnot give anything out? Where is the balance? And who decides?\n  Well, we have decided, so far, in this country that the people whose \nbusiness it is to promote commerce essentially decide. In some ways, in \nsome instances, they have to get the approval of or consult with \nothers, but in many important respects we have decided--I think \nmistakenly in this legislation and as a matter of policy--that the \nDepartment of Commerce makes these important national security \ndecisions.\n  Now we are going to be deciding, when we pass this bill, that the \nDepartment of Commerce will not even get to take a look at things that \nhave been deemed to be mass marketed or foreign available. So be it. \nBut let's not fool ourselves into thinking that this is an all-or-\nnothing situation or that someone is suggesting that we not export \ncomputers or that we isolate ourselves in that regard or that we blind \nourselves to the technology revolution. That is not the case at all. We \nare just trying to reach some kind of a reasonable, measured way in \nwhich we can do what is doable.\n  My basic problem with all this is that we do not know to what extent \nwe may be making a mistake. We do not know to what extent some of this \nis controllable, as the GAO has pointed out. The GAO listed in its \nreport, I think, about a dozen potential ways supercomputers can be \nlimited in ways that other people did not have them and also pointed \nout that they have not been tried, they have not been attempted.\n  Our law required, in the 1998 Defense authorization bill, that there \nbe a national security assessment, as we were in the process of totally \ndecontrolling computers. I would not cite the Clinton administration as \nhaving good policy in that regard, but I must confess, this \nadministration is picking up where the Clinton administration left off \nin that respect. The law required that we have a national security \nassessment. It has never been done.\n  So I have one opinion and my colleagues--a clear majority of them--\nhave another opinion about the effect of what we are doing with this \nlegislation, but the fact of the matter is, nobody knows. And that \nconcerns me. It concerns me greatly because it is going to be some time \nnow before we know the effect of this. We should have been studying \nthis issue. We should have had a blue ribbon commission. We should have \nhad a group of objective people who are unaffiliated with people who \nare in the export business--which is hard to come by on this subject, \nby the way--to make an objective assessment.\n  I am hoping before this debate is over with we can, at least after \nthe fact, move in that direction. I may be wrong about some of my \nconcerns, but I can afford to be wrong. As to those who say there is no \nproblem, we cannot afford for them to be wrong because that would mean \nmatters of national security would be implicated.\n  So I am hopeful we will be able to move in that direction, the \ndirection of really doing an objective assessment as to where this \nbalance is and to who ought to be making the decisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee for \nhis concern and his consideration and, again, for all of the effort he \nhas put into this bill. He has been responsible, along with several \nothers, for a number of the changes that have been made in this bill.\n  But there are a couple of things I need to emphasize based on the \ncomments he just made. One of them is in relation to the comment that \nthere should have been somebody studying the issue. There have been \npeople studying the issue. There have been a lot of people studying the \nissue, not to mention all of the Senate and House hearings that have \nbeen held, particularly since 1994.\n  When the Export Administration Act expired, we began a study. And one \nof the things this town is not short on is documentation. We document \neverything. That gives you a chance to go back and look at what \neverybody thought in the history of this country, but particularly on \nthe history of this issue. It was an opportunity to go back and see \nwhat kinds of problems there were and what the pitfalls were that kept \nthe reauthorization from happening again, what kept the updates from \nhappening. We have been very close, throughout this whole process, of \nhaving it happen again.\n  We talked about balance. One of the balance things that happens in \nthis bill is that the Department of Defense, the Department of State, \nand the intelligence community get a greater say through this bill than \nthey had under the Export Act of 1979, that got reapproved through \n1994. There is more balance in this bill if you want Defense, State, \nand intelligence to have more of a say. They have more say under this \nbill than they had before.\n  There is a continuation of a lot of the things they had before, but \nthat is because they all agreed on them. But what we have is an \nendorsement from State and Defense on this particular bill saying this \nis a better situation than what we are operating under now. So we are \ntrying to get that done.\n  In relation to the applications, actually, 99.4 percent of the \napplications get approved, only .6 percent get denied. So what does \nthat tell you? A thing that it does not exactly say is that on the 99.4 \npercent that get approved, a lot of those have conditions. What this \ncommittee gets to do is put conditions on the application. But there is \nstill a vast number that are readily approved.\n  Why are we making the licensing application folks take all of their \ntime on items that will be approved that are routinely, regularly \napproved at the present time? Without this bill, we are forcing them to \nconcentrate the bulk\n\n[[Page S9108]]\n\nof their effort--probably about 90 percent of their time--on items that \ndo not need to be considered, where all of these agencies say: This is \nan automatic for us, but there is no way for us to kick this automatic \nout of the process. We have to spend the bulk of our time working on \nthings that are absolutely routine. Wouldn't it be nice if we could \nconcentrate on the 10 percent of the things that really need some \nconditions, that really need some concentration, that perhaps need to \nbe denied?\n\n  During this process, I had an enforcement officer on exports assigned \nto my office because I wanted a greater understanding of how the \nenforcement process worked. That includes the postshipment \nverifications. I have had people assigned to my office who worked with \nthe applications, and we went to the different agencies to see how they \nparticipated, how they wanted to be able to participate, and whether \ntheir rights and abilities were being stomped on by the old process.\n  I think we have arrived at a bill that the agencies agree they have a \nsay and that they can do a better job of enforcing those things that \nneed to be enforced.\n  Senator Kyl mentioned there were some arms control problems, probably \na nuclear gun. That sounds like arms control which is not export \ncontrol. Maybe somebody was trying to fudge it in there.\n  I have to mention that there is a very small provision in this bill--\nactually a big provision--where we provide additional resources to \npeople doing the enforcement. One of the specific things we put in \nthere is some training for freight forwarders. These are the people who \nlook at those 30-foot long cylinders and say: What the heck is in here; \ncould it be something damaging to the United States? That is going to \nbe some enforcement that we haven't had before that will help solve the \nsituation.\n  When we are talking about who ought to be looking at these things, we \nare assuming that we ought to be looking at them from the worst \npossible standpoint. That is probably true. So maybe what we ought to \nhave is the IRS auditors checking the capability on all of these \nlicenses.\n  The reason Commerce gets the main say in this situation is that we \nare talking about commerce. We are talking about the economy and what \nwe export. The Department of Defense and the Department of State handle \nthe arms export. That is the really dangerous stuff. There is some \nstuff that can be dangerous. There is always a secondary use for \nanything. You can pick up a brick and you can hit somebody over the \nhead. That makes it a weapon. But it is primarily a brick.\n  The factory that designed that brick probably used a computer to \ndesign the factory, but that doesn't make them an arms designer. That \nmakes them a computer designing brick factory.\n  One of the reasons that Commerce has the main control is that it is \ncommerce, and it is kind of the old story: If all you have is a hammer, \neverything looks like a nail. If you give it to Defense, then it all \nlooks like weapons. Commerce gets to have a say in this, but with this \nbill we give greater authority to Defense, State, and the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  We are not just talking about computers in this legislation. We are \ntalking about a lot of small companies in this country that could \ncompete more effectively if they could get contracts more readily. \nDuring that process of getting the 99.4 percent licensure, people lose \ncontracts or they are not asked to participate in a bigger contract at \nall. From Wyoming, I have some of those folks.\n  There is an outfit called Hi Q technology. They make tachometers. I \nlove this little success story. This guy used to have the parts \nmanufactured in Taiwan and the parts assembled in Taiwan. He said: Wait \na minute. Wyoming has some great folks who could put these things \ntogether. I bet they could put them together more carefully, make a \nbetter machine that would have less errors than the Taiwanese. So he \nstarted to have the parts shipped back to the United States and made in \nPowell, WY. He now makes the best tachometers in the world and ships \nthem around the world in competition with Taiwan.\n\n  Do you know what he is going to do next? He is going to start having \nthe parts manufactured in Powell, WY, too, because he can do that \nbetter with American labor. He can compete on the world market.\n  Now he can't, if every tachometer has to go through this licensing \nprocess. You can buy tachometers all over the world. You can't buy as \ngood a quality tachometer as he has, but you can buy them anywhere in \nthe world. They would like to have his, and he would like to sell them. \nIf this licensing process stops him, he can't do that.\n  We have a another fellow in Cody, WY, who invented a chest seal. If \nyou get your chest punctured, if you get shot, fall on rebar or \nsomething like that, your lung will collapse unless somebody puts, in \nthe old method, a credit card over it, which allows you, when you \ninhale, to inflate your lungs. Then they take it off when you exhale \nand it allows the blood and other stuff to come out. A Navy SEAL who \nnow lives in Cody, WY, thought he could improve on that system.\n  He came up with a chest seal that is a Band-Aid about that big. You \nwipe off the chest and you apply the Band-Aid. The secret is right in \nthe middle of it there is a thing that looks like the end of a balloon. \nWhen you breathe in, it pinches shut. When you breathe out, everything \ncomes out. That is in military kits around the world now. It has saved \na lot of lives on farms, ranches, and a lot of other places.\n  Sun screens and planes: There is a guy in Wyoming who figured out if \nthese things work in cars, maybe they would work in planes. And he \nstarted putting them in planes, specialized for the windows and stuff. \nDuring Desert Storm, one of our big problems was a recognition that \ninstruments in Saudi Arabia in the planes were being damaged by the \nintense heat. Somebody said: Wait a minute, I know this guy in Wyoming. \nHe makes this simple stuff that goes inside planes and keeps all of the \ninstruments from deteriorating. And it saves about $16,000 a year per \nairplane. It is used militarily, but it is not a military piece of \nequipment. It can be duplicated other places in the world. He kind of \nhas the corner on the market, like Kleenex, because he thought of it \nand he does it better.\n  If he is prohibited from selling this, except to the military of the \nUnited States, he can't be in business or he would have to sell it for \na lot more.\n  Another guy, in Sheridan, WY, a guy who has the Big Horn Valve \nCompany, found a new way to do valves so that you don't have to have a \nT that will leak. It is always internal. The valve twists half a turn \nand shuts off. Any area in between gives some capability. How is it \nused? NASA uses part of this now. It is a disconnect on a missile. They \ncan keep the fuel going into the missile the last possible moment. When \nthat missile takes off, the valve separates and closes. Refineries use \nit because it doesn't leak like the old-fashioned valves.\n  Again, if he has to go through this licensing process, he can lose \nhis international opportunity.\n  The times are changing, and I have to say, it is the young people who \nare changing it. Eight years ago my son was at South Dakota School of \nMines. He played a little basketball there. And after the basketball \ngame, I went back to his dorm to pick something up. By the time we had \ndriven halfway across South Dakota to get back to his dorm, it was \nabout 3 in the morning. We went into the dorm; the lights were on \neverywhere. There were kids, young engineers, taking computers apart. \nThey were borrowing pieces of computers from each other, and they were \nmaking supercomputers. That was 8 years ago.\n  I have no idea what they are up to now, but I did read that these \ncomputers' best activity is math. The first thing they will do, because \nit is the best activity, is solve math problems. One of the new \nInternet problems this last week was people feeding math problems into \nthe system and all of the computers concentrated on that. And the \nmessages would not go through.\n  It is technology. We have to keep the technology going. I apologize \nfor running over here in my excitement of being able to share a few \nWyoming examples with everybody. I did that. I did want to emphasize \nwhy it is important that we streamline the licensing process, not to \nthe point where it hurts our national security but where we can include \nsome things that will enhance the national security by allowing some \nconcentration.\n\n[[Page S9109]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/05/senate-section/article/S9109-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to discuss the most recent situation \nin Northern Ireland. All too often, I usually speak on the floor of the \nSenate about this issue after a bombing or bloody conflict between \nRepublicans and Unionists. This time, however, I wish to address a \nsituation that really has the potential to scar Northern Ireland more \nthan any single bullet.\n  We have seen in our own country schoolchildren returning to classes \nthis week. In Northern Ireland, schoolchildren are returning also. But, \nunfortunately, the week has been horrific for students at the Holy \nCross Girls Primary School in Belfast. The students and their parents \nhave faced a gauntlet of protesters on their way to school, many of \nwhom pelted the girls with stones and spit at them.\n  Earlier today, a bomb went off addressed toward the schoolchildren. \nWhen I turn on the television and see pictures of these little girls, 6 \nand 7, 8 years old, crying in terror, being shielded by their mothers--\nwhat is their crime and sin? They are going to school. If there is ever \nanything that can help that troubled part of the world, it would be to \nimprove the education of the young people and then allow them to go on \nto get jobs.\n  According to the press reports, the girls who attend this Catholic \nschool have walked peacefully to and from their classes through a \npredominantly Protestant neighborhood for 30 years. Tragically, these \nchildren have been targeted to escalate already high tensions between \nUnionists and Republicans.\n  After more than three decades of violence in Northern Ireland \ncommitted by parties on both sides of the issue--and both sides are \ncertainly responsible for violence--we sometimes become a bit callous \nabout events in this conflict. But this latest situation of targeting \nchildren is truly reprehensible because it threatens to scar these \nchildren permanently.\n  The tragic situation at Holy Cross School has the potential to \nundermine any peace agreement that may be reached in the future. \nNegotiations will continue this month on resuming the Northern Ireland \nassembly and further implementation of the Good Friday peace agreement. \nThese efforts will be for naught if the children of Belfast, whether \nthey are Catholic or Protestant, grow up in an environment where they \nthink hatred and division are a way of life.\n  Let me take a moment to say, as I have in the past, that I have \ncalled upon Republicans and Unionists to abide by the Good Friday \nagreement. For those of us who have been involved in Northern Ireland \nover the years, we know that the hatred runs deep and the solutions are \ngoing to be complex. That is why I proudly support the U.S. commitment \nto the International Fund for Ireland. The Fund has promoted economic \ndevelopment in Northern Ireland across factional lines. I have \nsupported it because the projects sponsored by IFI have been projects \nwhere Protestants and Catholics work side by side.\n  The situation at Holy Cross School is dangerous because it threatens \nto remove the most important characteristic that the Irish are blessed \nwith, and that is hope.\n  I condemn efforts by people who are trying to take that hope away \nfrom these children and instill them with fear and hatred. That will \nsimply perpetuate this conflict for years to come.\n  I recall going to Northern Ireland on President Clinton's last visit \nthere. I had a police officer assigned to me in Belfast. He said to me: \n``Your President is a great man.'' I asked him why he said that. He \nsaid that before President Clinton came to Northern Ireland, the \nofficer could not speak to somebody of the other faith. He told me \nwhich faith he belonged to but that is irrelevant since this was a \nstatement that could have been made by either a Protestant or a \nCatholic.\n  He said: ``Prior to that visit, I could not speak to someone of the \nother faith, but now I can work with them, I can be friends with \nthem.'' He added: ``The greatness of what your President has done and \nwhat the involvement of your country has been is that I no longer have \nto teach my children to hate.''\n  Think of that. He was saying that prior to these efforts at a peace \nagreement, prior to the involvement of the United States and people \nsuch as Senator Mitchell and others, he felt that it was his duty to \nteach his children to hate. Unfortunately, this could have been heard \non either side, but now he said he no longer had to do that.\n  I want to think that is the feeling of most people in Northern \nIreland, Protestant or Catholic. But I despair when I see the pictures \nof these little children going to school. These girls are 6, 7, and 8 \nyears old. Look at the terror in their faces. They are wondering what \nis going on.\n  Frankly, it brings back chilling memories of when I was in my teens \nand seeing the pictures in parts of our country where terrified \nAfrican-American schoolchildren were being escorted to school by \nmarshals. Here are Irish children being escorted to school by the \nsecurity forces.\n  There will not be peace in Northern Ireland, there will not be a \npromise for Northern Ireland until this sort of thing stops.\n  I commend the authorities who are protecting these children and \npursing the persons who threw the bomb. We can use law enforcement to \nstop the violence in the short term. In the long term people must look \ninto their own souls and practice the religious principles that they \nespouse. They must practice these principles not only for themselves \nbut for those who may not carry the same religion.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we are waiting for some things to \nhappen right now, I am very distressed about some of the things we are \nhearing about a concerted effort to stop our missile defense language \nwe have proposed for this year that the President has been very \noutspoken on, a recognition that we are in a very threatened position.\n  I think it is kind of a shock to many American people when they find \nout, and I say find out, not hear but find out, that we are in the most \nthreatened position we have been in as a nation perhaps in the history \nof this country.\n  I can remember saying this back in 1995, and finally we had the \nDirector of Central Intelligence about 2 years ago say that, in fact, \nwe are in the most threatened position we have been in as a nation.\n  There is a current movie that people have gone to. I happened to see \nit on an airplane the other day. It is called ``Thirteen Days.'' It is \na story about the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, and some of us are old \nenough to remember the hysteria that hit the streets in the United \nStates. People were going to the supermarkets and stocking up on \nthings. They were digging storm shelters and telling their friends: Do \nnot come to our house because we are digging a storm shelter. It was \npanic, and it was panic because they woke up one morning and found out \nthere were Soviet missiles on the island of Cuba aimed at American \ncities, and that we\n\n[[Page S9110]]\n\nhad no defense against those incoming missiles.\n  Those were medium-range missiles that could have hit any American \ncity in the continental America other than Seattle. So it is \nunderstandable people were panicked about it.\n  Yet if you saw this movie, one of the alternatives was to take 20 \nminutes and go down and wipe out the island of Cuba. That was one \nalternative, and that is why we say and I say that the threat facing \nAmerica is greater today than it was then, because of those missiles \nthat are currently targeting American cities. And this is not something \nthat is up for debate, it is not something that anyone is going to \nchallenge, because it was classified material until one of the \nnewspapers was able to get some information here about 2 years ago, \nand, yes, at that time they said at least 18 American cities were \ntargeted by missiles from China.\n\n  It goes without saying and everybody knows that virtually every \ncountry has weapons of mass destruction, either biological, chemical, \nor nuclear. The thing they do not have, at least up until recently, is \na missile to deliver those weapons. Now it is a different story. We \nknow for a fact that North Korea, Russia, and China have missiles that \nwill reach the United States of America.\n  Let me be real specific. If the Chinese were to deploy a missile from \nsomewhere around Beijing, it would take 35 minutes to get here, and \nduring that 35 minutes we have absolutely nothing in our arsenal to \nknock down that missile, zero. We are naked. It is hard to explain the \ndevastation that can take place by an incoming nuclear missile.\n  I come from the State of Oklahoma. In Oklahoma, we had the most \ndevastating domestic terrorist attack in the history of this country. \nThat was when the Murrah Federal Office Building explosion occurred. \nThat was devastating, and 168 people lost their lives. I was there just \na few minutes after it happened, and I can remember the parts of the \nbodies that were stuck to the walls of the building that was still \nsmoking. It was still insecure when all of these firemen who had \nvolunteered came all the way from as far away as Maryland to help to \ntry to go in and secure the building, to try to find the bodies. Many \nbodies were never found.\n  That was a terrible explosion, and yet the smallest nuclear warhead \nknown to man is 1,000 times that explosive power. So think about what \nthat could do relative to the disaster that took place in Oklahoma a \nfew years ago.\n  Now we are faced with this threat. I would like to think that is the \nonly problem, but there are other problems. We are at one-half the \nforce strength of 1991. How many people know that? Is that debatable? I \nam talking one-half Army divisions, one-half tactical air wings, one-\nhalf of the ships--down from 600 to 300 ships. It is usually reassuring \nto people, thinking that although we are at one-half strength, we have \nthe best military personnel, we have the best of equipment, the most \nmodern equipment. That is not true anymore.\n  We had a hearing the other day before all the Chiefs. There was a \nfriend of mine in the audience named Charles Sublett, a hero in \nVietnam, flying F-4s and F-100s while the Navy was flying A-6s and A-\n4s. I identified him as a hero. He stood up. I said: Let me ask you \nthis question--and a lot of people differ as to the war in Vietnam; \nthere is a difference of opinion Americans have--was it true every \npiece of equipment you had was better than that which any potential \nadversary had? He said: Absolutely.\n  Today that is not true. The best air-to-air missile we have is the F-\n14. It is not as good as the SU-27 now manufactured on the open market \nand bought by the Russians and Chinese, and the best we have for air-\nto-ground capability is the F-16 and still their SU-30 is better.\n  I asked the same question of the generals testifying. They said that \nis true in terms of the range and the maneuverability. Our pilots are \nbetter, but the equipment is not as good. The same is true with \nartillery capability. The Paladin is outgunned in terms of range and \nfire by almost everything our potential adversaries have. It is not \njust that we do not have a missile defense in this country when the \nthreat is every bit as real as 1962 when everybody panicked. We have a \nreal job in trying to do an adequate job defending this country with \nthe defense authorization bill that will be forthcoming.\n  Tonight we have our first meeting. We had subcommittee meetings \ntoday, and tonight we have our first meeting. I hope this does not end \nup being a partisan bill. People recognize defending America has to be \nthe No. 1 priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/05/senate-section/article/S9110-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9110-S9117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              EXPORT ADMINISTRATION ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on the bill before the Senate, it is my \nunderstanding some people are trying to work out an agreement, but I \nrise in opposition to the Export Administration Act. A lot of people \nstate the purpose of this bill is to protect the national security. We \nare kidding ourselves. The real objective of those who wrote this bill \nand who actively support it is to promote trade and transfers of the \nvery dual-use high technologies which, in the wrong hands, pose a \nserious threat to national security. Their emphasis is such liberalized \ntrade will be good for the economy, but we have to ask: At what price?\n  This debate does not occur in a vacuum. We have the record of the \nlast 8 years when we had an administration which deliberately ignored \nand undermined our Nation's cold war system of export controls designed \nto protect national security. Their attitude was that the cold war was \nover so there was no real threat out there. Why worry about technology \ntransfers? Why worry about rogue state missile systems and weapons \nprograms? This flies in the face of everything that is logical.\n  We have had very serious problems in hearing things taking place in \nChina. During the elections in Taiwan when there was a notion we might \ngo in there and try to intervene, they were trying to intimidate the \nelections by firing missiles in the Taiwan Straits. Later on the second \nhighest ranking Chinese military officer said: We are not concerned \nabout America coming to the aid of Taipei because they would rather \ndefend Los Angeles.\n  Then we had the Defense Minister of China saying, war with America is \ninevitable, which he has repeated 3 times, once in the last 8 months. \nWe have a serious problem out there and we have to recognize that.\n  My fear is a lot of this technology is going to go to countries such \nas China, and specifically China.\n  I will review the actions of the Clinton administration. The first \nthing they did in 1994, shortly after taking office, they ended COCOM, \nthe Coordinating Committee on Multinational Export Controls. This was \nput together so we and our allies could all agree not to export high \ntechnology that could get in the hands of the wrong people. That system \nwas set in place, and in 1994 the administration ended that.\n  The administration, shortly after that in 1996, took control of the \nauthority on export licenses out of the hands of the State Department \nand put it in the Commerce Department. Later they recognized it was \nwrong, the public recognized it, and after the Cox report they moved it \nback to the State Department.\n  The granting of waivers for missile defense technologies--we all \nremember the significant problem we had when the administration signed \na waiver to allow China to have the guidance technology produced by the \nLoral Corporation, owned by the Hughes Corporation, that allow the \nChinese to have the guided-missile technology that gave them more \ncontrol over where the missiles might go, even if one might be coming \ntoward the United States. They allowed transfer of high-performance \ncomputers, which ended up helping improve Chinese military systems.\n  The theft of our nuclear secrets, at that time we had 16 nuclear \ncompromises. Eight were before the last administration; eight were \nduring the Clinton administration. We discovered that of the eight \nbefore the Clinton administration, one went back as far as the Carter \nadministration, which was discovered by this country when a walk-in \ninformant came to a CIA office with the documentation that China had \nthat information from those other compromises from the previous \nadministration. Yet it was covered up until the Cox report came out 4 \nyears later and we realized China had virtually everything.\n\n[[Page S9111]]\n\n  The main thing that concerns me is we have a threat out there today. \nWe have been guilty of allowing our nuclear secrets to get into the \nhands of the wrong people. Until this is under control, I think it \nwould be premature, in my opinion, to pass, to implement those changes \nrecommended in the Export Administration Act under consideration today.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been here now since 2:15. Senator \nLeahy spoke in morning business about Northern Ireland, which was very \nlucid and understandable. I appreciate his remarks. We had the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, talk for 5 minutes or so about this bill \ndirectly and indirectly. We have a few people who oppose this \nlegislation, but they literally are holding up not only what is going \non in the Senate but what we need to do for this country.\n  We have eight appropriations bills that need to be passed. We could \nbe working on those. We have the education bill and some things we \nstill need to finalize. We have conference reports. We have lots of \nthings that need to be done. There is a hue and cry that we need to get \nto the Defense bill. We need to do Defense appropriations. We can't do \nthat until we do the Defense authorization bill.\n  I hope everyone understands that one of the alternatives available on \nthis bill and any other bill is we can move to third reading. We could \ndo that right now. We, of course, will not do that. I will confer with \nSenator Sarbanes. I hope Senator Enzi, who has been managing this bill \nfor the last 2 days, will confer with the ranking member of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Gramm, to see if we can get permission to do that. \nWe really want to move forward on this.\n  I see the chairman of the committee here who has worked so diligently \non this bill. I say to my friend from Maryland that we are getting \nrequests now for morning business that are totally unrelated to this \nlegislation. We have been here all this afternoon. We had some very \ngood statements this morning on the bill. It is important that Members \nhave an opportunity to speak on the bill. Here we are, doing nothing, \nwith so many things left to do.\n  I say to my friend from Maryland who is so ably managing this bill \nthat I think we should be arriving at a point soon, if Members aren't \nwilling to come over and talk about what they want or are not willing \nto offer amendments, we move to third reading. Certainly there is \nnothing in the order that would prevent that. Senator Daschle said he \nwould not move to cloture under the agreement with Senator Thompson, \nand he will stick to that. But that doesn't mean we do nothing all day \nWednesday, Thursday, and Friday.\n  I know the Senator from Maryland is trying to work out a compromise. \nAll I am saying is that I hope before we have an afternoon of morning \nbusiness we decide whether or not we are going to be able to complete \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, first of all, I don't think we should go \nto morning business. I think we should stay on the bill even if there \nis a period of time when we are in a quorum call.\n  Second, I say to my colleagues who are listening that if anyone has \nany statement they want to make, they had better get over and do it \nbecause we are working on an amendment which is sort of being cleared \ndowntown. If we can get clearance on that and an accommodation, I hope \nwe can then adopt that amendment, probably have some colloquy, do a \nmanagers' amendment, and go to the third reading of the bill and finish \nthis bill. That would be our objective.\n\n  So if we start moving that way, and people who have not been around \nand have not been engaged in the process then want to make a statement, \nor maybe all of a sudden appear from somewhere and offer an amendment, \nwe are going to say: Where have you been? We have been biding our time \nand waiting and wanting to move ahead, and so forth and so on, and you \nwere not here.\n  But at the moment we need to get the clearance on this amendment we \nare working on. We think that is in the works. That is the best I can \nsay to the majority whip on that score.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I concur in the admonition of the chairman \nand the manager on the Republican side that Members who have something \nto say should come down and speak because as we speak there are some \ndiscussions going on about some possible amendments that would move us \nmuch closer toward a time when the bill could be completed. In fact, \nsome of us are meeting at 3:30 to try to resolve some issues that are \npending right now. So I join in the comment made that people who wish \nto speak to the bill should do so as soon as possible.\n  I will take this opportunity to highlight some of the issues, a \ncouple of which might be the subject of a potential agreement that \nwould be added to the bill and that might help to move it along to \ncompletion.\n  As I said in my other remarks, there are some concerns about the way \ncurrent agreements have been enforced or have not been enforced with \nrespect to dual-technology items that have been sent to these \ncountries. There is a provision in the bill that enables the United \nStates to come down hard on a company which receives an item that is \nsupposed to be used for commercial purposes--for research or university \npurposes, something such as that--and then in turn transfers that item \nto some kind of defense program that is unauthorized in the license.\n  Just to use a purely hypothetical example, I said there might be some \nnuclear generation facility component which is sent to help build a \nnuclear generating plant, but the end user, instead of being that \ncommercial reactor facility, sends it over to some defense plant, which \nthen uses it in their nuclear program for weaponry. That would be a \ngood example of an improper application of one of these dual-use items \nwhere the license had been granted for shipment for one purpose but it \nturns out to have been used for another.\n\n  We have a postshipment verification requirement ordinarily. That \nmeans we have somebody who goes over and makes sure the item was used \nin the way and in the place they said it was going to be used. The \nproblem is, in the past we have found those postverification shipment \nprocedures are not followed all the time. Indeed, a lot of the time \nthey are not followed, and there is not much the United States can do \nabout it.\n  I quoted the statistics earlier today--I am not sure I have them \nhere--but the fact is, with respect to satellites, the United States \nhas an agreement with China that was entered into in 1998 that provides \nsome degree of postshipment verification that the satellite is being \nused where it is supposed to be used, and so on, but it turns out less \nthan a fourth of the required verifications have been permitted. They \nhave been delayed. There have been requests by the Chinese Government: \nLet us do the inspection rather than have you do it--this kind of \nthing.\n  Clearly, if we are going to have a liberalization of our export \ncontrol policy, and we are going to be granting more licenses to permit \nthe shipment of dual-technology items which could be put to military \nuse, and we are willing to say, look, if you will put it to commercial \nuse, OK, but we don't want you to put it to military use, and we want \nto have somebody check that after the fact to make sure that is \ncorrect, if we are going to do that procedure, we have to make sure it \nworks, and there has to be some penalty for those who violate it.\n  The bill has a penalty if it is a company that violates the \nprocedure, but there is no provision to deal with a country that \nviolates it. So one of the proposals that is under active consideration \nright now as a possible amendment that could be agreed to would make a \nminor change, but it would have a major effect.\n  In reference to the subsection on page 296 of the bill, the first \nseven lines in this case would read: If the country in which the end-\nuser is located refuses\n\n[[Page S9112]]\n\nto allow post-shipment verification of a controlled item, the \nSecretary--meaning the Secretary of Commerce--may deny a license for \nthe export of any other controlled item until such post-shipment \nverification is allowed.\n  It is very straightforward. It is not mandatory, so there is nothing \nthat makes the Secretary of Commerce do this. But at least the \nSecretary would have an ability to say to a country, such as China, for \nexample: Look, you have not allowed us to inspect the ultimate user of \nthe last three items we sent you, so we are not going to approve any \nmore licenses--at least of products A, B, and C--until you allow that. \nThat might be one way to help get this provision of postshipment \nverification enforced.\n  So that is one of the ideas we have. As I say, it is one that is \nbeing discussed right now. It is one on which possibly there could be \nsome agreement. We hope so. If so, I think that will advance the time \nthat we can get the bill resolved.\n  Another question has to do with this matter of a product that is \navailable in foreign markets. The concept of the proponents of the bill \nis if a product is available in a foreign market, then the cat is \nalready out of the bag; we might as well let American companies compete \nfor that business, too.\n  I raised a lot of questions this morning about how that really works. \nBut leaving that aside, at least one very modest addition which \ncertainly would help somewhat would be to ensure that not only are the \nitems comparable in the sense that if you can buy this particular kind \nof computer in country A, then why restrict American companies from \nselling the same kind of computer?--that what we would want to do is \nensure that we are talking about computers of comparable quality, not \njust that they are sold for roughly the same price, not just that they \nhave roughly the same capacity, but that they are truly of the same \nquality.\n\n  The reason for that is most people would like to buy American \nproducts because of their quality. It is not enough to say you can buy \na similar computer three other places in the world if you are not ready \nto establish that the computer you are talking about in those three \nother places is of comparable quality to the U.S. computer. It does not \nmatter if it has the same capacity and if it costs roughly the same; if \nit is not as good, if it does not have the same quality, then it would \nnot be a comparable item. We just want to make sure when we are talking \nabout foreign availability we really mean the same basic kind of \nproduct is available in those foreign countries.\n  To give you an illustration, you can buy two different cars that go \njust as fast. One goes just as fast as the other one. One has just as \nmuch acceleration as the other one. The air-conditioner is just as \ngood. And it costs about the same amount of money. But what you might \nfind if you read Consumer Reports is the first car will last you about \n20,000 miles and then it becomes a piece of junk, whereas the second \ncar has much better quality. It has a 50,000-mile warranty. It has a \ngreat service record. The company will always take care of it if there \nis something wrong, and so on.\n  That is just a hypothetical example. But I think if we are going to \nsay we are going to permit the export of items as long as they are \navailable anywhere else in the world, even though they are products we \nwould just as soon not fall into the hands of the wrong countries, if \nwe are going to go that way, we have to make sure we are at least \ntalking about goods that have comparable quality. I think the addition \nof some language in that regard would be very useful.\n  Another idea that has been discussed--and there are others who, \nfrankly, would be better able to discuss this than I because it has \nbeen their idea--is to have some kind of commission, a blue ribbon \ncommission that would evaluate the success of this new regime after it \nhas been put into place.\n  Nobody knows for sure how this is going to work. I think almost \neverybody would concede we are in unchartered territory, that the \nstakes are enormous, and that what we do not want to do is find out 5 \nyears down the road that something we put in place --locked into place \nin statutory form--is actually permitting the rogue countries of the \nworld to acquire a lot of equipment or technology that we would rather \nnot have fall into their hands simply because we were not careful \nenough in writing the legislation.\n\n  I don't think most of us are smart enough to predict that far in the \nfuture exactly how we want do all of this. The notion has been that it \nwould be good to have in place some kind of a blue ribbon commission \nwhich could be appointed in the not-too-distant future to examine how \nthis is working and to make recommendations to the President and to the \nCongress on how to make improvements in that. We can talk about the \ndetails of how the commission is appointed and when it reports and all \nthose kinds of things. This kind of idea is a good idea, and it would \nbe useful to have that incorporated into the legislation as well.\n  I believe there will be some kind of agreement on this. I think the \nparties are talking. Everybody recognizes the value, the utility of \nthat.\n  A fourth area I will mention is that in the past the Department of \nCommerce has added items and subtracted items to the so-called \ncontrolled commodity list. It has done so under its own rules and \nregulations which could in fact and maybe does involve some \nconsultation with other departments of government. It is a little \nunclear exactly how the process works. In the past, the Department of \nCommerce has been the department in charge. I believe the list is some \n2,400 items controlled right now.\n  Part of the theory of the legislation is that some of those items \nwould be taken off the controlled list so that a party wishing to \nexport them would not have to come to the U.S. Government and obtain a \nlicense for the export of that item. That is probably appropriate with \nrespect to many of these controlled items. Still we have to be careful \nthat we are not taking items off the list which could in fact be used \nby a hostile country against the interests of the United States.\n  Given the fact that the Department of Commerce has as its mission \ntrade promotion, it is not exactly evident that that department is in \nthe best position to judge whether or not an item should stay on the \nlist. Obviously, it at least ought to be talking to the intelligence \ncommunity, the Defense Department, the State Department, the Department \nof Energy, and so on. We want to have at least some recognition of the \nfact that as this is going to be administered in the future, the \nDepartment of Commerce will, to an extent appropriate, call upon the \nadvice and counsel of these other departments in seeking to make \ndeterminations with respect to what items are on that control list or \nnot.\n  It may be that this is a matter the administration needs to think \nabout and figure out how they want to handle. For my own part, I have, \nas I have said before, the utmost confidence in this administration and \nSecretary Don Evans and the other people who would be making the \ndecisions. As a matter of fact, my only beef with Don Evans, the \nSecretary of Commerce, is that he hired away my chief of staff when he \nwas confirmed. We have a great relationship. I have total confidence in \nhim and in the people in his department. I believe they will, in fact, \ncall upon the expertise of other people in government who may be in a \nbetter position to judge with respect to a particular item.\n  They will have a lot of cross pressures, too. They will have folks in \nindustry pushing them to decontrol as much as possible because \nobviously it is more costly and more difficult to export an item if you \nhave to go get a license for the export than if you don't have to worry \nabout that.\n  Given these cross pressures, we would at least like to get some kind \nof commitment from the administration that it is going to look at this \nand try to find a way to ensure that the other departments of \ngovernment are brought into the process as appropriate.\n  There may be some other things, as the administration has indicated \nto us, that should be the subject of a subsequent Executive order to \nimplement the legislation. Obviously, we will be interested in working \nwith the administration on what some of those items might be as well. \nSome of them might be able to correct some of the problems I identified \nthis morning and that some others have as well. We will be expressing \nthat to the administration again. I\n\n[[Page S9113]]\n\nam sure they will respond with an appropriate response.\n  These are the kinds of items we are talking about now as possibly \nbeing resolved by some kind of amendment or series of amendments that \ncould get us to a conclusion on this legislation. Since it is very \nevident from the standpoint of those of us who have concerns about it \nthat in the end legislation is going to pass and we have no desire to \ndelay or to stall it, we are not going to win very many amendments that \nwe propose. Notwithstanding the fact we are very serious and concerned \nabout it, there is no point in us taking up the Senate's time or \npersisting in a matter on which we are not likely to succeed, \nespecially if, as has been conveyed to us, a few changes might be \npossible to be agreed to here fairly quickly, and then we could move on \nwith the conclusion of the legislation.\n  That is why I add my comments to those of the Senator from Maryland \nand suggest that if there are those who would like to come here to make \nan opening statement about the legislation or to express concerns or \nsupport for it or any particular amendment, this would be a good time \nto do so. I am hopeful that within the next several minutes we will be \nable to meet and we will be able to confer about some of the things I \nhave talked about and perhaps come to some conclusion. I am sure it is \nthe position of the managers that they would like to move fairly \nquickly after that, if we are able to do that. Therefore, it would be \nappropriate to discuss at this time any concerns or other items with \nrespect to this bill people would like to take up.\n  I had indicated this morning that I would just quickly detail sort of \na list of potential amendments in case anybody is interested. These \nwere proposals that were prepared before the legislation was taken up. \nI don't know how many people are still planning on offering any of \nthese amendments. My own view is that if we are able to achieve \nconsensus on the items I mentioned a moment ago, it will probably be \ndoubtful that these amendments will be adopted. Therefore, people might \nwant to consider dealing with the subjects in some other way. I will \njust run through them quickly.\n  One of the problems has to do with deemed exports. Deemed exports are \nbasically transfer of technology, of knowledge, rather than a \nparticular product, but that can, of course, be just as important to a \nrogue nation in putting together some kind of weapons program or \nmissile program as the export of a particular item. Some of us believe \nwe should deal a little bit more specifically with the matter of deemed \nexports. Again, that matter might be at least handled for the time \nbeing through some communication with the administration, assurance \nthat it intends to deal with the subject in some way.\n  I talked about the matter of the controlled list and how other \ndepartments probably need to have a little more involvement in that \nthan the legislation itself provides. The legislation itself provides \nno assurance that any other departments will be involved in the listing \nof items on the controlled list. We think it would be a good idea if \nthere were some assurance that they would be included in the process.\n\n  I mentioned the standard of finding for foreign availability. There \nare quite a few different ideas about how that might be strengthened. I \nmentioned the one about comparable quality. I hope we can do something \non that.\n  There is a question that we are not going to pursue here--at least I \nwill not pursue--but it could be the subject of an amendment. It is \nimportant. I wish we could do something about it. It had to do with \ntaking a little bit of extra time to deal with matters that are \nparticularly complex. The Thompson amendment failed yesterday. There \nare other ideas about how to deal with that so that the Departments of \nDefense, State, and Energy, and any other agencies that are involved in \na particular license would have enough time to review the license \napplication beyond the limit of 30 days, which is currently provided \nfor.\n  The Thompson amendment provided an additional potentially 60 days. \nThere are some other potential compromises that could be offered there. \nI doubt, since the Thompson amendment was defeated, that an amendment \non this subject will be offered again.\n  There is a question about the interagency dispute resolution process, \nand there have been some proposed changes that could come up as an \namendment with respect thereto. This process requires any dispute over \na license, application, or a commodity classification to be resolved by \nthe various departments that should be involved and then to forward any \ndisagreement up the chain of command. This is a recommendation of the \nCox commission and frankly would strengthen the hand of individual \ndepartments in this interagency review process. I am not certain, but I \nbelieve the House bill addressed this in some fashion, and it may be \nthat if the House holds to its position and we pass the bill before us \ntoday, that issue is going to have to be further visited. At least from \nmy perspective, it would be a wise thing to do.\n  There is another potential amendment relating to standardization of \ndetermination requirements. This is something others have brought up. \nThis is not something that I would bring up. It has to do with the \nstandard for waiving the foreign availability or mass market \ndeterminations. I did allude to this in my opening statement--the \ndifferent standards of serious, significant, or merely a national \nthreat. It may be wise to try to standardize those. Somebody else might \nbring that up.\n  There could also be an amendment relating to a reporting requirement \nfor key proliferators, requiring a report on certain items transferred \nto certain key proliferator countries. This is something that I think \nwould be useful to the Congress as we continue to review how the act is \nworking and, frankly, useful to a blue ribbon commission as well. It is \nnot in the bill at this point. Somebody else may pursue that. Likewise, \na license for key proliferators requiring that a license for certain \nitems transferred to certain key proliferators be actually established \nin the legislation, rather than leaving it up to a question of what is \non the control list.\n  There is also a proposed amendment relating to congressional \nnotification when changes are made in either the particular countries \ninvolved or the tiers--as you know, we have tier I, tier II, and tier \nIII countries--or when violations of the Export Administration Act \noccur. I think, frankly, this would be a useful report, especially if \nwe have a blue ribbon commission. They are going to want to collect \nthis data anyway.\n  Congress should be aware of the data. It is especially going to be \nimportant for countries that may continue to violate the postshipment \nverification procedures. I think it would be useful to have a \ncongressional notification process. It is not in the bill now. I have \nnot proposed that this be part of a managers' amendment. I wonder if \npeople will consider that. Somebody may want to offer that amendment.\n  There is also a different version of the blue ribbon commission which \nI understand might be proposed, and there may be other amendments.\n  I think that is a list of at least several of the amendments that \nwere being drafted for presentation a little later. Again, many might \nbe obviated by the discussion I had before.\n  There are a couple of other items that have to do with specific \nprovisions of the bill, such as the 18-month limitation on the \nPresidential authority to grant a waiver from the foreign availability. \nThat is too restrictive. I would eliminate that.\n  There is another possibility in that same section for another change. \nThis has to do with the fact that the President can't delegate his \nauthority. You want the President making the ultimate determinations, \nbut you want him making big determinations, not little ones. There are \na lot of things in this bill that have to do with particular items that \nshould not go up to the President. He could delegate that easily to one \nof his secretaries. I don't believe that will be a proposed amendment.\n  I want to explain to my colleagues that notwithstanding the fact that \nan item or a concern may not be proposed here in the form of an \namendment, that doesn't mean there are not additional concerns we have \nwith the legislation that I hope eventually, between the House and \nSenate, will be addressed. Much of that was discussed in my opening \ncomments.\n\n[[Page S9114]]\n\n  That is the list. I hope in the next few minutes we can try to \nresolve these remaining issues so we can move forward.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate bill \nS. 149, the Export Administration Act of 2001. I am very proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nhis tireless efforts in crafting legislation that I believe will move \nus forward in this area. I am thankful for the leadership of the \ndistinguished chair and the ranking member of the Banking Committee, \nthe Senator from Maryland, and the Senator from Texas, and others who \nhave worked hard to successfully address the issue of export controls \nin a changing economy.\n\n  U.S. competitiveness in the global economy will depend heavily on our \nability to foster continued innovation in our technology sector and \nhelp domestic companies gain markets overseas.\n  Mr. President, in my State, technology-based industries are the \nbulwark of the Washington State economy. They now account for the \nlargest share of employment, business activity, and labor income of any \nsector in the State's economic base. Roughly 38 percent of all \nWashington State jobs are tied to the tech sector, and the State's \n286,000 tech workers earn wages that are 81 percent above the State \naverage.\n  This sector is gearing up to be a crucial engine for the future of \nthe U.S. economy, and for Washington State in particular. However, to \nguide the continued development of this sector, we need to ensure the \nsuccess of U.S. companies and their exports in the international \nmarketplace. This legilsation streamlines the process by which \ncompanies gain approval to export their products to foreign markets. \nThis is important because it is increasingly importer that in today's \neconomy, a company that cannot compete globally will not succeed.\n  Although the United States currently leads the world in technology, \nwe are not the only technology suppliers and this lead is not \nguaranteed to last. We sacrifice our position as a global technology \nand economic leader when we limit U.S. companies' ability to sell their \nproducts abroad through a burdensome, unreasonable, and flawed export \ncontrol system.\n  Under the current system, companies lose out in the short term \nthrough restrictions on direct sales but also in the long term through \nloss of market share.\n  The existing process for U.S. companies to acquire export licenses \ninvolves a complex application procedure and a Byzantine system of \nbureaucratic authority spread over four Federal agencies. Getting the \nlicense can take a very long time, which compromises the reliability of \nU.S. suppliers and makes it hard for manufacturers and customers to \nplan ahead.\n  Mr. President, S. 149 will go a long way in streamlining the export \ncontrol process and utlimately strengthening U.S. economic \ncompetitiveness by making three major changes:\n  First, this bill provides a commonsense approach to the reality of \nthe global economy by recognizing that if a certain technology is \navailable on the mass market or made available for sale to multiple \nbuyers, it simply does not make sense to restrict U.S. companies from \nthese commercial opportunities.\n  Second, this bill streamlines export control licensing by \ncentralizing authority under one agency and streamlining the process. \nLet me be clear. It does not do anything to reduce the depth of the \nreview process, nor compromise its effectiveness; it simply provides \naccountability and structure to ensure that decisions are made in a \nmore timely efficient and transparent manner.\n  Third, this bill removes the antiquated MTOPS standard for \ncategorizing high-speed computers, and allows the President and his \nsecurity team to develop a control system that is flexible and \nspecifically tailored to keep pace with advances in technological \ncapability.\n  United States companies operate in a fiercely competitive \nenvironment, and we cannot afford to have outdated regulations make \nthat competition even more difficult--especially if these regulations \ndo not effectively meet their objectives.\n  This is the fundamental flaw of the current control system. Although \nrestrictions disadvantage American companies globally in the name of \nnational security, in practice, they do not effectively enhance our \nsecurity interests.\n  I refer to the December GAO report which states:\n\n       The current system of controlling the export of individual \n     machines is ineffective in limiting countries of concern from \n     obtaining high performance computing capabilities for \n     military applications.\n\n  This is a crucial point. Especially as we have heard many of our \ndistinguished colleagues in this Chamber characterize this bill as \nputting business or economic interests over national security \ninterests.\n  With all due respect to the opponents of this bill, this perceived \nconflict of economic versus security interests is fundamentally \nmisguided. In fact, this bill helps support our economic interests \nwhile enhancing the President's ability to ensure our national \nsecurity.\n  And you need not take my word for it. I am joined by leaders of the \nintelligence community, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of \nDefense, the National Security Advisor, and President Bush who all \nagree that these changes will actually strengthen the President's \nnational security authority. Instead of his having to rely on an \nantiquated system to control security the President will be granted \ndirect authority to intervene in matters where he determines national \nsecurity is at stake.\n  This bill helps us focus on those export technologies that constitute \ntrue national security threats. And, make no mistake, this bill is not \nsoft on those who break the law. For those firms and individuals who \nviolate the established control laws, this bill authorizes \nsubstantially higher criminal and civil penalties that those included \nin the current system.\n  We need to establish an export control regime that facilitates our \nNation's status as a global economic and technology leader and provides \na control system that allows the administration to focus on those \nexports that do constitute a specific security threat. We must come to \nrealize that these are not competing goals but constitute intertwined \nobjectives. This bill helps to achieve both, and I urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record at this point a document entitled ``Talking Points on High \nPerformance Computers,'' which describes some of the difficulties we \nhave encountered in the transfer of high-technology computers to other \ncountries, and which basically says we should be more careful about \nliberalizing export controls on these items.\n  There being on objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Talking Points on High Performance Computers\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       In 1997, in response to growing concerns that foreign \n     entities had illegally acquired U.S.-made high performance \n     computers for military purposes, Congress inserted language \n     into the FY 1998 Defense Authorization Act that was designed \n     to strengthen export controls on such computers.\n       S. 149 would repeal the sections of that Act requiring \n     prior notification for exports of HPCs above the MTOP \n     threshold to Tier 3 countries (including China), post-\n     shipment verifications for these HPCs, and Congressional \n     notification of an adjustment in MTOP threshold levels. It \n     also contains a provision to repeal the sections that \n     established MTOPS performance levels above which no computers \n     could be sold to certain countries without a license.\n\n[[Page S9115]]\n\n                    current export controls on hpcs\n\n       In January 2001, President Clinton loosened export controls \n     on high performance computers for the sixth time. Under the \n     latest guidelines, computers with a processing speed of less \n     than 85,000 million theoretical operations per seconds \n     (MTOPS) no longer require a license for export to military \n     organizations in Tier 3 countries like China.\n       The bar requiring firms to notify the Commerce Department \n     of an export was also raised to 85,000 MTOPS--establishing, \n     for the first time, licensing and advanced notification \n     thresholds at the same level. Consequently, the new rules \n     effectively eliminate routine prior U.S. government review of \n     any computer exports below the licensing threshold to Tier 3 \n     countries.\n       By contrast, in January 2000, computers with processing \n     speeds above 2,000 MTOPS required a license for export to \n     Tier 3 countries--over a 40-fold increase in a 1-year period.\n       85,000 MTOPS computers are very powerful. As a comparison, \n     in 1997 some of the initial computers developed in the U.S. \n     under the Stockpile Stewardship Program's Accelerated \n     Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI), called ASCI Red and \n     ASCI Red/1024, had processing speeds of 46,000 and 76,000 \n     MTOPS respectively. These computers were used for 3D modeling \n     and shock physics simulation for nuclear weapons \n     applications.\n       In March 2001, the General Accounting Office concluded that \n     President Clinton failed to adequately analyze ``military \n     significant uses for computers at the new thresholds and \n     assess the national security impact of such uses.''\n       For example, in testimony to the Senate Governmental \n     Affairs Committee in March 2001, Susan Westin, Managing \n     Director of the International Affairs and Trade Division at \n     GAO, stated, ``The report does not note that applications for \n     3-dimensional modeling of armor and anti-armor and 3-\n     dimensional modeling of submarines can be run on computers \n     at about 70,000 MTOPS.\n       Furthermore, Ms. Westin noted that ``The President's report \n     does not state that computers rated up to 85,000 MTOPS could \n     operate all but four of the 194 militarily significant \n     applications identified in the 1998 Defense- and Commerce-\n     sponsored study.'' (The study to which she referred was one \n     of two studies upon which the report's section on the \n     computer uses of military significance was largely based.)\n\n\n             controllability of high performance computers\n\n       Some cite computer ``clustering'' as making computer \n     controls ineffective. This involves linking several \n     processors together to create a parallel processing system \n     with greater capabilities than the individual processors.\n       According to Susan Westin's testimony to the Senate \n     Governmental Affairs Committee in March, President Clinton \n     set the licensing control threshold of 85,000 MTOPS based on \n     the availability of clustering technologies projected to be \n     available by the end of 2001.\n       However, as Ms. Westin noted in her testimony, ``DOD \n     officials, when asked, could not provide evidence to support \n     their conclusions that there is necessary technical expertise \n     in tier three countries [like China] to cluster to any \n     performance level.'' (Emphasis in original.)\n       Additionally, as Andrew Grover, CEO of Intel, concluded \n     during his remarks to the Forum for Technology and Innovation \n     in March 1999, ``The physical technology, the hardware \n     technology implicit in building these large parallel \n     machines, is not the same as the physical technology used in \n     building commodity machines.''\n       The report produced in 1999 by a 9-member bipartisan \n     commission chaired by Congressman Chris Cox in the House of \n     Representatives (the Cox Report) also addressed this issue \n     with regard to China's computing abilities, stating that \n     ``while the PRC might attempt to perform some HPC functions \n     by other means, these computer work-arounds remain difficult \n     and imperfect.''\n\n\n                  why do hpc's need to be controlled?\n\n       As stated by Gary Milhollin, Executive Director of the \n     Wisconsin project on Nuclear Arms Control, in an op-ed in the \n     Washington Post in March 2000,\n       ``The truth is, high-performance computers aren't like most \n     other exports--they're more like weapons. They are essential \n     to develop the software and hardware that make things like \n     advanced military radar work. And one of the driving forces \n     behind the development of `supercomputers' has always been \n     the desire to design better nuclear weapons and the \n     missiles that deliver them . . . It is easier, safer, and \n     more economical to stop dangerous exports than to defend \n     against the weapons they produce.'' (Emphasis added.)\n       The Cox report discussed in detail China's potential use of \n     high-performance computers for the design and testing of \n     ballistic missiles and advanced conventional weapons, the \n     design and manufacturing of chemical and biological weapons, \n     nuclear weapons development, warfare applications such as \n     computer network attack, intelligence collection and \n     analysis, and military command and control.\n       The Cox Committee concluded that China is ``attempting to \n     achieve parity with U.S. systems and capabilities in its \n     military modernization efforts.'' As illustrated by Beijing's \n     recent military exercises, its rapid efforts to modernize its \n     military, and its continuing buildup of short-range missiles \n     aimed at Taiwan, China poses a real and growing threat to \n     U.S. national security.\n       The United States should not ease restrictions on the \n     export of high performance computers that China can use to \n     further its weapons development programs. Unfortunately, this \n     is precisely what S. 149 would accomplish.\n\n\n                          Notification Process\n\n       The 1998 Defense Authorization Act requires exporters to \n     submit for review any proposed Tier 3 sale above the MTOPS \n     threshold. This review is conducted by the Secretaries \n     Commerce, Defense, State, and Energy, and the Director of the \n     Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.\n       This requirement would be repealed by S. 149.\n       In his testimony to the House Armed Services Committee in \n     October 1999, Gary Milhollin discussed the importance of the \n     notification process set forth in the 1998 Defense \n     Authorization Act, stating that it ``has worked \n     brilliantly.'' Furthermore, he concluded, ``It has stopped a \n     number of dangerous exports without imposing any significant \n     burden on American industry.''\n       In his testimony, Mr. Milhollin sited a number of instances \n     where the process has been successful.\n       For example, Digital Equipment Corporation (Now Compaq) \n     applied for permission to sell a supercomputer to the Harbin \n     Institute of Technology in China. According to Mr. \n     Milhollin's testimony, this institute ``is overseen by the \n     China Aerospace Corporation, China's principal missile and \n     rocket manufacturer,'' and it ``makes rocket castings and \n     other components for long-range missiles.''\n       The application was denied as a result of objections from \n     the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the State \n     Department. Mr. Milhollin further notes that the sale would \n     have been worth only $348,000, in comparison to Compaq's \n     annual revenue of approximately $31 billion.\n       Without the notification process, Digital would most likely \n     have indirectly aided China in its effort to make more long-\n     range ballistic missiles. Do we want to risk such an outcome \n     in the future?\n\n\n                       Post-Shipment Verification\n\n       S. 149 would also repeal the section in the 1998 Defense \n     Authorization Act that requires post-shipment verifications \n     for high performance computers exported to Tier 3 countries, \n     like China.\n       In June 1998, China agreed to allow post-shipment \n     verifications for all exports, including high-performance \n     computers. For the following reasons, the Cox Committee found \n     the terms of the agreement ``wholly inadequate'':\n       1. China considers U.S. Commerce Department requests to \n     verify the end-use of a U.S. high performance computer to be \n     non-binding.\n       2. China insists that one of its own ministries conduct an \n     end-use verification, if it agrees to one at all.\n       3. China argues that U.S. Embassy and Consulate commercial \n     service personnel may not attend an end-use verification \n     unless invited by China.\n       4. China argues that it is at China's discretion whether or \n     not to conduct any end-use verification.\n       5. China will not permit an end-use verification at any \n     time after the first six months of the computer's arrival.\n       According to the Bureau of Export Administration, out of \n     857 high-performance computers shipped to China, only 132 \n     post-shipment verifications have been performed.\n       According to the Cox Report,\n       ``The illegal diversion of HPCs for the benefit of the PRC \n     military is facilitated by the lack of effective post-sale \n     verifications of the locations and purposes for which the \n     computers are being used. HPC diversion for PRC military use \n     is also facilitated by the steady relaxation of U.S. export \n     controls over sales of HPCs.''\n       The Cox Report also states,\n       ``.  .  . the United States has no effective way to verify \n     that high-performance computer purchases reportedly made for \n     commercial purposes are not diverted to military uses. The \n     Select Committee judges that the PRC has in fact used \n     high-performance computers to perform nuclear weapon \n     applications.''\n       More recently, during a July 2001 hearing of the House \n     International Relations Committee, David Tarbell, Deputy \n     Undersecretary of Defense for Technology Security Policy, \n     stated, ``. . . the Chinese government has been unwilling to \n     establish a verification regime and an end use monitoring \n     regime that would get all of the security interests that \n     we're interested in to ensure that items that are shipped are \n     not diverted.'' (Emphasis added.)\n       When pressed further by Chairman Hyde about whether the \n     post-shipment verification regime is a failure, Secretary \n     Tarbell replied, ``I'm not sure I would characterize it as a \n     complete failure, but it is close to . . . It is not \n     something I have a great deal of confidence in.'' (Emphasis \n     added.)\n       The lack of an effective post-shipment verification regime \n     for dual-use exports eliminates any benefit to U.S. national \n     security of a licensing process. This bill would allow the \n     Commerce Department to grant licenses to countries that \n     refuse to allow post-shipment verification.\n\n\n            China's Use of U.S. HPC's for Military Purposes\n\n       The Cox report discussed China's use of high performance \n     computers for military applications, stating.\n\n[[Page S9116]]\n\n       ``. . . open source reporting and stated PRC military \n     modernization goals tend to support the belief that the PRC \n     could be using HPCs in the design, development, and operation \n     of missiles, anti-armor weapons, chemical and biological \n     weapons, and information warfare technologies.''\n       Furthermore, specifically with regard to nuclear weapons \n     development and testing, the Cox report states, ``The Select \n     Committee judges that the PRC is almost certain to use U.S. \n     HPCs to perform nuclear weapons applications. Moreover the \n     PRC continues to seek HPCs and the related computer programs \n     for these applications.''\n       According to an article in the Washington Times in June \n     2000, ``U.S. high-performance computers are being used at the \n     Chinese Academy of Engineering Physics, the main nuclear \n     weapons facility in Beijing.'' The Times reported that this \n     was the third time the Chinese government has been detected \n     diverting U.S.-origin computers to defense facilities.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       S. 149 significantly weakens controls on the export of high \n     performance computers. The bill reverses the efforts of \n     Congress in 1997 to strengthen such controls.\n       The foreign availability of high performance computers is \n     controllable. Computer ``clustering'' will not necessarily \n     provide China, or another country, with the capability that \n     would be achieved with a commodity machine purchased from the \n     United States.\n       The notification process established in the 1998 Defense \n     Authorization Act has been effective in preventing some sales \n     of high performance computers that would most likely have \n     been diverted to military uses.\n       A mandatory post-shipment verification regime is necessary \n     to ensure that U.S. high performance computers are being used \n     for commercial, not military, purposes.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to report to our colleagues where \nI think we are. We had been hopeful that we would have agreement on a \nfew amendments that had been discussed at some length--largely with \nSenator Kyl and Senator Thompson--and that those amendments could be \nagreed to and the managers' amendment would be agreed to, and then we \nwould have been able to go on to final passage of the legislation this \nevening. I know a number of our colleagues are going to the White House \nfor the state dinner with the President of the Republic of Mexico.\n  Regrettably, there has been a hangup, I guess I will describe it as, \nat this point with respect to this blue ribbon commission amendment \nthat we had discussed. An effort is still underway to try to work that \nout. We did reach agreement on two other amendments that I think are of \nsome consequence, for which both Senator Kyl and Senator Thompson \nearlier in the debate sort of laid out a rationale. Senator Enzi and I \njoined together in trying to accommodate that concern.\n  Apparently, it is believed that if we go overnight, that will provide \nsome opportunity to work out the one remaining item.\n  If Members choose an amendment on that, we will have to deal with the \namendment on its terms in one way or another or Members may choose at \nthat point not to offer the amendment. But that would be the situation \nwe would find ourselves in, and then we would move to final passage.\n  As best we can ascertain, there are not other amendments, and I \ncertainly hope that is the case. That is the premise on which we are \nnow proceeding. In light of that, I expect what we would do shortly is \ngo over until the morning, and if the blue ribbon commission amendment \nhas been worked out, that will be included in what would be passed. If \nnot, we would pass the other two amendments that have been addressed \nand worked out, pass the managers' amendment, and go to third reading \nand final passage of the legislation.\n  This is what we have been trying to work towards all day long, and I \nthink we came close but not quite there. So that is the situation. I \nwant to report that to all of my colleagues. I know a lot of time has \nbeen spent in a sense waiting while discussions were going on, but that \nis not new for this body. We actually had hopes we would be able to get \nthe bill done today. I very much regret that is not the case.\n  I discussed it with my colleagues on the other side. I do not think \nthere are other amendments hanging out there, but if there are, we \ncertainly want to be enlightened as to them. I am certainly not \ninviting them. We need to complete this legislation now.\n  It is clear what the will of this body is with respect to this \nlegislation, and I hope Members would get a chance to exercise that \nwill and then we will be able to get on with the other extended agenda \nwhich confronts the Senate now as we move into the fall period.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for the purpose of asking a \nquestion?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. First of all, it is my understanding the Senator from \nMaryland and Senator Enzi, who both have managed this bill so well, are \ngoing to work with Senator Thompson and others, hopefully in the \nmorning when we come in at 10:30, to have some kind of unanimous \nconsent agreement at that time that would give us a final order to \ndispose of this bill. Is that true?\n  Mr. SARBANES. We very much hope to achieve that. And if we could do \nthat, I also hope it would not take a great deal of time to implement \nor carry out a unanimous consent agreement, then not only get the \nagreement but move from the agreement to where we do the final passage. \nThen this legislation is completed and the floor is clear for other \nmatters which I know the leadership is anxious to consider.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend before the Senator from Tennessee \nspeaks, we are going to come in at 10:30 tomorrow and then the \nPresident of Mexico, as the Senator indicated, will be here in the \nmorning. We will have a short time in the morning. I hope early in the \nmorning the staffs could work with the principals to try to come up \nwith a UC that we can propound before we listen to the President of \nMexico. That would really work well.\n  It is my understanding the Senator from Maryland, the Senator from \nWyoming, and the Senator from Tennessee are going to work toward that \nend so we can move to the Commerce-State-Justice bill, which Senators \nLott and Daschle are very anxious we finish this week.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, the scenario that has been outlined is a \nprobability. That is something for which we can strive. We have \naccomplished some things in this down time we have had today. We are \ntalking about a couple of amendments, and we are talking about a couple \nof letters, all of which will need to be finally agreed upon among the \nparties. I do not think that would be any problem. I do not anticipate \nother amendments at this time, but I say to my colleagues who might be \nlistening, if anyone has any amendments, they should come forth \nimmediately and announce them. Otherwise, I would anticipate tomorrow \nmorning we would know where we stand with regard to the blue ribbon \ncommission issue and would tomorrow morning be able to enter into some \nsort of unanimous consent agreement.\n  There being no further amendments other than our agreeing to the \nlanguage of the letters and to the other amendments, we will be able to \nproceed on to final passage.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. REID. I always feel a sense of almost guilt when the Chamber is \nempty all day long and there are not people offering amendments and \ndiscussing the legislation, but it is important to note to all of the \nSenators within the sound of my voice and anyone else who is watching, \ntoday has been a very productive day. There has been tremendous work \ndone by numerous Senators--Senator Enzi, Senator Sarbanes, Senator \nGramm, Senator Thompson, and Senator Kyl. We could go through the whole \nlist of Senators who have been heavily involved in working on this bill \ntoday behind the scenes. There has been a lot of work.\n  The fact that we have not been in the Chamber should not diminish the \nfact there has been a lot of progress on this legislation.\n  Will the Senator from Tennessee agree with that statement?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I certainly will, and I express appreciation to the \nleadership\n\n[[Page S9117]]\n\nfor allowing us to do this unfettered and unhassled because I know the \nSenator wants to finish and move on to other things. We have \naccomplished a couple of different things in the first day. We have had \nan opportunity to say our piece on our side to express our concern with \nsome of the provisions. We have also had an opportunity to have a vote. \nIt does not take a genius to count that vote.\n  After the vote occurred, the proponents of this legislation, in a \nvery reasonable fashion, suggested we get together and see if some of \nthe concerns we expressed could not be addressed. That is what good \ndebate and good interchange is all about: actually listening to each \nother and learning something from each other and trying to see whether \nor not we could address some issues.\n  Those thoughts have been expressed in a way that had not been heard \nbefore. All of this happened, and that is a good thing. We are going to \nwind up with a better product than we otherwise would have. So, yes, I \nconcur with the Senator. It is time to do what we can do and then move \non.\n  I add we still need to be diligent and make sure we agree on the \nlanguage, as we have orally, and hopefully wrap this thing up tomorrow.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, we are going to strive very hard to get \nthis unanimous consent agreement before we go to the joint meeting of \nthe Congress, and then I hope we can come back and in fairly short \norder execute the unanimous consent request and move to final passage \nof this legislation by midday tomorrow, and then clear the Chamber for \nthe leadership to take up other matters which I know are pressing on \ntheir agenda.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/05/senate-section/article/S9117-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, next week the Senate will be honored with a \nvisit from the Right Honorable John Howard, Prime Minister of \nAustralia. Prime Minister Howard comes to the United States to \ncelebrate the 50th Anniversary of the signing ANZUS Treaty, the \ndocument that has formally tied our strategic destinies together for \nthe good of the entire Asian Pacific Rim.\n  Our relationship with Australia did not begin with the ratification \nof one treaty. American and Australian soldiers have fought together on \nevery battlefield of the world from the Meuse Argonne in 1918 to the \nMekong Delta and Desert Storm. We share a common historic and cultural \nheritage. We are immigrant peoples forged from the British Empire. We \nconquered our continents and became a beacon of hope for people \nstruggling to be free.\n  For over 100 years, the United States and Australia have been the \nfoundation for stability in the South Pacific. Today, we are on the \nprecipice of a new day in this vital region. The potential for economic \ngrowth there is staggering. Where our two countries provided the \nmilitary basis for peace in that hemisphere, we now can set the stage \nfor a new free market order that will open the frontiers of freedom for \ncountless millions.\n  On September 5th, I sent a letter to President Bush asking that he \naccelerate the schedule for creating a free trade agreement with \nAustralia. We are Australia's largest source of foreign investment and \nsecond largest trading partner with a two way trade totaling over $19 \nbillion. Even though Australia has a relatively small population, they \nare the 15th largest market for American exports.\n  An American Australia Free Trade Agreement will be a capstone event \non a century of friendship and mutual sacrifice. It has the potential \nfor setting a new standard for all of the Pacific to follow. So we \nwelcome Prime Minister Howard to the United States and look forward to \nanother century of prosperity and peace.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my letter to President Bush \ndated September 5, 2001 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                              Office of the Republican Leader,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 5, 2001.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In recognition of the upcoming visit of \n     Prime Minister John Howard, to celebrate the 50th anniversary \n     of our alliance with Australia, I believe that it is a \n     wonderful opportunity to strengthen the historic ties between \n     our countries by launching the United States-Australia Free \n     Trade Agreement.\n       In addition to a military alliance that has borne fruit on \n     battlefields from the Meuse Argonne to Vietnam, we share a \n     common cultural and economic bond. The United States-\n     Australia strategic partnership is the foundation for \n     stability in the South Pacific. We are Australia's largest \n     source of foreign investment and second largest trading \n     partner and they are one of the top markets for American \n     exports.\n       The United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement would be \n     the first in a series of formal regimes designed to bring the \n     fruits of the free market to the entire Asian Pacific rim. \n     There is no better place to expand the new economic frontier \n     than with our friends and allies in Australia.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Trent Lott,\n     Republican Leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/05/senate-section/article/S9117-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9117-S9118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STEM CELL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss embryonic stem \ncell research, having just participated in a hearing on stem cell \nresearch before the Senate's Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee.\n  The future of stem cells in the United States, indeed the world, \nposes one of the greatest challenges to our Government since the \nfoundation of our Republic over 200 years ago.\n  Enormous pressures will be placed upon our Presidents. President \nBush, at the threshold of this debate on new developments in medical \nresearch, has taken an important step forward. I commend the President \nfor supporting some degree of Federal funding for embryonic stem cell \nresearch. I also particularly commend the President for his efforts to \nban human cloning.\n  Likewise, Congress must write laws striking a balance. On the one \nhand, ethical, moral, and religious standards give our Nation its \nstrong foundation and must be considered.\n  On the other hand, we must allow science to go forward, within \nreasonable bounds, to assess the ability of the new frontier of \nembryonic stem cell research to alleviate the human suffering being \nexperienced by millions.\n  Like our executive and legislative branches of Government, our \njudiciary will also be faced with challenges. The judiciary must \ninterpret, not re-write, the law of the land, as a flood of cases will \ncome before the courts.\n  If the three branches of our Government fail, in the judgment of \nAmericans, to discharge their respective responsibilities in a fair, \nobjective way, there will be many adverse impacts upon the American \npeople.\n  For example, this science will simply leave the U.S. laboratories and \nmove off shore. The United States will no longer be a Nation that \nimports and keeps our best researchers; rather, we will become a Nation \nthat exports our brain power in crucial fields. Americans seeking \nmedical treatment will likewise go abroad.\n  Consequently, our Government is faced with challenges. But, to the \nextent we allow embryonic stem cell research at home, within a fair and \nbalanced framework of regulations, we can better control the important \nethical, moral and religious standards vital to our culture here in the \nUnited States.\n  America has accepted the awesome responsibility of being the only \nworld superpower in areas of security, the preservation of freedom, and \nthe fostering of the principles of democracy and human rights \nthroughout the world. Are we as a Nation going to be\n\n[[Page S9118]]\n\na superpower in medical science, advocating ethical standards for \nothers beyond our shores; or are we, as a Nation, going to retreat \nbehind unrealistic, unenforceable barricades, and leave advancement in \nthe science of this emerging field to the rest of the world?\n  The facts are that an overwhelming amount of evidence exists that \nindicates that stem cell research holds enormous potential for \ntreatment, and ultimately cures, for many diseases such as Parkinson's \ndisease, cancer, ALS, Alzheimer's, heart disease, spinal chord \ninjuries, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and \ndiabetes.\n  Constantly, my Senate staff and I meet and hear from many Virginians \nwho suffer from these and other diseases. And, many of these same \nindividuals succumb to their disease, as no cure has yet been found for \ntheir illness. Embryonic stem cell research offers a real opportunity \nto help save lives in the future.\n  After thoughtful consideration, I came to the conclusion that the \nFederal Government, subject to restrictions, should fund embryonic stem \ncell research so that we remain a superpower in medical science. I \njoined with several of my colleagues in the Senate in writing to \nPresident Bush expressing my support for Federal funding of embryonic \nstem cell research prior to the President's August 9th announcement. I \nask unanimous consent that the letter to President Bush be printed in \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We strongly urge you to continue the \n     last Administration's policy of using Federal funds for \n     research on human stem cells after these cells have been \n     derived from embryos. In addition, we strongly urge you to \n     support legislation which would remove the existing ban on \n     the use of Federal funds to derive stem cells from embryos.\n       On the issue of stem cell research, we think our colleague, \n     Senator Gordon Smith, went to the heart of the matter when he \n     pointed out the difference between an embryo in a petri dish, \n     which would not produce human life, as opposed to an embryo \n     in the womb of a woman where further development would \n     produce life.\n       The essential consideration is that there are many excess \n     embryos created for the purpose of in vitro fertilization. \n     The only issue is whether these embryo will be discarded or \n     used for stem cell research to save lives. Stem cell research \n     has demonstrated a remarkable capacity of these cells to \n     transform into any type of cell in the human body. Stem cells \n     could be transplanted to any part of the body to replace \n     tissue that has been damaged by disease, injury or aging. If \n     scientists are correct, stem cells could be used to treat and \n     cure a multitude of maladies such as Parkinson's, \n     Alzhemier's, diabetes, ALS, heart disease, spinal cord \n     injury, all types of cancers, burns, stroke, macular \n     degeneration, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, \n     autoimmune diseases, hepatitis and arthritis.\n       Current law prohibits Federal funding to create human \n     embryos for research purposes through cloning, or through any \n     other means. We do not object to these important \n     prohibitions. However, creating embryos for research purposes \n     is entirely different from using spare embryos left-over from \n     infertility treatments. These spare embryos are now destined \n     to be thrown away.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 14, 1991 \nin Eugene, OR. Police arrested Pamela Joanne Richardson, 28, and \nMichael James Hughes, 21, for allegedly attacking a gay man outside a \nbar while using offensive language about his sexual orientation.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/05/senate-section/article/S9118-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize Kids \nVoting USA and its efforts to educate our children about civic \ndemocracy and the importance of being an informed voter.\n  The program began in 1988 with three Arizona businessmen on a fishing \ntrip to Costa Rica. They learned that voter turnout in that country was \nroutinely about 80 percent. This high turnout was attributed to a \ntradition of children accompanying their parents to the polls. The men \nobserved first-hand the success Costa Rica had achieved by instilling \nin children at an early age the importance of active participation and \nvoting.\n  The three Arizona businessmen took this idea back to the United \nStates and founded Kids Voting USA. Today, this nonprofit, nonpartisan \norganization reaches 5 million students in 39 States, and includes \n200,000 teachers, and 20,000 voter precincts.\n  With voter turnout declining each year, Kids Voting USA recognizes \nthe need to educate our youth and instill in them the responsibility to \nbe active, informed citizens and voters. By teaching the skills for \ndemocratic living year-round, students receive a civics education and \nparticipate in local and national elections in communities across the \ncountry. Kids Voting USA enables students to visit official polls on \nelection day, accompanied by a parent or guardian, to cast a ballot \nthat replicates the official ballot. Although not a part of the \nofficial results, the students' votes are registered at schools and by \nthe media.\n  This year, National Kids Voting Week is September 24-28. It is a week \nwhen Kids Voting communities across the country celebrate this vibrant \nand important program. I would like to recognize Kids Voting USA and \nall its has done to promote the future of democracy by engaging young \npeople, schools and communities in the election process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/05/senate-section/article/S9118-4", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9118-S9119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SAS INSTITUTE INC. CELEBRATES 25TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I am proud to honor SAS Institute \nInc. as it celebrates 25 years as a leading technology company. SAS is \nthe world's largest privately held software company. The roots of SAS' \nsoftware stem from a United States Department of Agriculture grant to a \ngroup of universities in need of a way to analyze their vast amounts of \nagriculture data. The group developed the ``Statistical Analysis \nSystem'', giving SAS both its name and its corporate beginnings.\n  Headquartered in Cary, NC, SAS has made significant contributions to \ncommunities throughout North Carolina.\n\n[[Page S9119]]\n\nFortunately, as it has grown over the last 25 years, SAS has extended \nits community involvement to include areas around the United States and \nthe world. The company and its founders believe very strongly that \neducation and technology are vitally important for our local \ncommunities, state, and country.\n  SAS' customer list have grown significantly over the past 25 years. \nSAS customers now include 98 of the ``Fortune 100'' companies. In \naddition, all fourteen major Federal Government departments currently \nuse SAS software. SAS customers continually praise its software, as \ndemonstrated by a 98-percent annual renewal rate.\n  For the past quarter century, SAS has annually reinvested at least 30 \npercent of its income into Research & Development, far exceeding the \nindustry average. As a result of its commitment to R, SAS is \npositioned to continue to develop important solutions for its \ncustomers.\n  SAS co-owners and co-founders, Dr. James H. Goodnight and John P. \nSall, have a built a company that is committed to providing not only \nvaluable software solutions for its customers, but also providing a \nworker friendly environment for their employees. SAS' treatment of its \nemployees is a model for other companies around the world to follow. \nFor example, SAS was a corporate pioneer by providing on-site daycare \nfor its employees' children as early as 1981. In 1986, SAS began \noffering onsite healthcare for its employees. Last year, the company's \nHealth Care Center had more than 33,000 patient visits. SAS also \nprovides onsite employee cafeterias, an employee fitness center, \nmassage therapy and hair care services. SAS has created a family \natmosphere that inspires employee loyalty and bottom line success.\n  As a result of the many employee benefits and the positive employee-\nfriendly atmosphere created by its co-founders, SAS' employee turnover \nrate is just 5 percent as compared with a 20-percent industry average. \nBased on its workplace environment, SAS has received corporate \nleadership awards from numerous publications, including Working Mother, \nFortune, and Business Week magazines.\n  Based on its past performance, I have no doubt that SAS will continue \nto provide an exciting work environment for its employees and remain \ncommitted to supporting community causes. SAS and its employees most \ncertainly must be excited about the next 25 years, and as a U.S. \nSenator from North Carolina, I am proud that SAS was born in my \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/05/senate-section/article/S9119-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/05/senate-section/article/S9119-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/05/senate-section/article/S9119-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:40 am, a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2563.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nallowing certain U.S. legal tender coins to be qualified investments \nfor an individual retirement account (IRA).\n  Congress excluded ``collectibles,'' such as antiques, gold and silver \nbullion, and legal tender coinage, as appropriate for contribution to \nIRAs in 1981. The primary reason was the concern that individuals would \nget a tax\n\n[[Page S9125]]\n\nbreak when they bought collectibles for their personal use. For \nexample, a taxpayer might deduct the purchase of an antique rug for \nhis/her living room as an IRA investment. Congress was also concerned \nabout how the many different types of collectibles are valued.\n  Over the years, however, certain coins and precious metals have been \nexcluded from the definition of a collectible because they are \nindependently valued investments that offer investors portfolio \ndiversity and liquidity. For example, Congress excluded gold and silver \nU.S. American Eagles from the definition of collectibles in 1986, and \nthe Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 took the further step of excluding \ncertain precious metals bullion.\n  My legislation would exclude from the definition of collectibles only \nthose U.S. legal tender coins which meet the following three standards: \ncertification by a nationally recognized grading service, traded on a \nnationally-recognized network and held by a qualified trustee as \ndescribed in the Internal Revenue Code. In other words, only investment \nquality coins that are independently valued and not held for personal \nuse may be included in IRAs.\n  There are several nationally-recognized, independent certification or \ngrading services. Full-time professional graders (numismatists) examine \neach coin for authenticity and grade them according to established \nstandards. Upon certification, the coin is sonically-sealed (preserved) \nto ensure that if remains in the same condition as when it was graded.\n  Legal tender coins are then traded via two independent electronic \nnetworks--the Certified Coin Exchange and Certified CoinNet. These \nnetworks are independent of each other and have no financial interest \nin the legal tender coinage and precious metals markets. The networks \nfunction in precisely the same manner as the NASDAQ with a series of \npublished ``bid'' and ``ask'' prices and last trades. The buys and \nsells are enforceable prices that must be honored as posted until \nupdated.\n  Mr. President, the liquidity provided through a bona fide national \ntrading network, combined with published prices, make legal tender \ncoinage a practical investment that offers investors diversification \nand liquidity. Investment in these tangible assets has become a safe \nand prudent course of action for both the small and large investor and \nshould be given the same treatment under the law as other financial \ninvestments. I urge the Senate to enact this important legislation as \nsoon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1405\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CERTAIN COINS NOT TREATED AS COLLECTIBLES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 408(m)(3) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to exception for certain coins and \n     bullion) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting after clause (iv) in subparagraph (A) the \n     following new clause:\n       ``(v) any coin certified by a recognized grading service \n     and either traded on a nationally recognized electronic \n     network or listed by a recognized wholesale reporting \n     service, and which is or was at any time legal tender in the \n     United States, or'', and\n       (2) by striking ``such bullion'' in the matter following \n     subparagraph (B) and inserting ``such coin or bullion (in \n     either coin or bar form)''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 1407. A bill to establish a national competence for critical \ninfrastructure protection, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Critical \nInfrastructures Protection Act of 2001. This bill represents an \nimportant first step towards greatly increasing our understanding of \nour nation's infrastructures and the interdependencies among those \ninfrastructures that underpin our daily lives.\n  I would ask my colleagues to think about the scare surrounding the \nyear 2000 potential computer glitch, the so-called Y2K problem. We \ninvested billions of dollars to ensure that the transition to that date \ndid not cause a cataclysmic failure in our weapons systems, medical \ndevices, energy sources, financial systems and many other areas. But, \nthe cyber component of our potential vulnerability did not disappear on \nJanuary 2, 2000.\n  The physical infrastructures that support our daily lives are \nvulnerable as well. The increasing complexity of transportation and \nenergy infrastructures make them extremely vital to our economy and \nexceedingly vulnerable to minor disturbances or perturbations, \nintentional or not. In many instances, a cyber infrastructure underlies \nthe normal, efficient functioning of the physical infrastructures.\n  The smooth functioning of the Federal Government, whether it's a \nDefense Department mission or the handling of veteran's medical claims, \nrelies heavily on cyber infrastructures. Further, many critical \ninfrastructures are supported or owned by private sector entities. The \ntask of adequate protection and mitigation risk must be a cooperative \neffort between Federal, State and local governments and private sector \nactors.\n  Beyond having insufficient understanding of the complex systems and \ntheir interdependencies, we also have no means to pinpoint what \nvulnerabilities we face or create policies to address vulnerabilities \nor ensure stability. Technology has outpaced our understanding of the \npotential inherent weaknesses or ensuing vulnerabilities. We currently \ncannot assess either the problems or possible solutions.\n  The administration is fully aware of this problem. We confront a \nfundamental national security concern, and we currently lack sufficient \ngovernment coordination and scientific understanding to adequately \naddress it.\n  The President will sign an Executive order in the coming weeks to \naddress the coordination needs of the federal agencies responsible for \ncritical infrastructures. This Executive order establishes the \nPresident's Critical Infrastructure Protection and Continuity Board to \naddress our federal government's policies, procedures and capacity to \nachieve specific policy objectives. This Board will require scientific \nmodeling and simulation capacity to inform policy making and \nimplementation of a framework to ensure adequate protection.\n  The National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center (NISAC) \noffers precisely that scientific capability. For almost a decade two of \nthe Department of Energy National Laboratories, Los Alamos and Sandia \nNational Labs, have been working to model our nations energy and \ntransportation infrastructures. They have also modeled epidemics, \nsimulated anthrax attacks and assisted private sector companies better \nunderstand the infrastructure necessarily for the next generation of \ncell phones.\n  The computing capacity and expertise applied to modeling and \nsimulating the physics of a nuclear explosion can be readily leveraged \nto address the design and protection of our nation's cyber and physical \ninfrastructures.\n  This bill is designed to support the President's forthcoming \nexecutive order by reiterating our key national policy objectives, \nincluding: that the physical or virtual disruption of any of these \ncritical infrastructures should be rare, brief, limited geographically, \nmanageable, and minimally detrimental to the economy, essential human \nand government services, and national security; a public-private \npartnership, involving corporation and non-governmental organizations, \nis necessary to facilitate adequate protection; the need for a \ncomprehensive and effective program to ensure continuity of essential \nFederal functions under all circumstances.\n  The bill also establishes NISAC as a core research and analytical \ntool to support the President's Critical Infrastructure Protection and \nContinuity Board, especially, but not limited to, the Infrastructure \nInterdependencies Committee established in the Executive order.\n  Further, the bill authorizes $8 million for the first year in order \nto expedite the process of creating a structure for data acquisition, \nmodel development and enhanced understanding or our nation's \ninfrastructures and their interdependencies.\n\n[[Page S9126]]\n\n  Our Nation cannot be secure without sufficient understanding of the \ninfrastructures that undergrid our economy and facilitate modern life. \nThe unintentional or overt disruption of any one of these \ninfrastructures could have a cascading effect on other areas. In a \nworst case scenario, such mass disruption could have a severe economic \nor national security impact.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support in ensuring we immediately \napply the best available means to addressing these threats. NISAC can \noffer the appropriate analytical tools to support the President's \nCritical Infrastructure Board. This bill will position and fund NISAC \nin the forthcoming year to fulfill this mission.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1407\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Critical Infrastructures \n     Protection Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Information revolution has transformed the conduct \n     of business and the operations of government as well as the \n     infrastructure relied upon for the defense and national \n     security of the United States.\n       (2) Private business, government, and the national security \n     apparatus increasingly depend on an interdependent network of \n     critical physical and information infrastructures, including \n     telecommunications, energy, financial services, water, and \n     transportation sectors.\n       (3) A continuous national effort is required to ensure the \n     reliable provision of cyber and physical infrastructure \n     services critical to maintaining the national defense, \n     continuity of government, economic prosperity, and quality of \n     life in the United States.\n       (4) This national effort requires extensive modeling and \n     analytic capabilities for purposes of evaluating appropriate \n     mechanisms to ensure the stability of these complex and \n     interdependent systems, and to underpin policy \n     recommendations, so as to achieve the continuous viability \n     and adequate protection of the critical infrastructure of the \n     nation.\n\n     SEC. 3. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) that any physical or virtual disruption of the \n     operation of the critical infrastructures of the United \n     States be rare, brief, geographically limited in effect, \n     manageable, and minimally detrimental to the economy, \n     essential human and government services, and national \n     security of the United States;\n       (2) that actions necessary to achieve the policy stated in \n     paragraph (1) be carried out in a public-private partnership \n     involving corporate and non-governmental organizations; and\n       (3) to have in place a comprehensive and effective program \n     to ensure the continuity of essential Federal Government \n     functions under all circumstances.\n\n     SEC. 4.
