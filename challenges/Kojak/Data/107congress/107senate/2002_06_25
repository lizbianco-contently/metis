Madam President, the retirement system in this country \nleaves a great deal to be desired. We have many people who do not have \nadequate income when they reach the age of retirement. We have some \ncharts that make that case. These charts are based on the 1999 U.S. \ncensus current population survey. They make the case fairly strongly.\n  This first chart is titled ``Private Workers Who Participate in an \nEmployer Sponsored Plan,'' and breaks down the population by race and \nethnicity. When we look at all workers as of 1999, there were 44 \npercent of the private workers who participated in the employer-\nsponsored plan, looking at the entire population. Among white, non-\nHispanic workers, there were 47 percent or nearly half of the \npopulation that had some sort of employer-sponsored plan. That means a \nlittle over half did not. This chart does not include the public-sector \nemployees or the self-employed workers.\n  For other minority groups the numbers are substantially less. For \nblack, non-Hispanic, it is 41 percent; for Asian Pacific islanders and \nother non-Hispanic, 38 percent; for other minority non-Hispanic, 35 \npercent; and among Hispanic workers, it is 27 percent. Therefore, 27 \npercent, slightly more than one fourth of the private-sector Hispanic \nworkers in the country, have an employer-sponsored plan.\n  That is important in my State because we have a large Hispanic \npopulation. When you look around the country and ask, where is the \nproblem the worst as far as inadequate retirement coverage, my State is \nNo. 1 in the Nation for the number of private-sector workers that do \nnot have coverage.\n  The second chart demonstrates the percentage of private-sector \nworkers who work at companies that provide after retirement or a \npension plan. This chart talks of the companies employing these \nworkers.\n  Madam President, 58 percent of all employees work for employers that \nprovide some kind of plan. But then the numbers decline. Among white \nnon-Hispanic, it is higher, and 62 percent of those employees work for \ncompanies that provide some kind of retirement plan; among Hispanic \nworkers, only 40 percent of Hispanic workers nationwide work for \ncompanies that provide some kind of retirement plan. So this is a \nsignificant concern and a significant part of the problem as well.\n\n  The third chart illustrates the percentage of employees who \nparticipate in an employer-sponsored plan when the employer actually \noffers the plan. This is an assessment of how many people actually take \nadvantage of this plan, in these different groups, once they have the \nopportunity. Among all workers, 75 percent nationwide will participate \nand have participated in an employer-sponsored plan if it is offered. \nAgain, it is a little higher for white, non-Hispanic workers--up to 77 \npercent. Among Hispanics, it is 68 percent.\n  The interesting aspect about this is it is much less of a spread \nbetween the average, the ``all worker'' category, 75 percent, and the \nHispanic, which is 68 percent, which makes the obvious case that \nHispanic participation is not significantly different from that of the \nrest of the population when they are offered a plan.\n  The final chart pulls all this data together, puts it all in one \nplace so we can understand it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate the Chair's information.\n  While it is not conclusive, it does indicate that if Hispanic workers \ndo have jobs where the employers offer some type of plan, they tend to \nparticipate. Unfortunately, the data indicates that Hispanics tend to \nwork for employers who do not offer retirement plans. What we need to \ndo is get more employers to offer retirement plans, particularly small \nemployers. That is what the legislation we are developing right now is \nintended to do. I will be proposing that later.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at this issue seriously. I hope we can \nintroduce a bill before the week is out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/25/senate-section/article/S5970-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5970-S5972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     UNITED NATIONS POPULATION FUND\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, now I will focus on the U.N. \npopulation fund. Last year I voted for the Foreign Operations \nconference report. I thought the funds provided there were inadequate \nto meet our pressing needs as we talked about them, but I recognized \nthat the roughly $15 billion would provide help to millions of \ndesperately poor people around the world and at the same time help \nimprove the short-term and long-term security of our own country. I \nvoted for that bill.\n  Here we are 7 months later and some of the most important funding \nprovided in that bill, the $34 million provided for the U.N. population \nfund, is still sitting at the Department of Treasury. It is not helping \npoor people. It is not helping to make America more secure. It is just \nsitting at the Treasury Department.\n  The United Nations population fund works in over 150 countries, where \nit helps give women around the world access to reproductive health care \nand family planning services as well as services to ensure safe \npregnancy and delivery. This population fund, the U.N. population fund, \nplays a critical role in helping prevent the further spread of AIDS. \nThe withholding of U.S. funds, which is what we as a country are \nengaged in right now, only exacerbates the general inadequate health of \npoor women worldwide. It leads to more unwanted pregnancies and to \ndeaths of more and more women during childbirth.\n  Last fall, the Bush administration provided an extra $600,000 to the \nU.N. population fund to help women in Afghanistan, and these funds were \nvery welcome and were certainly used, substantially to provide safe \nbirthing kits, which are very important. They were also used to open \nand upgrade maternity hospitals, which is very important.\n  I want to make clear that the population fund does not perform \nabortions. It does not support the performing of abortions in any way. \nAnyone who suggests that they do has not studied the situation in \ndepth.\n  The House of Representatives passed a conference report on the fiscal \nyear Foreign Operations bill which included $34 million for this \npurpose. It was an overwhelming vote. The Senate approved $40 million \nfor this purpose, also with a lopsided vote. But now, because of \nhearsay, because of unsubstantiated allegations that have been \ndisproved many times, the administration is holding up this critically \nimportant funding.\n  It is the most desperate women in the world who are adversely \naffected by this action; it is not the United Nations itself. The women \nwho would benefit from this funding are the most adversely affected.\n  I believe very strongly that the administration has been willing to \nfollow the law and speed the appropriation of funds for these purposes \nin the past. I cannot understand why we are not moving ahead this year. \nThe emergency supplemental appropriations bill that is presently being \nconferenced provides an excellent opportunity for us to resolve this \nissue.\n  I urge the Senate conferees to ensure that language included in the \nsupplemental passed in the Senate be included in the conference report. \nThat language requires that this money, the $34 million that was \nappropriated last December, be released unless the President certifies \nby July 10 that doing so would violate U.S. law.\n  This is fair. More important, it is the intent of Congress. It is the \nlaw of the land. I urge the administration to follow through in the \nconference.\n\n[[Page S5971]]\n\n  I will be glad to yield to my colleague, but I believe my time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Chair, this half hour is under the control of \nthe Democrats. It is the minority's time this morning so we have \nwhatever time we need, I say to my friend from New Mexico.\n  I ask my friend two questions. The first is on pension reform. The \nSenator is the leader of a task force appointed by the majority leader. \nI acknowledge the fine job he has done.\n  Would the Senator indicate if it is true that a lot of attention has \nbeen focused on pensions and how employees are treated as a result of \nthe Enron debacle?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, in response to the question of my \nfriend from Nevada, that is exactly right. I think the entire country \nwas appalled to see what happened to the pension savings, the \nretirement savings of various Enron employees when that company \ncollapsed. Accordingly, we have spent a lot of time discussing how to \nensure that these funds that are in a pension fund for a worker can be \nsafeguarded so we can avoid this situation in the future. That part of \nthe problem has gotten a lot of rhetorical attention, at least. We have \nstill not taken the necessary actions to solve it. I hope we are able \nto do that in the next few weeks as we consider the legislation that \nhas come out of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nand also legislation that is, I understand, going to be marked up in \nthe Finance Committee.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator also acknowledge what people are saying, \nthat it seems so unfair that people who were working at Enron, who \nweren't so-called bosses, wound up with very little, whereas the \nbosses, the corporate leaders, ended up with millions and millions of \ndollars? Isn't that something they are talking about in New Mexico?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, in response to the question, it \ncertainly is something that is a great concern in my State. I think \npeople tend to lump all these issues together, understandably, because \nthey are all part of a very much larger problem. One is the inadequate \nprotection of the retirement savings of workers. Another issue is the \ninequity in compensation between the top officials of some of these \ncorporations and the average worker. A third is the very unfair \nseverance package arrangements that are made when some of these \ncompanies go bankrupt.\n  How does it happen that the top officials wind up getting severance \npackages, in spite of the financial difficulties of the company, while \nthe people at the very bottom get virtually nothing?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, let me ask the Senator from New Mexico, \nthe chairman of the task force, it is true, is it not, that one of the \nthings you are working on is legislation in conjunction with the \ncommittees of jurisdiction to make sure that in the future when this \ntakes place there will be equity as far as employees are concerned?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, in response to that, we are trying to \nfigure out what can be done in this regard. We essentially do not think \nGovernment should be dictating at what level companies compensate \nworkers. But we do think the various laws we pass in Congress should be \nwritten in such a way that we don't provide additional benefits for \nextremely lavish compensation to high officials and inadequate \ncompensation to people who are working every day in the bowels of these \ncompanies.\n  Mr. REID. I also say to the Senator, based on the second part of the \nstatement he made, I congratulate, commend, and applaud the Senator \nfrom New Mexico for bringing to the Senate's attention something that \nhas been going on now for several years; that is, the inability of the \nUnited Nations to help poor women around the world with just basic \ninformation and educational opportunities as to why they get pregnant, \nand as to why they are not taken care of when they are pregnant. But \ndoes the Senator acknowledge that this has turned into some abortion \nissue that has nothing to do with family planning on the international \nscene? Is that true?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, my response to that question is the \nSenator from Nevada is exactly right. I think there is important \nassistance that the overwhelming majority of the House and Senate would \nlike to see provided worldwide to these poor women who need assistance \nto deal with their very real issues of giving birth and planning their \nfamilies for the future. We have appropriated money. That money has \nbeen appropriated now for 7 or 8 months, and it is sitting at the \nDepartment of the Treasury. I don't understand why they can't go ahead \nand spend that money as it was intended. I hope very much that happens \nin the very near future.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from New Mexico, if someone is really \nconcerned about abortion, it would seem to me they should consider ways \nto help women be educated so there are less unintended pregnancies. \nIsn't that one of the main goals of international family planning?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, in response to that question, that is \nclearly my understanding of the main goal of international family \nplanning. It is a worthwhile goal. I think clearly we do not want \ndesperately poor families and desperately poor women to find themselves \nwith unwanted pregnancies because of lack of information. What we are \ntrying to do is get assistance to this population fund so that we can \nprovide good information and assistance to these desperately poor \nwomen.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator also acknowledge that where we have had \ninternational family planning in the past healthier babies are born and \nless babies are born? Is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, again, in response to the question, I \nbelieve there is a record of success with many of these programs, and \nwith many of the efforts that have been made to this population fund. I \nthink it makes good sense for the United States as the largest, most \nprosperous country in the world to participate with other countries--\nwith our friends and allies around the world--in supporting this \neffort. That is all we are trying to do. Our support is not \noverwhelming as compared to a lot of countries. But it is important, \nand we should provide it.\n\n  Mr. REID. I also ask my friend, is it not true that the Congress, in \ngood faith, has appropriated these moneys, and now they are being held \nup by the administration?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, in response, that is certainly my \ninformation. My information is that the money was appropriated, and \nthat it was appropriated last December when we passed the foreign \noperations appropriations bill. There is no reason that money should \nnot be released for the intended use. That is what the law requires. I \nhope very much that the administration will move ahead. We are fast \napproaching the date when we are going to do another foreign operations \nappropriations bill. I don't think we serve the intended purpose by \njust delaying and delaying the use of these funds.\n  Mr. REID. It is fair to say, is it not, that each day that goes by \nthere are more people around the world and more women around the world \nwho have this lack of information and unintended pregnancies and \ncomplicated pregnancies that could be helped by virtue of these moneys \nif, in fact, they were coming forward.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, again, in response to the question, I \nthink it is easy for us to believe, when we are sitting here in a nice \nair-conditioned Senate Chamber, that there is no urgency and think \nthese are all sort of theoretical problems out there and there is no \nurgency in getting about trying to deal with them. I think the reality \nis very different for a lot of the women to whom my friend in Nevada is \nreferring.\n  The reality is they have to either have assistance now or live with \nthe consequences of not having the assistance. For that reason, I think \nit is very important we move ahead immediately.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I yield the remainder of our time to the \nSenator from Montana, Mr. Baucus.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: I wanted to \nknow how much time there is in morning business, and if there is any \ntime\n\n[[Page S5972]]\n\nfor the Republican side in morning business time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 4 minutes remaining. \nThere is no time reserved for the minority side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: I would like to \nrequest of our leader--I am endeavoring to reach Senator Levin. I \nunderstand he will soon be available to give me some guidance as to \nwhat he desires as Chair. We are anxious to move ahead on this bill. I \nrealize certain of our colleagues have extremely sensitive matters to \nspeak to--the tragic wildfires experienced out West and the Amtrak \nsituation. I am not sure what my good friend from Montana is going to \naddress. But, at the same time, I am hopeful that with the support of \nour leadership, we can outline a course of action today so the Kennedy \namendment--I spoke to Senator Kennedy late last night--can be voted on \nat a time that is convenient, preceded by, say, maybe 30 minutes of \nfinal remarks by Senator Kennedy and our side; that we are able to go \nto the missile defense amendment, which I shared with the chairman last \nnight; and, that we have today at least, say, 4 hours of debate on that \nwith the hope we will vote this afternoon somewhere around 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I would say to my friend, the comanager of \nthis bill, that Senator Levin isn't due here until 10:30. We are \nsupposed to take up the Defense bill at 10:30.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I am not hearing the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. That is when we are supposed to take up the Defense bill. \nHe will be here at or about 10:30. We, through staff, asked last night \nif the Republicans wanted any time for morning business. They said they \ndidn't want any; they have a conference this morning. That is why the \none-half hour was devoted to the Democrats. Had they wanted more time, \nwe would have come in one-half hour earlier.\n  I ask unanimous consent that--we used all of Senator Baucus' time in \nthis colloquy--Senator Baucus will be recognized for up to 5 minutes to \nspeak as if in morning business.\n  I say to my friend from Virginia if Senator Hutchison and Senator \nCraig wish time, I am sure Senator Levin would have no problem giving \nthem 5 minutes each. Is that fair enough?\n  Mr. WARNER. I think that is fair enough.\n  Mr. REID. Following the statement of the Senator from Montana, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Texas be recognized for 5 \nminutes, and following her the Senator from Idaho be recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, I think that is a very \ngood reconciliation in the interest of time. But let us say we would \nreturn to the bill at 10 minutes to----\n  Mr. REID. Why don't we return when we finish the morning business, \nwhich would be about a quarter till?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is fine.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, reserving the right to object--I ask the \nindulgence of my friend--if I could have about 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/25/senate-section/article/S5972-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I rise today to talk about Amtrak. \nOur Amtrak national rail passenger system is teetering on the brink of \nbankruptcy. They have said they need $200 million in operating cash or \nthe entire system will grind to a halt very soon. The effect of such a \nshutdown would be devastating.\n  With the Independence Day weekend approaching, and the number of \nairline flights slashed since September 11, families throughout the \nNation are counting on Amtrak to get them to their destinations. If \nAmtrak is not running, those families will add to the millions of cars \nalready expected to crowd our Nation's highways.\n  Amtrak has already received more than 100,000 reservations for the \nholiday weekend. Reservations account for about half of Amtrak's \nexpected passenger load.\n  I have noticed from articles in the paper that people are already \nbeginning to question whether Amtrak service is going to be there, so \nthey are already suffering cancellations, which adds to the deficits we \nalready have.\n  I have always been a supporter of Amtrak, but sometimes it has been \nhard because Amtrak has not really come to grips with the \ninefficiencies in the system. I hope Mr. Gunn, the new CEO of Amtrak--\nand I appreciate so much his willingness to come in and take over this \nrailroad operation at this time--will make a difference. He has already \nfired mid-level managers. Certainly, I think anybody looking at the \nlabor situation in Amtrak would realize that the rail unions really are \nout of line with other workers in our country. Amtrak has never engaged \nin tough negotiations with its unions, even 4 years ago, when we were \ntrying to reauthorize Amtrak. As a result, labor costs are out of line \nwith other workers in our country. A 5-year severance package for \nAmtrak employees, as in other rail unions, is way beyond the norm for \nmost union workers or other workers in our country.\n  I do hope the unions will work with us to try to bring efficiency in \nboth management, administration, contracting out, and overall severance \npackages that are in an alarming condition and have put us in such a \nprecarious situation.\n  Amtrak has not come forward with its true financial condition in many \ninstances. Mortgaging Penn Station last year was quite irresponsible. I \ndidn't like it at all. I think we should have met this head on.\n  On the other hand, there are some Members of Congress who have been \nso recalcitrant about Amtrak; I can understand Amtrak's unwillingness \nto come and bare its financial soul to Members of Congress when they \nknow they are going to get their heads chopped off.\n  We need to step back and take a responsible approach. We need a \npassenger rail system. It is part of a multimodal system that will \nserve the needs of all of the people. A skeleton that would go across \nthe top of our country, down the west coast, across the bottom/southern \npart of the country, up to the east coast with one line right down the \nmiddle would give us a solid national rail system where States could \nthen form compacts and feed into those systems. In my State of Texas, \nthe DART, the Dallas Area Rapid Transit, is feeding its train into the \nAmtrak system.\n  Those are the possibilities we have if we know we have a dependable \nnational rail passenger system. This means a whole system. It does not \nmean just the Northeast corridor.\n  One of the problems we have had is the rest of the system has been \nstarved year after year while the Northeast corridor has gotten the \nlion's share of funding. We must acknowledge once and for all this is \ngoing be a national system. We are all going to be in this together.\n  All of us who believe in a national rail system should say: This is \nnot going to be a piece of a system that is subsidized heavily and \nanother piece that isn't. We need to consider it as a system. We need \nto fund it well.\n  Some people have said: We have to subsidize Amtrak too much. We have \nbeen subsidizing Amtrak to the tune of $520 million annually; whereas \nwe have subsidized highways to the tune of $30 billion, and $10 billion \nper year on aviation.\n\n[[Page S5973]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. We have seen the subsidies. Some are user fees but \nsome are not. We just bailed out the airline industry because we knew \nit was essential for our economy. In Texas, we send billions of dollars \nto the highway trust fund. We get 88 cents on the dollar back. We are \nsubsidizing other States' highways.\n  I don't mean that I want Texas to have to get 100 percent. Our \nNational Highway System is built on a national system concept. That is \nwhat we need for Amtrak. We need to say: Yes, some States are getting \nmore than others. Maybe States should step to the plate more. I would \nbe willing to say that my State should step to the plate and help in \nthese subsidies, just as I think every State that receives service \nshould. That would be a worthy reform.\n  The bottom line is, this should be a national system that we support \nas part of our national security, our homeland security, a multimodal \nsystem that provides transportation for all the people of our country \nin a convenient way and in a way that is most necessary.\n  We have aviation; we have highways. Rail is an important third part \nof our overall transportation system.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Idaho is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/25/senate-section/article/S5973-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WESTERN WILDFIRES\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I rise this morning--and I will return \ntomorrow and the next day--to talk about a story and a saga playing its \nway across the western landscape that you and I watched yesterday and \non the morning news. We saw the headlines in all of the papers that \nsaid, Monstrous Wildfires Near Arizona Town; Show Low, Arizona, and The \nThousands of Citizens Who Live There at Risk.\n  What I want to do for a brief period is stage this as the great John \nWayne movie ``Rio Bravo,'' where John Wayne captures the outlaw Joe \nBernadette and sticks him in jail waiting for the judge to get the town \nto try the outlaw. It is the saga of the white hats and the black hats.\n  For two decades we have been playing the white hat and the black hat \ngame when it comes to the management of our western public lands and \nespecially the timber lands of the West.\n  In the early 1990s, scientists came together and said: ``If we don't \nbegin a concerted effort of active management and fuel reduction on the \nfloor of western great basin forests, they will burn in wildfire.'' \nThat is an exact quote, well over a decade ago, when the experts saw \nthat the lack of management and the shutdown of our public lands would \nsome day spur us into wildfires.\n  Not only did it spur us into wildfires, the scenario those scientists \ndid not plug in was that during the decade when we shut the public \nlands down, all in the name of the environment, we began to inhabit \nthem. Every little piece of land that was nonpublic got a beautiful \nhome built on it, as people wanted to retreat into what we called the \nurban-wildland interface, to have their little piece of that wild west \nthat was left staged in the movie of ``Rio Bravo.''\n  The great tragedy is, there is no wild west today. It is an \nurbanizing West with thousands of people in it wanting to live in those \nlands that have built up fuel loads on the floor of the forests that \nare equivalent to tens of thousands of gallons of gasoline per acre.\n  You and I have seen on the television the last few days the monster \nfire of Arizona that consumed Heber, AZ, that now has taken over 325 \nhomes, that may take Show Low, AZ, today, rolling on across the \nlandscape, burning up those thousands of gallons of equivalent fuel per \nacre on the ground. This is so dramatic, the President flies out today \nto view the carnage.\n  It isn't just the homes that are gone. It is the landscape that is \ngone. It is the wildlife habitat. It is the watershed--all gone, not \nfor 5 years, not 10 years, but in the arid Southwest gone for 100 \nyears. Why? Because man in his infinite wisdom said, two or three \ndecades ago, all in the name of the environment, that we would no \nlonger enter the forests. We would no longer thin the forests. We would \nno longer clean the floors, all in the name of leaving the land alone.\n  Now we go to Colorado, Durango, CO, where a fire is just a few miles \nfrom that beautiful mining town. Between Colorado and Arizona and New \nMexico, we have lost over 507 homes this year, this spring. It isn't \neven summer yet. It isn't even late summer. It isn't the late July and \nAugust of the hot weathers of the Great Basin timeframe in which most \nof these lands normally burn.\n  If this were a tornado, if this were in Louisiana or across Florida, \nit would have wiped out an entire landscape and thousands of homes or \nhundreds of homes would be gone and we would have a national disaster. \nWe would have all kinds of focus on it, how tragic it is. But somehow \nthis has gotten less attention, even though the West is filled with \nsmoke today.\n  It should never have become a white hat/black hat issue. But for two \ndecades, it became that. Right here on the floor of the Senate that \nvery issue got debated. It was them versus us, the chain saw versus \nBambi. Bambi won. Now Bambi is losing. Bambi's home is gone. The place \nshe sleeps is gone. The place she drinks her water is gone. The \nwildlife are in danger--in an area in Arizona where two fires came \ntogether, over 300,000 acres. That is an area that is 500 miles square, \nas big as the whole L.A. Basin. If that is not a national disaster, I \ndon't know what is. That is just Arizona.\n\n  Madam President, 1.5 million acres have all burned in the Great Basin \nWest this year, and here we are just in the last days of June. At this \ntime in 2000, 7.3 million acres burned in the West, and we have already \nforgotten about it; we had only burned 1.2 million acres.\n  Well, the story will be continued. Let's call this ``Rio Bravo.'' \nLet's call this a time when America comes together to refocus its \nintent on public land policy. I am going to be back with charts and \nmaps tomorrow to visit with my colleagues about this national crisis \nthat burns its way across the landscape of Arizona, New Mexico, and \nColorado because what I am fearful of is, come late August, it will be \nin my home State of Idaho, which lost a million acres of land in 2000, \nand nobody talked about it because it was in the back country and with \nno homes burned. There was no national television coverage to watch a \nsmoldering home. But Bambi lost her home, and Bambi's cousins lost \ntheir homes, and a million acres in Idaho today will be decades in \ncoming back.\n  So why don't we get real and recognize that in managing our public \nlands there must be a balance. It cannot be either/or or all or nothing \nbecause when that happens, Mother Nature is not always the best steward \nof the land. Today in Arizona, Mother Nature is making headlines and \nshe is calling herself Monster Wildfire. That is Mother Nature, but not \nin her finest hour.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/25/senate-section/article/S5973-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S5974]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the two managers of the bill have asked \nthat I propound a unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending Kennedy amendment be \ntemporarily set aside and that the Senate resume its consideration at \n12 today and that at that time there be 30 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Kennedy amendment. That would terminate at 12:30 when we \nrecess for the party conferences. The time would be equally divided in \nthe usual form prior to a vote in relation to the amendment at 2:30 \ntoday. The time from 2:15 to 2:30 would also be equally divided in the \nusual form. Further, there would be no amendments in order prior to the \nKennedy amendment at 2:30 with the exception that Senator Warner be \nrecognized for a motion to table the Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. There will now be general debate on the bill. From 12 to \n12:30, the time will be spent on the Kennedy amendment equally divided. \nWhen we come back from the party conference at 2:15, there will be an \nadditional 15 minutes equally divided, with the vote occurring at 2:30 \non the Warner motion to table the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. No objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, very briefly, we are making progress on \nthe national Defense authorization bill. We have the pending amendment \nof Senator Kennedy which will now be voted upon with a motion to table \nat 2:30. We expect we will at that point begin a debate on missile \ndefense, but the process is not yet worked out for the amendments \nrelative to that as to the order and how they will be offered. There \nwill be some discussion on that matter between now and then. We are \nworking with Senators on the amendments to see if we can act on \namendments later today and possibly clear amendments. I continue to be \noptimistic, with our leader's assistance, with the cooperation of all \nSenators, that we can complete action on this bill in a timely manner \nthis week.\n\n  My good friend from Virginia, the ranking member of our committee, is \nworking hard to achieve that same result.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have worked with my leader with regard to the unanimous \nconsent that was adopted. I will not send my amendment to the desk, but \nI intend to initiate debate.\n  As I understand from the chairman, there will be a rejoinder on the \nother side and we will proceed on this issue until the hour of 12 \no'clock. It is also my expectation that the chairman and I, with our \nrespective leaders, Senators Daschle and Lott, will meet prior to the \ncaucuses for the purpose of establishing a procedure by which my \namendment is to be sent to the desk and considered by the Senate. Am I \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LEVIN. There is an intention, as I have shared with my colleague \nfrom Virginia, to offer a second-degree amendment to that amendment. \nThat is what we will be discussing with the leaders between now and 12 \no'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I don't know that that was in the form of a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was not a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. WARNER. I simply stated for the convenience of the Senate the \nprocedure we will follow between now and the hour of 2:30, at which \ntime I will be recognized for the purpose of tabling the Kennedy \namendment.\n  I encourage colleagues on my side to come forward. I know Senator \nAllen is anxious to speak to the Kennedy amendment, as are Senator Bond \nand Senator Fred Thompson. There will be concluding remarks by our \ndistinguished colleague from Wyoming. That will take place from 12 to \n12:30 and again from 2:15 to 2:30.\n  At this point in time, I will address the question of missile defense \nin the amendment I intend to submit to the Senate. Since I will not now \nsend it to the desk, I will read it. This is an amendment proposed by \nmyself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Allard, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \nSmith of New Hampshire, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \nRoberts, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Helms, Mr. McCain, and Mr. \nNickles.\n  I read the amendment as follows:\n\n       On page 217, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1010. ADDITIONAL AMOUNT FOR BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE OR \n                   COMBATING TERRORISM IN ACCORDANCE WITH NATIONAL \n                   SECURITY PRIORITIES OF THE PRESIDENT.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--In addition to other \n     amounts authorized to be appropriated by other provisions of \n     this division, there is hereby authorized to be appropriated \n     for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2003, \n     $814,300,000 for whichever of the following purposes the \n     President determines that the additional amount is necessary \n     in the national security interests of the United States:\n       (1) Research, development, test, and evaluation for \n     ballistic missile defense programs of the Department of \n     Defense.\n       (2) Activities of the Department of Defense for combating \n     terrorism at home and abroad.\n       (b) Offset.--The total amount authorized to be appropriated \n     under the other provisions of this division is hereby reduced \n     by $814,300,000 to reflect the amounts that the Secretary \n     determines unnecessary by reason of a revision of assumptions \n     regarding inflation that are applied as a result of the \n     midsession review of the budget conducted by the Office of \n     Management and Budget during the spring and early summer of \n     2002.\n\n  In simple language, it is annually the function of the Department of \nDefense to make certain assumptions with regard to those moneys that \nthey require for purposes of, for example, pay, and other large cash \nexpenditures in a fiscal year, the amount that inflation may erode the \nability to pay those sums.\n  In this case, fortunately, this country has experienced a low \ninflation rate, lower than anticipated, and therefore there is \nremaining within the 2002 budget sufficient cash, in my judgment and \nthe judgment of others working in the Department of Defense, to cover \nthis amendment. Therefore, this amendment will not dislodge any of the \nprograms or authorizations as now exist in the bill before the Senate. \nI make that clear. No Senator should think his or her programs which \nthey have fought hard for as part of this bill will be reduced in \namount as a consequence of this amendment.\n  The amendment I will submit, hopefully this afternoon, with the \nconcurrence of the leadership, on behalf of myself and other Members \nwhom I enumerated, is an important step to work directly on problems in \nthe Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2003 as reported out of \nthe committee which have led many Republican committee members, \nincluding this one, to have no other possibility than to vote against a \nbill on which we had worked for the better part of a year.\n  That is a very difficult decision, when members of a committee, large \nnumbers of members in our committee, working in a bipartisan fashion, \nchairman and ranking member together, formulate a bill, and then when \nit is brought to a markup session, we are faced with a realization that \nan element of that bill is so totally in opposition to what the \nCommander in Chief of the United States, namely the President, has sent \nto the Congress for the purposes of fulfilling his rights as Commander \nin Chief in the defense of this country. That decision faced by us, and \na significant number of Members, forced members to vote against that \nbill that we worked on for a year. We did so because of the drastic \ncuts and the restrictions made to missile defense by a narrow margin of \nthe majority in the markup session.\n  I recognize the importance of passing a Defense authorization bill \nduring times of war with broad bipartisan support. It sends a clear \nsignal of support to our men and women in uniform and expresses the \ncommitment of the Senate to fighting the global war against terrorism \nin defending our homeland.\n  In order to have such broad bipartisan support, we have to pass a \nbill that supports our President--again, our Commander in Chief--and \nhis fundamental priorities for defense. In its current form, this bill \nfails that test. The Secretary of Defense confirmed by a letter to the \nchairman that he will advise the President to veto the Defense \nauthorization bill if the missile defense provision contained in our \nbill is adopted by the Congress.\n  This view is strongly reiterated in the statement of administration \npolicy on our bill which notes that:\n\n\n[[Page S5975]]\n\n\n       The administration's missile defense program is a carefully \n     balanced effort to defend the American people, our deployed \n     forces, and our friends and allies, against a growing missile \n     threat. The provision of S. 2514 would undermine this \n     critical defense effort.\n\n  What a tragedy for our Nation, what a tragedy for the Armed Forces, \nto see this precisely at this time, with our Nation at war, when we \nneed to demonstrate consensus and support. Now is not the time to send \na signal that we are lessening our resolve in defending this Nation \nfrom all known and recognized threats. We must be prepared as a nation. \nHistory will be our judge.\n\n  The amendment I will offer would restore the funding reductions to \nmissile defense made during the committee's consideration of the bill. \nThis amendment would provide an additional $814 million-plus to restore \nthe funding taken from the President's request for missile defense \nduring markup and allow the President the flexibility to spend the \nmoney for missile defense and activities of the Department of Defense \nto counter terrorism both at home and abroad.\n  That is very important. This is basically parallel to what we did \nlast year on the Defense authorization bill. I will address that in \ngreater detail momentarily, but it gives the flexibility to the \nPresident of the United States and his Secretary of Defense to allocate \nthe $814 million-plus in accordance with those two objectives.\n  This is a reasonable compromise, I believe, to the position taken by \nthe majority during the course of the markup. Again, it is identical in \nform to the compromise we reached last year on this issue.\n  At the outset of this discussion, I want to remind Senators present \nof a measure we passed in 1999 by a vote of 97 to 3, a measure that was \nsubsequently signed into law by President Clinton, the National Missile \nDefense Act of 1999, referred to as the Cochran Act, as he was the \nprincipal drafter and sponsor of that very important law. The act is \nshort and not very complicated. It does two things very clearly.\n  First, the Cochran Act establishes a policy of deploying, ``as soon \nas is technologically possible,'' an effective defense of the territory \nof the United States--that is all 50 States and the U.S. territories--\nfrom limited ballistic missile attack.\n  Madam President, 97 Senators are on record supporting that policy.\n  A second part of that law reiterates a longstanding policy that the \nUnited States will seek further reduction in Russian nuclear forces.\n  During the debate on this act, some contended that its two policy \ndeclarations have equal stature and status. Equal or not, I think all \nwould agree both are important statements of policy. The amendment to \ninclude a statement of policy on arms reduction was offered because \nsome Senators feared that deployment of a missile defense could lead to \na new offensive arms race. But President Bush did not see any \ninconsistency in these two goals and has pursued both vigorously. He \nhas made missile defense one of his top national security priorities, \nand he has dramatically--and, I would add, appropriately--expanded \nfunding to expedite the development and deployment of those important \ndefenses.\n  At the same time, he sought to restructure this Nation's relationship \nwith Russia. He outlined this policy in a landmark speech at the \nNational Defense University in May of 2001:\n\n       Today's Russia is not yesterday's Soviet Union. We need a \n     new framework that allows us to build missile defenses, and \n     that encourage still further cuts in nuclear weapons.\n\n  President Bush has since engaged Russian President Putin on a regular \nand intensive basis to move the Russian-American relationship beyond \ncold war hostility to one built on openness, shared goals, and shared \nresponsibility. President Bush has been extraordinarily successful in \nthis effort.\n  Last December, the President announced his intent to withdraw from \nthe 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. This is a treaty which \nspecifically prevented both Russia and the United States from \ndeveloping and deploying effective missile defenses. Critics feared \nthat President Bush's action would lead to a harsh Russian \ndenunciation. In fact, Russia reacted hardly at all.\n\n  President Putin announced that the U.S. move was a mistake, but it \nwould not affect the improved United States-Russian relationship.\n  Many missile defense critics feared that withdrawing from the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty would trigger a new arms race. Yet on May 24, \nat the summit in Moscow, President Bush and President Putin signed a \nlandmark arms control agreement.\n  This breakthrough treaty, negotiated in a period of just several \nmonths, will reduce nuclear arsenals from their present levels of about \n6,000 strategic warheads to 1,700 to 2,200 strategic warheads over the \nnext decade. This is the most dramatic reduction in strategic weapons \nhistory.\n  Far from disrupting the United States-Russian relationship, \nwithdrawing from the ABM Treaty and developing missile defenses have \nallowed us to develop defenses for the United States, its allies and \nfriends, and its deployed troops, against the real and increasing \nthreat of missile attack, while at the same time our relationship with \nRussia appears to grow in a positive manner.\n  So President Bush has taken to heart both policy statements in the \nNational Missile Defense Act of 1999. He has made missile defense a \nhigh priority and is doing all he can to expedite the development and \ndeployment of missile defenses. And he has achieved the goal of further \nreductions in Russian nuclear forces.\n  Now it is up to us, the Senate and the Congress, to do our part. The \nPresident has made a reasonable and balanced request for missile \ndefense this year. The request of $7.6 billion is smaller than last \nyear's request and smaller than last year's appropriated level.\n  The House of Representatives fully funded this request level. In \nfact, they have increased it slightly. Yet the bill of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee cuts over $800 million from the effort to develop \nand deploy missile defenses. Yes, against that background, our \ncommittee went ahead and cut $800-plus million.\n  This bill would impose reductions that impede progress, increase \nprogram risk, and undermine the effort to provide for the rapid \ndevelopment and deployment of missile defenses for our Nation, our \nallies and friends, and our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen \ndeployed overseas. The administration asserts quite accurately, in my \nview, that the committee bill undercuts missile defense efforts:\n\n     . . . by severely reducing the program's workforce, \n     significantly impairing DOD's ability to effectively \n     integrate components currently under deployment, delaying \n     boost-phase defense efforts, hindering early deployment \n     contingent capability, undermining efforts to address \n     countermeasures, and slowing key sensor programs.\n\n  That is the assessment of the Secretary of Defense.\n  The bill before the Senate would cut hundreds of millions of dollars \nfrom theater missile defense, programs to defend against short-, \nmedium- and intermediate-range missiles.\n  That is the threat that is most identified as impairing the ability \nof our forward-deployed forces to pursue their missions without the \nthreat of missile attack. These are the very missiles our troops faced \nin the Persian Gulf war over a decade ago, and we know well of the \ncasualties that our forces, U.S. forces and indeed those of our allies, \ntook as a consequence of the short-range Scud missiles fired \nindiscriminately by Saddam Hussein.\n  Today we have some improved defenses but not adequate defenses \nagainst these short-range weapons.\n  Last September we suffered a grievous attack on our Nation. Many \nlives and much property were lost in that attack. On that terrible day \nwe also lost our uniquely American feeling of invulnerability. Homeland \nsecurity is now, without a doubt, our top priority. Missile defense is \nan integral part of homeland defense.\n  The most recent national intelligence estimate on missile threats--\nthat is January of this year--states:\n\n       The probability that a missile with a weapon of mass \n     destruction will be used against U.S. forces or interests is \n     higher today than during most of the cold war, and will \n     continue to grow as the capabilities of potential adversaries \n     mature.\n\n  George Tenet, head of the CIA, during his testimony to the Armed \nServices Committee earlier this year, made the point that missile \nthreats have sometimes evolved much faster than\n\n[[Page S5976]]\n\npredicted and confirm the view expressed in the national intelligence \nestimate that I just quoted that both terrorism and missile threats \nmust be taken very seriously.\n  I understand and respectfully disagree with those who argue that \nevery dollar we spend on missile defense is one dollar we don't spend \nprotecting our shores and harbors.\n  That is precisely what the defense of our Nation against missile \nattack does--protects our shores. It protects our harbors, our cities, \nour towns, our villages, and our people from the world's most terrible \nweapons.\n  As we did last year, this amendment would provide flexibility for the \nPresident to use the additional funds as he sees fit to defend this \nNation from missile defense and the Department of Defense activities in \ncounterterrorism. It is a discretion that is very much needed by the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense. And it parallels exactly what \nwe did last year.\n  I say to my colleagues that this amendment offers a reasonable \ncompromise on an issue that has divided the Armed Services Committee \nfor the past 2 years, and continues, regrettably, to divide the Senate. \nThis is the same formula that we used last year to heal a serious rift \nin the committee and the Senate, and thereby bring the bill to the \nfloor on a bipartisan basis.\n  I note that this amendment differs in one important aspect from the \none we passed last year. Last year, we simply added $1.3 billion to the \ndefense top line. This year, the amendment does not increase the \nadministration's budget request. It does not put money on top. Rather, \nit takes advantage of the fact that the administration will conduct its \nannual midyear review of inflation assumptions, including those used to \ncraft the defense budget request.\n  I have been assured that the new inflation savings that will result \nfrom this abuse will be more than adequate to cover this added amount \nfor homeland defense. The amendment provides an offset based on these \nanticipated inflation savings.\n  I commend Chairman Levin for the statesmanship he displayed on the \nissue last year at the time I brought the amendment up which closed the \nrift between the aisles. Our bill came to the floor last September. The \nPentagon and the World Trade Center were still burning, and we were \nabout to embark on a war against the forces of international terrorism. \nOur distinguished chairman, Mr. Levin, used these eloquent words during \nthe debate last year on this amendment:\n\n       As important as the funding that we provide is, there is \n     something else that is critically important. That is the \n     unity of purpose that we showed as we entered into the \n     current struggle. Debate on a bill such as this is an \n     inherent part of our democracy. But, in one regard, we \n     operate differently in times of national emergency. We set \n     aside those differences we cannot reach.\n\n  I think the spirit of that very important statement by our chairman \nprevails today, and should be the guideline--the guiding factor--when \neach Senator eventually votes on this measure. Today, we remain at war, \nand that unity is just as important today as it was last September.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It is a fair, \nbalanced compromise offered in the same spirit of unity that moved us \nforward last year, and which can be the basis for moving us forward \nagain today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I wonder if my friend from Virginia would \nclarify a few factual parts of his proposed amendment.\n  The Senator from Virginia said that he has been assured that the \ninflation savings which will result from the midterm review will be \nsufficient to cover $814 million. I am wondering where that assurance \ncame from, because whichever approach we adopt, that is an important \npart. Where was that assurance? Who gave the Senator that assurance?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. I went \nto the Department of Defense early one morning around 7:30 or quarter \nto 8 and spent the better part of an hour with the Secretary of Defense \nand his top budget people. I wanted to make certain that if I were to \nformulate this amendment along those lines--I concede to the chairman \nthat it was my idea, and it caught them a little bit by surprise--the \nSecretary said he would like to consider it. That he did. He went back \nin his own internal system and eventually he conveyed to me the message \nthat the amendment as I have given him in draft form would be \nacceptable to him and the administration.\n  I did concur that the calculations to be performed by the President's \nOffice of Management and Budget would enable this amendment to \nauthorize those funds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The $814 million that the Senator assumes in his amendment \nmay or may not materialize, if the midterm review is not completed. But \nhas the Senator from Virginia, as I understand it, been assured at this \npoint prior to the midterm review that those savings will be \nforthcoming in inflation review?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, these are very good questions. I want to \nanswer them very precisely.\n  The midyear review to which the Senator referred conducted by OMB is \nin progress. He is correct. While the review is not formally complete, \nwe have been assured--that is, this Senator has been assured by the \nadministration--that the revision of the inflation assumptions will--I \nrepeat ``will''--provide ample funds to cover the additional allocation \nfor missile defense and DOD activities to combat terrorism as framed in \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. One further clarification: That came directly from the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If it turns out otherwise when the midterm review is \ncompleted, despite that best estimate on the part of the Secretary of \nDefense, will the amendment still authorize the expenditure of that \n$814 million in the ways specified? In other words, if it turns out to \nbe inaccurate and there is only $600 million in savings, am I not \ncorrect that the amendment would nonetheless authorize the $814 \nmillion?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. On its face, it would do so. In the interim, I say \nto the chairman, the appropriations process will have a chance to \nreview the midterm OMB analysis.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But the Senator's amendment, as I understand it, is not \ncontingent on that amount of inflation savings being available. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. WARNER. It is not contingent; that is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And if the net savings turned out to be $400 million \ninstead of $814 million, then would the Secretary be required to make \ncuts in other programs?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, that is a question that I would reserve \nfor the moment. But I am confident that option will not occur. If I \nmay----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Because the Senator from Virginia is confident?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The savings----\n  Mr. WARNER. Are going to be sufficient.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But my question is--if it turns out otherwise, there have \nto be cuts made somewhere, under the Senator's amendment, as he has \njust responded. He is not adding any money, so there must be cuts made \nsomewhere. And those cuts, of course, could then come in areas that we \nhave tried to protect, including operations and maintenance, readiness, \nand a number of other areas of which this committee has been very \nprotective.\n  One of my concerns about the language of this amendment is that it is \nnot contingent upon savings being available. It assumes those savings \nare available. And whether or not they are forthcoming, this money is \nauthorized, as I understand it. So that is one of the concerns I have \nabout this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I want to be extremely careful in my \nresponse. I will be meeting with the Secretary of Defense in about an \nhour's time. I want to clarify the chairman's question by asking it \ndirectly to him and providing the Senate, this afternoon, as this \ndebate continues, a clear response to the chairman's question.\n  If I might add a bit here about this process, the administration uses \ncertain inflation assumptions in building its budget, including its \ndefense budget, to assure that the Government can buy the goods and \nservices it needs. If inflation is lower than anticipated, the budget \nrequest is a little higher than needed to buy the required goods and \nservices.\n\n[[Page S5977]]\n\n  When a midyear review determines the inflation rate is lower than \nanticipated, the Secretary of Defense identifies budgeted funds that \nare no longer required as a result of the inflation--they refer to it \nas a bonus. Since they are deemed to be excess, there is no \nprogrammatic impact resulting from the inflation savings being used.\n  What happens if the new inflation assumptions are wrong and savings \ndo not materialize? This borders on the Senator's question. Won't \nprograms be affected then? Inflation assumptions are just that: \nassumptions made based on the best information available at the time. \nThe information used during the midyear review is more recent and \nprovides a better basis for inflation assessments than those made \nalmost a year ago when the 2003 budget was being built.\n  The same question can be asked about any budget at this time. What \nhappens to programs if inflation is higher than expected? I would note \nthat the Department of Defense routinely takes advantage of inflation \nsavings, as do the authorization and Appropriations Committees in both \nthe markup and conference process. So this is not a new source of \nfunds.\n  I would also note that the path taken by the House on missile defense \nis quite different than that of the Senate. The use of this source will \nbe debated and resolved in the context of our conference, if adopted by \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nStrategic Systems, I have had the opportunity, over the course of many \nhearings and many briefings, to look closely at our missile defense \nprogram, and also to recommend to the committee that we make these \nreductions.\n  All of these recommendations were based upon careful scrutiny of the \nprograms. They were based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of \nthe programs going forward, and, in addition, a sense of trying to \navoid duplicative costs, ill-defined programs, those areas in which \nmoney might be spent but there is no clear indication of the product \nthat was going to be purchased. In fact, some purchases seem to be \npremature because the testing of the products had not been \naccomplished. So this process has been a long one, and it has resulted \nin specific recommendations that today we are considering on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  I will make some general points about what is in this bill because it \nrepresents a significant commitment to missile defense, both theater \nmissile defense and national missile defense, which now have been \namalgamated in the administration's approach which they describe as a \nlayered defense: the boost phase, midcourse phase, and terminal phase.\n  We have made a significant commitment of dollars in this bill to \nmissile defense, and those points should be made.\n  First, the Department of Defense estimates that in this year they \nwill spend about $4.2 billion. They expect to spend that for missile \ndefense, leaving $4 billion of funds to be carried over to the next \nfiscal year, 2003.\n  We recommend, in this bill before us today, $6.8 billion of new \nfunding for fiscal year 2003, giving the Department of Defense more \nthan $10 billion available for spending next year on missile defense. \nThat is a significant commitment to missile defense, and one that is \nsupported by this Senator and, I am sure, by others. It is probably \ntwice what will be spent this year.\n  To characterize $10 billion of available resources for missile \ndefense next year as deep and damaging cuts to missile defense is \nsomewhat inaccurate.\n  I should say at this juncture, the proposed amendment by my colleague \nfrom Virginia suggests that we add about $800 million and give the \nPresident the option of spending it on missile defense or antiterrorism \nactivities. But it seems clear to me this debate is about missile \ndefense and not about terrorism. Terrorism is something we are \nconcerned about, but I think the impetus for this amendment is the \noverarching concern of the administration for missile defense.\n  So I think, first, we have, in fact, included within this bill before \nus robust funding for missile defense. We also have to respond to the \nreality that today we are engaged in a war on terror.\n  In fact, the National Intelligence Estimate for December 2001 stated:\n\n       U.S. territory is more likely to be attacked with [weapons \n     of mass destruction] . . . from nonmissile delivery means--\n     most likely from terrorists--than by missiles, primarily \n     because nonmissile delivery means are less costly, easier to \n     acquire, and more reliable and accurate. They can also be \n     used without attribution.\n\n  That is the National Intelligence Estimate for December 2001. So we \ndo recognize there are threats to us from weapons of mass destruction, \nbut we have to put it in context that the most immediate threats are \neither short-term theater missile threats by nation states or \nclandestine operations of terrorists entering the United States.\n\n  So with that recognition, I think this proposal we bring to the floor \nmakes a great deal of sense. We have looked hard at individual \nprograms. We are cognizant of the threats, particularly the theater \nmissile threats. And we are also trying to do what we can to ensure \nthat we protect this country from terrorist threats. So we have \ndeliberated carefully and thoroughly on all of these issues.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the threats because they should be \noften mentioned because our strategy has to respond to these threats.\n  First, I think we should point out how we are going forward with the \nPAC-3 system which is a theater missile defense system. It is in \noperational testing. It is strongly supported in this bill. It counters \nthose threats that are often mentioned here on the floor.\n  I know colleagues have talked about the potential access to short-\nrange missiles by terrorist groups in the Middle East. I think they \nhave also talked about the developments which are ongoing in countries \nsuch as Iran and Iraq and North Korea for missile systems, short-range \ntactical systems.\n  We have a system that is in operational testing, the PAC-3 system \nthat counters those threats. We support that system. It is supported in \nthis budget. We hope it is fielded at the first possible moment, \ndeployed with troops in the field. There are other systems, too, that \nwe support.\n  We continue to develop the THAAD system, which is another theater \nmissile system. That is supported in this budget. We are supporting the \nNavy theater-wide system. We are considering, and very carefully \nsupporting, a whole range of missile systems that are important to our \ndefense. So to suggest that this legislation is not supportive of \nmissile defense is to miss the details of the legislation.\n  We are also looking very carefully, as I mentioned, at specific \nadjustments to the systems that are being considered today.\n  That is our role, our responsibility. We are not here simply to say \nwhatever the Defense Department sends over is something we will support \nwithout any question or scrutiny. Our job is to look carefully at \nsystems and to make critical decisions about scarce resources, and we \nhave done that.\n  Let me suggest some of the recommendations we have made in the \ncontext of the missile systems I mentioned. First, the sea-based \nmidcourse, which was formerly Navy theater-wide. We fully fund the \ndevelopment and test program, $374 million. In fact, we add $40 million \nfor new shipboard radar for robust theater missile defense. We are \nadding money to these programs because we believe it is important, and \nwe believe this type of additional expenditure should be included \nwithin the budget.\n  We do, however, look at the program carefully, and we have made the \nrecommendation that $52 million should be reduced because it is for a \nvery vaguely defined concept development study. We believe that study \nis unjustified, undefined, but we are supporting vigorously the Navy \nmidcourse program, sea-based midcourse, as we should.\n  From what I have seen of the Navy theater-wide system, the sea-based \nmidcourse, the Missile Defense Agency is engaged in something which \nmight be described as an ad hoc approach. Let me suggest why.\n  In our authorization bill last year, we asked the Secretary of \nDefense to submit a report to the congressional defense committees no \nlater than April\n\n[[Page S5978]]\n\n30, 2002, on the Department's ultimate plans for the Navy theater-wide \nsystem. That was last year's language. We asked them: Give us your \nplan.\n  We received a letter back from General Kadish which essentially said: \nHere is some information, but we can't give you any of the definitive \ninformation, particularly the life cycle costs of the system. What he \nsaid was, basically, while the questions posed in this request are \nrelevant, a response will not be available until the SMD element of the \nBMDS is defined, and he suggested that the SMD definition will be \ncompleted by December 2003.\n  That is interesting. Then just a few weeks ago--approximately 10 days \nago--I read in the Wall Street Journal where General Kadish was saying \nthere will likely be a contingent deployment of this system in the year \n2004. So the program will be defined by December 2003, and then we will \nhave contingency deployment in 2004. That suggests to me a lack of a \nclear-cut plan, a lack of meaningful communication to this committee \nand to this Senate.\n  That shaped a lot of our deliberations in the sense of these ill-\ndefined programs and the significant requests for money.\n  One area which is most relevant in this regard is the request for \nsystems engineering money. Systems engineering money is generally the \nhiring of engineers, contractors, and software engineers to talk about \ndesigning and integrating systems. It is a very important part of the \ndevelopment of any system, particularly one as complicated and \ntechnologically challenging as national missile defense. We had \nincluded within this budget $500 million in systems engineering and \nother Government support and operations funding in individual missile \nprogram accounts: More than $170 million in systems engineering for the \nmidcourse program element: the sea-based and the ground-based, the Navy \nsystem and the system in Alaska; more than $100 million for program \nmanagement operations funding in individual program lines in the \nmidcourse element; more than $70 million of Government support in the \nboost program element; more than $20 million in the sensor program \nelement; and more than $80 million in the THAAD program element.\n\n  These are all systems engineering or program management costs. It \nadds up to a half a billion dollars. There is another category of \nsystems engineering which has been developed in the last 2 years called \nthe BMD system, the system of systems.\n  First, let me suggest that there are some practical time problems in \nspending all this money. The presumption for BMD systems engineering is \nthat you are going to integrate all these systems that are being \ndeployed. The reality is, it is very unclear at this juncture what \nsystems will be deployed, what radars will be used, what types of \nsensors, what combinations of missiles and sensors. It is very unclear. \nBut still the request was for a significant amount of money for systems \nengineering for the entire BMD system.\n  We looked carefully at this. We concluded that $736 million for this \ncategory was more than sufficient, together with the $500 million that \nis already embedded in each of the program elements of the existing BMD \nprogram.\n  As a result, we were able to reduce this request for BMD system money \nby $330 million. But let me also point out that as of this juncture, it \nappears that BMD will only spend $400 million of last year's money, and \nthis will leave about $400 million for the next fiscal year. Together \nwith the $736 million and the $400 million carryover, BMD systems \nengineering has over $1 billion, hardly a draconian, drastic cut in \ntheir ability to continue to do these programs of integration and \nsystems engineering.\n  Again, we looked carefully. We determined what they were doing. We \ndetermined that they would have more than enough resources to continue \ntheir efforts into the next fiscal year, and we were able to move some \nof this money into the shipbuilding accounts which everyone in this \nChamber, I would say without hesitation, will support enthusiastically, \nan immediate need for our Navy for additional ships.\n  In addition, we were able to move some of this money into programs \nfor the protection of Department of Energy nuclear facilities. We did \nthat in response to published reports, which we have all seen, that the \nOffice of Management and Budget turned down the Department of Energy \nfor a significant increase in security funds at a time when the \nthreat--at least if you believe the last few weeks from the media--is \nnot the long-range missile, the threat is the terrorists coming in here \non an airplane, landing in Chicago with a plan or at least an idea to \nseize radiological material someplace in the United States, construct a \n``dirty'' bomb here, and detonate it. Yet the administration said: No, \nDOE, you don't need this extra money to secure the nuclear facilities.\n  We think DOE needs this money, and it is a higher priority than \nexcessive systems engineering money for the ballistic missile defense \nprogram.\n  So as we have looked at all of these programs, we have tried to take \na very careful, considerate look, tried to make tough decisions, and \nthey are tough decisions because we don't have unlimited, infinite \nresources. As the Senator from Michigan said, I question sincerely the \navailability next year of the inflation savings assumed in the proposed \nWarner amendment. This seems to be one of those fudge factors that is \nput in, an estimate. You might realize it, you might not realize it. I \nawait, as the Senator from Michigan does, eagerly, Senator Warner's \nresponse from the Secretary of Defense with respect to these questions.\n  The reality is that these resources may not be realized through \ninflation savings. If we authorize the spending, which, for political \nreasons, the administration seems to be absolutely committed to, we may \nend up using operational maintenance money to fund missile defense, to \nfund these ill-defined areas of systems engineering and other programs.\n  We will find ourselves, in that case, coming back here and wondering \nwhy our flying hours are down for the Air Force and Navy pilots, why we \ncan't provide the sort of resources we need for ongoing operations \nmaintenance at a time when we have forces in the field engaged today, \ntrying to destroy these terror networks, and succeeding in many cases \nbecause of their skill and courage and the support they are receiving.\n  We have brought to the floor a bill that robustly supports missile \ndefense but asks very tough questions about specific programs that are \nnot adequately justified or are redundant. Let me give an example of \nthat. The THAAD missile system is well on the way toward the \nengineering phase to get to a point where it can be part of our theater \nmissile defense system in the next several years, we hope. They are \nasking for $40 million to purchase 10 unproven missiles.\n  Our concept is fairly straightforward and simple. We provide that \n$895 million for the test development and for the first flight test of \nthe missile in this budget. A simple proposition: Let's fly one of \nthese missiles first before we buy 10 missiles. Maybe we can save \nresources. The THAAD Missile Program is a good example of a program \nthat was once forced to accelerate beyond its technical means. It was, \nas General Welch described it, rushing to failure, and it failed--\nprogram course out of sight, product not adequate, not meeting the \nrequirement set out for the system. It was a program in such distress \nthat it was virtually on the chopping block. General Welch's report \nsaid: Listen, you have to go back to a careful, deliberate, thorough \ndevelopment process. The program is back on track. And now our sense is \nthey are trying to get off track again--let's just buy these 10 extra \nmissiles today.\n  That is an example, I believe, of the robust support--$895 million. \nBut the very careful and appropriate question is: Why do you need to \nbuy 10 missiles today when your first flight test is going to be in \nfiscal year 2005? Due to time constraints, I must yield the floor but \nwill take time later to continue this discussion.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3918\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the amendment by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, and the time until 12:30 will be equally divided. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, with apologies to our friend from Rhode \nIsland, that was the unanimous consent request. I can assure him that \nthere is no time limit on the missile defense\n\n[[Page S5979]]\n\namendment that Senator Warner will be offering. So we can return to him \nat that time. The time was to be divided. Senator Kennedy has returned.\n  Let me ask the Chair a question. Is the time divided, under the \nunanimous consent agreement, until 2:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the time is divided equally.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is there anybody in control of the time here?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Kennedy controls 14 minutes and \nSenator Levin controls 14 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield my time to Senator Warner so that there is equal \ndivision between the proponents and opponents.\n  Mr. WARNER. It seems to me it was Senator Kennedy and myself. I have \ndelegated that to my colleague from Wyoming.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that it be divided in that way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  Madam President, the record is clear. When there is real competition, \npublic workers will show their strength. According to the DOD's \nnumbers, when Government agencies have competed for contracts, they \nhave won the bid 60 percent of the time fair and square. When public \nworkers win these competitions, the taxpayers save money and good \nworkers keep their jobs.\n  This amendment is about competition--competition for the Defense \nDepartment.\n  Our amendment will ensure that a framework is established for \ncompetition for various goods and services in the Defense Department. \nWe provide a framework, where if there are national security items, \nthey can be exempt. If there are requirements for emergency, they can \nbe exempt. If there are certain needs in terms of the high-tech areas, \nthey are exempt. But for the broad range of different contracts, this \namendment will ensure that the American taxpayers' interests are going \nto be preserved. But, more importantly, we are going to get the best in \nterms of performance for the DOD.\n  The public-private competitions that have taken place have saved, on \naverage, over 30 percent, according to the Defense Department.\n  The Republicans claim that this amendment is in conflict with the GAO \nPanel on Commercial Activities. In fact, this amendment is based on the \nprinciple unanimously articulated by that panel, which calls for \ngreater public-private competition, which gives DOD the power to design \nthe framework for that competition consistent with the sourcing \nprinciples laid out by the GAO panel.\n  The Republicans claim this amendment takes away flexibility from the \nDepartment of Defense. Nothing could be further from the truth. When \nnational security so demands, DOD is given the power to waive public-\nprivate competition. The amendment exempts many categories of work, \nincluding almost all high-tech work, from public-private competition. \nThe amendment even provides a waiver to DOD for functions that must be \nperformed urgently.\n  It remains in the discretion of DOD to determine how many jobs should \nbe subject to the public-private competition and which jobs are subject \nto this competition. The DOD retains enormous flexibility under this \namendment.\n  The Republicans claim this amendment will cost money. That is a sign \nof their shortsightedness when it comes to the value of competition. \nThe DOD recognizes that public-private competition consistently yields \nsavings of over 30 percent on contracts. Any short-term transition \ncosts, which the CBO has estimated at one-tenth of what they are \nclaiming for the substance of this amendment, will be more than made up \nfor in long-term savings to the taxpayers.\n  The Republicans claim that we are moving too quickly with this \namendment and that the Senate should not act now to promote expanded \ncompetition. I only ask that my Republican opponents listen to the \nadvice of Mitch Daniels, the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, when it comes to these matters. Earlier this month, he said:\n\n       We cannot afford to wait. . . . The objective is to get the \n     taxpayers the best deal.\n\n  While we wait, the administration is moving ahead with shifting 15 \npercent of all eligible jobs to the private sector without any adequate \ncompetition.\n  The passage of this amendment will lead to a smarter and more \nefficient procurement policy for the Department of Defense. Just as no \nprivate company would reasonably outsource jobs without a hard-headed \nanalysis showing cost savings, Government procurement should be based \non what is best for taxpayers and our national defense. The \nconsequences will be savings for taxpayers and improved dependability \nfor our courageous men and women in uniform.\n\n  We are surely facing great challenges in terms of our Nation's \nsecurity in this new era. More than ever, we are relying on the \nDepartment of Defense and its dedicated employees. As we expand our \nNation's military budget, we must ensure that taxpayers and our men and \nwomen in uniform are reaping all of the benefits possible. True \ncompetition is more critical today than ever before.\n  Only if we give public workers the opportunity to compete in public-\nprivate competition will we have true competition.\n  This is what the GAO has said on the question of the Commercial \nActivities Panel, which has been quoted yesterday:\n\n       Competitions, including public-private competition, have \n     shown to produce significant cost savings for the Government, \n     regardless of whether a public or a private entity is \n     selected.\n\n  Angela Styles, senior officer at OMB, a procurement official, \ntestified on the House Armed Services Military Readiness Subcommittee \non March 13 2002:\n\n       No one in this administration cares who wins a public-\n     private competition. But we very much care that Government \n     service is provided by those best able to do so. Every study \n     on public-private competition that I have seen concludes that \n     these competitions generate significant cost savings.\n\n  What is it about our friends on the other side that they refuse to \npermit the competition to take place?\n  Now, we heard estimates just yesterday that, according to DOD, the \namendment will cost $200 million. The years of experience and the \nstatements of the administration's officials clearly demonstrate that \npublic-private competitions save money rather than cost. The Deputy \nUnder Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics \ntestified that the public-private competitions save the Government \n$11.2 billion, a savings of $11.2 billion. The administrator of OMB's \nOffice of Federal Procurement Policy said the use of the public-private \ncompetition consistently reduces the cost of public performance by more \nthan that. Even in the short term, the core of this amendment would \ncost about a tenth of what the critics and DOD claim.\n  Those opposed to it say the amendment would prevent the \nimplementation of the GAO panel recommendation. The amendment is based \non the unanimous principles of the GAO panel that call for public-\nprivate competition. The GAO recommended:\n\n       A process that, for activities that may be performed by \n     either the public or private, would permit public-private \n     sources to participate in competitions for work currently \n     performed in house, work currently contracted in the private \n     sector, and new work consistent with these guiding \n     principles.\n\n  That was a quote.\n  The amendment also provides for a pilot program to test the \neffectiveness of the best value approach that is endorsed by the \nopponents of this amendment. Furthermore, arguments are made by the \nopponents that the amendment goes against the principle held for 50 \nyears: The Government should not compete for noninherently Government \nfunctions. For the first time, the amendment would mandate that the \nGovernment compete with the private sector.\n  The proponents of that statement left out a key clause in the \nlongstanding U.S. procurement policy. According to OMB, ``the \nGovernment shall not start or carry on any activity and provide a \ncommercial product or service if the product or service can be procured \nmore economically from a commercial source.''\n  We are not asking that work be given to the private sector if indeed \nthe Federal Government agency can do it more efficiently. The \nGovernment personnel system is not nimble enough to accommodate this \namendment and move on\n\n[[Page S5980]]\n\nshort notice. That is an argument that is made against this amendment.\n  There is no reason to believe the Government cannot adequately \naccommodate the need for qualified personnel. In the face of pending \nbase closures, OMB outsourcing quotas, the DOD civilian workforce will \ncontinue to downsize. As a result of this process, over 300,000 DOD \ncivilian personnel have lost their jobs due to outsourcing in recent \nyears. There is an excess of potential qualified personnel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to the Kennedy \namendment, which would arbitrarily require Federal Government agencies, \nparticularly the Department of Defense, to compete with the private \nsector for the performance of inherently nongovernmental services \nwithin the Department of Defense. As chairman of the Republican Senate \nHigh Tech task force, I believe that contracting with the private \nbusiness entities helps drive innovation and indeed save the taxpayers \nmoney.\n  This amendment would reverse the progress that has already been made \nin this area and obviously create damage to important initiatives such \nas e-government. In fact, many of the information technology companies \nacross this country believe they would no longer seek Federal contracts \nwith DOD under the provisions of this amendment, thereby, \nunfortunately, creating job losses in the private sector.\n  This view has been shared by my colleagues, Senators Ensign, Warner, \nGramm, Smith, Collins, Hutchison, Burns, Bennett, Hatch, and Brownback.\n  This amendment would mandate that every new Department of Defense \ncontract, modification, task order, or contract renewal undergo a so-\ncalled public-private competition, whether or not the Government even \nhas the requisite skill, competence, or personnel to perform the work.\n  The changes in this current process by this amendment will: (1) \nweaken and delay Government performance; (2) could devastate small \nbusiness; and (3) have a harmful effect on our important, creative, \nhigh-technology industry.\n  First, the anti-private-enterprise exercise that would be caused by \nthis bill would result in delays in performance of Government \ncontracts. The Department of Defense would lack the capacity to quickly \nprocure and adopt innovative solutions to enhance safety, security, and \neffectiveness. It would be an undesirable bureaucratic impediment that \ncould harm the ability of the Defense Department to perform its duties, \nespecially now during a national crisis.\n  Secondly, the added costs associated with the A-76 program, in \ncomparison to competitive procurement practices, traditionally would \nexclude most small businesses from participating in service \ncontracting. This would have a particularly detrimental impact on \nwomen, minority, and veteran-owned companies.\n  Finally, the amendment will have a devastating impact on the high-\ntech industry, an industry that is so important to the competitive \nvitality of the American economy. This amendment is opposed by the \nhigh-tech industry, including the Information Technology Association of \nAmerica (ITAA). The exemptions for technology are ambiguous and do not \ncover the full range of activities conducted by the exempted industry. \nMoreover, ITAA notes the information technology exemption herein covers \nonly 3 percent of total IT service contracting. This is also opposed by \nthe Chamber of Commerce and various unions.\n  I will close with the views of the Secretary of Defense, who says:\n\n       We have made a top priority of finding efficiencies and \n     savings within the Department of Defense to enable us to \n     improve our tool-to-tail ratio. An important element of that \n     effort is to adapt business and financial practices to make \n     the best warfighting use of the resources the American \n     taxpayers provide us. The draft Kennedy amendment would \n     increase Department cost by requiring public-private \n     competitions for new functions and for previously contracted \n     work already subjected to market competition. It would \n     also adversely impact mission effectiveness by delaying \n     contract awards for needed services.\n\n  The Secretary of Defense, Mr. Rumsfeld, closes:\n\n       The proposed amendment would increase Department costs and \n     dull our warfighting edge.\n\n  I suggest that no Member of this body should support legislation that \ndulls our warfighting edge. I therefore urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am still waiting to hear the reason from the other \nside that competition does not work. We are told that we cannot have \ncompetition in the Defense Department because it is going to take time \nto set up a process and procedure; we cannot have it because it is \ngoing to work against small business.\n  We have a million-dollar exemption so that anybody below a million \ndollars, a small business, can compete. Perhaps someone on the other \nside can tell us why competition cannot work. We have not heard the \nanswer to that. What we have heard is all of the accountants, Mitch \nDaniels, the GAO, say that competition can work, and when it does work, \nwe get the best in terms of our fighting men and women and we get the \nbest in terms of taxpayers.\n  I cannot understand the opponents saying we cannot set up a process \nand procedure in order to deal with this; it is going to be too \ncomplicated and costly. That is baloney. Competition can work, and I am \nso surprised, from the party that allegedly is for more competition, \nthat they cannot support this amendment.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, of \nwhich I am an original cosponsor.\n  I have long been concerned about the costs and benefits associated \nwith the process by which the Federal Government contracts out work. In \nparticular, I am concerned about the lack of data on whether these \ncontracts actually achieve real savings for the taxpayers, and about \nthe effects of outsourcing on the pay and benefits of Federal workers.\n  I do not automatically oppose contracting out. Such a process is \noften appropriate. I am concerned, however, that the Department of \nDefense is currently able to circumvent the public-private competition \nprocess for contracting out work that is employed by other Federal \nagencies. Contracting out affects the jobs of thousands of dedicated \nGovernment employees each year. These men and women deserve the chance \nto compete for this work, as the Senator from Massachusetts was \npointing out. They deserve the right to compete for their jobs, and \nthey have a right to do it on a level playing field. The Kennedy \namendment would help to provide a level playing field by ensuring that \ntrue public-private competition actually occurs.\n  This amendment does not prohibit the Department of Defense from \ncontracting out. It does not stipulate which categories of jobs may or \nmay not be subject to public-private competitions. In fact, a number of \njob categories are exempted. This amendment is broadly worded to give \nDOD flexibility on which and how many positions to subject to \ncompetitions. The amendment also includes a national security waiver.\n  Some have argued that this amendment would spell the end of \ncontracting out by the Department of Defense. Again, that is not true. \nThis amendment simply requires DOD to comply with four broad goals \naimed at bringing a measure of fairness and equity to the contracting \nout process.\n  First, the amendment would ensure that public-private competition \nactually occurs before work currently performed by Federal employees is \ncontracted out. The DOD would be able to\n\n[[Page S5981]]\n\nuse any cost-based process to carry out this competition, including the \nCircular A-76 process. This process would give DOD employees the \nopportunity to present their best bid and to compete on a level playing \nfield with bids from contractors. The goal of contracting out is to get \nthe highest quality work at the best price for the taxpayers. We should \nnot continue to shut the civilian DOD workforce out of this process.\n\n  Second, this amendment would help to ensure that Federal civilian \nemployees are given the opportunity to compete for a fraction of what \nis called ``new work'' to be performed at DOD. This provision would be \nphased in over several years.\n  Third, this amendment would require DOD to use ``contracting in'' as \nwell as ``contracting out'' to make sure that Federal taxpayers are \ngetting the best deal. It only makes sense to periodically compete work \nthat has been awarded to contractors to ensure that the Federal \ntaxpayers are continuing to get their money's worth. Work being \nperformed by contractors should be subject to the same scrutiny as work \nbeing performed by Government employees. In the interest of fairness, \nthe amendment requires that DOD opens to competition similar numbers of \ncontractor and civilian employee jobs.\n  Finally, the amendment would require DOD to establish an inventory to \ntrack the cost and size of its contractor workforce. This inventory \nwould be compiled using the same procedures that the Department of the \nArmy recently adopted to track its own contractor workforce. I share \nthe concerns of some of my constituents, who have told me that they \nbelieve that contracting out simply shifts jobs from the Federal \nGovernment to the private sector without any real savings. I also share \ntheir concern that part of any savings that is achieved may actually \ncome from reduced salaries and benefits that are paid to contractor \nemployees. It is important that DOD and Congress have an accurate \npicture of the true size and cost of the contractor workforce.\n  In sum, this amendment does not prohibit the Department of Defense \nfrom contracting out. It would ensure basic public-private competition \nthat will allow DOD employees to compete with contractor bids on a more \nlevel playing field. It will also help to ensure that the DOD \ncontracting process is achieving the best result for taxpayers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield 5 minutes for the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I appreciate the time.\n  I am very much concerned that the Kennedy amendment takes us \nbackward. Under the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998, \nthe FAIR Act, agencies are examining activities to find what they do \nthat duplicates activities done in the private sector. This would be \ndone to see if these activities can be contracted out, to do those \nactivities more cheaply and effectively. This would prevent the Federal \nGovernment from competing with the private marketplace. When the job is \ndone in the private marketplace, not only do we avoid having to carry \nan additional Federal bureaucracy, we get to tax them if they make a \nprofit and we get the benefits of the competition, the innovation, that \nsmall business brings.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Small Business Committee, I \nfocused a lot of time and attention on what small businesses are able \nto do. We find there are some tremendous innovations and new ideas \ncoming from small business. Whenever some action can be done \neffectively in the private sector, I believe the private sector should \nhave the opportunity to do it. Functions that are inherently \ngovernmental, clearly no one disagrees, should be done by Federal \nemployees. We are not talking about those. We are talking about \nfunctions that are commercial in nature.\n  The current process for evaluating these functions for a possible \ncontracting out is the so-called A-76 process. OMB Circular A-76 calls \nfor competition to take place wherever commercial activity currently \nperformed by a Government agency is proposed to be contracted out. The \nFederal employees of that agency describe how they would organize \nthemselves into the most efficient organization and compete against the \nproposals submitted by private contractors.\n  The Kennedy amendment would bar contracting out of these functions, \nunless the private contractor's proposal to provide cost savings of at \nleast 10 percent over the Federal employee's MEO. This is intended to \nmake contracting out as difficult as possible. This is a direct shot at \nsmall businesses. This is meant to cripple the ability of small \nbusinesses which are now providing vital products and services in our \nDefense Department.\n  The Kennedy amendment purports to implement the recommendation of the \nCommercial Activities Panel convened by Comptroller General David \nWalker. However, the sole emphasis on cost savings--also, the Kennedy \namendment puts in a 10-percent additional savings--the sole emphasis of \nthe sponsor of this measure is saying that the deciding criteria in \nthat should be cost actually conflicts with the Walker panel \nrecommendations. The Walker panels calls for the standard of best \nvalue, what generates the overall best value to the taxpayer.\n  Cost savings is clearly one factor being considered. But best value \ncontracting also includes other factors, such as higher quality, faster \ndelivery, innovative processes, reliable past performance, or other \ncriteria that might justify a higher cost.\n  Best value contracting is what most of us do every day when we go out \nto buy goods and services. When you buy lunch, you do not always buy \nthe lowest price item on the menu every day. When you go to the \ndepartment store, you do not always purchase the cheapest item on the \nshelf. You may deliberately buy an item that is more expensive because \nyou expect the quality to be better. The best value approach puts \nGovernment contracting on par with how average, intelligent, informed \nconsumers make their purchases in the marketplace.\n\n  That is one reason the Government is increasingly relying on best \nvalue contracting and why the Walker panel recommends it for analyzing \ncontracting out proposals. The Kennedy amendment's exclusive emphasis \non costs savings, and the additional unworkable requirement the savings \nmust be more than 10 percent, is a step backward from the Walker \nrecommendations.\n  The sponsor of the amendment has cited OMB and other statements made \nby this administration, when, in fact, the President, speaking for this \nadministration on March 19, emphasized the vitally important role that \nsmall business plays in meeting the needs of the Federal Government. He \ntalked about taking a major effort, launching a major effort, to stop \nthe bundling of contracts to prevent their being awarded to small \nbusinesses.\n  There is currently underway a study in OMB under Angela Styles on how \nto get more contracts unbundled so small business can provide a \nworkable and economic role.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield our final 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, there has been a lot of discussion \nconcerning the Commercial Activities Panel. As has already been stated, \nthis is a panel that was set up with the distinguished citizens to \nconsider this complex problem. One of their recommendations, No. 9, is \nto ensure that competitions involve a process that considers both \nquality and cost factors.\n  My understanding is that the amendment of the Senator from \nMassachusetts addresses only the cost factors in determining the best \nvalue to the Government. On that, in and of itself, we clearly have a \ndeviation, to say the least, from the Commercial Activities Panel.\n  That is not as significant a point as the one following, and that is \nthe Armed Services Committee simply has not reviewed the panel's \nrecommendations, and we on the Governmental Affairs Committee have not \nhad the opportunity to review and consider the panel's recommendations. \nThis is certainly an area of some complexity and controversy that \nshould go through the committee process.\n  We have a bill before the Senate now on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee similar to the Kennedy amendment but it applies to all \nagencies in the Federal Government. We have had\n\n[[Page S5982]]\n\none hearing on that bill to date. We are in the middle of that process. \nThis amendment will clearly increase the costs to the Government and \ndistract the Department of Defense from its war fighting mission.\n  The Senator asked, why are we against competition? The answer is, we \nare not. We have plenty of competition. What we have is competition in \nthe private sector competing for the jobs. The Senator would interject \nthe Federal unions into the middle of that competition where there has \nbeen no such injection in times past. The Department of Defense points \nout it will cost more money and it will delay contracts at a time when \nwe neither need higher costs nor delays in the issuing of contracts.\n  The DOD and the OMB Director opposes this amendment, as well as small \nand minority-owned businesses and major labor unions. This is no time \nto be shifting massive jobs from the private sector to the public \nsector labor unions. Private labor unions have been losing membership \nover the past several years while membership in the public labor unions \nhave been rising. Many labor unions oppose this amendment as well as \ntaxpayer groups.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Kennedy amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield a minute and a half.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to be a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  I rise today to speak in support of the Kennedy amendment, which will \nhelp ensure real competition between the public and the private sectors \nfor the work performed by the Department of Defense. I am pleased to \njoin my colleagues, Senator Jack Reed, Daniel Akaka, and Russ Feingold \nas a cosponsor of this important amendment.\n  Let me review what this amendment does. This amendment addresses the \nneed for more competition and more information by requiring an analysis \nof the costs of maintaining work in the public sector. The amendment \ndefines broad and flexible principles to guide a public-private \ncompetition process. It allows the Defense Department wide flexibility \nin setting up a competition consistent with these broad principles. The \namendment provides discretion to the Defense Department to waive the \npublic-private competition requirements when national security demands \nand exempts a number of activities from the requirements. It also \npermits DOD the discretion to determine which jobs and how many jobs \nshould be subject to public-private competition.\n  The amendment will also provide Congress the information it needs to \nexercise important oversight by watching the level of managed \ncompetitions, since there is currently no requirement that agencies \nconduct them. And by granting DOD ``pilot program'' authority to \nexplore alternatives to the OMB Circular A-76 process that will yield \nthe same projected cost savings, we can gain some practical experience \nwith some of the reforms recommended in the recently published report \nof the Commercial Activities Panel.\n  Nine months ago, our Nation's collective consciousness was jolted \nwhen heinous acts of terrorism were committed on American soil. As a \nresult of those horrific acts, we are not--and never will be--the same. \nWe are stronger in our response, more steeled in our resolve, more \nvigilant about identifying and eliminating our vulnerabilities. \nOvernight, that life-altering experience forced us to seriously \nevaluate the workings of our Government from a new and different \nperspective. We now view ``homeland security'' in completely different \nways. Protecting our borders, our ports, nuclear power plants, chemical \nplants, water supplies, and other critical infrastructure has taken on \na new and urgent imperative. The Department of Defense is reorganizing \nitself for homeland security, and functions that may not have seemed \nessential to DOD's mission may now, in fact, be essential; and \nconversely, there may be functions that could be better performed in \nthe private sector, allowing DOD to focus on its mission.\n  I would like to share an example to illustrate this point. After \nSeptember 11, I asked that my staff to secure a briefing on the \nsecurity of a chemical munitions storage depot that sits 30 miles from \nthe Illinois border. The United States is in the process of destroying \nthese deadly munitions, which could kill hundreds of thousands of \npeople, pursuant to the Chemical Weapons Convention. I learned that the \ndepot had only one uniformed military officer--the commander--to \nprotect it, because security was provided by private contractors. About \na week after that, National Guard troops joined the private contractors \nin protecting this site.\n  Historically, DOD has set the pace as the lead Federal agency in \nusing competitive sourcing. But when we talk about ``setting the \npace''--what we know is that fewer than 1 percent of DOD service \ncontracts are subject to public-private competition. Work is outsourced \nwithout any opportunity for public sector employees to compete for the \njobs. And DOD is considered the leader--few civilian agencies have \nutilized the process; in fact, in Fiscal Year 1997, not one civilian \nagency reported conducted a cost comparison study.\n  The Department of Defense spends tens of billions of dollars annually \non service contracts--ranging from services for repairing and \nmaintaining equipment to services for medical care to advisory \nassistance services such as providing management support, performing \nstudies, and delivering technical assistance.\n  In fiscal year 1999, DOD reportedly spent $96.5 billion for contract \nservices--more than it spent on supplies and equipment. GAO has \nrepeately reported that inadequate and inaccurate information provided \nby DOD on service contract spending hampers congressional \ndecisionmaking and limits congressional use of information reported in \nthe budget.\n  Not only is reliable cost information scarce, there is too little \ncompetition for contracts to provide services to and for Federal \nagencies. As I indicated, fewer than 1 percent of DOD service contracts \nare subject to public-private competition. Because there is such a \nsmall fraction competed, there is a paucity of information and a host \nof unknowns about whether outsourcing to the private sector is really \nsaving money for the taxpayers. Outsourcing has evolved as one of the \nprincipal mechanisms used to reduce the size, scope, and costs of the \nFederal government. However, we have few clues about whether \noutscourcing has in fact reduced government costs, size, and scope.\n  A GAO study of savings obtained from competitive sourcing published \nin August 2000 reflected that DOD did realize savings from seven of the \nnine competitive sourcing cases reviewed, although less than the $290 \nmillion DOD initially projected. And savings occurred regardless of \nwhether governmental organizations or private contractors won the \ncompetition. Last year, the General Accounting Office elevated \nstrategic human capital management to its list of ``high-risk'' \ngovernment-wide challenges. In testimony in February 2001 before the \nGovernmental Affairs oversight subcommittee which I now chair, \nComptroller General David Walker made it abundantly clear that Federal \nemployees are not the problem. As Mr. Walker emphasized, to view \nFederal employees as costs to be cut rather than assets to be valued \nwould be to take a narrow and shortsighted view, one that is obsolete \nand must be changed. I was heartened by his perspective.\n\n  Yet right on the heels of this acknowledgement of the severe human \ncapital crisis facing the Federal workforce, the administration \nlaunched a major initiative requiring Federal agencies to compete or \ndirectly convert to the private sector at least 5 percent of the full-\ntime equivalent jobs listed on their Federal Activities Inventories. An \nadditional 10 percent of the jobs are to be competed or converted by \nthe end of Fiscal Year 2003, 85,000 jobs, for an aggregate of 15 \npercent of all Federal jobs considered commercial in nature.\n  It strikes me that it will be about as formidable as the perils of \nSisyphus to make any headway in recruiting and retaining the best and \nbrightest in the Federal workforce when in the same breath you are \ntelling them that over the next few years one out of every four jobs is \npotentially slated to disappear into the private sector. We really \ndon't have a trove of solid, reliable agency-by-agency information \nabout\n\n[[Page S5983]]\n\nthe costs and performance of work that is being performed for the \ngovernment under contract. This amendment will begin to gather it--by \nand for the Department of Defense.\n  I have long been interested in whether we have a system to measure \nand account for these costs, determine if there is savings, and oversee \nthe work that is being done with Federal funds. It has been my \nimpression that some of my colleagues have been just hidebound to \noutsource, without regard to the price tag or performance. Their \nmotivation was to reduce the size of the Federal workforce--at any \ncost. When I suggested amendments--arguing that we had to save money, \nthey rejected them. They told me that is not the point--we have to turn \nsome lights out in some federal buildings. I would like to know whether \nthat's still driving the outsourcing fervor.\n  I want to be perfectly clear: I am not opposed to all outsourcing. \nWhat I am concerned about is ensuring that decisions to shift work to \nthe private sector are made fairly, not arbitrarily; that public-\nprivate competition is fostered; and that we have a reliable system in \nplace to have information about the costs and performance of work being \nperformed with Federal funds by the private sector under these \ncontracts, in essence, accountability.\n  You can outsource and save money for taxpayers, and I think you \nshould do that. If you decide you will outsource, privatize, and \ncontract out, whether you save money for taxpayers or not, you are not \nserving either taxpayers or the needs of our Nation.\n  It is interesting to me that the Senators on the other side of the \naisle are fearful of the word ``competition.'' The thought that the \nprivate sector might have to compete for providing services to the \nFederal Government with the public sector is unacceptable to them.\n  When you look at the Department of Defense, they spend over $96 \nbillion a year on contracts per services. How many of those are \ncompetitively bid? Less than $1 billion. Ninety-five billion out of $96 \nbillion in these contracts for services go without competitive bid. It \nhas created cozy, sweetheart, comfortable arrangements with companies \nand the Pentagon. They do not want to compete. They do not want to \nstand up against those who say we can do it for you more \nprofessionally, more cheaply, more effectively. They can't stand the \nidea of competition. That is why they are opposing the Kennedy \namendment.\n  Should we not at this point in time of our history, with limited \nresources, fighting a war on terrorism, insist the taxpayers get every \ndollar of service for every dollar of taxpayers' money they put into \nour national defense? That is what the Kennedy amendment says. That is \nwhy I am happy to cosponsor it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains to the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 1 minute 25 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On either side, then?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 1 minute 25 seconds for both.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I just want to respond to the comments made with respect \nto OMB. I want to read from a letter from the Director.\n\n       Dear Senator Warner, I am writing to express deep concern \n     over the possible Kennedy amendment [proposal]. While \n     packaged in good-government clothing, this amendment will \n     severely limit the Department of Defense's ability to acquire \n     services necessary to help the Department meet current \n     threats. The Department of Defense must have the flexibility. \n     . . .\n       While agencies are embracing competition, focusing on core \n     mission, and eliminating barriers to entering the \n     marketplace, this amendment does the opposite.\n\n  The Senator was talking about support from this Department, and this \nis not what is there.\n\n       It would require the Government to consider reforming non-\n     core activities that it doesn't have the skills to do when \n     entrepreneurs and their employees are ready, willing and able \n     to perform.\n       We most focus our agencies on performance and \n     accountability. Now--when our nation is at war against \n     terrorism of global reach--is not time for the Secretary of \n     Defense to have fewer options, for the sake of moving more \n     functions into government hands.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself the remaining time.\n  We should not have to get into a discussion about the value of \ncompetition. But a year ago one of our colleagues offered a very \nsimilar amendment and then Senator Warner said: Let's wait until we \nhave the Commercial Activities Panel report. That was to guide the \nDefense Department.\n  In this report, on page 47, it says:\n\n       Establishing a process that, for activities that may be \n     performed by either the public or the private, would permit \n     public and private sources to participate in competitions for \n     work currently performed in-house, work currently contracted \n     to the private sector, and new work, consistent with these \n     guiding principles.\n\n  Unanimous recommendation. That is what this amendment does. That is \nwhy we believe it is important. It will be in the interests of our \nnational security, the Department of Defense, and the taxpayers. That \nis why we believe this amendment should be accepted.\n  I believe all time has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/25/senate-section/article/S5983-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: It is the \nunderstanding of the Senator from Virginia that the time between 2:15 \nand 2:30 is to be equally divided between the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, under our amendment, the public workers and private \ncontractors alike will have a chance to compete for Department of \nDefense contracts. It will represent approximately $100 billion. Only \nabout $1 billion of that is competed for. We believe competition is \ngood. We believe competition will get the best product at the best \nprice, which will reflect the unanimous recommendations of the recent \nstudy. Fewer than 1 percent of these Department of Defense service \ncontracts are done in that way at this particular time.\n  I don't understand for the life of me why there should be resistance \nor reluctance to these various proposals. This kind of proposal was \nconsidered by the Commercial Activities Panel on improving the sourcing \ndivision of the Government, which was chaired by the Comptroller of the \nUnited States.\n  In this particular proposal, one of the recommendations, which was 12 \nto 0, was the amendment we are offering today. If our Republican \nfriends have trouble with that, why wasn't there some opposition to \nthat in this report? There was none. It is a unanimously favorable \nreport. This wasn't Democrat and this wasn't Republican. These were \ncontractors, representatives of the public, employees, and accountants, \ntalking about how the U.S. Department of Defense could get the best buy \nfor its money. It was said for years that we couldn't go ahead with \ncompetition until we finally got the Commercial Activities Panel \nreport. That took a year and half and 11 different hearings with public \ncomments from all over.\n  This was unanimous. It was not 8 to 4; this proposal was unanimous. \nThey believe as a result of their proposal that DOD is going to get the \nbest services--the American taxpayers are going to get the best buy, \nthe best service, and the men and women of the military are going to be \nbest served.\n  Why in the world the resistance to that argument?\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes of our time. We \nhave 7\\1/2\\ minutes. I yield myself 5 minutes out of our 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  I want to respond to the Senator. He asks, who opposes this? Let me \ngive you some idea of who and why.\n  One, the amendment will increase costs to DOD by $200 million a year. \nSecondly, he talks about the report of\n\n[[Page S5984]]\n\nthe General Accounting Office. There were 10 recommendations that were \nput out. His deals with one. That is a reason to oppose this.\n  The amendment would adversely affect DOD's mission. It would mandate, \nfor the first time, that the Federal Government compete with the \nprivate sector for work not concurrently performed.\n  It has problems with the A-76 issue. The Secretary of Defense opposes \nthe Kennedy amendment. The administration has indicated that his \nproposal goes against the President's governmental performance tasks.\n  Let me share with you, very briefly, a couple of other comments. This \nis from the Executive Office of the President, from Mitchell Daniels, \nwho was quoted yesterday as supporting it. He says:\n\n       I am writing to express deep concern over the possible \n     Kennedy Amendment.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       We must focus our agencies on performance and \n     accountability. Now--when our nation is at war against \n     terrorists of global reach--is not the time for the Secretary \n     of Defense to have fewer options, for the sake of moving more \n     functions into government hands.\n\n  That is why people are opposed to it. The Secretary of Defense, in a \nletter, says:\n\n       I am writing to express my strong opposition to the draft \n     amendment proposed by Senator Edward Kennedy.\n\n  Then he closes the letter by saying:\n\n       The proposed amendment would increase Department costs and \n     dull our warfighting edge.\n\n  Then, just in numbers, we all mentioned the Secretary of Defense and \nOMB. We also have organized labor. The Seafarers International Union, \nthe Industrial Technological Professional Employees, International \nUnion of Operating Engineers, the International Brotherhood of \nBoilermakers--these are some of the folks who have found that this will \nnot help implement what we are seeking to do; that is, to be able to \nutilize the members of the military and the things they do at a time \nwhen it is more difficult to fullfill those responsibilities. To shift \nsome of those responsibilities back to the military away from the \nprivate sector seems to be absolutely contrary to what we are seeking \nto do.\n  I urge all Members of the Senate to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself another 2 minutes.\n  I have listened to my friend and colleague. He says they are opposed \nbecause of cost. The fact is, how do they say it is going to cost more \nwhen we are going to get competition? We are going to get competition.\n  The fact remains we have the unanimous recommendation of the group \nthat studied this issue, and they believed the taxpayer would be best \nserved, and DOD would be best served as well with that recommendation.\n  What is the current situation? Under the current situation, I \nunderstand if you are able to get the contracts, you do not want to \nchange the system. That is what is going on on the floor of the Senate. \nThey do not want competition. They have their contracts. They have the \nsweetheart contracts, and they are saying no.\n  Listen to this: The GAO found that the costs of nearly 3,000 spare \nparts purchased by the military increased by 1,000 percent or more in \njust 1 year. If you have that kind of contract, why do you want \ncompetition?\n  There it is. Taxpayers are the ones losing out. One small part, a \nhub, estimated to cost $35, was sold to the Government at the \ncontractor's price for $14,000. If you have that kind of deal, why do \nyou want competition? That is the issue, plain and simple.\n  It is not just the belief of the Senator from Massachusetts, that is \nthe unanimous recommendation of those who have studied it, contractors, \nworkers, and all. Most of us believe that competition does improve the \nservices and the quality of the products. So you find out that is the \nresult.\n  We have heard time in and time out about the various kinds of \nproducts that have been produced, and the costs and the escalation of \nthose costs. I have a sheet right in my hand. This is the GAO \noversight. These are the costs on it.\n  Hub, body, estimated to cost $35, sold for $14,000; transformer, \nradio, $683 was the unit price, but they charged $11,700; The list goes \non and on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself another minute.\n  I have not heard from the other side the answer to these questions. \nWhy don't we have something other than just reading a letter from some \npeople who are serving the interests of those contractors and explain \nto me why they cannot do it? We have not heard it. It is going to be \ndifficult. It is going to be awkward. Yet we have the very important \nstatements that have been made by people, even within the current \nadministration, who say this can result in competition that can result \nin important savings.\n  That is what we want to do. That is what this amendment is about.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 20 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time does the other side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 3 minutes 52 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself my remaining time.\n  Mr. President, on September 11, the brave men and women who work in \nthe Pentagon faced a great tragedy. When that airplane plowed into the \nDepartment of Defense, our fellow citizens working there lost coworkers \nand joined in the valiant effort to save the injured and tend to the \nDefense Department families shaken by this act of terrorism.\n  This amendment is about giving these Americans a chance, a chance to \nshow they can do a good job and deserve the work, if they can do it \nbetter and more efficiently than a defense contractor, a chance to \nembrace the American spirit of competition and free enterprise by \ncompeting for Government contracts on the same basis as private-sector \ncompanies.\n  And this amendment is about our values as Americans. Our country was \nbuilt upon our ingenuity, fueled by the spirit of free enterprise. If \nyou can make a better product at a lower cost than the other guy, then \nyou deserve the business. That is the American way. And it is that \nspirit of entrepreneurship that makes America the envy of the world.\n  My amendment lets that American spirit thrive. It puts real \ncompetition into defense contracting and, in the process, gives a real \nboost to the taxpayers and to our own values as Americans.\n  I urge the Senate to support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. WARNER. And I would simply say to my good friend from \nMassachusetts, what has been omitted from this discussion is the tens \nupon tens of thousands of Government employees doing superb work in the \npublic shipyards, in the rework centers in several States. Somehow we \nhave looked at a very narrow segment of the overall business of the \nDepartment of Defense without referring to the magnificent \ncontributions by hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Government \nemployees.\n  So, Mr. President, at this time I move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. WARNER. All time is yielded back on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Massachusetts yield the \nremainder of his time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I believe my time has expired.\n  I believe we need to ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to \ntable; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On the motion to table.\n\n[[Page S5985]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 49, as follows:\n  [Rollcall Vote No. 162 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Helms\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S.J. RES. 34\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know we have a lot of work to do on the \nDefense authorization bill. I believe we are making good progress. I \nknow Senator Daschle is going to have to make a call sometime today \nabout whether or not we are going to be able to get a lockdown list or \nwhether he files cloture. I am interested in discussing that with him \nbefore he makes a final decision because we want to be helpful in \ngetting the work done.\n  I had indicated earlier also that we hoped we could get a time \nagreement and understanding and all Senators would be on notice as to \nwhen we would proceed on the issue involving the Yucca Mountain \ndisposal site. I ask, notwithstanding legislative or executive business \nor the provisions of rule XXII, immediately following completion of the \nDefense authorization bill but no later than July 9, the majority \nleader or the chairman of the Energy Committee be recognized in order \nto proceed to Calendar No. 412, S.J. Res. 34, and in accordance with \nthe provisions of section 115 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the \nSenate then vote on the motion, with no further intervening action or \ndebate.\n  I further ask that the motions be agreed to, the Senate consider the \njoint resolution under the statutory procedure set forth in the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act; further, that once pending, the resolution remain \nbefore the Senate to the exclusion of any other legislative or \nexecutive business; and finally, upon conclusion of floor debate and a \nquorum call, if requested, as provided by the statute, the Senate vote \non H.J. Res. 87 without further intervening motion, point of order, or \nappeal.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I object.\n  Let me simply say, I reiterate what I have said on several occasions. \nAs the Republican leader knows, a unanimous consent request in this \ncase is not necessary. The statute allows any Senator to bring the bill \nto the floor and make a motion to proceed. It is not debatable. The \nvote occurs. If it is successful, the debate, under the statute, is \nrequired for a period no longer than 10 hours. Any Senator is capable \nof doing that.\n  I object today simply because, of course, we have to finish our work \non the Defense authorization bill. We are not sure yet what the \ncircumstances will be with regard to the supplemental. I hate to have \nthis legislation supplant an emergency supplemental dealing with our \nArmed Forces and dealing with the emergency needs of counterterrorism. \nThat is exactly what this proposal would do. It would supplant it if \nthat were the pending business. We are hopeful we can accommodate the \npriorities of the country and the Senate in a way that recognizes the \nimportance of proper sequencing of legislation including the \nsupplemental. As I say, it certainly also recognizes any Senator's \nright to bring it to the floor.\n\n  I am personally very opposed to the Yucca Mountain legislation as is \npresented. I oppose it and urge my colleagues to oppose it as well. We \nhave a large majority of our colleagues on this side of the aisle who \noppose it. However, for that reason as well as for the procedural \nreasons I have just described, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could use leader time to comment further, I understand \nwhy the Senator would object at this time. However, I make it clear to \nall the Senators on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the \nissue, we will make every effort to make Senators aware of when this \nissue might come up, give them maximum opportunity for the majority \nleader or the chairman of the Energy Committee to call up this issue, \nand also so that Members know when we are actually going to get to the \nissue itself.\n  The way this is set up under expedited procedures, once we go to it, \nonce the motion to proceed is agreed to, there will be 10 hours of \ndebate and we will go to the final vote. I think that is the right \nscenario. However, I caution Senators, there is a deadline. Under the \nlaw there was a certain amount of time this legislation could be \npending in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and there was a \ncertain specified period of time during which it could be available for \nthe Senate to act. If we do not act by July 27, the veto of this issue \nby the Governor of the State involved will hold. The worst of all \nworlds would be not to act in a responsible way with a clear vote in \nthe prescribed amount of time we have available. By going to this issue \nthe first week we are back, everybody will know when to expect it to \ncome up, and it will be assured that we get it done before the \nexpiration date of July 27.\n  We will continue to speak about the importance of this issue. We have \nbeen working on it many years, and we have spent an awful lot of \ntaxpayers' money. It is time we make a decision and move forward with \nthis repository.\n  I am happy to yield to Senator Murkowski.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I certainly urge the two leaders to proceed and \nrecognize the obligation we have to bring this matter to a vote. It \nwould be a grave reflection on the Senate to not take up this matter \nprior to July 27. The House has done its work and spoken with an \noverwhelming vote in support of proceeding with Yucca. To allow this \nmatter simply to die through inaction is a grave reflection on what was \nintended to be a balanced procedure, giving the Governor of the State \nof Nevada an opportunity to present the opinion of the State of Nevada, \nyet allowing for both the House and Senate to vote on the issue.\n  I encourage the two leaders to give us the assurance that we would \nhave an up-or-down vote, that it would simply not be allowed to die in \nthe course of events that clearly are going to take a great deal of \ntime and effort as we proceed with the calendar.\n  July 27 is the drop dead date for the procedure, as the minority \nleader indicated. He will be forced to vote on the motion to proceed \nfollowed by 10 hours of debate and then the final disposition. I remind \nmy colleagues of the fiscal responsibility we have in light of\n\n[[Page S5986]]\n\nthe realization that the Federal Government entered into a contract, a \ncontract with the utility companies that develop nuclear power in this \ncountry, to take that waste in 1998. The ratepayers have paid in the \narea of $16 billion to $17 billion to the Federal Government. The \nFederal Government is derelict in not being responsive to contractual \ncommitments or contractual agreements, with the possibility of \npotential litigation, to the taxpayers of this country, somewhere \nbetween $40 billion and $70 billion for the failure of the Federal \nGovernment to honor the terms of that contract.\n\n  The longer we delay this process--when I say ``delay,'' I am talking \nabout just that: Proceeding with the process that would basically lead \nto a time sequence that would not allow us to dispose of this issue is \nirresponsible. As a consequence, I encourage the two leaders to give us \nthe assurance that we will have an up-or-down vote, we will be allowed \nto have 10 hours of debate, prior to July 27. To not do that, indeed, \nwould be a very grave and negative reflection of this body--simply \nducking its responsibility.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it will be better if I yield the floor and \nallow the Senator to get time on his own so he will not have to think \nhe is being inconsiderate of me by the time he takes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for objecting \ntoday, and I appreciate his opposition to this project.\n  The junior Senator from Alaska talked about an obligation to move \nthis legislation. I think there is never an obligation to do the wrong \nthing.\n  I believe that proceeding on the issue of Yucca Mountain would be the \nwrong thing for this country for several reasons. There are a lot of \nmisconceptions when it comes to Yucca Mountain. It is said we have a \ncontract with the utility companies. That is simply because this \nCongress decided to enact a law based on politics and not based on what \nthe country actually needed.\n  Over the time of studying Yucca Mountain, we have a process that has \nbecome extraordinarily expensive, so much so that during the 1980s they \ndropped two of the sites they were studying because the costs were out \nof sight. Now, in the late 1990s or early 2000, the costs are going out \nof sight again. The latest cost estimate for Yucca Mountain is close to \n$60 billion. That is as much money as the cost of all 12 of our \naircraft carriers.\n\n  The stated purpose is so we can make nuclear power more viable in the \nfuture, if we have a solution for the waste. I submit to my colleagues \nthat Yucca Mountain will not make nuclear power more viable because of \nthe expense.\n  We talk about the trust fund, that the ratepayers are paying into \nthis trust fund. They paid in approximately $11 billion. When you count \ninterest on that money in these phony trust funds that we have set up \nthe trust fund is somewhere around $17 billion. We have spent about $8 \nbillion of that so far, $4 billion on Yucca Mountain, constructing \nYucca Mountain.\n  People have no idea. Because they go out there and see this very \nimpressive hole in the ground, they think we are almost done. We have \nhardly even scratched the surface. It is a huge project, hugely \nexpensive. It is going to come out of the general revenues. That means \ntaxpayers across the country who do not have nuclear power in their \nStates are going to be paying for Yucca Mountain for years and years \ninto the future.\n  I will close. It is talked about that any Senator can bring this \nlegislation to the floor. That is true. It says right in the act that \nany Senator can bring this legislation to the floor. Under the rules of \nthe Senate, any Senator can bring any legislation to the floor, but the \nprecedent and the history and the tradition of the Senate is that only \nthe majority leader brings legislation to the floor of the Senate. \nThere have been five pieces of legislation that had similar language to \nthe Nuclear Waste Policy Act, where it specifically stated that any \nSenator could bring the legislation to the floor. However, in that \nhistory of those five pieces of legislation, three of them were brought \nto the floor by the majority leader, and regarding two of them, the \nmajority leader actually got them not brought forward to be considered \nin the Senate.\n  If somebody besides the majority leader brings this legislation to \nthe floor, we are breaking with the traditions of the Senate. Because \nwe do not have a Rules Committee that says how legislation will come to \nthe floor in the Senate, the same way the House has a Rules Committee, \nI believe we are setting a very dangerous precedent for the majority.\n  On this side of the aisle we happen to be in the minority right now. \nSomeday we would like to be in the majority. I think it sets a \ndangerous precedent for us on this side of the aisle, if we are going \nto be in the majority someday, for this type of legislation to go \nforward without the majority leader bringing the bill to the floor. He \nhas announced his opposition, and we appreciate that. But I remind my \ncolleagues it is said, because this legislation is so important, that \nwe need to set this kind of precedent; that people do not believe, \nbecause of the importance of this legislation, that we are setting that \nprecedent.\n  I say, to the contrary, there are a lot of pieces of legislation that \nwe look at around here that we say are very important. If a majority of \nSenators get together, regardless of which side of the aisle they are \non, and offer a motion to proceed, they can control the floor of the \nSenate and thereby become the majority in and of themselves.\n  I thank the majority leader for the work he is doing in trying to \ndefeat this legislation. My colleague from the State of Nevada, the \nsenior Senator, has done yeoman work over the years, and I appreciate \nall his efforts. We are going to continue to fight this legislation, \nnot just because we believe it is bad for our State but, more \nimportantly, we believe this legislation is wrongheaded for the United \nStates of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wanted to speak to the Defense \nauthorization bill and was curious as to whether we are back to regular \norder on the Defense authorization. We are back to regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is pending.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank my subcommittee chairman on the \nStrategic Subcommittee on Armed Services for his leadership. On this \nparticular subcommittee, we do not always see eye to eye, and I \nappreciate his willingness to reach out and work with us. I value our \nworking relationship with my chairman on the subcommittee.\n  There is certainly much in the committee bill I am able to support. \nOne of my particular interests for several years has been the use of \ncommercial imagery to help meet the Nation's geospatial and imagery \nrequirements. I do not believe the Department of Defense has been \naggressive enough either in crafting a strategy or in providing funding \nfor this purpose.\n  I am gratified that the committee bill includes a substantial \nincrease for commercial imagery acquisition and some very helpful words \nin report language that I suspect will drive the Department toward \nestablishing a sound relationship with the commercial imagery industry.\n  I also appreciate the support of the new Department of Energy \nenvironmental cleanup reform initiative that will incentivize cleanup \nsites to do their important work faster and more efficiently. The \naccelerated cleanup initiative will reduce risk to the workers, \ncommunities, and the environment, shorten the cleanup schedule by \ndecades, and save tens of billions of dollars over the life of the \ncleanup. The bill adds $200 million to this initiative, and I expect \nthe Department of Energy will make tremendous strides.\n  In both of these areas, I believe the bill makes excellent progress. \nHowever, early in the process of crafting this bill, I made it very \nclear that one of my top priorities was to assure that ballistic \nmissile defense programs are adequately funded. I am deeply \ndisappointed that the committee bill, by the margin of one single vote, \nreduces missile defense programs by more than $800 million. This \nrepresents an 11-percent decrease to the missile defense request for \nfiscal year 2003, a request, I might add, that was already less than \nwhat was appropriated for fiscal year 2002, by some $200 million.\n\n[[Page S5987]]\n\n  I believe reductions of this magnitude are unjustified and will do \ndeep and fundamental harm to the effort to develop and deploy effective \nmissile defenses as efficiently as we can.\n  In the wake of the events of September 11, I believe missile defense \nis more important than ever. As the Director of Central Intelligence \nGeorge Tenet testified before our subcommittee, we don't have the \nluxury of choosing the threats to which we respond. Missile threats \nhave a way of developing faster than we expect.\n  I opposed the bill in committee because of these reductions, and I \nintend to support, as vigorously as I can, efforts on the floor to \nrestore the funding. I am disappointed we could not find an acceptable \ncompromise on this issue in committee, and I look forward to working \nwith my chairman in a continuing effort to find an acceptable \nresolution to this disagreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the soon to be \nlaid down amendment by Senator Warner on missile defense. This is a \nmajor topic for the body to consider. It is a major topic for the \ncountry. I want to address it from a number of different perspectives \nbut primarily from the perspective of the threat we are facing in the \ninternational community today.\n  We are seeing now what is taking place in Iran. I wish to draw \nspecial notice to what is occurring there. We are seeing terrorism \nbeing supported greatly from that country. We are seeing them \nsupporting terrorist threats and terrorist efforts and funding and even \nproviding arms to terrorists in a number of countries throughout the \nregion. They are supporting it in Lebanon. They are supporting it in \ncentral Asia. They are developing the missile capacity in Iran.\n  Iranian missile capacity has developed substantially now. They are \nexpanding their sphere of influence to the extent of how far the \ndelivery of their weaponry is that they can go with the missiles they \nhave.\n  Iran, as the President identified, is one of the countries comprising \nthe axis of evil. They seek to do away with the Israeli State, they \nseek to expand substantially their threat in the region, and they are \nno friend of the United States. They also have no reservation \nwhatsoever about using the weapons of mass destruction that they have, \neven targeted toward the United States.\n  Here is a country that clearly means us harm. Here is a country that \nis developing and expanding its missile capacity. Here is a country \nthat has some capacity for weapons of mass destruction already and is \ntrying to obtain nuclear capacity, nuclear weapon capacity, which some \ncountries believe they will have in the next several years. That is \nIran.\n  We see what is taking place in North Korea. North Korea has developed \nand has missile capacity. They have a missile with a substantial range \nof influence and threat. They share those with a number of other rogue \nregimes around the world. North Korea has weapons of mass destruction. \nWe don't know about their nuclear capacity and development. They are \nprobably trying to pursue it. That is a country that also means us \nharm. This is a nation that is a failed state.\n  Our estimate is that over the last 5 to 7 years at least 1 million \nNorth Koreans have died of starvation. At the same time they are \ndeveloping this massive missile and weapons capacity, there are people \nfleeing North Korea today. In the last week, we saw that there were 27 \npeople, I believe, from North Korea seeking refuge in the embassies in \nChina to get out of the repressive regime in North Korea. The state has \nfailed. Buildings are collapsing in that state. When people are caught \nin that building, they get crushed. North Koreans are fleeing from that \nfailed state. They are trying to get out.\n  This country is maintaining a missile capacity that threatens a \nnumber of U.S. allies and could potentially in the near future threaten \nthe United States.\n  With both of these known examples in Iran and North Korea, why on \nEarth would not the United States develop a missile defense system when \nwe know these threats are there?\n  These are state sponsors of terror. By our own account, they are one \nof the seven countries that are state sponsors of terror. They are \ndoing this financially, with weaponry, and by some accounts with their \nown officers. They are selling these missiles around the world, as we \nknow is the case with North Korea.\n  Why wouldn't the United States as rapidly as possible develop our \nmissile defense capacity when we know this is taking place?\n  The first order for our defense is to provide for the common defense. \nThat is the reason we created the Federal Government.\n  When we know these things are being developed by two countries that \nmean to do us harm, why would we not as rapidly as possible use our \nefforts to develop a missile defense system? Clearly, we should be \ndoing this. This should be of the highest order for us. If one of these \ncould reach U.S. shores--and they may be able to do so in the near \nfuture with the development of what is taking place in these two \ncountries, and where they are offering to sell their missile capacity--\nit could cause enormous harm and death in America.\n  They currently threaten a number of our allies. They would cause \nenormous death in those nations.\n  We should be developing a missile defense system as fast as possible. \nUnfortunately, the Senate Defense authorization bill is hindering the \neffort with what is currently in the bill. That is why I am supporting \nSenator Warner's effort to amend this bill so we can move forward with \na missile defense system on a very rapid basis.\n  The bill which passed out of the Senate Armed Services Committee \nincludes a $814.3 million reduction to the budget requested for \nballistic missile defense. The Warner amendment would provide the \nauthority to transfer up to $814 million within the request to be used \nfor ballistic missile defense and DOD activities to combat terrorism, \nas the President determined. The administration supports this budget \nrequest and opposes the reductions put forward in the committee bill \nfor the Missile Defense Program. This is a reasonable position for the \nadministration to take given the needs that we have for missile \ndefense. It is one we should support, and it is one for which we should \nbe having a robust missile defense program moving forward.\n\n  For my own State's perspective, this Warner amendment would restore \n$30 million to save a spot on the production lines for the second \nairborne laser aircraft. The acquisition of the second ABL aircraft is \nessential to the continuation of the program. The first aircraft, which \nI have seen, is a very impressive aircraft that I think is going to be \nused in not only missile defense but in other capacities as well.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee's version of the bill is not \namended to include additional missile defense funding. Secretary \nRumsfeld has stated that he will recommend to the President that he \nveto the fiscal year 2003 National Defense Authorization Act. That is \nfrom the Secretary of Defense--a recommendation to veto.\n  The Missile Defense Program that was developed is a balanced effort \nto explore a range of technologies that will allow the United States to \ndefend against the growing missile threat facing this country and our \nforces, friends, and allies.\n  I just articulate two countries that we know of that are problematic.\n  What if things occur in other countries? For instance, we are \ndeveloping and should grow in our alliance and work with Pakistan. This \nis a very difficult country. What if President Musharraf is not \nsuccessful and more radical elements take over in Pakistan? That is a \ncountry with both nuclear and missile capacity. This is not one of \nthose far-flung possibilities. This is a very real possibility that \ncould take place. We hope we are working against it. I support \nPresident Musharraf. This country is very supportive of him. He has \ndone a lot of excellent work. Recently, he helped in reducing tensions \nbetween India and Pakistan.\n  It is a very real possibility for which we should be preparing. If \nthat eventuality happened, and the United States said, OK, now we need \nto build a missile defense system to offset what is taking place in \nsomeplace such as Pakistan, it is too late.\n  According to Secretary Rumsfeld, the $814 million shortfall in \nfunding\n\n[[Page S5988]]\n\nwould impose a number of burdensome statutory restrictions that would \nundermine our ability to manage the Missile Defense Program \neffectively.\n  The amendment provides the President flexibility to determine which \nuse of the funds is within the national interest. The funds could be \ncorrected to meet any new terrorism threat that may evolve.\n  The ballistic missile defense reductions in the bill are considerable \nand will impair the ability of the Department of Defense to move \nforward in its effort to develop and deploy effective missile defenses.\n  The Warner amendment is consistent with the National Missile Defense \nAct of 1999, which passed the Senate, I remind the body, by a vote of \n97 to 3--virtually unanimous--that set out a goal of deploying an \neffective missile defense for the territory of the United States as \nsoon as technologically possible.\n  That was the standard we put forward. With the Warner amendment, we \ncould meet that. Without it, we will not. We will not have the funding \nnecessary to meet what we can do technologically. There will be \nrestrictions of what we can do.\n  In addition, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 set a goal of \nfurther negotiated reductions in nuclear weapons programs from Russia.\n  The amendment provides the opportunity to make more rapid progress in \ndeveloping and deploying effective missile defenses, a goal endorsed by \n97 of our colleagues.\n  The Warner amendment provides an offset based on anticipated \ninflation savings and will have no impact on other programs.\n  Even though the Warner amendment would boost the bottom line of the \nbill, it is protected from a budget point of order because it would \nauthorize discretionary spending--not mandatory spending.\n  The amendment will keep the defense budget within the amount \nrequested by DOD.\n  We have a number of possibilities for harm that could come to the \nUnited States--possibilities of nuclear, radiological, chemical, or \nbiological weapons capability. And we have possibilities that would be \nenormous disasters.\n  We know the al-Qaida network is pursuing these means of destruction \non the United States. U.S. intelligence uncovered rudimentary diagrams \nof nuclear weapons in an al-Qaida safehouse in Kabul. This year, the \nCIA reported that several of the 30 foreign terrorist groups and other \nnonstate actors around the world ``have expressed interest'' in \nobtaining biological, chemical, and nuclear arms. Such weapons of mass \ndestruction can be delivered on ballistic missiles aimed at U.S. forces \nand our friends. We cannot let this happen.\n  Today, our security environment is profoundly different than it was \nbefore September 11. Perhaps I should say it is not profoundly \ndifferent, but we realize how incredibly vulnerable the United States \nis, and we should have realized that prior to September 11.\n  The challenges facing the United States have changed from threat of a \nglobal war with the Soviet Union to the threat posed by emerging \nadversaries in regions around the world, including terrorism. In the \nwake of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, we need \nto look at the threat posed to us as a nation and how we should best \nutilize resources, which certainly includes an effective Missile \nDefense Program.\n  For those reasons, I strongly support the amendment soon to be laid \ndown by the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been listening to the Senator from \nKansas. He makes eminent sense. He demonstrates a frustration that we \nhave been living through now for certainly the last 10 years.\n  He mentioned the Missile Defense Act of 1999. There was an act that \nwas passed. It was passed by a huge margin, and certainly was a veto-\nproof margin, so the President did sign it. But then, after that, we \ndid not comply with the act. We have been living since--that was signed \nin 1999--outside the law in terms of taking the action to deploy ``as \nsoon as technologically possible.'' I think the excuse that was used at \nthat time was the ABM Treaty. I am very thankful that finally we have \ncrossed that bridge and we have gotten that behind us.\n  I have often looked back to 1972--and of course that was a Republican \nadministration, and I am a Republican--when we had Henry Kissinger. And \nat that time they said: There are two superpowers, the Soviet Union and \nthe United States of America. The whole thrust of that was mutually \nassured destruction. You won't protect yourself; we won't protect \nourselves. You shoot us, we will shoot you, and everybody dies, and \neverybody is happy.\n  That was a philosophy that everybody believed at that time. That was \nnot the world of today. Sometimes I look wistfully back to the cold \nwar. We had two superpowers. At least there was predictability. We knew \nwhat they thought and what their capabilities were. That is not true \ntoday. We have a totally different world.\n  Even Henry Kissinger, who was the architect of that plan, in 1996, \nsaid it is nuts to make a virtue out of our vulnerability. That is \nexactly what we have been doing.\n  I regretted each time President Clinton vetoed the Defense \nauthorization bill. I remember the veto message. It said: I will \ncontinue to veto any authorization bill or any bill that has money in \nit for a threat that does not exist--implying, of course, that the \nthreat did not exist: A nuclear weapon, a warhead being carried by \nmissile, hitting the United States of America. That was in 1995, his \nfirst veto.\n  Yet when we tried to get our intelligence to come up with some \naccuracy as to when the threat would exist, the National Intelligence \nEstimate of 1995 was highly politicized and said we were not going to \nhave this threat for another 15 years. At that very time our American \ncities were targeted by Chinese missiles. At that time, of course, that \nwas classified. It is not classified anymore. The threat, nonetheless, \nwas there.\n  I share the frustration of my friend from Kansas. I have 4 kids and \n11 grandkids. I look at the threat that is out there. I was very \npleased when the Rumsfeld commission established, in 1997, that the \nthreat was very real, the threat was imminent, and the long-range \nthreat could emerge without warning.\n  I was, as the years went by, trying to get some information to shock \nthis institution and other institutions into the reality that the \nthreat was imminent.\n  I recall writing a letter to General Henry Shelton, Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, and asking him if he agreed with the Rumsfeld \nrecommendations. He said the rogue state threat was unlikely, and he \nwas confident the intelligence would give us at least 3 years' warning. \nThis was at a time when we also included in this letter: Would you tell \nus when you think North Korea would have the capability of having a \nmultiple-stage rocket? He said that that would be in the years to come. \nThat was August 24, 1998. Seven days later, on August 31, 1998, North \nKorea launched a three-stage rocket that had the capability of reaching \nthe United States of America.\n  So all of that is going on right now. All of that has been happening. \nWe are finally at the point where we are going to vote on something--\nthe missile defense capability was taken out of the Defense \nauthorization bill, and now we have an opportunity to put it back. \nSingularly, this is the most important vote of this entire year, giving \nus this capability to meet this threat that is out there.\n\n  When I talk to groups, I quite often say--particularly when there are \nyoung people in the audience--I would like to see a show of hands as to \nhow many of you saw the movie ``Thirteen Days.'' Of course, most of \nthem saw it. I saw it. It was about the Cuban missile crisis in the \nearly 1960s, how the Kennedy administration was able to get us out of \nthat mess. All of a sudden we woke up one morning and found out cities \nwere targeted by missiles, and we had no missile defense.\n  In a way, the threat that faces us today is far greater than it was \nback in the 1960s because at least that was all from one island that \nyou could take out, I believe, in 22 minutes. Now we are talking about \nmissiles that are halfway around the world that, if deployed, would \ntake some 35 minutes to\n\n[[Page S5989]]\n\nget here. And we do not have anything in our arsenal--we are naked--to \nknock them down. That is the threat we are faced with today. It is out \nthere, and it is a very real threat.\n  I often think about September 11 and the tragedy of the skyline of \nNew York City when the planes came into the World Trade Center. It was \na very sad day in our country's history. But I thought, what if that \nhad been, instead of two airplanes in New York City, the weapon of \nchoice of terrorists--in other words, a nuclear warhead on a missile. \nIf that had been the case, then there would be nothing left in that \npicture of the skyline but a piece of charcoal, and we would not be \ntalking about 2,000 lives; we would be talking about 2 million lives. \nIt sounds extreme to talk this way, but that is the situation we are \nfaced with right now.\n  When you say, well, of course China is not going to do this, North \nKorea is not going to do this, and Russia is not going to do this--they \nare the ones that have a missile that can reach us--let's stop and \nrealize--and it is not even classified--that China today is trading \ntechnology and trading systems with countries such as Iran, Iraq, \nSyria, and Lebanon, so it does not have to be indigenous to be a \nthreat. The threat is there whether they buy a system from someone else \nor whether they make it themselves.\n  After the Persian Gulf war, Saddam Hussein said: If we had waited 10 \nyears to go into Kuwait, the Americans would not have come to their aid \nbecause we would have had a missile to reach the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I suggest to you here it is, 10 years later. The threat is imminent. \nWe are way past due in doing something about it. Today is a significant \nday when we can set out to do that, something that would defend \nAmerica. That is the primary function of what Government is supposed to \nbe doing. We have an opportunity to do that today.\n  So I encourage all my colleagues, for the sake of all of their people \nwhom they represent back home, and for the sake of my 4 kids and my 11 \ngrandkids, let's get this thing started and pass the Warner amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this morning I had the opportunity to \naddress the issue of missile defense from my perspective as the \nchairman of the Strategic Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee.\n  In the course of our deliberations over many months, with many \nhearings, hours of testimony, and more hours of briefings and staff \ncontacts, we looked very closely at the proposed budget for missile \ndefense this year by the Department of Defense. We supported many of \ntheir initiatives.\n  We are recommending $6.8 billion of new funding for fiscal year 2003. \nBut let me put that in a larger context. For fiscal year 2002, the \nDepartment of Defense estimates they have only spent $4.2 billion of \npreviously authorized money, leaving approximately $4 billion of \ncarryover funds for fiscal year 2003. So our recommendation, together \nwith carryover funds, will give the Department of Defense more than $10 \nbillion of available funding for fiscal year 2003.\n  That is a staggering amount of money. It is the largest 1-year \nfunding source for missile defense I think we have ever had in our \nhistory. It is the combination of not only what we authorize this year \nfor fiscal year 2003, but what has been authorized and not spent for \nfiscal year 2002.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator from Rhode Island yield on that point?\n  Mr. REED. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ALLARD. My understanding is they actually did not get into the \nspending, because we were in session late last year, until the second \nquarter. So when you get into second-quarter spending on a full year's \nallocation, obviously you are not going to have the opportunity to \nspend all the dollars. It is not because the need is not there, it is \njust because we were in session so late last year, in December, and \nthat is the reason those dollars that were budgeted did not get spent. \nI have all the confidence in the world we probably will catch up with \nthat.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator, my colleague, the ranking member from \nColorado, for that point. I do not disagree with that point, but I am \nmaking a different point, which I will make again; which is, regardless \nof what caused them not to spend the money last year, that money seems \nto be entirely available this year, together with our proposed funding \nlevel, and gives the Missile Defense Agency over $10 billion to spend \non missile defense in fiscal year 2003. That is robust funding by any \ndefinition. The suggestion that we are cutting out the heart of funding \nfor missile defense is, I think, erroneous.\n  We are supporting very strongly a missile defense program, but we are \nnot supporting it without looking carefully at its components and \nmaking tough choices about priorities of spending.\n  That is why, as a result of our proposed reductions, we were able to \nmove significant amounts of money into shipbuilding, which every Member \nof this body strongly recommends, commends, and supports. In addition, \nwe were able to move some money into Department of Energy security for \ntheir nuclear facilities, which is very important. We also have, in \nfact, provided a bill that robustly supports missile defense.\n  We did reduce the overall recommendation of the Department of Defense \nfor missile defense, but we also added funds into specific missile \ndefense programs which we believed were underfunded. For example, we \nadded an additional $30 million for test and evaluation of missile \ndefenses. One of the persistent criticisms of our missile development \nprogram is that they have not had realistic testing, that they have had \ntests but they didn't really represent in any meaningful way the type \nof actual environment in which the missiles must operate. We added \nadditional resources. This is one of the recommendations of everyone \nwho has looked at the Missile Defense Program.\n  We have added $40 million for a new, powerful, sea-based radar for \nthe Navy theater-wide system. Again, this is a system which General \nKadish, director of the Missile Defense Agency, announced 10 days ago \nor so was a likely candidate for contingency deployment in the year \n2004.\n  That was not suggested or recommended by the administration, but we \nbelieved very strongly that an additional $40 million to develop this \nradar was key to developing the Navy theater-wide system which could be \nthe major element of the sea-based system.\n  We have also added $40 million for the Arrow missile defense system. \nThat is a joint United States-Israeli program to develop and field--and \nit is far into the development phase--a theater missile system that \nwill protect not only Israel but United States forces, too, because we \nhope we will emphasize interoperability as we go forward with the \ndevelopment of that system.\n  Many colleagues have said the danger of terrorists obtaining missiles \nis acute in the Middle East, and we are putting more money into the \nsystem than was requested by the Department of Defense to ensure that \nour allies and our forces in that region have an effective missile \nscreen. That is a plus--not a minus--that we added, that the \nadministration did not request.\n  We have also included $22 million for an airborne infrared system \nwhich could be used as a near-term, highly accurate detection and \ntracking system for national or theater missile defense. Again, this \nwas not requested by the administration but supported and included by \nour deliberations at the committee level because we do in fact want to \nsee an effective missile defense system fielded at an early time.\n  Let me talk about some of the reductions we made. Before I get into \ndetails, we asked some basic questions: What are you going to spend the \nmoney for? What is the product? What do you want to buy? When do you \nplan on deploying such-and-such a system? Frankly, the answers we got \nwere very vague, very ambiguous. The Missile Defense Agency seems to be \nin the process of redefining their role, which is incumbent upon this \nnew agency. But in that phase of redefinition, they were not able to \nprovide the kind of specific data we requested. In fact, in some cases \nthey just plain refused to provide any really adequate information.\n\n  One example is that in last year's authorization, we requested, \nrequired by law in the report language, that they report to us on the \nlife-cycle costs of any system going into the engineering\n\n[[Page S5990]]\n\nphase. THAAD was in that engineering phase, and THAAD is a theater \nballistic missile being developed right now. Rather than reporting to \nus the life-cycle costs, they simply administratively took THAAD out of \nthat engineering phase, which suggests to me that either they don't \nhave these life-cycle costs or they were unwilling to share them with \nthe Congress.\n  We have to know these things. We have to make judgments about \ncritical systems, not just missile systems, shipbuilding, the \noperational readiness of our land forces, our air forces. All of these \nare tough choices with scarce resources. At a minimum, we have to know \nhow much these proposed systems will cost. In the case of missile \ndefense, it is very difficult, if not sometimes impossible, to get that \ninformation.\n  We looked at programs and expected they would be justified and \ndetailed in concrete ways. Frankly, we found many programs that \nappeared to be duplicative, ill-defined, and conceptual in nature. And \nthese programs were not inconsequential. We are not talking about a \ncouple of million dollars to do a study, we are talking about hundreds \nof millions of dollars; in the case of the Navy theater-wide, $52 \nmillion to do a study of concepts for sea-based midcourse naval \ndefense.\n  So that was the approach we took: Look hard at all of these programs, \nwith the purpose of trying to ensure that missile defense development \ngoes forward but also to ensure we had resources for other critical \nneeds of the Department of Defense.\n  One of the areas that appeared to us to be the least well justified \nwas the area of the BMD system cost--approximately $800 million--used, \nas they say, to integrate the multilayered BMD system. First, there are \na couple of timing issues. The various components of this BMD system \nhave not yet been decided. As a result, they have an awesome challenge \nto integrate components that have not been decided upon. That is just \nan obvious starting point. Again, there was not the clear-cut \ndefinition of what they were doing, and $800 million is a great deal of \nmoney to spend on simply contracting for consultants, engineers, and \nsystems reviews, particularly when the architecture of the components \nis not yet established.\n  We also found out, as we looked back at last year's authorization, \nwhich included a significant amount of money for this BMD system, that \nthe Department of Defense, as of midway through the year, had only \nspent about $50 million. We were informed that throughout the course of \nthe year they are expected to spend about $400 million, leaving about \n$400 million of resources in this one particular element, BMD systems, \nthat is available for fiscal year 2003 spending. So even with our \nreduction in BMD systems, they will still have a significant amount of \nmoney, upwards of $1 billion, for fiscal year 2003, in this one \ncategory of BMD systems.\n  Again, if you ask them what are they doing: We are integrating \nsystems. We are planning, and we are thinking.\n  All of that is very fair, but is that a sufficient justification for \n$1 billion when we have other pressing needs for national defense in \nthis budget?\n  As we go forward, we looked, again, very carefully, at all the \ndifferent elements. We made adjustments that we thought were justified \nby the lack of clear program goals, by duplicative funding, poorly \njustified funding, and then we looked at other issues.\n\n  For example, the THAAD Program. THAAD is a theater missile defense \nprogram that has been under development for several years. It had its \nproblems years ago. It was, frankly, off course. One of the conclusions \nof the Welch panel that looked at the THAAD Program was that they were \nrushing to failure. They were trying to do too much too fast. They were \nabandoning the basic principles of developing a system, good \nrequirements, moving forward deliberately, testing carefully. As a \nresult, the program was in danger of being canceled. The program is \nback on track now, with better engineering, commitment by the \ncontractors. They are moving forward.\n  But what the administration would like to do now is to go ahead and \npurchase 10 extra missiles for the THAAD Program. The problem is that \nthe first flight test for the THAAD is in fiscal year 2005. We fully \nfund this flight test, $895 million for the THAAD for developing the \nmissile, for flight testing in 2005. But ask yourself, why would we buy \n10 unproven missiles several years before the first flight test?\n  The administration talks about a contingency deployment. That is \nnice, but the first real flight test is several years from now. And in \na scarce, tough budgeting climate, why are you buying 10 extra missiles \nthat appear to be unnecessary before they follow through with the first \ntest flight. So we made a reduction of approximately $40 million for \nthose extra missiles.\n  Now, we also looked at some of the funding for what they described as \nboost phase experiments--$85 million. We found these very ill defined \nand conceptual. That is a lot of money for ``experiments,'' without \nother explanation.\n  Then we looked at the proposal to buy a second airborne laser \naircraft, $135 million. The airborne laser is an interesting system, \ndesigned to mount a laser in a 747 and use that to knock down a missile \nas it leaves the launch phase in its boost phase. It is very \ncomplicated technology, challenging just in the simple physics, let \nalone the hardware that you have to construct. I am told that the \nprototype laser is twice the size of a system that can fit on a 747. I \nam also told that the 747 that they are outfitting has yet to have been \nflown operationally in this capacity in a test.\n  So you asks yourself, when you have not developed a laser, when you \nhave not used it on the aircraft to actually engage targets, when you \nare working on basic optics problems and physics problems, why do we \nhave to buy a second airplane in this year? When, for example, you have \npeople complaining that the real chokepoint in our airplane fleet are \ntanker aircraft to support our ongoing operations. This is an example \nof expenditure we thought was unjustified. As a result, we suggested \nand recommended that there be reductions in this program.\n  Now, I wish to mention one other point in conjunction with the \nairborne laser because I think it is important. One of the things we \ndiscovered in our deliberation was that the Department of Defense has \nnot only totally revamped the Missile Defense Agency, but it is trying \nto give it an autonomy that exists for few, if any, other defense \nprograms. It has effectively eliminated review of its activities by the \nJROC, which is chaired by the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nwarfighters who eventually will use all this equipment. We believe, as \nwith most other programs, that it is required for these people to have \na say whether and how missile defense is being developed.\n\n  We found out that the Joint Chiefs of Staff were not consulted about \nthis budget that was submitted from the National Missile Agency for \nmissile defense in general; that they did not have an opportunity to \nsay you are spending too little or too much. They were frozen out. \nThose are the senior uniform leaders of our Armed Forces and they \ndidn't get a say in determining what should be spent on missile \ndefense.\n  As we develop these systems, we have to think, even at this point, \nhow are we going to use these systems? The airborne laser has real \npotential in a tactical situation where you are going against theater \nmissiles. If it is going to be used in a national missile situation, \nwhere we are trying to back down an aggressor that threatens us with an \nintercontinental missile launch, a couple issues should be considered: \nfirst, this is a 747 doing circles close to the airspace of a hostile \nnation. If we believe they have the capacity and the will to shoot an \nintercontinental missile at us, we have to assume they have the \ncapacity and the will to knock down a 747 as it circles in the air \nwaiting for the blastoff. So our first reaction militarily, I think, \nwould be that we would have to dominate the airspace, send our fighters \nin to preempt the attack so they won't have to send the 747. Why don't \nwe preempt the launch by attacking?\n  These are some of the operational issues that are being addressed. \nAll we are speaking about here is technological possibilities, but \nuntil they are integrated in with the coherent advice of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff and JROC, the weight of that advice and of these \nproposals, I think, has to be questioned. That is our job.\n  Now, we spent a great deal of careful time reviewing all of these \nsystems. As\n\n[[Page S5991]]\n\nI said, we support robust deployment of systems. The PAC-3 system is a \ntheater system that is well on the way to operational readiness. It is \nbeing tested right now. We have made some substantial and robust \nexpenditures for the THAAD Program. Navy theater-wide is a program we \nare supporting in terms of its testing and evaluation. We support the \nABL concept. We are funding it but the question before us is, Is it \ntime to buy a second airplane now? I think the answer is no.\n  The midcourse, the land-based national defense system in Alaska, has \nbeen robustly funded. A few days ago the administration announced that \na test bed has been started in Alaska for five missiles. That is fully \nsupported in this legislation that we bring to the floor--even though \nthere are real questions about its utility for anything more than a \ntest bed, or even for a test bed.\n  A contingency deployment would be likely directed against those \nnations identified as the ``evil empire.'' It turns out that the radar \nthat the system being used in Alaska, the COBRA DANE radar, does not \nface in the direction of Iraq and Iran. It would be impossible to track \nthose missiles. It has partial coverage of North Korea, but it would be \ndifficult to cover with that radar. The administration has rejected a \nproposal supported under the Clinton administration to build an X-band \nradar in conjunction with the Alaska test bed. One of the reasons that \nthe X-band radar was so important was indicated by General Kadish and \nothers in their testimony.\n\n  One of the real challenges for a midcourse interception is to \nidentify the warhead from all of the clutter, including decoys that \nwould likely be launched. To do that, you have to have a finely \ndiscriminating radar. The X-band is much more finely discriminating \nthan the L band, which is COBRA DANE. The administration says forget \nthat, we are not doing that. Yet we have funded this proposal fully \nbecause we recognize that the X-band radar is an important aspect of \ndefending the country. Yet we also recognize we don't have a blank \ncheck. We have to make tough judgments about what we spend.\n  So the idea that we are sort of blithely cutting programs and \neviscerating missile defense is, I think, wrong on its face. There is \n$6.8 billion in this year, coupled with almost $4 billion of funds, \nthat can be used from this year, meaning the fiscal year 2003 budget, \ncoupled with almost $4 billion still available from the fiscal year \n2002 budget, is robust funding for missile defense.\n  My last point is something that I think is important to emphasize in \nthe context of not just this program, but the overall challenge we \nhave. When Secretary Rumsfeld came up to the Appropriations Committee \nto argue for the cancellation of the Crusader system, he made the \npoint--which I think in his mind was very clear--that we face a defense \nbow wave of epic proportions as we go forward. If we fund all the \nprograms that we are proposing right now, we are going to have some \nvery hard choices. One of the problems with Secretary Rumsfeld's \nevaluation is it doesn't go as far as I think it should because, as far \nas I know, he is not including the cost of the deployment or operation \nof any missile defense system in the bow wave.\n  As we consider the long-term implications, we must consider that we \ncannot just add funds. We have to be careful about it, and we have to \nbe very careful about what these funds will be used for. We have done a \nvery thorough, detailed review of these programs. We have made \nsuggestions based upon the review. There are other pressing needs. The \nmost glaring to me is homeland defense and antiterrorism expenditures.\n  There, the possibility for extra spending probably exists. Here I \nthink we have made sound choices about priorities that will help \nenhance the defense of the country. I urge my colleagues to consider \ncarefully the proposals that Senator Levin might make but ultimately \nto, I hope, agree that the bill we brought to the floor contains robust \nspending that will enhance our defense through wise expenditures with \nrespect to missile defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the two managers of the bill are two of the \nmost experienced legislators we have on Capitol Hill, and so I have \nabsolute confidence in both of them. They certainly know how to handle \nlegislation. I have to say, though, it is 4 o'clock. It is Tuesday. We \nhave the July recess coming up soon. I do not know what the leader will \ndo, but I suggest to the leader that he should file cloture on this \nbill because it is obvious to me we are not going to be finished with \nthis bill tomorrow, and I think we are going to have trouble finishing \nthe bill on Thursday.\n  The decision is that of the majority leader, but I say to my two dear \nfriends, the senior Senator from Michigan and the senior Senator from \nVirginia, the manager and ranking member of this most important \ncommittee, that would be my recommendation to the leader, that he file \na cloture motion sometime this afternoon. It seems to me that is the \nonly way we are going to finish this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, last night I provided Chairman Levin with \na draft of my missile defense amendment and then we discussed it at \nlength this morning. At approximately 2:35 or 2:40, the Senator \nprovided me with a proposal the Senator from Michigan had. So he had my \namendment for a number of hours. I have only had his for about an hour \nand 30 minutes.\n  I have a lot of people with strong beliefs over on my side, and it \nseems to me it is not unreasonable given the amount of time that I was \nable to provide for the chairman and the leadership on his side, that I \nwould require just a bit more time to resolve good, honest differences \nof opinion on my side.\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering if I could ask my friend from Virginia and \nmy friend from Michigan, maybe we should go to some other amendment \nthen?\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask the indulgence of my good friend to enable me to \nwork a bit and see whether or not we can proceed to a clear \nunderstanding for a procedure such that the Senate can address the \nviews of the chairman and the views of the ranking member.\n  Mr. REID. As I said when I started this statement this afternoon, I \nhave the greatest confidence in the two managers of this bill. That \nbeing the case, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments in response \nto my colleague's comments earlier about trying to justify the cuts \nthey had in various parts of the Missile Defense Program.\n  I rise in support of the amendment that is going to be offered by the \nranking Republican in the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, and \nmyself, where we are restoring $814 million for missile defense and \nactivities of the Department of Defense to combat terrorism at home and \nabroad. This is an important amendment. It will allow the bill to move \nforward on a bipartisan basis, and I believe it deserves the support of \nevery Member of this body.\n  The committee bill dramatically reduces the President's funding \nrequest for missile defense. This bill actually makes a billion dollars \nin reduction and then adds back to the ballistic missile defense budget \nin areas where the funding was not requested. I confess that I am \nbaffled and deeply disappointed that the committee majority insisted on \nthese reductions.\n  The missile defense request this year was both reasonable and modest, \nin my view. At $7.6 billion, it was less than the request for fiscal \nyear 2002 by about $700 million and less than what was appropriated in \nfiscal year 2002 by $200 million. If the committee bill is enacted, \nmissile defense will be funded a billion dollars below last year's \nfunding level.\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can accept this \nbecause they look at missile defense as a\n\n[[Page S5992]]\n\ndrain on resources that can be better spent on other priorities. This \npoint of view says a missile attack is the least likely threat the \nNation must face and that every dollar spent on missile defense is a \ndollar we cannot spend on more likely threats.\n  Let us examine this point of view. The contention that a missile \nattack is the least likely threat the Nation will face is simply false \non the face of it. Ballistic missiles pose the most likely threat that \nwe must face. Indeed, we face it today and every day. Missiles and \nweapons of mass destruction are meant to deter. I know our colleagues \non the other side of the aisle believe this. They have often argued \nthat our own nuclear force levels are too high and that effective \ndeterrence does not require that many weapons.\n  According to the latest national intelligence estimate on missile \nthreats, our Nation faces a likely intercontinental ballistic missile \nthreat from Iran and North Korea and a possible threat from Iraq. \nDozens of nations have short- and medium-range ballistic missiles \nalready in the field that threaten U.S. interests, military forces, and \nour allies. The clear trend in ballistic missile technology is toward \nlonger range and greater sophistication. Once deployed, these missiles \nthreaten the United States, its allies, its friends, and deployed \ntroops. No one has to fire them to be effective. They are effective by \ntheir mere presence.\n  The most recent national intelligence estimate concludes that nations \nhostile to U.S. interests are developing these capabilities precisely \nto deter the United States. We already know that our adversaries \nbelieve we can be deterred from pursuing our interests. Earlier this \nyear, the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee received some \nremarkable testimony from Mr. Charles Duelfer in his capacity as the \nDeputy Executive Chairman of the U.N. Special Commission on Iraq. He \nhad the opportunity to interview senior Iraqi Ministers about Saddam \nHussein's perception of the gulf war. Many of us are aware that the \nUnited States threatened Iraq with extraordinary regime-ending \nconsequences should that nation use chemical or biological weapons \nagainst coalition forces during the conflict. The use of this threat \nhas been seen as a triumph of deterrence, but according to Mr. Duelfer, \nIraq loaded chemical and biological warheads on ballistic missiles.\n  Authority to launch those missiles was delegated to local commanders \nwith no further intervention or control by higher Iraqi authorities \nwith orders to launch if the United States moved on Baghdad.\n  We never attacked Baghdad. The Iraqi regime survived and survives \nthis day, and they attribute that survival to the deterrent effect of \nmissiles and weapons of mass destruction.\n  Furthermore, the national intelligence estimate also concludes that \nthe likelihood that a missile with a weapon of mass destruction will be \nused against U.S. forces or interests is higher today than during most \nof the cold war and will continue to grow as the capabilities of \npotential adversaries mature.\n  We have had testimony from many witnesses this year attesting to the \nseriousness of the threat. General Thomas Schwartz, then the Commander \nin Chief of U.S. Forces Korea, told the Armed Services Committee:\n\n       As a result of their specific actions, North Korea \n     continues to pose a dangerous and complex threat to the \n     peninsula and the WMD and missile programs constitute a \n     growing threat to the region and the world.\n\n  And Admiral Dennis Blair, the Commander in Chief of Pacific Command, \ntestified that he is ``worried about the missiles that China builds . . \n. which threaten Taiwan and . . . about the missiles which North Korea \nbuilds . . . to threaten South Korea and Japan.'' General Richard \nMeyers, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a letter to me \ndated May 7, 2002, wrote that ``the missile threat facing the United \nStates and deployed forces is growing more serious . . . Missiles \ncarrying nuclear, biological or chemical weapons could inflict damage \nfar worse than was experienced on September 11.''\n  In light of the consistency of views expressed by our intelligence \ncommunity and our military commanders, I just cannot fathom the point \nof view that disregards the missile threat. And yet we hear that other \npriorities, such as homeland security, are so much higher than missile \ndefense that deep reductions to funding for missile defense are \njustified. Let us put this view in perspective as well.\n  First of all, I would note that missile defense is, quintessentially, \nhomeland defense. Defenses against long-range missiles will protect our \npeople and our national territory, our shores and harbors, our cities, \nfactories, and farmlands from the world most destructive weapons. \nDefenses against shorter range missiles will protect our allies and our \ndeployed forces that are fighting for our freedom.\n  Secondly, approving the missile defense budget request will not \nimpair military readiness. General Meyers recently wrote to me he fully \nendorsed the President's missile defense request, and stated \nunequivocally that ``military readiness will not be hurt if Congress \napproves the . . . President's budget.''\n  Third, I would note that the missile defense program is not a single \nprogram activity. The $7.6 billion request funds about 20 sizable \nprojects in the Missile Defense Agency and the Army.\n  Finally, the missile defense request is a modest one when you realize \nthe magnitude of other defense efforts. The missile defense request for \nfiscal year 2003 is $7.6 billion. This is a mission we have never done \nbefore. In essence, we have almost no legacy capability. Contrast that \nwith the more than $11 billion we will spend on three tactical aircraft \nprograms in 2003. We will probably spend about $350 billion on these \nthree programs over their lifetime. And we have tremendous legacy \ncapabilities in this area. Our tactical aircraft are today the best in \nthe world. Another example: We will spend close to $40 billion in 2003 \non other homeland security programs. These are all important programs \nand address vital national security needs. But in light of the size of \nthese programs, the view that the missile defense request is wildly \nexcessive or out of line is misleading at best.\n  Consequently, I believe, as does the President, the Secretary of \nDefense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and the theater commander in \nchief, that the missile defense budget request is fair and reasonable. \nIn combination, these reductions represent a frank and potentially \ndevastating challenge to the administration's missile defense goals and \nhow the Department has organized itself to achieve those goals.\n  The administration established the Missile Defense Agency and \nexpedited oversight processes. The committee bill would cut \nliterally hundreds of government and contractors employees that work at \nthe Agency's headquarters and for the military services that serve as \nexecutive agents for missile defense programs. These are the people who \nprovide information technology, services, security, contract management \nand oversight for missile defense projects, and they are vital to good \nmanagement.\n\n  The administration seeks early deployment of missile defense \ncapabilities. The committee bill eliminates funds that could provide \ncapabilities for contingency deployment.\n  The Missile Defense Agency established a goal of developing multi-\nlayered defense capable of intercepting missiles of all ranges in all \nphases of flight. The committee bill reduces or eliminates funding for \nboost phase intercept systems and cuts funding for defenses against \nshort, medium, and intermediate range missiles by more than $500 \nmillion.\n  The Missile Defense Agency established a goal of developing a single \nintegrated missile defense system. MDA established a government-\nindustry National Team to select the best and brightest from industry \nto determine the best overall architecture and perform system \nengineering and integration and battle management and command control \nwork for the integrated missile defense system. The committee bill \nreduces by two-thirds funding for BMD system SE and BM/C2 and \nvirtually eliminates funding for the National Team.\n  The amendment offered by Senators Warner, Lott, Stevens, and I could \npotentially restore the $814 million net reduction to missile defense \nand reverse these unjustified committee actions. We all recognize, \nhowever, that missile defense is part of the larger picture of homeland \ndefense. This amendment provides the flexibility to the\n\n[[Page S5993]]\n\nPresident to direct this funding, as he see fit, to research and \ndevelopment for missile defense and for activities of the Department of \nDefense to counter terrorism.\n  I personally believe that the President would be completely justified \nin using the funding for missile defense. But to comfortably with the \nidea that President can direct these funds according to the Nation's \nneeds as he sees them. If the terrorist threat should take an \nunexpected turn, these funds could be valuable in the effort to assure \nthat a new threat can be contained. If such is not the case, he can \ndirect the funds to missile defense.\n  I believe that this is a reasonable and fair compromise that will \nallow the bill to move forward on a bipartisan basis. The gap between \nthe two sides on the missile defense issue is substantial. I recognize \nthat. This amendment is an honest and fair attempt to bridge that gap \nin a manner that can satisfy both sides. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I compliment the distinguished Senator from Colorado for \nhis statement. He is a member of the Armed Services Committee which \nreported this bill to the Senate. He has been a leader in the effort to \ndevelop and deploy an effective national missile defense system.\n  I strongly support the effort being made by Senator Warner, the \nranking Republican on this committee, to amend the bill, to authorize \nappropriations as requested by the President, for missile defense. It \nis clear to me that the reductions to that program contained in this \nbill are designed to prevent the successful development of effective \nmissile defenses. The reductions proposed in the committee bill \nobviously have been carefully selected to do the maximum amount of \ndamage to the President's plan to modernize these programs. These \nreductions do not trim fat. They cut the heart out of our missile \ndefense effort.\n  The President has embarked on a fundamental transformation of these \nprograms which was made possible by the withdrawal from the ABM Treaty. \nThat treaty had led to restrictions on our efforts to develop \ntechnologies to conduct tests and to develop effective missile defense \ncapabilities. The treaty outlawed promising basing modes, and it \nimposed stringent curbs on the types of technologies we could use to \ndefend ourselves against missile attack.\n  The President plans to transform the separate missile defense \nprograms into an integrated missile defense system which makes the most \nof the progress we have already made but which is supplemented with new \ncapabilities and new technologies such as the ability to destroy \nmissiles in their boost phase and to base missile defenses at sea. The \nPresident's budget request begins to make this transformation a \nreality.\n  The committee bill, on the other hand, cuts $362 million from the \nrequest for the ballistic missile defense system, under which \nfundamental engineering that is necessary to achieve this goal will be \nundertaken. This cut will eliminate two-thirds of the funding for \nsystem engineering and integration, and virtually eliminate the \nnational team which would integrate the various system elements.\n\n  The report accompanying the bill erroneously claims that these \nefforts are redundant with system engineering performed in the \nindividual programs. This is not the case. The engineering work this \nbill would eliminate is both distinct and vital.\n  The bill also cuts $108 million from program operations, again on the \nerroneous assumption that this effort is redundant. In fact, according \nto the Missile Defense Agency, if this cut stands, 70 percent of the \ncivilian workforce at the Agency would be eliminated.\n  The bill also guts the efforts to exploit new technologies and basing \nmodes which previously were prohibited, as I said, in the ABM Treaty, \nbut which we may now pursue. For example, $52 million is cut from the \nsea-based midcourse program. That program had a successful intercept \njust last week, its second in two attempts. But this bill would reduce \nfunds for testing and delay our ability to build on the recent \nsuccesses.\n  The airborne laser program, which will provide the United States not \nonly its first airborne missile defense system but the first to use a \ndirected energy weapon, it is reduced by $135 million in this committee \nbill, leaving the program with only one aircraft.\n  And the cuts go on: $55 million from the sea-based boost phase work; \n$30 million from space-based boost; $10 million from the space-based \nlaser. All of these cuts would severely hamper or eliminate work on \npromising new basing modes or new technologies, just as we have been \nfreed by the withdrawal from the ABM Treaty to fully undertake our \nresearch and investigations.\n  The bill also cuts efforts for which even longtime defenders of the \nABM Treaty and missile defense critics have always professed support. \nFor example, critics have said that our missile defenses need more \ntesting, and outside experts have agreed with that.\n  So what have they done in this bill? Eliminated 10 test missiles from \nthe THAAD Program--not named for me. This is the THAAD--Theater High \nAltitude Air Defense is what it stands for--Program.\n  Year after year, the generals in charge of our Missile Defense \nProgram have testified that their testing has been ``hardware poor.'' \nThey did not have enough of the missiles that they needed, the test \nmissiles. They have had so little test hardware that when something \ngoes wrong, as inevitably and occasionally is going to happen in a test \nprogram, they are forced to bring the program to a stop while they look \nfor other hardware or try to deal with the problem in some other way.\n  Congress has been asked by this administration to provide more \nhardware so that testing can continue when problems develop so that \nthese problems can be corrected. General Kadish has called this \n``flying through failure.'' You have to keep testing to find out how to \nsolve the problems, and many of our efforts along this line have been \nsuccessful and problems have been solved.\n  We have seen test after successful test in not only the THAAD Program \nthat we mentioned, but in the longer range higher velocity missile test \nprograms.\n  But this bill cuts from the THAAD Program 10 flight test missiles \nthat will help ensure our ability to fly through failure and keep the \nprogram on track.\n\n  In the past, opponents have also criticized the program generally as \nbeing too risky--which means there is a lot of chance for failure. It \ndoesn't mean that it is risky in that it will not work, it is that you \nwill have failures along the line. But if you go back in the history of \nour Defense Department and look at new product development--the Polaris \nMissile is an example or the Sidewinder Missile is an example--they had \nmore failures by far in those early days of testing than these missile \ndefense programs have had. So failures are expected.\n  But the good news is that we are making very impressive progress. \nNow, right on the brink of the transformation of the programs into a \nmodernized, fully authorized program, this committee goes through and \ncuts out just enough--and in some cases more than enough--of certain \nactivities that are involved in the integrated Missile Defense Program \nto guarantee its failure, to guarantee that we will not be able to \nsucceed in deploying an effective missile defense to protect the \nsecurity of Americans here at home.\n  While applauding homeland defense as a necessity, we are, on the one \nhand, saying it is a good idea and saying we are going to work with the \nPresident to make that be an effective way to defend ourselves more \neffectively than we have in the past, and then, on the other hand, \neliminating authorization for funds that are absolutely essential for \nan effective missile defense program.\n  They cut $147 million from the midcourse defense segments. The \ncommittee eliminated funding for the complementary exoatmospheric kill \nvehicle, which would reduce the risk of relying on the single design \nnow being tested.\n  Opponents have claimed that missile defenses will be vulnerable to \ncountermeasures. But guess what. This bill takes the funding away from \ntesting against countermeasures. Can you believe that? I have read \narticle after article in papers, the Union of Concerned Scientists \nsaying: Well, missiles can hit a missile in full flight. But if there\n\n[[Page S5994]]\n\nwere an extra balloon or a decoy or two, they would not be able to \ndifferentiate the difference between the decoy and the actual missile \nthat is attacking us.\n  We have proven in tests over the Pacific that it can be done, that \nthe intercept missile has differentiated between the missile and the \ndecoy. Then the scientists say: Oh, but that was just one decoy. It was \nnot sophisticated. What if a potential enemy deploys a lot of decoys?\n  Here the administration plans to do just that as it gets more \nsophisticated and proves that one thing can work, and how complicated \ncan an enemy be--we will find out whether we can defend against that. \nBut they cut the money so we can't do that. The opponents of the \nmissile defense effort are playing right into the hands of the critics. \nI guess next they will say there is no money for the additional decoys \nand the countermeasures. Of course there isn't. They took the money out \nof the bill.\n  I am hopeful Senators will look at the details and not just assume, \nOK, the Democrats think the President is spending too much on missile \ndefense, the Republicans want to spend more.\n  We are trying to support the President. At a time when our country is \nunder threat from terrorists, we are confronted with nation states \nbuilding more sophisticated intercontinental ballistic missile \ncapability, testing those missiles, as North Korea did and as other \nnation states are doing. And you can get the intelligence reports. We \nget them routinely, on a regular basis. And we have public hearings on \nthose that can be discussed publicly.\n\n  In those hearings it has become abundantly clear that there is a \nproliferation of missile technology in the world today and a lot of \nnation states that say they are out to destroy us and to kill Americans \nwherever they can be found are building these systems and testing these \nsystems.\n  We need to proceed to support our President in this legislation. Of \nall times to start nitpicking a request for missile defense and go \nabout it in the way that is undertaken in this bill and say: We have \nleft a lot of money here for missile defense. The President has asked \nfor billions--for $7 billion. We just have taken out less than a \nbillion, $800 million.\n  But look where the money is coming from. The money that is being \ntaken away from the programs is designed to prevent the full-scale \ndevelopment of a modern missile defense capability. That is the result \nif the Senate does not adopt an amendment to change these reductions, \nto eliminate these reductions and give the President what he is asking \nfor. And that is a capability to integrate all of the systems into one \nengineering and development program, for efficiency sake--for \nefficiency, to save money in the long run so we will not have to have \nredundant engineering programs. We won't have to have engineering \ncontracts to the private sector. We will not have to have redundant \ncontracts with the private sector. We can bring it all together and \nhave a layered system that would be a lot more efficient and a lot more \neffective.\n  There is more to this than politics. We are talking about a threat to \nour Nation's security, to the livelihood and well-being of American \ncitizens, to American troops in the field, and to the ships at sea in \ndangerous waters and in dangerous areas of this world today.\n  Is this Senate about to take away the opportunity to defend those \nassets, those resources, our own citizens, our own troops, and our own \nsailors? I am not going to be a part of that.\n  This Senate needs to hear the truth. The truth is looking at the \ndetails of the proposal that this committee is making to the Senate. \nDon't let them do this. We will pay dearly for it in the years ahead by \nhaving to appropriate more money than we should for individual programs \nor in catastrophes that could have been avoided.\n  As I said, opponents have claimed that missile defenses will be \nvulnerable to countermeasures, yet the reductions in this bill \neliminate funding for counter-countermeasure work that would address \nthis problem.\n  One could be forgiven for concluding that the goal here is not to \nimprove the missile defense system, but to ensure it is continually \nvulnerable to criticism.\n  In the past, disagreements about missile defense in the Senate have \nbeen largely over whether to defend the territory of the United States, \nand then mostly because such defenses were prohibited by the ABM \nTreaty. At the same time, there has been near unanimous support for \nmissile defense capabilities that will protect our troops deployed \noverseas. Yet, this bill would take hundreds of millions of dollars \nfrom our theater missile defense programs, even as our troops are \ndeployed in what we all acknowledge will be a long military effort in a \npart of the world that is saturated with ballistic missiles. It is both \nbaffling and troubling that the Armed Services Committee would so \nseverely reduce funding for these programs--at any time, but especially \nnow.\n  For example, the revolutionary Airborne Laser Program is reduced by \n$135 million, restricting the capability to just one aircraft. Having \ntwo or more aircraft means that one can be grounded for service or \nupgrading without losing the capability altogether. But with a single \naircraft, this important theater defense capability will be \nunnecessarily constrained.\n  The THAAD Program will provide the first ground-based defense against \nlonger-range theater missiles like North Korea's No Dong and its \nderivatives, such as Iran's Shahab-3. The No Dong is already deployed--\nour troops in Korea and Japan are threatened by it today, but this bill \ncuts funding for THAAD by $40 million.\n  The Medium Extended Air Defense System--or MEADS--is a cooperative \neffort with Italy and Germany to field a mobile theater missile defense \nsystem; it is reduced by $48 million.\n  The sea-based midcourse program--formerly known as Navy Theater \nWide--will provide the first sea-based capability to shoot down \nmissiles like the No Dong. The program had its second successful \nintercept attempt just last week, but this bill would cut the program \nby $52 million.\n  The Space-Based Infrared--or SBIRS-Low--Program will provide \nmidcourse tracking of both theater and intercontinental missiles. The \nprogram has just been restructuring by the administration, but this \nbill's reduction of $55 million will force it to be restructured again, \nfurther delaying this essential capability.\n  The arbitrary cuts to the systems engineering efforts and the program \noperations of the Missile Defense Agency will fall just as heavily on \ntheater missile defense programs as on our efforts to defend against \nlong-range missiles. Altogether, some $524 million of the missile \ndefense reductions contained in this bill fall on our efforts to defend \nagainst the thousands of theater ballistic missiles our deployed troops \nface today. This is irresponsible and unconscionable.\n  This bill isn't just micromanagement of the missile defense program, \nit is micro-mismanagement. The reductions contained in this bill have \nbeen carefully tailored to undermine the missile defense program and \ncompromise its effectiveness. If the general in charge of the program \ntried to manage it the way this bill does, he would be fired.\n  President Bush's courageous act of withdrawing from the ABM Treaty \nhas freed our Nation--for the first time in over three decades--to \npursue the best possible technologies to protect our citizens and \ndeployed troops from missile attack. If allowed to stand, the \nreductions contained in this bill would squander that opportunity by \ncrippling the efforts to transform our missile defense program in ways \nimpossible until now. The Senate should reject these irresponsible cuts \nand give the President a chance to make this program work. I urge \nSenators to support the Warner amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the United States completed its withdrawal \nfrom the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty on June, 13, 2002, and the \nPentagon has shifted into high gear its efforts to deploy a rudimentary \nanti-missile system by 2004. The drivers of this missile defense hot-\nrod are doing their best to make it look as good as possible, and they \nare spreading the word of its latest successes on the test track.\n  But I am not alone in wondering what this vehicle, with its $100 \nbillion purchase price, really has under the\n\n[[Page S5995]]\n\nhood. Does it have the souped-up engine that we are being promised, or \nis this another dressed-up jalopy? And, more importantly, as this \nmissile defense hot-rod charges down the road with its throttle wide \nopen and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in the rear-view mirror, is \nthe scrutiny of Congress and the American people being left in the \ndust?\n  As part of its normal oversight duties, the Armed Services Committee \nhas requested from the Department of Defense information relating to \ncost estimates and performance measures for various components of the \nmissile defense research program that is underway. This kind of \ninformation is essential to allowing Congress to render its own \nassessment of whether these programs are on-budget and meeting \nexpectations.\n  As the Armed Services Committee began hearings on the fiscal year \n2003 Defense budget request in February 2002, we requested basic \ninformation from the Department of Defense on its proposed missile \ndefense program. We asked for cost estimates, development schedules, \nand performance milestones. But the committee has not received the \ninformation. It is as though the Department of Defense does not want \nCongress to know what we are getting for the $7.8 billion in missile \ndefense funds that were appropriated last year.\n  On March 7, 2002, at an Armed Services Committee hearing, I \nquestioned the Pentagon's chief of acquisition, Under Secretary Pete \nAldridge, about the delays in providing this information to Congress. \nHe answered my questions with what I believed was an unequivocal \nstatement that he would make sure that Congress gets the information it \nneeds.\n  Three and a half months later, we still have not received the \ninformation that we requested. It also seems that the Pentagon is \ndeveloping a new aspect of its strategy in its consultations with \nCongress and the American people. On June 9, 2002, The Los Angeles \nTimes ran an article entitled, ``Missile Data To Be Kept Secret.'' The \nWashington Post ran a similar story on June 12, ``Secrecy On Missile \nDefense Grows.'' The two articles detail a decision to begin \nclassifying as ``secret'' certain types of basic information about \nmissile defense tests.\n  These missile defense tests use decoys to challenge our anti-missile \nsystem to pick out and destroy the right target, which would be a \nwarhead hurtling toward the United States at thousands of miles per \nhour. According to the newspaper articles, the Pentagon will no longer \nrelease to the public descriptions of what types of decoys are used in \na missile defense test to fool our anti-missile radars. This \ninformation will be classified.\n  Independent engineers and scientists who lack security clearances \nwill have no means to form an opinion on the rigor of this aspect of \nmissile defense tests. No longer will the experts outside the \ngovernment be able to make informed comments on whether a missile \ndefense test is a realistic challenge to a developmental system, or a \nstacked deck on which a bet in favor of our rudimentary anti-missile \nsystem is a sure winner.\n  I do not think that it is a cooincidence that independent scientists \nhave criticized the realism of past missile defense tests because the \ndecoys used were not realistic. I cannot help but be left with the \nimpression that the sole reason for classifying this kind of basic \ninformation is to squelch criticism about the missile defense program.\n  Should this basic information about our missile defense program be \nprotected by the cloak of government secrecy? If the tests are rigorous \nand our anti-missile system is meeting our expectations, would it not \nbe to our advantage to let our adversaries know how effective this \nsystem will be?\n  But perhaps this national missile defense system is not progressing \nas rapidly as hoped. Then would it not be to our advantage to encourage \nconstructive criticism in order to improve the system? In either case, \nI cannot see how these secrecy edicts will promote the development of a \nmissile defense system that actually works.\n  The bottom line is that Congress and the American people must know \nwhether the huge sums that are being spent on missile defense will \nincrease our national security. Since September 11, we have been \nconsumed with debates about homeland security. What is this system \nintended to be but a protection of our homeland?\n  Do we believe that American people can be entrusted with information \nabout their own security? I certainly think so. Without a doubt, we \nneed to carefully guard information that would compromise our national \ndefense, but public scrutiny of our missile defense program is not an \ninherent threat to our security.\n\n  In April, the Appropriations Committee heard testimony from a number \nof people with expertise in homeland security. We heard many warnings \nabout the peril of losing public trust in our Government. No matter if \nthe threat is terrorists with biological weapons or rogue states with \nmissiles, we must not jeopardize the trust of the American people in \ntheir Government. If the missile defense system does not work as it is \nsupposed to do, and we hide its shortcomings inside ``top secret'' \nfolders and other red tape, we will be setting ourselves up for a sure \nfall. We ought to have more, not fewer, independent reviews of our \nantimissile system.\n  So I oppose the amendment to increase missile defense funding in this \nbill by $812 million. The Department of Defense has shown it is more \nthan willing to delay and obfuscate details about what it is doing on \nmissile defense, and I cannot understand the logic of increasing funds \nfor an antimissile system that is the subject of greater and greater \nsecrecy. It does not make sense to devote more money to a system of \nquestionable utility before there is a consensus of independent views \nthat an antimissile system is technologically feasible. The missile \ndefense system that we are developing needs more scrutiny, not more \nsecrecy, more assessment, not more money.\n  In the next few days, the Senate will vote on this bill and authorize \nbillions of dollars in missile defense funds. While the Pentagon will \ncontinue to portray these programs as a hot rod that is speeding toward \nsuccess, one thing is certain: this hot rod is running on almost $8 \nbillion in taxpayer money this year. Talk about a gas guzzler! If \nCongress is not allowed to kick the tires, check the oil and look under \nthe hood, this rig could fall apart and leave us all stranded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/25/senate-section/article/S5995-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5995-S5996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IMMEDIATE ACTION FOR AMTRAK\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Nation faces a transportation crisis. \nAmtrak, the country's passenger rail service, is running out of dough--\nD-O-U-G-H--money, that green stuff, funds, what makes the cash \nregisters ring, funds, and its passengers are running out of time. \nWithout an infusion of funding quickly, Amtrak will stop all operations \nwithin the next very few days.\n  If Amtrak closes, the Nation's transportation system will be thrown \ninto chaos. All of Amtrak's 68,000 daily riders will be without \nservice. Thousands of vacation passengers who have already paid money \nfor Amtrak tickets will be left stranded at the station. Commuter \nrailroads from East to West will be completely shut down.\n  For example, Washington's Union Station is just a few blocks from \nthis Capitol. None of the Maryland or Virginia commuter rail trains \nwill be able to access Union Station. Why? Because Amtrak owns the \nstation. The Virginia trains will not operate at all because Amtrak \nruns the trains.\n  The commuter rail authorities in Philadelphia, New York City, and in \nmany parts of New Jersey will stop running. Why? Why will they stop \nrunning? Because Amtrak provides the electricity for those trains to \noperate.\n  Access to Penn Station in New York City the single busiest rail \nstation in the country will be limited. Why? Because Amtrak already has \nmortgaged away parts of that station.\n  In Boston, tens of thousands of commuters daily rely on Amtrak \nbecause it operates commuter lines under contract with the State of \nMassachusetts. Those commuters will have to find a new way to get to \nwork. Why? Because their trains will not be running.\n  Out West, in California, all ``Caltrains'' service will be halted. \nWhy? Why, I ask? Because Amtrak operates those trains. That is why. The \nsame can be said for the ``Sounder Commuter Rail Service'' in Seattle.\n  Without Amtrak service, these passengers will take to the highways \nand\n\n[[Page S5996]]\n\nthe airways. The traffic jams that are already difficult to navigate \nwill grow by thousands, tens of thousands of cars. How would you like \nthat? The airways between Boston, New York, and Washington already \ncomprise the most congested airspace in the entire country. The air \ntraffic control system cannot simply absorb dozens of additional \nflights during peak business travel times.\n  Mr. President, the July 4th holiday is almost upon us. As the \ncelebrations approach, the warnings for potential terrorist attacks \ngrow louder. We should heed those warnings and ensure that Amtrak stays \nopen. Amtrak has a vital homeland security role. The railroad is a \nviable transportation alternative to highways and airways. To allow \nAmtrak to close its doors now, when the terrorist threats and the \nattack warnings come almost daily, would be irresponsible, wouldn't it? \nIt seems to me it would be. To take away the safety net for the \ntraveling public would be foolhardy, wouldn't it? Wouldn't it be? I \nwould think so.\n  We also must consider the ramifications to the Nation's economy if \nAmtrak is allowed to file for bankruptcy. Immediately, more than 20,000 \nAmtrak employees would lose their jobs. That is 20,000 families without \npaychecks, 20,000 families without health care benefits. Thousands more \njobs at commuter lines, suppliers, and vendors would be in jeopardy. In \nthe blink of an eye, the Nation's economy would be dealt a devastating \nblow in States from coast to coast. With the economy in a precarious \nstate as it is, with the markets fluctuating by the day, it makes no \nsense--none--to allow Amtrak to close.\n  With the support of the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Stevens of Alaska, I have proposed, in our \ndiscussions with House conferees on the supplemental appropriations \nbill, that the supplemental appropriations bill, currently pending in \nconference, include at least $205 million for Amtrak to keep trains \nrunning through the end of the fiscal year. With the looming crisis \nfacing the Nation's passenger rail service, we should insist that this \nfunding for Amtrak be part of the final version of the bill, hopefully \nto be considered by Congress this week.\n  The Senate included $55 million for Amtrak emergency repairs in its \nversion of the supplemental bill which passed on June 7 by an \noverwhelming margin of 71 to 22. The House did not include any funds \nfor Amtrak in its bill. The conference report on the supplemental bill \nwould build on the package already approved by the Senate and provide \nsufficient funding to keep Amtrak on track through the end of this \nfiscal year.\n  Last week, Amtrak's new president, David Gunn, testified before the \nSenate Appropriations Transportation Subcommittee. At that hearing, Mr. \nGunn said:\n\n       The urgency of this is enormous. We are very near the point \n     of no return.\n\n  Those are not Robert Byrd's words. They are the words of Mr. David \nGunn, new president of Amtrak. Let me repeat them:\n\n       The urgency of this is enormous. We are very near the point \n     of no return.\n\n  In the days since that hearing, there has been no news that I know \nabout to change Mr. Gunn's assessment of the situation. Amtrak's board \nof directors has been involved in discussions with Transportation \nSecretary Norman Mineta and the Federal Railroad Administration. But \nthe national administration, instead of stepping up to the plate and \nproviding Amtrak with the funding that it needs, has pushed for a half-\nway approach that only delays the crisis.\n  I have spoken with Secretary Mineta. I have spoken with President \nGunn. Following those conversations, it is clear that the best \nalternative is an emergency appropriation of $205 million. That is cash \non the barrel head. There is no time for creative accounting. There is \nno time for posturing. There is no time for so-called reforms. We can \ntalk about reforms and improvements later, but we cannot reform a dead \nrailroad. Amtrak needs help. It needs help now.\n  Last September, when the nation's airline industry was shut down, to \nwhom did Americans turn for transportation? To Amtrak. Since then, \nAmtrak's ridership has continued to increase, with record numbers of \nAmericans turning to passenger rail service. At a time when the Nation \nis turning to Amtrak, the Federal Government should not turn its back.\n  On September 21, after just a few hours of debate, Senators approved \n$15 billion for the airline industry. Of those funds, $10 billion was \nmade available in loan guarantees and $5 billion in cash for emergency \ngrants. Few questions were asked. The airlines needed this infusion; \nthe airlines got it. Congress acted; the administration acted. We \nshould do the same now.\n  We did not blink when the airline industry faced a financial crisis. \nThe administration did not urge grand reforms of the airline industry \nin order to qualify for these funds. Congress did not urge grand \nreforms of the airline industry in order to qualify for these funds. \nWhen asked for help, when the need was clear, Congress and the \nadministration provided help to the airlines. We ought to show the same \nleadership for the Nation's rail passengers and employees.\n  The truth of the matter is that none of this has to happen. We can \nprovide a short-term immediate solution for Amtrak to carry it through \nthe fiscal year by enacting the proposal I have made, with the support \nof Senator Stevens, in the supplemental appropriations conference, for \n$205 million in the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  I have joined with more than 40 Senators to urge President Bush to \nsupport the $205 million supplemental appropriation. As the letter \nstates: The Nation's economy and the Nation's morale have suffered \nenough since September 11. Allowing the Nation's passenger rail service \nto shut down would idle more than 20,000 employees and throw the lives \nof tens of thousands of passengers into disarray. The administration \nand Congress must not allow this to happen.\n  Quite simply, Amtrak is vital. It is vital to those Americans who \nrely on Amtrak for their daily commute to and from work. It is vital to \nthose Americans who use Amtrak for their vacation travel. It is vital \nto thousands of rail employees. It is vital to our Nation's homeland \nsecurity. Congress should move ahead with an emergency appropriation \nfor Amtrak and stave off the bankruptcy that would result in absolute \nchaos for the Nation's transportation network and would give certitude \nand assurance to Amtrak that the Federal Government, Congress, and the \nadministration do not intend to let it happen to Amtrak; that the \nFederal Government, that Congress and the administration, stand ready \nto act, and act quickly. The administration and the congressional \nleadership should support the addition of $205 million in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill for Amtrak.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/25/senate-section/article/S5996-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5996-S5999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have in many ways a good Defense \nauthorization bill. I am sorry we are debating again this year over \nnational missile defense.\n  Last year, the same debate occurred. It was about the only major \ndisagreement we had over the Defense authorization bill, but it is a \nvery important issue. It is important to the people of the United \nStates. It is important to the President and the Secretary of Defense \nwho are charged with defending our homeland against attack. We have to \ndebate it again this year. That is healthy. That is what this body is \nall about.\n  In 1999, it is important to recall, the Senate voted 97 to 3 to \n``deploy as soon as technologically feasible a national missile defense \nsystem.'' That represented the overwhelming consensus of opinion in \nthis body. President Clinton signed that bill. President Clinton stated \nthat he favored the deployment of a national missile defense system.\n  During the 2000 campaign, Vice President Gore said he was for it. \nPresident Bush made quite clear in his campaign for the Presidency that \nhe considered the deployment of a national missile defense system a \nhigh priority for America.\n  We should not fail to note that Vice President Gore's candidate for \nVice President, Senator Joe Lieberman, was\n\n[[Page S5997]]\n\na cosponsor with Senator Cochran of the National Missile Defense Act of \n1999 and a supporter of national missile defense. He quite clearly \nstated that position during the campaign for the Presidency.\n  It is a bipartisan issue. There is no doubt about it. President Bush \nhad it somewhat higher on his priority than President Clinton, but \neverybody was on board about the issue in general.\n  When President Bush became President, he proposed last year for the \n2002 budget a $7.8 billion national missile defense budget.\n  President Clinton had proposed a $5.3 billion national defense \nbudget, so he was a little over $2 billion above what President Clinton \nproposed. We voted on it in committee. On a party-line vote, the \nDemocratic majority struck that increase--or a significant portion of \nit--from the bill. We took it to the floor last year and, after full \ndebate, that money was restored.\n  Again this year the President asked for missile defense funds. It is \nnot correct, however, to say he asked for an increase. He actually \nasked for less this year for national missile defense. He asked for, I \nbelieve, $7.6 billion this year as opposed to $7.8 billion last year, \nall of which was necessary to complete the research and development and \ntesting that is necessary to bring this system online. Let me note, \npeople say that is billions and billions of dollars. It is a lot of \nmoney, no doubt about it; but we have a $376.2 billion defense budget. \nThe $7.6 billion needed to deploy and bring online a national missile \ndefense system to protect us from missile attack is not too much, in my \nopinion, and is a rather small part of the overall defense budget.\n  So, again, we had in committee a 13 to 12 party-line vote on a motion \nthat cut the President's request by over $814.3 million this year. And \nthe way those cuts were made--as Senator Cochran and others have noted, \nthose cuts took parts of programs and undermined the brain trust or the \ncapabilities of many of the systems--some of the testing capabilities \nthat the people who have been a critic of the system say we ought to \ndo. It undermined our ability to do that.\n  It is an unwise act, in my view. We need a continual, steady funding \nsource that the Defense Department can count on so that they can \ndevelop, over a period of years, an effective national missile defense \nsystem. We would be very unwise if every year we cut a little bit and \ntry to fight to put that back and go up and down in the budget. That \ncosts more money in the long run and is not healthy. It was one of the \nPresident's top priorities when he took office. It is a top priority, I \nbelieve, of all Americans. I believe we should go forward with it.\n  Well, people say: Why do we need this budget? Why do we need a \nnational missile defense? There are a lot of threats to America, but we \ndon't believe we are threatened by intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles--or words to that effect.\n  Several years ago, when President Clinton was President, he appointed \na bipartisan commission, or one was selected and put together. The \nchairman turned out to be the now Secretary of Defense, Donald \nRumsfeld. That commission, after studying the intelligence situation, \nthe threats facing America--Republicans and Democrats of both parties--\nunanimously agreed that we were facing an increased threat; that we \nwould, indeed, be facing a ballistic missile threat to this country \nsooner than had been projected; and that we needed to prepare \nourselves.\n  So I would like people to know how these things occur. We don't just, \nout of the blue, come up with ideas that we need to have a national \nmissile defense. We deal with some of the best experts. We listen to \ntheir testimony in the Senate Armed Services Committee and, based on \nthat testimony under oath, recognizing that what witnesses say has \ngreat import, they help us decide how to spend our resources.\n  Admiral Wilson, the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told \nus this recently, on March 19 of this year, about Iran: Iran continues \n``the development and acquisition of longer range missiles and weapons \nof mass destruction to deter the United States and to intimidate Iran's \nneighbors.'' He added about Iran, ``It is buying and developing longer \nrange missiles.''\n\n  He notes that Iran already has chemical weapons and is ``pursuing \nbiological and nuclear capabilities,'' both of which can be placed \ninside an intercontinental ballistic missile. He concludes on Iran that \nIran will ``likely acquire a full range of weapons of mass destruction \ncapability, field substantial numbers of ballistic and cruise missiles, \nincluding perhaps an ICBM, that will be capable of hitting the United \nStates.''\n  Admiral Wilson on Iraq: ``Baghdad continues to work on short-range--\n150 kilometer--missiles and can use this expertise for future long-\nrange missile development.'' He adds, ``Iraq may also have begun to \nreconstitute chemical and biological weapons programs,'' as we have \nheard so much concern expressed about, all of which can be delivered by \nmissile. Wilson concludes that ``it is possible that Iraq can develop \nand test an ICBM capable of reaching the United States by 2015.''\n  Admiral Wilson on North Korea: ``Korea continues to place heavy \nemphasis on the improvement of its military capability and North Korea \ncontinues its robust efforts to develop more capable ballistic \nmissiles.''\n  We know North Korea has been doing that for some time and testing \nthose missiles. Admiral Wilson said this specifically as to North \nKorea: It is ``developing an ICBM capability with its Taepo Dong 2 \nmissile, judged capable of delivering a several hundred kilogram \npayload to Alaska and Hawaii, and a lighter payload to the western half \nof the United States.'' They have that capability in North Korea now.\n  The President of the United States has to deal with these issues. He \nhas to consider what might happen as he deals with these countries.\n  Admiral Wilson, further on North Korea, added this: ``It probably has \nthe capability to field''--that means put into place right now--``an \nICBM within the next couple of years.'' That is a frightening thought. \n``North Korea continues,'' he added, ``to proliferate''--that is to \nsell or distribute--``weapons of mass destruction, and especially \nweapons technology.''\n  CIA Director George Tenet, in March of this year before the Armed \nServices Committee, said this about the Chinese military buildup:\n\n       Earlier this month, Beijing announced a 17.6 increase in \n     defense spending, replicating last year's increase of 17.7 \n     percent. If this trend continues, China could double its \n     announced defense spending between 2000 and 2005.\n\n  Tenet added further on China:\n\n       China continues to make progress toward fielding its first \n     generation of road-mobile strategic missiles, the DF-31, a \n     longer range version, capable of reaching targets in the \n     United States, which will become operational later this \n     decade.\n\n  In the CIA's unclassified report of January 10 of this year, entitled \n``Foreign Missile Development,'' they wrote this:\n\n       China has about 20 liquid propellant missiles, silo based, \n     that could reach targets in the United States.\n\n  The report also said China continues ``a long-running modernizational \nprogram and expects within 15 years to have 75 to 100 ICBM's deployed \nprimarily against the United States.''\n  Admiral Wilson, testifying about the China situation, noted:\n\n       One of Beijing's top military priorities is to strengthen \n     and modernize its small daily strategic nuclear deterrent \n     force.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       The number, reliability, survivability, and accuracy of \n     Chinese strategic missiles, capable of hitting the United \n     States, will increase during the next 10 years.\n\n  There are about 15 to 16 countries now that have these kinds of \nmissiles. I shared those from some recent testimonies we have had \nbefore our committee. This is not a myth. We are not talking about an \nabstract idea. We are talking about a different world. In the previous \nworld, the Soviet Union had missiles, we had missiles, and we entered \ninto a treaty to bar the deployment of a national missile defense \nsystem. We agreed to that, and it worked for some time.\n  Unfortunately--or fortunately in some ways--the country we had a \ntreaty with, the Soviet Union, no longer exists, but Russia exists. The \ntreaty was with the Soviet Union. During that same period of time, all \nthese other countries were developing the capabilities to threaten us. \nSo we now had a treaty with a country that used to be our enemy, and it \nno longer is, that was barring us from deploying and producing a \ndefensive system for our country. That did not make sense, and the\n\n[[Page S5998]]\n\nPresident had the gumption, the courage, and the wisdom to say we did \nnot need to be in this treaty any longer, that it did not serve our \ninterests. He worked with the Russians, and we had Members of this body \nabout to have a conniption fit that if we violated or took steps to get \nout of this treaty, as the treaty gave us the right to do, somehow this \nwould cause another cold war, an arms race with Russia, and do all \nkinds of damage to our relationship.\n  President Bush worked on this, and the Russians knew this was not \ncritical to their defense. We knew it was not critical to the Russian \ndefense. What was important about it was it was complicating our \nability to develop a missile system that made sense. Under that treaty, \nwe were trying to build a system that could have only one location for \nthe missiles. It has to cover the entire United States from that one \nsystem. The treaty explicitly prohibited mobile systems such as ship-\nbased; it kept us from developing a system that would take out missiles \nin the launch phase; it would have kept us from doing space-based \ndefense systems, all of which were prohibited by the treaty.\n  President Bush was serious about national missile defense, and he \ntook the steps to eliminate that. Indeed, Phil Coyle, who has been a \nbig critic of the national missile defense system, in a recent quote in \nthe newspaper said, with grudging admiration--I think he said, well, \nthey are serious about it. And that is correct. This President is \nserious about producing a layered defense system for America.\n  We are doing it for the $7.6 billion in this year's budget. If we do \nthis over a period of years, we are going to be able to successfully \nimplement a system that can protect us from limited missile attack. It \ncannot protect us from the kind of attack the Russians could have \nlaunched, but it can protect us against limited attack, accidental \nattack, or rogue nation attack. We have that capability, and we should \ndo it. We do not need President Bush sitting down eyeball to eyeball \nwith Saddam Hussein, knowing Saddam Hussein can push a button and a \nnuclear weapon or a chemical or biological weapon that he has can hit \nNew York City or some other American city. We do not need him in that \nposition. He does not need to be there, and we can avoid that.\n  Great nations do not allow themselves to be in a situation where the \nability to act in their national interest will be compromised by these \nkinds of threats by nations that have not shown themselves to have a \ncommitment to civilized behavior. That is simply where we are.\n  So I believe this country needs to deploy this national missile \ndefense system. I am sorry there are some who do not agree, and they \nhave been consistent in opposing it in every way possible. I have to \nrespect that, but we voted 97 to 3 to deploy it. Both Presidential \ncandidates said they wanted it. We funded it last year at $7.8 billion, \nafter a full floor debate, and we did not do it thinking that was going \nto be the only year we funded national missile defense. When we voted \nlast year to fund national missile defense, we contemplated and \nconsidered that we would be funding it on a steady basis to complete a \nprogram as the President envisioned. We have to start now. They say \nthese missiles are not able to reach us today. Well, it takes a number \nof years to develop, get the bugs out, and study this system so we have \nthe best system.\n\n  The President has been tough about this. He cancelled the Navy \ntheater-wide program that many people believed in, but it was behind \nschedule, over budget, and not performing, so he cancelled it. He said \nthat is not getting us to where we need to go. He has shown he is \nwilling to make tough calls, but the ultimate goal is to reach a \nsituation in which we can deploy a system by the time our enemies have \nthe capability of reaching us.\n  This Senate is at its best when we talk about important issues. I \nbelieve in many ways this one has been settled. The American people \nvoted for two candidates who favored it in the last election. The \nPresident has pushed it forward. We funded it last year at the \nPresident's request; we should not come in now to take a big whack out \nof it and target programs that really are pretty key. These cuts have \nthe unfortunate impact of undermining some of the work that would be \ndone.\n  For example, it eliminates 10 THAAD missiles. Those are the theater \nmissiles. When we have troops out on the battlefield in the theater of \noperations, if Saddam Hussein has a missile that will go 150 \nkilometers, then he can hit them if he cannot hit the United States. So \nwe cannot deploy our people and leave them vulnerable to being \nannihilated by an enemy attack if we have the capability to defend it, \nand we do. The THAAD is going to be a highly successful program, but \nthis bill, as it was voted out of committee over my objection, would \neliminate 10 THAAD missiles that would be used for future testing and \nit would put the success of the program in jeopardy by not allowing it \nto fly through failures.\n  In other words, these programs have to be tested, robust tested. Some \nof the critics are probably correct in saying we did not have enough \ntesting in the system. The President's budget will enhance testing.\n  The bill, as proposed on the floor today, delays or eliminates \nplanning for promising boost phase programs. In other words, one of the \nbest ways to knock down an incoming missile is when it is coming off \nthe ground in the foreign country. So if it falls back, it falls back \non their country. If it is missed, there still may be an ABM system in \nthe United States that can knock it down later. If those systems could \nbe knocked down through absolute communications capabilities in the \nregion, sea-based capabilities, that would be ideal. All of that was \nprohibited in the treaty. That is one of the reasons the President got \nrid of it.\n  This bill, as it is today, would eliminate planning for promising \nboost phase programs. It eliminates sea- and space-based kinetic kill \nexperiments in the field. It imposes serious risk to the airborne laser \nprogram by eliminating funding for a second aircraft testing program. \nIt will not allow the airborne laser program to fly through failure, to \nfigure out what will really work and make it successful. It imposes \nnumerous tests and evaluation restrictions and duplicative oversight \nrequirements on the Missile Defense Agency.\n  We have been very fortunate that General Kadish is head of this \nprogram. He is a man of ability, integrity, and steadfastness. He has \nnurtured it through good and ill. He has seen it hit successfully time \nand again in recent months, and he is leading it on through quite a \nsuccessful program. It has been well managed. He is very concerned \nabout these cuts. It will complicate his strategic vision of how to \nproduce and deploy this system as we have told him we want him to do.\n  It is important to know that we have a man in charge who is capable \nand knows how to get the job done, and he is very troubled that we are \ncutting back in this fashion.\n  In sum, I note these cuts will expose the United States to \nunnecessary risks if we enact them. I do not believe they will be \nenacted. I believe we will vote to restore the cuts. I know the bill \npassed in the House of Representatives has this funding in it, and they \nwill insist on it. I am not sure the President will accept the bill \nthat has these large cuts in our national missile defense.\n  It is time to move ahead. I believe we can deploy a system that is \nlayered in nature, that will have a shot at knocking down an attacking \nmissile in a boost phase, that can hit in midcourse and defend again \nwith a layer system on the land of the United States. Then we will not \nbe in the bizarre situation of several years ago when we were trying to \nmaneuver our national missile defense system to fit the ABM Treaty, to \nallow just one site to produce, that would limit testing and \ndevelopment in a lot of different areas.\n  We are on the right track. Let's stay the course. Let's not back up \nnow. Let's not manipulate this program and endanger it. This is a small \npart, $800 million out of a $386 billion budget. Let's not gimmick \naround with it. Let's get on with it. Let's stay committed. We will \nsave money in the long run and have a system that will protect the \npeople of the United States from rogue attack, from nations that are \ndesperately attempting to have an ICBM system such as Korea and Iraq.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller).

Mr. President, Saturday was a sad day for America and for \nall who have fought so hard for the rights of people with disabilities \nin our society. On Saturday, our Nation lost one of its great heroes: \nMy good friend, Justin Dart, Jr.\n  Justin Dart was the godfather of the disability rights movement. For \n30 years he fought to end prejudice against people with disabilities, \nto strengthen the disabilities right movement, to protect the rights of \npeople with disabilities. Millions of Americans with disabilities never \nknew his name but they owe him so much.\n  Justin was born August 28, 1930. His grandfather was the founder of \nthe Walgreen Drug store chain. His father was also a very successful \nbusinessman. Justin was the son of privilege and wealth, but he became \nthe brother of the forgotten and the downtrodden, those whom society \nleft on the roadside of life. From the time that polio left him a \nwheelchair user in 1948, to this past Saturday when he passed away, \nJustin lived a life dedicated to social justice for people with \ndisabilities and for all people regardless of race or gender or sexual \norientation. He is, of course, best known as the godfather of the \ndisabilities rights movement and the father of the Americans With \nDisabilities Act.\n\n  Justin was both a close personal friend of mine and a mentor for me \non disability policy. When I first came to the Senate--after having \nworked in the House on a couple of disability issues because I had a \nbrother who was disabled; I came to the Senate in 1985--at that time \nthere was a big movement on to pass a Civil Rights Act for Americans \nwith disabilities. I got caught up in that.\n  I wondered, is it possible we could ever pass a civil rights bill for \npeople with disabilities? Through a set of circumstances and fate, I \nbecame the chairman of the Disability Policy Subcommittee and then \nbecame the lead sponsor of the Americans With Disabilities Act. It was \nunder my sponsorship on that committee, and with the guiding hand of \nSenator Kennedy of Massachusetts, who was the chairman of the full \ncommittee, that we were able to get the bill through both the House and \nthe Senate, signed into law July 26, 1990, by President George Bush.\n  When I first got here and became involved with the disability rights \nmovement and with the jelling, the pulling together of all these people \nto get the Americans With Disabilities Act passed, it did not take me \nlong to realize it was Justin Dart who was pulling the pieces together. \nFor so many years, the disability community has been segregated and \nsegmented--the deaf community, the blind community, those who used \nwheelchairs, those with mental disabilities, those who had illnesses \nand diseases. Various forms of disability had their own segments but no \none brought them together under an umbrella. It was the power and the \nforce, the magnetism of Justin Dart that brought it together, that made \nit into a movement whereby we could actually get the Americans With \nDisabilities Act passed.\n  It was fitting that on July 26, 1990, we all gathered on the White \nHouse lawn for the biggest gathering for a bill signing on the White \nHouse lawn in the history of this country. It was a gorgeous, sunny \nday. We were all there. Senator Dole had been a great companion in \nhelping get the bill passed on the Senate side; so many people from the \nHouse side, including Tony Coelho, Steny Hoyer, but there on the \nplatform was President Bush and Justin Dart. It was right that he was \nthere on that platform.\n  When President Bush signed the Americans With Disabilities Act, he \ngave the first pen to Justin Dart. He truly was the one who brought us \ntogether and gave the inspiration and guidance to get this wonderful, \nmagnificent bill through.\n  The rest, as they say, is history. Go anywhere in America today and \nyou will see people with disabilities in workplaces, in schools, \ntraveling with their families to restaurants, going to theaters, going \nto sports arenas. All new buildings have wide doorways, ramps \neverywhere. No building being built today is not accessible--because of \nthe Americans With Disabilities Act, because of Justin Dart.\n  What a tremendous legacy. Justin was a recipient of five Presidential \nappointments, numerous honors, including the Hubert Humphrey Award of \nthe Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. In 1998, Justin Dart \nreceived a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian \naward. Before he passed away on Saturday, Justin left a letter. I don't \nknow exactly when it was written. But I think Justin knew that his time \non Earth was not going to be much longer. He had a series of setbacks. \nHe lost his leg just about 3 years ago. We thought we lost him then, \nbut, man, he came back strong and continued to lead. He wrote this \nletter, which is just so profound.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this last letter from Justin Dart \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Justin Dart, Jr.\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     I am with you. I love you. Lead on.\n       Dearly Beloved: Listen to the heart of this old soldier. As \n     with all of us the time comes when body and mind are battered \n     and weary. But I do not go quietly into the night. I do not \n     give up struggling to be a responsible contributor to the \n     sacred continuum of human life. I do not give up struggling \n     to overcome my weakness, to conform my life--and that part of \n     my life called death--to the great values of the human dream.\n       Death is not a tragedy. It is not an evil from which we \n     must escape. Death is as natural as birth. Like childbirth \n     death is often a time of fear and pain, but also of profound \n     beauty, of celebration of the mystery and majesty which is \n     life pushing its horizons toward oneness with the truth of \n     mother universe. The days of dying carry a special \n     responsibility. There is a great potential to communicate \n     values in a uniquely powerful way--the person who dies \n     demonstrating for civil rights.\n       Let my final actions thunder of love solidarity, protest--\n     of empowerment.\n       I adamantly protest the richest culture in the history of \n     the world, a culture which has the obvious potential to \n     create a golden age of science and democracy dedicated to \n     maximizing the quality of life of every person, but which \n     still squanders the majority of its human and physical \n     capital on modern versions of primitive symbols of power and \n     prestige.\n       I adamantly protest the richest culture in the history of \n     the world which still incarcerates millions of humans with \n     and without disabilities in barbaric institutions, backrooms \n     and worse, windowless cells of oppressive perceptions, for \n     the lack of the most elementary empowerment supports.\n       I call for solidarity among all who love justice all who \n     love life, to create a revolution that will empower every \n     single human being to govern his or her life, to govern the \n     society and to be fully productive of life quality for self \n     and for all.\n       I do so love all the patriots of this and every nation who \n     have fought and sacrificed to bring us to the threshold of \n     this beautiful human dream. I do so love America the \n     beautiful and our wild, creative beautiful people. I do so \n     love you, my beautiful colleagues in the disability and civil \n     rights movement.\n       My relationship with Yoshiko Dart includes, but also \n     transcends, love as the word is normally defined. She is my \n     wife, my partner, my mentor, my leader and my inspiration to \n     believe that the human dream can live. She is the greatest \n     human being I have ever known.\n       Yoshiko, beloved colleagues, I am the luckiest man in the \n     world to have been associated with you. Thanks to you, I die \n     free. Thanks to you, I die in the joy of struggle. Thanks to \n     you, I die in the beautiful belief that the revolution of \n     empowerment will go on. I love you so much. I'm with you \n     always. Lead on! Lead on!\n                                                       Justin Dart\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will not read the whole thing but I feel constrained to \nread parts. He said:\n\n     I am with you. I love you. Lead on.\n       Dearly Beloved: Listen to the heart of this old soldier. As \n     with all of us the time comes when body and mind are battered \n     and weary. But I do not go quietly into the night.

I do so love America the \n     beautiful and our wild, creative, beautiful people.

She is my \n     wife, my partner, my mentor, my leader and my inspiration to \n     believe that the human dream can live. She is the greatest \n     human being I have ever known.\n\n  Continuing to speak about his wife he said:\n\n       Yoshiko, beloved colleagues, I am the luckiest man in the \n     world to have been associated with you. Thanks to you, I die \n     free. Thanks to you, I die in the joy of struggle. Thanks to \n     you, I die in the beautiful belief that the revolution of \n     empowerment will go on. I love you so much. I am with you \n     always. Lead on. Lead on.\n  He was truly one of the most beautiful humans with whom I have ever \nbeen privileged to associate. We shared many memorable moments \ntogether. I was proud to be at his side when he received the Medal of \nFreedom from President Clinton. But I always remember best, and forever \nin my mind's eye will be embedded, him sitting there, next to President \nBush when President Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  Not many people know it, but Justin Dart, with that wheelchair and \nhis wonderful wife Yoshiko, visited every one of the 50 States in order \nto lay the groundwork for the passage of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. And Justin knew that our work did not end with the \nADA. He knew it was just the beginning. Even just a few short weeks ago \nhe attended a rally I was at for MiCASSA, the Medicaid Community-based \nAttendant Services and Supports Act, a bill that Senator Specter and I \nare cosponsoring.\n  I was surprised that Justin was there but very pleased to see him \nleading, as usual, even though I knew that his health had not been \ngood. He had to curtail many of his activities. But we had a couple of \nhundred people there from the disabled community and, I am telling you, \nhis voice was as strong and as powerful and as persuasive as I have \never heard, and that was just a couple of weeks ago. To the very end he \nhad that fire in his eyes and that strong voice.\n  In the final week before he passed away, Justin personally attended \nfour events to push for more civil rights for people with disabilities. \nHe never hesitated to emphasize the assistance he received from those \nworking with him--as you can tell from the letter I just read, most \nespecially his wife of more than 30 years, Yoshiko Saji. She was, as he \noften said, quite simply the most magnificent human being. As in life, \nYoshiko was at his side when Justin passed away this weekend. He is \nsurvived not only by Yoshiko and their extended family of foster \nchildren, many friends, colleagues and relatives, but also by millions \nof disability and human rights activists all over the world.\n  The average American may not ever have heard of Justin Dart. They may \ngo through their lives never having heard of him. But I will tell you \nthis, any person with a disability in this country who has struggled \nand fought, gone to school, moving ahead in life, they will know who \nJustin Dart was and they will know what he did for them and for our \ncountry to make our country more inclusive, to bring us altogether.\n  So I will personally miss Justin Dart: that strong voice, the cowboy \nhat and the cowboy boots, that piercing gaze of his that sort of \nstripped away all the phoniness of life. When he rolled up in that \nwheelchair and he got in front of a microphone and started to speak, it \nwas power, passion, commitment. It will not be the same in the struggle \nfor civil rights for people with disabilities. It will not be the same \nin our struggle for MiCASSA, which we have to pass.\n  People with disabilities are about the only ones left in our society \nwhere the Government decides what they are going to do with you rather \nthan what you do with the money. MiCASSA says that, basically the money \nshould follow the person--not the person following the money.\n\n  Quite frankly, it was a Georgia case in which the Supreme Court \ndecided that people with disabilities had to first be able to live in \nthe most open setting, in a community-based setting in their homes and \nin their communities rather than institutions. It was a great case in \nthe State of Georgia.\n  This legislation is proposing what Justin worked so hard for--\nbasically to say let the person decide, let that individual decide \nwhether they want to live in their home and not in a nursing home.\n  That is what this fight for MiCASSA is all about. I am sorry we \ndidn't get it passed before he passed away. But I can assure you that \nthe fight will continue. We will not rest until people with \ndisabilities have all the rights that people without disabilities have \nin our society.\n  Justin will be remembered as a person who removed all these barriers. \nWe will miss his passion, his sense of justice, his unwavering \nleadership, and, as I said, his strong and clear voice. Justin Dart \nwill continue to inspire us to carry on. His message will continue to \nspeak for the next generation of leaders. I always said to Justin: Hang \nin there.\n  We almost lost him a couple of years ago when his leg was removed. I \nsaid: Justin, you have to hang in there. He always said: There are more \nbehind me. And there are. A whole new generation of young people is \ncoming up under the Americans with Disabilities Act. They have been \nable to go to school, they have gotten an education, and they are \nmoving on. They are not going to let the clock be turned back.\n  I am convinced that sooner, rather than later, we will get the \nMiCASSA bill passed and permit people with disabilities to live in \ntheir own homes. We will do it in the name of Justin Dart. In his name, \nwe will remove the last remaining barriers.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory and the \nspirit of Justin W. Dart Jr., a tireless advocate for the rights of \ndisabled persons, who passed away on June 22 at his Washington home at \nthe age of 71.\n  I feel so privileged to have had the honor of knowing and working \nwith Justin. Many on Capitol Hill may remember him, in his cowboy hat, \noffering critical input as we worked to draft the Americans With \nDisabilities Act.\n  On July 26, 1990, Justin was at the side of President George Bush \nwhen the President signed the bill into law. Justin referred to that \nevent as ``a landmark date in the evolution of human culture,'' and we \nall have Justin to thank for his immeasurable gift to that evolution.\n  Justin was tireless in his travels, visiting all 50 States, not once \nbut at least four times, to promote the ADA legislation. He also \ntraveled around he world to advocate for full civil rights protection \nfor people with disabilities.\n  In 1998, he once again found himself at the side of a President, this \ntime Bill Clinton, who presented Justin with the Medal of Freedom, the \nNation's highest civilian honor.\n  It would be impossible in this short tribute to list the awards and \naccomplishments that marked his life, but it is fair to say that Justin \nDart, who used a wheelchair from the age of 18 after contracting polio, \nfound his calling in life. And we are all much richer for the \nexperience.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have been following the proceedings \nover the last day or so with increasing concern. As we said last week, \nwe all know that this legislation has to be completed this week. I had \nhoped, because of the agreement we were able to reach among leadership \nlast week, that we would table nonrelevant amendments, that we would be \nable to move expeditiously with amendments on those issues for which \nthere was an interest, and that we would accommodate these amendments \nin a way that would allow us to move the consideration of this bill \nalong successfully. I guess I was overly optimistic.\n  Frankly, I am very disappointed, in spite of that agreement, in spite \nof the efforts we have made to encourage Senators to come to the floor, \nand in spite of the fact that we know there is so much that still needs \nto be done, that we are at a procedural impasse.\n  I, frankly, know of no other recourse but to file cloture. That is \nthe only way we can be absolutely certain we will complete our work \nbefore the end of this week. I have indicated that lament to the \nRepublican leader.\n  I have noted with some concern to our managers that unless we do, I \nsee no really practical way we can complete our work and perhaps \naccommodate other issues and other needs legislatively before the end \nof this week and before the Fourth of July recess.\n  Frankly, I don't know what the impasse is now. I thought we had \nreached an agreement on one of the amendments. At the very last minute, \nit appeared that in spite of that agreement there was opposition on the \nother side. And that precluded the opportunity to move forward on at \nleast one of these issues.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion have been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on S. 2514, the \n     Defense authorization bill:\n         Harry Reid, Jon Corzine, Richard Durbin, Tom Harkin, Carl \n           Levin, Mary Landrieu, Tom Carper, Ben Nelson, Ron \n           Wyden, Daniel Akaka, Debbie Stabenow, Evan Bayh, Maria \n           Cantwell, Herb Kohl, John Edwards, Jeff Bingaman, \n           Joseph Lieberman.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will indicate to all colleagues that we \nwill not leave this week until this bill has been voted on and final \npassage. I hope that won't be the last piece of legislative work we do. \nI hope we will even be able to work on a couple of the nominations. \nThere are a number of issues on the Executive Calendar that could be \naddressed. But we can't do anything until we have completed our work \nhere.\n  Senators should be aware that there will be a cloture vote on \nThursday morning. That will then trigger a 30-hour period within which \nthis work must be completed so that we have a guarantee that at least \nbefore Friday afternoon the legislative time will have run out and we \nwill have an opportunity to vote on final passage. I regret that I have \nto do this, but I see no other recourse.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the role.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself time under leader time to \nrespond to the action just taken by Senator Daschle. Having been in his \nposition, I certainly understand why he is doing that. I think it is \nthe right thing to do in this case.\n  We clearly need to move this Defense authorization bill forward, as \nwe did the supplemental. We need to get an agreement on that and \nprovide additional funds for defense and homeland security.\n  We also need to get completion of the Defense authorization bill \nbefore we leave for the Fourth of July recess. How could we celebrate \nthe freedom of the country without having done our work on the Defense \nbill in view of all that we are dealing with at home and abroad?\n\n  So I think the majority leader was in his rights, and I would plan to \nsupport his cloture motion unless we can come up with some agreement \nthat would allow us to save time by vitiating that. But I pledge my \ncontinued support to try to get this bill done in an orderly fashion at \na reasonable hour, hopefully Thursday afternoon or early or late \nThursday evening.\n  I just want to be on record that I understand why he is doing it, and \nI think it is the right thing, all things considered, at this time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in light of this development, it is safe \nto announce there will be no more rollcall votes for the remainder of \nthe day.\n  I yield the floor. And if no none is seeking the floor, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will give a few remarks. If anyone \nneeds the floor, I will be glad to yield.\n  I think it is important for us to recognize, as we go forward with \nthis new national missile defense system, that we are moving into a new \nera.\n  We had the ABM Treaty in 1972 that was the cornerstone of a mutual \nassured destruction strategy between the United States and the Soviet \nUnion. We both agreed we would not launch missiles against one another \nand we would not, under the treaty, explicitly build an antimissile \ndefense system. Not one of us would, leaving each other vulnerable to \none another.\n  The treaty only has six or seven pages. It is in the appendix of this \nbook that I have in the Chamber. The reason I want to share it is \nbecause a lot of people wondered why, 6 months ago, President Bush \nchose to get out of the treaty. And that took effect just a few days \nago when the 6 months ran from the notice he gave in December.\n  This treaty really kept us from defending ourselves. In the first \narticle it says:\n\n       Each Party undertakes not to deploy ABM systems for a \n     defense of the territory of its country and not to provide a \n     base for such a defense, and not to deploy ABM systems for \n     defense of an individual region. . . .\n\n  We basically said we could not deploy one. It says that again in \nseveral places here.\n  Article V says--and this was the conflict we were having, the \nproblems we were having:\n       Each Party undertakes not to develop, test, or deploy ABM \n     systems or components which are sea-based, air-based, space-\n     based, or mobile land-based.\n\n  Much of our new scientific development in recent years indicates that \nsea-based, air-based, space-based has the capacity to help us protect \nour homeland from missile attack.\n  Earlier this afternoon I read some quotes from the vice admiral in \ncharge of the Defense Intelligence Agency in which he said China was \ndeveloping a mobile-based IBM system. China was not party to the \ntreaty; neither was Korea, neither was Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. \nThey were not a party to the treaty. All those countries are striving \nto develop a missile system.\n  China, according to the intelligence report, is, in fact, developing \na mobile land-based system. According to this treaty we had with the \nSoviet Union--a country that no longer exists--that treaty prohibited \nus from doing that or having a sea-based or an air-based system. This \nwas getting really out of\n\n[[Page S6002]]\n\ncontrol. In other words, we had a treaty in 1972 that made sense, when \nwe had no other nations, virtually, except the Soviet Union with a \nballistic missile system.\n  We are moving into an age where 16 countries have a missile system. \nSome of those are virulent rogue nations that desire us harm. We had \nthis treaty that kept us from preparing a defense to that.\n  Some people forgot, also, that under the treaty there were some \nexceptions. We chose one route and the Soviet Union chose another one, \nwhich was to build a national missile defense around Moscow. They, in \nfact, deployed a missile defense system, under their option, around \nMoscow. But we were prohibited from doing that.\n  President Bush took a lot of grief. You remember it. They said he was \nacting unilaterally. And the Socialist left in Europe went up in arms \nthat the United States should not get out of this treaty. Some in \nRussia said it was a mistake, and they objected. But the truth is, I \nthink they were just negotiating with us for a good deal.\n  President Bush was steadfast. He stayed the course. The National \nSecurity Adviser, Condoleezza Rice, was consistent; she never backed \noff. They made clear that at this point in history the mutual assured \ndestruction that existed between us and the Soviet Union was out of \ndate. We now hope to have in Russia a friend, not an enemy. It was an \nentirely different nation. What our threat was--and we learned on \nSeptember 11 just how real this was--was from rogue nations. And we \nought to be able to begin to prepare as to how to defend ourselves from \nthat.\n  In 1999, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld chaired a commission to study \nthe threat posed to the United States from ballistic missile attack. \nThat was a bipartisan commission. And they studied the issue intensely. \nThe commission unanimously voted that the United States was facing a \nthreat from missile attack by other nations. They unanimously agreed \nthat the threat was coming much quicker than had been predicted \nearlier, and that by the year 2005 we could be subject to missile \nattack from other nations.\n  So that is why the Nation decided, in 1999, to go forward. It was a \ndramatic vote in this Senate when we voted 97 to 3, with Senator Thad \nCochran, who spoke earlier this afternoon, being the prime proponent of \nthe legislation. But in addition to Senator Cochran, one of his prime \ncosponsors was Senator Lieberman, the Democratic Vice Presidential \ncandidate last year, and one of the leading senior members of the Armed \nServices Committee. They proposed the language that, in 1999, stated we \nwould deploy a national missile defense system as soon as \ntechnologically feasible.\n\n  We made that decision. We funded it. President Clinton proposed a \n$5.3 billion budget for national missile defense to carry out that \nobjective.\n  President Bush, during the campaign, said he believed we ought to be \nmoving more aggressively, that the threat was more real than some \nthought. He wanted to step up the pace, and he did do that. He proposed \nan increase when he became President of about $2.5 billion over the \n$5.3 billion, making it a $7.7 billion national missile defense budget. \nThat was passed by this body. We had a dispute in committee, and on a \nparty-line vote the increase was not backed in the committee. But when \nwe got to the floor, the full amount was affirmed on voting.\n  So this year the President asked for a little bit less. He asked for \na $7.6 billion or so expenditure for national missile defense. He did \nnot ask for an increase over last year but actually asked for a small \nreduction as compared to last year's expenditure. But, again, that was \none issue that we disputed in the Armed Services Committee, and on a \nstraight--unfortunately, I thought--party-line vote, $800 million was \ntaken out of the national missile defense fund.\n  It was taken out in a way that General Kadish, who has managed this \nprogram with integrity and skill and determination, said would damage \nthe program significantly.\n  I don't believe we ought to allow that to stand. I believe the full \nSenate needs to review it and replace that money. Let's do what the \nPresident asked. Let's give him the money he requested. Let's keep this \nplan to build a national missile defense that will include sea-based, \nmobile land-based, multiple land-based, and space-based, if \nappropriate, capabilities that will allow us to hit the incoming \nmissiles in their launch phase, midphase, and in the terminal phase, \nall of which we have the capability to do.\n  The tests that have been running have been successful. We have been \nable to have head-to-head collision, bullet-hitting-bullet, high-over-\nthe-ocean, smashing and destroying missiles. We are going to continue \nto test it under the most rigorous conditions. I believe this process \nwe are undergoing will be successful, and we will prove that we have \nthe capability to destroy incoming missiles even with decoys, even \nunder the most hostile conditions. That is what we ought to do.\n  The total price of it, the $7.6 billion the President asked, out of a \n$386 billion defense budget that we are putting up this year, is \nreasonable and appropriate. It represents not a step to cold war but a \nstep to a new, positive relationship, away from mutually assured \ndestruction, away from the hostility we had with the Soviet Union for \nso long, to a new open day in which we are actively engaged in the \nworld, but a day in which we don't have rogue nations being able to \nintimidate us, being able to intimidate the President, being able to \nthreaten our country with attack that would have to cause him to pause. \nIt would have to affect our defense policy, if that were to be the \ncase.\n  I believe this will move us away from it, give us freedom to act in \nour just national interest. I urge the Senate to move forward with \napproval of our President's budget and the Warner amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I know my friend from Nebraska, the \ndistinguished Senator, is here. I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel, be allowed to make a statement on the \nunderlying bill, that during that period of time there would be no \namendments offered to the bill; following the statement of the Senator \nfrom Nebraska, the Senate then proceed to a period of morning business \nfor the rest of the evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank my distinguished colleague and friend, the senior \nSenator from Nevada.\n  I rise today in support of the Warner amendment, an amendment that \nwill restore the $814 million cut from the President's request for \nmissile defense funding. Last December, President Bush made the \ndecision to withdraw the United States from the constraints of the \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, the ABM Treaty. That treaty went \nout of existence on June 13. The United States is no longer constrained \nby cold-war-era treaty requirements.\n  I supported President Bush's actions to withdraw the United States \nfrom the ABM Treaty, which I believe demonstrates his commitment to \nAmerica's defense. The ABM Treaty was an important treaty. It defined \nthe strategic policy of our Nation and defined the strategic nuclear \npolicy of an era because at that time in 1972, the ABM Treaty was \nsigned by two countries: the Soviet Union and the United States, the \nonly two countries that had the capacity to launch all out nuclear war.\n  The world has changed--the world is dynamic--since the ABM Treaty was \nsigned, and the policy of mutually assured destruction that formed the \ncornerstone of our nuclear deterrent policy is gone.\n  Now, as September 11 has made brutally clear, we face varied threats \nfrom terrorists, individuals, nations, organizations, and those that \nsupport them. These threats, these challenges come in many forms. \nCurrently, 12 nations have nuclear weapons programs; 28 nations have \nballistic missiles; 13 nations have biological weapons; and 16 nations \nhave chemical weapons.\n  These new realities mean we must place a greater emphasis on \ndefense--all forms of defense. Unfortunately, the defense authorization \nbill reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee takes a step \nbackwards with regard to missile defense.\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\n  The $814 million cut will have a profound effect on U.S. efforts to \ncontinue research and important development and eventually deploy an \neffective missile defense system.\n  In addition to the proposed cuts in research and testing, nearly 70 \npercent of the Missile Defense Agency's civilian jobs and related costs \ncould be eliminated if the current legislation we are debating is \nenacted. These cuts would severely hamper the Missile Defense Agency's \nability to conduct day-to-day business. That means tests. That means \nresearch. That means development. That means a better understanding of \nthe integration of these new defense capabilities into our overall \nnational security system.\n  This is very important. It isn't one test. It is not one program. It \nis not one system. It is an integration of all these strategic balances \nthat now become the dynamic of our national security system: Offensive \nweapons, now defensive capabilities to guard against not just ballistic \nmissiles but tactical missiles, nuclear, biological, weapons that can \nbe delivered and delivered anywhere in this country.\n  We seek a broad array of research, development, and testing \nactivities to yield a system as soon as feasible, not any system but a \nrelevant, realistic system that in fact has the capability to defend \nthis country and our allies. This is not one monolithic umbrella over \njust this country. Our deployed forces overseas, large groupings of our \ndeployed forces all over the globe, must be protected. Our friends and \nallies rely on the United States. This is a large, profound, critically \nimportant project. It cannot be accomplished, defined in a year or 2 \nyears. But in the interest of our country and its future security, it \nis quite clear that we need a national missile defense system.\n  The Armed Services Committee's actions in the bill they reported out \nof committee would hamper this objective. If the current Senate version \nof the missile defense budget were to stand, Secretary Rumsfeld would \nrecommend that the President veto this legislation.\n  It is important to note how missile defense interconnects with our \nbroader security and strategic policies. In February, I visited the \nU.S. Strategic Command in Bellevue, NB, the headquarters of our \nmilitary nuclear strategy.\n  At 1 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, Secretary Rumsfeld will announce \nthat Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska will become the new headquarters \nfor a merged SPACECOM and STRATCOM facility with new \nresponsibilities to face the new challenges and threats of our day.\n\n  Missile defense will be part of that new merged command and will \nbring Space Command and Strategic Command together. When I was at \nOffutt Air Force Base earlier this year, I was briefed on how defense \npolicy was moving beyond the cold war nuclear triad of missiles, \nbombers, and submarines.\n  One leg of the new triad would consist of our old nuclear capability, \nbut it would be supplemented with both conventional military \nsuperiority and an effective missile defense system--integrating the \nsystems. In forging this new triad, the United States could \nsignificantly reduce our nuclear arsenal, while at the same time \nprotecting our country, our troops abroad, and our allies from limited \nmissile threats and possible missile blackmail from rogue regimes, \nterrorists, and other nations.\n  Today's New York Times ran a story discussing a course that this \ntransformation could take. It described a possible new Unified \nCombatant Command that could ``combine the military network that warns \nof missile attacks with its force that can fire nuclear and nonnuclear \nweapons at suspected nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons sites \naround the world.''\n  We are in the process of making this new strategic framework a \nreality. It is our highest responsibility--the security of this Nation, \nthe security of our men and women around the world, whose only \nobjective is the security of this Nation. We have a responsibility to \nour allies. We must recognize that the threats facing our Nation are \nchanging, and we must restructure, reorganize, and adapt to these new \ndangerous threats.\n  Missile defense will play a significant role in protecting our \ncountry, our allies, and our deployed forces. I might say, isn't it \ninteresting that under President Putin, the Russians are working \nclosely with our defense establishment to work through these new \nmutually beneficial strategies and finding ways to cooperate in both of \nour interests.\n  The threats to the United States are not unique to the United States. \nThese threats are threats to Russia and to nations all over the world. \nA missile defense system for the United States and our allies is not \nmutually exclusive from the interests and benefits of Russia. With \nPresident Bush's recent trip to Russia, that was formalized in two very \nimportant documents that were signed by Presidents Bush and Putin.\n  So it is not a matter of a unilateral course of action for the United \nStates to pursue missile defense. It is in the interest across the \nglobe of all peoples who wish to make the world safer, more secure, \nmore prosperous, more peaceful. And why is that? It is as much about \ndefining opportunities and hope for the world as any one part of this \nequation or this debate. What we are facing in the Middle East, \nAfghanistan, Central Asia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and South Asia \ncannot be disconnected from this total development of policy that makes \nthe world safer and more secure and more stable for the benefit of all \npeople. These are factors that are not often pointed out in this debate \nabout missile defense.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to take a close look at Senator \nWarner's amendment to put this funding into this Defense authorization \nbill--maybe as important a Defense authorization bill as we have seen \nin this country in many years. I hope my colleagues will read through \nwhat the amendment does. It is very simple: putting the money back in.\n  I want my colleagues to take it the next few steps and ask themselves \nthe consequences for slowing down missile defense development in this \ncountry.\n  We, too often, get disconnected from the objective of the debate in \nCongress because we get snagged in the underbrush of the nuance, or the \namendment at the time, or the argument at the time, or the newspaper \nheadline tomorrow, or defending an amendment to an amendment; and we \nlose sight of the horizon, where do we go, why, and what is the point, \nand what is the bigger picture, the wider lens that is required? This \nis such an amendment. This is a wider lens amendment.\n\n  I hope Senator Warner, when he introduces his amendment, will get a \nvote on that amendment. I hope this Senate will come forward with the \nvotes to support Senator Warner's amendment because it is not just \nabout how much damage we would do to the security interests of this \ncountry; it is about more than just that strategic and military \ndynamic. It is about the future course of our foreign policy, the \nenhancement of our relationships, and the ability to help bring peace \nand stability and prosperity to the world. This is what we debate.\n  Defense is not just defense. Defense is about allowing a nation not \njust to defend itself but to prosper and reach out to help other \nnations and make the world safer. That is the big picture. That is what \nwe pray for--not the amendment.\n  So, again, I urge my colleagues to take some time to understand what \nthis is about and the consequences of their vote. I am a cosponsor of \nSenator Warner's amendment. I have believed for some time that it is a \nresponsible and relevant approach as part of our larger framework of \ninterests and, certainly, strategic defense policy for our future.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Warner \namendment, and I wish to take as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise, as I said, in opposition to the Warner \namendment. The Warner amendment calls for the elimination of about $814 \nmillion in the\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\nunderlying bill that has been directed to much-needed investments in \nthe Department of Defense to ward off the many threats that are facing \nour Nation today in a very responsible manner, I wish to add.\n  I thank Chairman Levin, the Senator from Michigan, for his \noutstanding work on pulling together this underlying bill. I \nparticularly thank our subcommittee chairman, Senator Jack Reed, who \nhas worked very hard on this particular provision. I acknowledge their \ngood work in this area.\n  I rise in opposition to this amendment as a supporter of missile \ndefense--not as one of its critics, not as a detractor for the missile \ndefense system.\n  The Warner amendment is unwise and unnecessary for two reasons, and I \nwish to comment about both reasons.\n  First, the thrust of the amendment rests on very shaky fiscal \nparameters. Senator Conrad has spoken very well and clearly on this \nsubject, but one of the problems--not substantive but technical \nproblems--with this amendment is that it basically taps into revenues \nthat do not exist. There is no ``real offset'' for this amendment. \nThere is a claim of an offset, but it is going to be very difficult, if \nnot impossible, to materialize that offset because of the thrust of \nthis amendment.\n\n  It says basically that this money is going to be found by \nanticipating fluctuations in the inflation rate, assuming that the \ninflation rate is going down when it is probably rising. Nonetheless, \nthis money is not a real offset. It is based on very shaky fiscal \nprinciples, and that is one of the reasons I do not think we should \nsupport this amendment.\n  The second reason, however, is a stronger argument, and it is more \nimportant, although the first argument is something to consider because \nif we do not consider it, then any Member of the Senate could offer any \namendment to add $100 million, $50 million, $400 million, $600 million \nand say we are going to find an offset because we think inflation is \ngoing to move one way or the other, and so we are going to guess that \nthe money may be available. It is a very bad precedent when we are \ntalking about this much money in a time of tightening budgets and \ngreater demands on the Federal budget, both domestic spending as well \nas military spending. I think it is a strong argument.\n  The stronger argument is that it is wholly unnecessary to restore \nthis amendment and claim that it in any way enhances or pushes forward \nand strengthens missile defense, because it does not. I would argue in \nsome ways it will weaken our overall Defense bill, which is why I \noppose it.\n  Why do I say that? In the underlying bill, without the Warner \namendment, we are spending 25 percent more for missile defense than we \ndid 2 years ago, up to $6.8 billion, up from $5.1 billion when \nPresident Clinton was in his last year in office. Let me repeat, in the \nunderlying bill, without the Warner amendment, there is a 25-percent \nincrease in the Missile Defense Program.\n  Democrats and Republicans on the committee, and Democrats in \nparticular on this amendment, have supported a robust development of \nmissile defense. We want to support the President in a strong Defense \nbill. We have met and exceeded the dollars he has asked for, but what \nwe are saying and what I am suggesting is that the committee work has \nrewarded success in this program of missile defense. It acknowledges \nthat it is important to develop a missile defense program for the \nUnited States, not undermining it, not cutting it, not trying to bury \nit, but to support it. That is what the underlying bill does: It \nrewards success, cutting out its redundancies and demanding the \nappropriate oversight that the American taxpayers deserve.\n  This, after all, is a $7 billion program--not million; $7 billion. I \nhave observed in my time in Congress--Madam President, perhaps you have \nobserved this, too--that sometimes we give more scrutiny to a $164 \nwelfare check or a $1,000 credit card charge or a $2,000 rebate that a \nsmall business might get from a subsidy, and we go over that with a \nfine-tooth comb to make sure that welfare mother, that small business \nowner, or that person just ``doesn't get away with murder'' with \nspending or mishandling $164 or the $2,000. Yet with a $7 billion \nprogram, we want to say: Let's not look at the details; this is what \nthe President asked for; let's just do it that way exactly; they \ncouldn't possibly be wrong even by a percentage point; they couldn't be \noff 1 penny. I think that is very hard, if not impossible, to accept as \nrealistic.\n  This bill looks carefully at the $7 billion program--and we did this \nin every program in the Defense bill--again, not undercutting it at \nall, matching the President's dollars, but shifting things around to \nmake sure we can have a very good missile defense program.\n  We could also address some immediate threats that everyone now in \nAmerica, if they did not know it before September 11, knows now, and we \nall know as each week unfolds more and more clearly the other immediate \nthreats, chemical, biological, nuclear threats, weapons of mass \ndestruction, potentially poised against our Nation.\n  The challenge is before our military to invest in their readiness, in \ntheir equipment, in their mobility, and in their restructuring. We know \nthat we are not fighting the cold war anymore and we will not fight the \ncold war ever again, but we will be fighting this asymmetrical threat \nand so we want to have a strong military budget, a robust military \nbudget, and allocate these funds accordingly.\n  The underlying bill did that. It took a very small percentage of the \noverall missile defense, and as Senator Reed has so eloquently pointed \nout and let me restate, we reward success in the underlying bill. The \nPatriot Advanced Capability-3 system has tested well against multiple \ntargets. That is part of the Missile Defense Program. It does not pass \nevery test.\n  Sometimes the critics of missile defense will point out, no, we \ncannot have it; this test failed. Well, in every success there are \nfailures. We will fail a time or two, but if we continue to invest, \ncontinue to be wise and spend our money well, watching our budgets \ncarefully but not undercutting this program, we can develop an \neffective missile defense system not only for ourselves but our allies \nand protect America in the future.\n  The Patriot Advanced Capability-3 system has not passed every test, \nbut its future to protect our allies and soldiers looks bright. \nAccordingly, the committee fully funds this part of the missile defense \nsystem, bringing it closer to deployment.\n  Another part of the missile defense is the research program that we \nare doing in conjunction with Israel and others, but primarily Israel, \nthe Arab program. It is a theater-wide missile defense system that we \nare developing. It has fared very well to date. Threats against Israel \nand U.S. forces in the Mideast certainly are real. Our committee \nincreased funding for this project, again rewarding success, \nidentifying what parts of the Missile Defense Program are successful \nand moving forward, using the money wisely and having success. We are \nsupporting that.\n  The subcommittee made some very smart recommendations. It looked at \nthe whole $7 billion and it found in one instance--this is only one \nexample--that the administration had asked for $371 million versus $202 \nmillion last year for systems engineering and integration. The request \nis more than the Pentagon can spend on system engineering. In \ncommittee, in a public hearing, DOD was unable to justify the request. \nStill, the committee added $29 million for a 13-percent increase to \nsystems engineering and design, giving the benefit of the doubt but \nthought that would be a good place to move some money into some other \nimportant things in defense, which is our job as Members of Congress.\n  I am proud we met the President's target on defense. I argued, let us \nnot give one dollar less. If we can, let us give more. Some people have \na different view, but I believe we need to support our defense in every \nway possible.\n  I think moving this money to fund other activities in the Defense \nbill is not only wise, it sharpens our Missile Defense Program and \nsharpens our overall Defense bill and our budget. There are numerous \nexamples like the one I gave about engineering and integration, which \nis what this committee did.\n\n  The Warner amendment is unwise in a fiscal way. It is irresponsible \nto claim revenues that do not exist, to hope\n\n[[Page S6005]]\n\nthey materialize, and then, if they do not, the budget situation is \nmade much worse.\n  But on a deeper level and a more important level, the amendment is \nunwarranted and unjustified because there is a robust budget for \nmissile defense in this Defense bill. We have shifted some of the \nmoney, and I will talk about why we have tried to shift the $814 \nmillion that we identified as unnecessary, redundant, or unjustified to \nother programs in the military because there are, in addition to the \nthreat from a missile that might come to this country from Iran or Iraq \nor North Korea or one of the other rogue nations, there are real and \nimmediate threats and, I would argue, more present threats.\n  Not that I do not believe missile defense is a threat. I do. Not \neveryone in Congress does, but I do believe it could be a threat and we \nneed to deploy a system that will be cost effective to the taxpayer as \nwell as technologically effective.\n  In moving the $814 million to sharpen our Missile Defense Program and \nto sharpen our overall budget, we invested $124 million into hardening \nnuclear facilities against terrorist attacks. We have many nuclear \nfacilities in this Nation. We have labs committed to the development \nand exploration of nuclear materials. DOE asked for it in the budget \nsubmission, but it was turned down.\n  We have all seen reports of threats against our nuclear facilities. \nWe know that whether one is in New York, in Louisiana, in Arkansas, or \nin some other place where nuclear facilities are present, the community \nis concerned, as they should be.\n  Is our Government doing everything it can to protect us, to harden \nthese facilities against attack? I think every Member of this Senate \nwould like to be able to say we have added over $120 million to our \nnuclear facilities to provide tougher perimeters and systems that will \nprotect from a terror attack.\n  We have heard testimony not just before my Emerging Threats \nSubcommittee but many of our subcommittees about the importance of \nthat. We took part of the savings that we identified and redirected it \nto shipbuilding. Shipbuilding is important to Louisiana. It is not just \nimportant to Mississippi because Ingall's Shipyard is there. It is not \njust important to Maine because of our colleagues, Senator Snowe and \nSenator Collins. Shipbuilding, ship procurement, and the sustaining and \nmaintenance of at least a 310-ship Navy is very important to our \nmilitary strategy. There has not been one committee that I have \nattended since I have been on the Armed Services Committee, whether we \nare talking about the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Caribbean, or other \nplaces in the world, that the admirals and the generals, the men and \nwomen in uniform, representing and protecting our Nation, have \ntestified to anything other than a 310-ship Navy as an absolute \nminimum.\n  There was a point in our history we had 900 ships. Now maybe we \ncannot afford 900 ships. Maybe we do not need 900 ships, but in this \nnew world of asymmetrical threats, where we cannot wait for the enemy \nto come to us; we need to go to them, there are only two ways basically \nto get there: either by water or by air. We have to have both. We \ncannot rely only on our Air Force capabilities. We have to have a \nstrong, robust Navy to fight on these battlefields wherever they might \nbe, to transport our troops, to do it effectively, to do it safely.\n  There is not a Member, I do not think, and particularly Senator \nWarner from Virginia, who comes from a huge Navy State, to argue that \nthis was a poor or not thought-through reallocation of this money. \nWithout it, we cannot build and continue to carry out our LPD-17s and \nother important shipbuilding and procurement that is underway right now \nwith the Navy.\n  Four thousand sorties have been flown from Navy ships in the Arabian \nGulf. Our surveillance airplanes, our fighters, and our bombers get a \nlot of attention, but many of those sorties begin by lifting off from \nour aircraft carriers and from places that are bringing this equipment \nand these platforms and giving them a place to take off, refuel and \ntake off again, to protect us from the threats of terrorism and other \nthreats around the world.\n\n  As we have seen in Afghanistan, we are in an age of war, fighting \nwhere we cannot forward-deploy our Armed Forces land-based near the \ntheater. We are blocked by unfriendly nations from being able to fly \nover or to land at bases. Our Navy provides those places of security, \nthose places for our armed men and women, our forces to regroup to get \nready and take off for battle.\n  At a time when the Navy is so vital to our war effort, the Navy could \nin this budget fall below 300 ships. This $690 million readjustment, or \nadditional investment, taken from a program, while important, is not in \nthe least bit delayed or undermined and will go a long way to \nstrengthen our Navy.\n  We add money for other counterterrorism priorities in this budget. We \nhave moved some money--a good bit of money, but a very small percentage \nof the overall funding--from missiles to other parts of the budget that \nare crying out to be addressed: Our shortage of ships in the Navy, our \nneed to secure our nuclear facilities, and there have been several \nother investments in counterterrorism.\n  That was a wise decision. I was proud to support it in the committee. \nI urge my colleagues to reject the Warner amendment and to support \nSenator Levin and Senator Reid in this effort.\n  I quote Gen. Henry Shelton, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, on his view of threats posed by military ballistic missiles and \nweapons of mass destruction. General Shelton is a very decorated leader \nof our armed services. His reputation is without question. He said \nwithin this last year there are other serious threats out there in \naddition to that posed by ballistic missiles. We know, for example, \nthere are adversaries with chemical and biological weapons that can \nattack the United States today. They can do it with a briefcase, by \ninfiltrating our territory across our shores or through our airports.\n  This underlying bill is attempting to address this real, broad, and \nasymmetrical effect. It can come from missiles, it can come from a \nbriefcase, it can come from a container through one of our ports, it \ncan come through a bomb planted in the back of a U-haul pickup truck, \nagainst any number of targets. This city, Washington, DC, our Capital, \nis rich with targets, but so are all the cities, including the home \nState of Washington of the Presiding Officer and my State of Louisiana.\n  The taxpayers want us to make sure we are not just spending a lot of \nmoney on defense but we are spending it wisely, in the right places, \nand we are not overspending in one area and leaving ourselves \nvulnerable in another. Protecting our nuclear powerplants and \nsupporting missile defense we can do. Investing in counterterrorism and \nsupporting missile defense we can do. Building a strong Navy and \nsupporting missile defense we can do. But we have to be smart about it \nand not just with some political slogan that looks good at election \ntime. I am afraid that is what this is all about.\n  Let's have a strong Defense bill, a smart Defense bill, a bill that \nmatches the President more than dollar for dollar but makes good and \nwise choices about how we are spending those dollars.\n  As a supporter of missile defense, I argue strongly against the \nWarner amendment and urge my colleagues to support what the committee \ndid. This will be a very important vote, along with some other tough \nvotes we will have to take regarding transportation and setting good \npriorities in our Defense bill.\n\n  As the article on the secrecy shield in the Washington Post suggests, \nif we are going to spend $7 billion--and I support building the \nprogram--let's do it in the right way and make sure there is full \npublic disclosure. There could be some aspects we do not want on the \nfront page of every newspaper, but give the taxpayers the best missile \ndefense system. Spend their money wisely. By putting up a secrecy \nshield, which is what this article based on a recent report that has \ncome out is claiming, I believe as we move forward with our missile \ndefense system, it needs to be done with full disclosure, without \njeopardizing those features that might have to be kept in a classified \nposition, so the taxpayers can be sure we are spending their money \nwisely.\n\n[[Page S6006]]\n\n  In the words of General Shelton, there are many threats facing our \nNation. The bill we are debating today is about preparing ourselves for \nall of those threats, allocating our resources wisely by making very \ngood decisions. Lives depend on it. The strength of this Nation depends \non it. Our future and the future of our allies depend on the decisions \nwe make in the next few days on this very important bill. This is one \nof those decisions.\n  Let's say we are going to shift money, strengthen missile defense, \nsharpen it, but also strengthen our other defenses so we can protect \nthe people. They sent us here to do no less.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, less than 2 weeks ago America marked the \nhistoric demise of the ABM Treaty. We did so in accordance with the \ntreaty's terms, and with the consent of Russia, acknowledging that the \nstrategic rivalry that dominated our relationship for three decades is \na thing of the past, in word and in deed. I find it remarkable that \nremoval of the legal and diplomatic constraints formerly placed on the \ndevelopment of America's missile defenses has been replaced by \npolitical constraints imposed by members of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  As my colleagues know, the committee bill slashed the President's \nbudget request for missile defense programs by $812 million. I \nappreciate that missile defense was a controversial issue when it was \nviewed by some as a threat to United States-Russia relations. These \ncritics argued that the strategic stability we enjoyed from the cold \nwar-era ``balance of terror'' would be put at grave risk by President \nBush's support for missile defense development unconstrained by treaty \nlimitations.\n  These critics were wrong. I did not then agree with them, but I \nunderstood their position. Today, however, we live in a post-ABM Treaty \nworld, forged with the cooperation and explicit consent of the Russian \nGovernment.\n  No longer does this arms control agreement regulate our development \nof anti-missile systems. No longer does America's diplomatic \nrelationship with Russia require us to pay allegiance to an arms \ncontrol relic of an adversarial past. The President has consistently \nstated that the development of effective missile defenses is a priority \nof his administration, and a requirement in an age of proliferation. \nMost Americans support the construction of missile defenses, especially \nif it is done in a way that doesn't violate our treaty commitments. \nRather than alienate our friends overseas, America's missile defense \ndevelopment, some of which will be coordinated with the Russians and \nour allies, will one day help protect allies in Europe and Asia from \nmissile assault. If properly managed, our international alliances will \nbe strengthened, not weakened, by these systems. I believe they will \nenhance, not undermine, strategic stability.\n  It is troubling that the committee bill would deny the administration \nthe resources and flexibility to aggressively pursue a range of missile \ndefense programs, at a time when diplomatic and treaty constraints on \nthat development no longer restrict our freedom of action. One \nmotivation of missile defense critics is their belief that effective \nmissile defenses are no more than a Reagan-era fantasy, a political \nproject that disregards daunting technological obstacles to \nachievement. But by slashing nearly a billion dollars from missile \ndefense development in the coming fiscal year alone, critics create a \nself-fulfilling prophecy. By definition, their denial of requested \nresources makes it nearly impossible for the administration to meet its \nobjective to deploy missile defenses as soon as possible. I would \nremind my colleagues that only 3 years ago, 97 United States Senators \nvoted to deploy ``as soon as technologically possible an effective \nNational Missile Defense System capable of defending the territory of \nthe United States against limited ballistic missile attack.''\n  Expert studies show that political and funding constraints have in \nfact impeded progress on developing and deploying missile defenses. Of \nthe many missile defense programs, one of the most cost-effective and, \nif properly executed, most readily deployable would be a sea-based \nprogram using the Navy's existing Aegis fleet air defense assets. If \naccorded the proper priority and resources, populated areas along \nAmerica's coasts, forward-deployed U.S. forces, and U.S. allies could \nbegin to come under a limited missile defense umbrella before the end \nof the President's first term. Indeed, had the advice of many defense \nexperts been followed since 1995, when a blue-ribbon commission first \ncalled for withdrawal from the ABM Treaty and pursuit of Aegis-evolved \nmissile defenses, such protection would likely have been put into place \nbefore now.\n  We are a nation at war. The administration is seriously contemplating \na military campaign against Iraq, a nation armed with short-range \nballistic missiles that took their toll on American troops and Israeli \ncivilians during the Persian Gulf war. Saddam Hussein is also known to \nbe pursuing more sophisticated missile systems. In any military \ncampaign, our forces and our allies would be at risk from Iraqi \nwarheads containing biological or chemical agents. Iran is pursuing an \nICBM program and could test it within 3 years, according to our \nintelligence community's consensus estimate. Iran is also aggressively \npursuing a nuclear capability. Our intelligence community assesses that \nNorth Korea today possesses the capability to hit the United States \nwith a nuclear weapon-sized payload. Many experts believe the North \nKoreans already possess enough weapons-grade plutonium for several \nnuclear weapons.\n  America faces the risk of strategic blackmail from nations such as \nthese whose possession of sophisticated missile technology puts them in \na position to restrict our flexibility to deploy military forces where \nand when they are needed. Much of the missile defense debate has \nfocused on defense of the U.S. homeland, and this is important. But \ndevelopment of effective missile defenses is critical not only to \nprotect America, but to preserve our military options overseas, by \nallowing us to meet threats to our interests around the world. \nEffective missile defenses will allow American forces the flexibility \nto operate in regions where the presence of a dangerous regime armed \nwith ballistic missiles would otherwise unacceptably constrain American \nmilitary operations.\n  America's defenselessness to missile attack, and the vulnerability of \nour overseas forces and our allies to rogue regimes with advanced \nmissile capabilities, are the Achilles' heel of American foreign \npolicy. Preserving our ability to deploy military forces across the \nglobe requires us to protect against threats of missile attack that, \nleft unmet, could one day cause us to acquiesce to acts of aggression \noverseas in order not to expose ourselves to attack. Missile defenses \nwill reduce the possibility of strategic blackmail by rogue regimes.\n  The threats are real. The diplomatic foundation has been laid. The \npotential of missile defense technology is clear. The implications of \nrendering America defenseless as a strategic choice are morally \ntroubling. The case for missile defense is compelling. The threat of \nterrorism is grave, but the rise of this clear and present danger does \nnot diminish the menace that rogue regimes that cavort with terror and \naggressively pursue weapons of mass destruction pose to America. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Warner amendment to restore the \nPresident's requested funding for missile defense programs.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I rise in strong support \nof the amendment offered by my friend and colleague, Senator Warner, to \nrestore funding for missile defense.\n  The cuts made during markup, while amounting to ``only'' 10 to 11 \npercent of the overall missile defense budget, are targeted to \ndecapitate the program and destine it to failure. President Bush will \nlikely veto the Defense authorization bill if we do not restore funding \nto missile defense.\n  I have long been a strong proponent of missile defense. We must take \nthe appropriate steps to protect our homeland against all threats. An \neffective missile defense is a key element in homeland security. There \nare those who discount the threat. However, a recent national \nintelligence estimate (NIE) warned that a rogue nation, other than \nChina or Russia, will be capable of a ballistic missile attack against \nthe United Stats before 2015.\n  I believe we will face the threat in the near term, well before 2015. \nThe threat is real, and it is now, not in the\n\n[[Page S6007]]\n\ndistant future. If this body turns a blind eye to this ominous threat, \nHistory will condemn us for our lack of action, and question why we sat \nidle while the threat grew. It is important to note that the public \noverwhelmingly supports missile defense. However, the vast majority of \nAmericans do not realize that our Nation currently can do nothing to \nstop a ballistic missile attack against the United States. In fact, a \nmajority of Americans expressed surprise, disbelief, and anger, when \ntold that the United States has no defense against ballistic missiles.\n  We need to get serious about developing and fielding a missile \ndefense system. We can't wait for another September 11-like event to \nspur us into action. Complacency is our enemy. For the sake of our \nchildren and our grandchildren, I hope that reason will prevail and \nthat we will vote to pass this amendment.\n  I commend President Bush for withdrawing from the ABM Treaty. The ABM \nTreaty was a cold war relic that deserved to be discarded. I also \napplaud the Bush administration for its new approach toward missile \ndefense. Approaching missile defense as an integrated ``system of \nsystems,'' with layered defense in phases--boost, midcourse, and \nterminal--is the right thing to do. Unfortunately, the cuts during \nmarkup targeted the critically important systems engineering and \ncommand and control elements of missile defense.\n  In effect, the cuts removed the ``system of systems'' architecture \nthat is important to the new approach to missile defense. The national \nintelligence estimate was clear. North Korea, Iraq, Iran, and others \nactively seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction and longer \nrange ballistic missiles. China already has ICBMs capable of hitting \nthe United States and has threatened to use them if the United States \ninterceded in a conflict with Taiwan. Effective missile defense is one \nof the most complex technical problems to face our Nation, and one that \nrequires innovative solutions.\n  I applaud the new approach for the development and rapid fielding of \nmissile defense. It is the right approach given the unique challenges \nof the program and the looming threat. There has been much unwarranted \nconfusion over the non-traditional approach to defining requirements \nfor missile defense, and the review and oversight process. Some allege \nthat the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has been given cart blanche to \nspend taxpayer money on outlandish technologies with no oversight.\n  These allegations are totally unfounded, and are largely intended by \nideological opponents of missile defense to alarm and confuse the \npublic. Developing a missile defense system is, as Pete Aldridge, the \nDeputy Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics \nsaid, like operating in ``uncharted waters.''\n  In order to define the requirements for the system in the face of \nmaturing technologies and the unpredictable future threat, the Missile \nDefense Agency will use an evolutionary or ``spiral'' development \napproach. In most complex programs like missile defense, it is \nextremely difficult in the early stages of development to define in \nsufficient detail what the fielded system will look like, how it will \nperform, and what its functional characteristics will be. These items \nare normally described in operational requirements documents, or ORDs. \nHowever, far too often, the services, with the best of intentions, \nwrite the operational requirements documents (ORDs) too early in \ndevelopment with their ``best guess'' on what the parameters should be, \nand then spend huge amounts of money trying to drive programs to meet \nthose requirements.\n  In missile defense, these final requirements at this point are \nimpossible to determine. Using ``spiral'' development. In other words, \ndeveloping the system in increments and fielding capabilities as soon \nas they are ready will allow the Department of Defense to field an \neffective missile defense as rapidly as possible. Some argue that this \nprogram will not receive the proper amount of oversight both within the \nDepartment of Defense and from the Congress. The truth is that this \nprogram will have more oversight than any other program in the DOD, and \nI am confident that the Armed Services Committee will continue its \ndiligent oversight role as well.\n  I would like to say a few words about the level of DOD oversight on \nmissile defense so the record is clear. A group of senior Defense \nofficials, including Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, Pete Aldridge, \nand the service Secretaries will act as a ``board of directors'' for \nmissile defense and will review the missile defense program on a \nperiodic basis. In fact, this group has already reviewed the program \nmultiple times in the last few months and will continue to do so in the \nfuture. Keep in mind that the average DOD acquisition program does not \nhave this level of oversight.\n  In addition, a second oversight group, the Missile Defense Support \nGroup, also has been created to review missile defense. This group \nresembles the Defense Acquisition Board, which on traditional \nacquisition programs only reviews the program at key milestones. \nHowever, the Missile Defense Support Group will review the program on a \nquarterly basis. Furthermore, the oversight panel is supported by a \nstaff that will conduct day-to-day oversight to ensure that the program \nremains on track. Of course, the Congress will continue its oversight \nrole as before. Nothing has changed in that regard.\n  The concerns about a lack of oversight are unfounded. I would like to \nconclude by once again applauding the Bush administration for revamping \nthe Missile Defense Program into one that has the highest probability \nfor success. Let's get on with the task. Our Nation's security and the \nsafety of millions of Americans depend on us.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Warner for his leadership on this \nissue, and would encourage all my colleagues to vote for this \namendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to briefly comment on my \nvote against Senator Kennedy's amendment to the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  This amendment would have resulted in a fundamental change in the way \nthe Department of Defense is structured. It mandated a new policy for \nevery new, modified, or renewed contract for all noninherently \ngovernmental services within the Department of Defense. The \nconsequences of such a change at this point in time would not, in my \nestimation, serve the best interests of my State or of this Nation.\n  Small businesses are an integral part of Montana's economy. Small \nbusinesses meet the diverse, everyday needs of Montana's citizens; many \nMontana small businesses also successfully compete for federal \ncontracts. The provisions of this amendment would have priced many \nsmall businesses out of Federal contract competitions. In light of \nMontana's struggling economy, I could not vote for an amendment that \nwould have increased small business costs while creating an \ninsurmountable hurdle that need not exist.\n  I am also keenly aware of the human capital crunch that the Federal \nGovernment currently faces. The Department of Defense faces particular \nchallenges as they seek to maintain readiness while adjusting to post-\ncold war and post-September 11 realities. This amendment would have \nresulted in increased personnel costs for the Department of Defense, \nbut, more importantly, it would have delayed contract awards and \nadversely affected mission effectiveness. This is not in the best \ninterest of our nation's security or economic needs.\n  I am a strong supporter of labor standards in both the private and \npublic sectors. Upholding labor standards for all Montanans is a top \npriority for me. I also firmly believe that the Federal Government \nneeds to secure the best services, whether public or private, for the \ntaxpayer dollars it expends. In examining this amendment, I felt that \nit did not uphold these standards. Instead, the amendment held the \npotential to harm Montana's small business viability and exacerbate the \npublic-sector federal human capital shortage.\n\n\n                    MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam. President, I rise today to discuss medical \nresearch aimed at preserving blood products, human organs, and other \nwound-repairing tissues. As the chairman may recall, last year I \ndiscussed with Chairman Levin the fact that this research could \ndramatically impact our ability\n\n[[Page S6008]]\n\nto overcome current medical challenges involved in blood and tissue \npreservation.\n  Recent U.S. military actions have resulted in stationing troops in \nharsh climates and conditions, such as those experience in Afghanistan. \nCurrent locations and missions require new capabilities in combat \ncasualty care, and these capabilities would include stable blood \nproducts, organs, and wound repairing tissues that will enhance human \nsurvivability under conditions of trauma, shock, anoxia, and other \nextreme conditions, including extreme environment. The Department of \nDefense needs to develop tissues with a long shelf life to support \ncombat casualty care. Research in this area could develop stress-\ntolerant biosystems or tissues that selectively control critical \nmetabolic processes by exploiting an enhanced understanding of \ndifferential gene expression in bio-organisms and systems exposed to \nextreme environments.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator from Maine is quite correct in her \nobservation and assessment that medical treatment, and specifically \ncombat casualty care, particularly in a time of war, should not be \noverlooked. Further, the Department of Defense must consider all \ninitiatives that could provide our military physicians and medical \nstaff the tools necessary to save the lives of men and women whose \nservice to our Nation puts them at risk of severe injury.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am hopeful that as our bill moves through floor \nconsideration and conference with the House, we can work to ensure that \nthis type of research is adequately funded within the Department of \nDefense.\n  There are many aspects to consider in taking care of our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen and marines who are sent into harm's way. In times like \nthese, preserving the well-being of our men and men in uniform should \nbe given the investment necessary to see that research like this gets \nto the field.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the distinguished Senator from Maine for \nhighlighting the critical nature of this research. I recognize her \ninterest in this particular area and that this research clearly has \npotential for saving lives, both military and civilian. I look forward \nto working with her on this issue as the Fiscal Year 2003 National \nDefense Authorization bill moves forward.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the distinguished chairman for her commitment to \nsupport investments in the well-being of a most precious national \nasset--our men and women in uniform. And I look forward to working with \nher on this important issue. The support of the chairman of the \nEmerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee will be critical, and \nwelcomed, to see that leading edge medical research is not only \nexplored, but deployed in the days ahead.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/25/senate-section/article/S6008-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

VIRGINIA\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, last week the Supreme Court ruled, in a \ncase called Atkins v. Virginia, that the execution of mentally retarded \npersons violates the eighth amendment's prohibition of cruel and \nunusual punishment. The Court thereby reversed its 1989 holding in \nPenry v. Lynaugh, which it decided at a time when only two States with \ndeath penalty laws forbade the execution of the mentally retarded. In \nAtkins, the Court noted that in the 13 years following Penry, 16 \nadditional States have enacted laws banning such executions. In \naddition, 12 States do not have the death penalty at all, meaning that \na total of 30 States do not permit the execution of the mentally \nretarded. Therefore, the Court concluded that a ``national consensus'' \nhas emerged against the execution of the mentally retarded. Because the \nCourt interprets the eighth amendment in accordance with ``evolving \nstandards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,'' \nthe Court concluded that the emergence of this national consensus \nrendered such executions unconstitutional.\n  I applaud the Supreme Court's decision. And I do so not from the \nperspective of one who opposes the death penalty in all its \napplications. Rather, I am a supporter of the death penalty. I believe \nthat, when used appropriately, it is an effective crime-fighting tool \nand a deterrent. Indeed, I am the author of two major Federal crime \nlaws that extended the availability of the death penalty. I authored \nthe Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, which extended the death penalty to \ndrug kingpins. And I authored the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994, which extended the death penalty to roughly 60 \ncrimes, including--just to name a few--terrorist homicides, murder of \nFederal law enforcement officers, large-scale drug trafficking, and \nsexual abuse resulting in death.\n  But I believe that when we apply this ultimate sanction--which is, of \ncourse, irrevocable--we must do so consistent with the values that we \nstand for as a nation and as a civilized people. We must be as \nreasonable, as fair, and as judicious as we possibly can be. And we \nmust ensure that we reserve the death penalty only for monstrous people \nwho have committed monstrous acts. In short, we must apply the death \npenalty in a way that is worthy of us as Americans.\n  That is why I have led the fight to make sure that the Federal death \npenalty--which I strongly support--does not apply to the mentally \nretarded. Just as we would not execute a 12-year-old who commits a \ncrime, even though that 12-year-old knows the difference between right \nand wrong, so we should not execute a mentally retarded person. To be \nmentally retarded is to be deprived of the ability to comport oneself \nin a normal way, not because of anything that one did, but because of \nan accident of birth. We all know families into which children are born \nwho do not have a high enough intelligence quotient to justly and \nfairly measure their actions against every other person in society. I \ncannot imagine strapping in a chair someone with an I.Q. of less than \n70, with the mental capacity of a 12-year-old--at most--and telling him \nthat he must die for his crimes.\n  Let me be clear: I do not believe that a mentally retarded criminal \nis blameless. Far from it. A mentally retarded person, like a child, \nmay well know the difference between right and wrong, and may be able \nto control his actions. Therefore, I must be clear about one further \npoint. This is not about choosing between executing mentally retarded \ncriminals or letting them roam the streets. That is a false choice. \nUnder the Federal laws that I have authored, as well as under State \nstatutes, we provide for every possible penalty short of death for the \nmentally retarded, including life imprisonment without possibility of \nparole.\n  That was true last week, and it remains true today. The Supreme Court \ndecision does not alter that fact one bit. It remains within our \nability--and it remains our duty--to ensure that dangerous mentally \nretarded criminals are kept far away from law-abiding citizens. We have \na host of penalties available to us to ensure that we are able to do \nso. And we have been doing so effectively. Since the 1989 Penry \ndecision, only five States have resorted to executing mentally retarded \npersons. The remaining States, as well as the Federal Government, have \neffectively confined and deterred mentally retarded criminals by means \nof incarceration.\n  Some people have argued that we must allow executions of the mentally \nretarded because it is often extremely difficult to define and \ndetermine mental retardation. I disagree. That has not been the \nexperience of the States in recent years. More importantly, whether \nsomething is difficult to do has no bearing on whether it is the right \nthing to do. Sparing the lives of mentally retarded criminals is \nmanifestly the right thing to do, regardless of whether it is difficult \non the margins. We ask judges and juries to make\n\n[[Page S6009]]\n\ndifficult decisions every day of the year, because a system of justice \nbased upon avoiding difficult decisions would provide no justice at \nall.\n  In 1990, I led the fight against an amendment that would have changed \nthe Federal death penalty statute to permit the execution of the \nmentally retarded. During the floor debate, I implored my colleagues, \n``Let us show that our support for the death penalty is bonded by \nhumanity.'' I asked my colleagues to remember that to be mentally \nretarded is to be denied the ability to develop the full human \nfaculties that the rest of us take for granted. ``We do not execute \nchildren,'' I noted. ``Let us not execute people who never get beyond \nthat stage in their life through absolutely no fault of their own.''\n  I am proud that a majority of this body agreed with me and rejected \nthe amendment. And I am proud that by our action, we, in our own small \nway, helped galvanize our brothers and sisters in State legislatures to \nsuch an extent that, 12 years later, the Supreme Court can state that a \nnational consensus has emerged against executing the mentally retarded. \nAs a supporter of the death penalty, I know that this ultimate sanction \nis justifiable only if it is administered in a way that comports with \nAmerican values.

The perpetrators \n``apparently assumed he was of Arab descent'' police said. The two men \nwere charged with aggravated battery and a hate crime in the attack.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/25/senate-section/article/S6009-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n AWARD OF THE DISTINGUISHED FLYING CROSS TO FORMER SENATOR WILLIAM D. \n                                HATHAWAY\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise to salute a soldier, public \nservant, and son of Maine who Monday afternoon was honored for his \nheroic service 58 years ago today. This recognition is all the more \nspecial for me, for our Nation also honors a colleague, former Senator \nWilliam D. Hathaway of Maine.\n  On Monday, the United States Air Force recognized a distinguished \nWorld War II veteran for his heroic service 58 years ago. As a young \nairman serving with the Fifteenth Air Force high over the Ploesti oil \nfields in Romania, Second Lieutenant Bill Hathaway and his crew mates \nshowed their courage, and in the process helped turn the tide of the \nBattle of Ploesti toward the Allied cause.\n  As Major General N.F. Twining, Commanding General of the Fifteenth \nAir Force, wrote in a letter to Lieutenant Hathaway after the battle, \n``Your return marked the culmination of an outstanding campaign in the \nannals of American military history. The German war machine's \ndisintegration on all fronts is being caused, to a large extent, by \ntheir lack of oil oil that you took away from them.''\n  On the morning of June 24, 1944, while stationed near San Pancrazio, \nItaly, Lieutenant Hathaway and other members of the 514th Flying \nSquadron were deployed to Romania, where a battle for control of the \nPloesti oil fields was raging with the Germans. Early that morning, \nLieutenant Hathaway's squadron took off from their air station, located \nnear the heel of Italy's boot, and crossed the Adriatic toward \nBucharest, and the nearby oil fields. Future Senator Bill Hathaway was \nsituated as a navigator as his B-17 aircraft droned toward its target.\n  By 10:00 a.m., the squadron had arrived over Ploesti, but they \nencountered heavy enemy fire from the time they crossed the Rhine River \nnearby. As many as 200 German fighters challenged the American flyers, \nwho encountered heavy flak. Upon arriving over the oil fields, though, \nthe American mission was thwarted by a heavy German smoke screen that \nshielded the oil fields and other targets on the ground from sight.\n  Undaunted, Lieutenant Hathaway and the crew plotted another \nalternative, as the squadron's commanding officer ordered the crew to \nturn around, circle back, and try the bombing run again. Dodging nearby \nanti-aircraft fire and enemy fighters, the team proceeded over the oil \nfields again, and this time they found their target. The 514th dropped \nits bombs on target and headed away from Ploesti.\n  But as with so many battles, the 514th's celebration was fleeting. \nSoon after dropping its bombs, Lieutenant Hathaway's aircraft was hit \nby flak from the dogfight over the oilfields. One of the B-17's engines \nwas disabled, and three crew were injured: Lieutenant Hathaway was hit \nin the shoulder, nose gunner George Deputy in the head; and bombardier \nRichard McDowell in the leg. Demonstrating the tenacity and courage \nthat has characterized Bill Hathaway throughout his career, Lieutenant \nHathaway gave his pilot a course to Turkey, and, while medics dressed \nthe wounds of the other two airmen, he assumed Deputy's position in the \nnose turret, and fired at the German fighters that continued to buzz \nhis aircraft.\n  Despite his valiant effort, the plane was crippled and continued to \nlose altitude. After German fighters took out a second engine, the \npilot gave the order to bail out. Lieutenant Hathaway, and other \nmembers of the crew, donned their parachutes and jumped. Two crew, \ncopilot David Kistler and waist gunner Ben Matthews, were killed when \ntheir parachutes failed to open. Lieutenant Hathaway and two others \nwere taken prisoner upon landing, later being reunited with the \nremainder of the B-17 crew. Ultimately, these American heroes were \nimprisoned in Bucharest by German forces, where they remained until \nRomania was liberated by Russian allied soldiers in August, 1944.\n  For his extraordinary heroism and bravery, the Air Force this week \nhonored Senator Hathaway, and fellow crew members Herman Hucke and \nRichard McDowell, with the Distinguished Flying Cross. The ceremony at \nthe Officer's Club at Bolling Air Force Base Monday afternoon provided \nyet another distinguished recognition for Senator Bill Hathaway, who \nrepresented Maine for 13 years in Congress. Since leaving Congress, he \nhas remained active and engaged in public service, including time as a \ncommissioner and chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission.\n  In reviewing the courageous actions of Lieutenant Hathaway and his \ncrew today, I am reminded of the words of President John F. Kennedy, \nwho said, ``In the long history of the world, only a few generations \nhave been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum \ndanger.'' Well, how fortunate we are that those few generations were \nblessed with men like Bill Hathaway, Herman Hucke, Richard McDowell, \nand other members of the crew, seemingly ordinary Americans from small \ntowns and big cities all across our Nation who performed extraordinary \ndeeds in service to their country.\n  So I am proud to join with the Air Force, the President, and the \npeople of Maine and a grateful Nation in honoring Senator Hathaway, and \nhis fellow crew, for their outstanding service. This recognition is \nwell-deserved and, certainly, long overdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/25/senate-section/article/S6009-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6009-S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE ANNOUNCEMENT OF GOVERNOR JESSE VENTURA NOT TO SEEK A SECOND TERM IN \n                                 OFFICE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about one of most colorful, \nto put\n\n[[Page S6010]]\n\nit mildly, elected officials in contemporary American politics. \nRecently, Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura announced he would not seek \na second term in the Land of 10,000 Lakes. Governor Ventura took an \nunusual career path to arrive at his current position. After high \nschool, Jesse Ventura volunteered for one of our Nation's toughest \nmilitary assignments, the SEALs. He served 4 years in the Navy before \neventually taking center stage in the wrestling ring and then as mayor \nof Brooklyn Park, MN for five years. Jesse continued his unconventional \nways by challenging the political system and, against all odds, winning \nhis gubernatorial race in 1998 against two well-established opponents. \nNow, he is exiting the political arena. As I look back, there were many \ncomments made by the Governor that I disagreed with, as I did with some \nof his public policies. But Jesse Ventura's run 4 years ago was about \nmore than who would run the State of Minnesota. As my hero, Theodore \nRoosevelt, said nearly a century ago, ``It is not the critic who \ncounts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or \nwhere the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs \nto the man who is actually in the arena.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/25/senate-section/article/S6010-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            DEFEAT THE HEAT\n\n Mr. FRIST. Madam President, as a Member of the U.S. Senate and \nas a physician, I would like to take the opportunity to alert my \ncolleagues to the Defeat the Heat campaign for America's children.\n  Defeat the Heat is a new public safety campaign created by the \nNational SAFE KIDS Campaign, the National Athletic Trainers' \nAssociation (NATA) and Gatorade. The campaign's purpose is to educate \nparents and kids about the dangers and the prevention of dehydration \nand heat illness. The goal is to teach parents to think of fluids as \nessential equipment for playing sports, just as they would regard a \nhelmet or shin guards to be protective gear.\n  A survey commissioned by the National SAFE KIDS Campaign reveals that \nmore than three in four parents of active 8-14 year olds do not know \nhow much fluid their kids need to replace what is lost through \nperspiration, and many do not know how to prevent dehydration. A child \ncan lose up to a quart of sweat during a 2-hour sports game.\n  There are several physiological factors that make children more \nvulnerable to heat-related illness than adults. Children absorb more \nheat from the environment because they have a greater surface-area to \nbody-mass ration than adults--the smaller the child, the faster the \nheat is absorbed. Also, children are not able to dissipate as much heat \nas adults through perspiration. They produce more metabolic heat during \nphysical activity and do not have the same physiological urge to drink \nenough fluids to replenish sweat losses during prolonged exercise.\n  How can we help America's children defeat the heat? Drinking enough \nof the right fluids is the best defense against heat illness because \ndehydration is one of the first steps to more serious heat-related \nconditions like heat stroke and heat exhaustion. Children should be \nsure to drink before, during, and after activity and never wait until \nthey feel thirsty to drink. If children feel thirsty, their body is \nalready dehydrated.\n  It is with great pleasure that I join my fellow Tennessean, Coach Pat \nSummitt, six-time national champion NCAA Women's Basketball coach at \nthe University of Tennessee, the National SAFE KIDS Campaign, the \nNational Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA), Gatorade, and others in \nthis admirable and worthwhile cause to educate parents about these \nhealth risks. As a physician, it is my hope that parents become active \nin this program to help their children defeat the heat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/25/senate-section/article/S6010-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL JOHN K. ELLSWORTH\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nexceptional officer in the United States Air Force Reserve, an \nindividual that a great many of us have come to know personally over \nthe past few years, Colonel John K. Ellsworth. Colonel Ellsworth, who \nserves as Deputy Chief of the Air Force Senate Liaison Office, and was \nrecently promoted to Colonel, will be leaving his position to attend \nthe prestigious Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, PA. During his \nassignment here on Capitol Hill, Colonel Ellsworth personified the Air \nForce core values of integrity, service, and excellence in the many \nmissions the Air Force performs in support of our national security. \nMany Members and staff enjoyed the opportunity to work with him on a \nvariety of Air Force issues and traveled with him on a multitude of \nfact-finding trips around the world. To a person, they all recognize \nand deeply appreciate his character, dedication to duty, and \nprofessionalism. Today it is my privilege to recognize some of Colonel \nEllsworth's many accomplishments, and to commend the superb service he \nprovided the Air Force, the Congress, and our Nation.\n  Colonel Ellsworth entered the Air Force through the Reserve Officers' \nTraining Corps program at the Citadel, SC. He served in various \noperational support and staff assignments including duty as a \nmaintenance officer for many of the Air Force's aircraft. Throughout \nhis distinguished career, Colonel Ellsworth's exceptional leadership \nskills were always evident to both superiors and subordinates as he \nrepeatedly proved himself in numerous select leadership and command \npositions.\n  During his current assignment of working with the Congress, Colonel \nEllsworth provided a clear and credible voice for the Air Force while \nrepresenting its many programs on Capitol Hill, consistently providing \naccurate, concise and timely information. His integrity, \nprofessionalism and expertise enabled him to develop and maintain an \nexceptional rapport between the Air Force and the Congress. The key to \nhis success, I believe, was his deep understanding of Congressional \nprocesses and priorities, and his unflinching advocacy of programs \nessential to the Air Force and to our Nation.\n  I am very pleased that Colonel Ellsworth is about to begin the next \nphase of his career as a senior officer in our Air Force. I offer my \nsincere congratulations and best wishes to his as he heads for his next \nassignment where he will further his knowledge of national security \nstrategy with other warriors of our armed forces.\n  On behalf of the Congress and our great Nation, I thank Colonel \nEllsworth and his entire family for the commitment and sacrifice they \nhave made throughout his career. I know I speak for all of my \ncolleagues in expressing my heartfelt appreciation to Colonel Ellsworth \nfor a job well done. He is certainly a credit to the Air Force and the \nUnited States. We wish our friend the best of luck in his new \nassignment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/25/senate-section/article/S6010-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/25/senate-section/article/S6010-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/25/senate-section/article/S6010-5", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6010-S6011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON BOSNIA AND U.S. FORCES IN NATO-LED STABILIZATION FORCE (SFOR) \n           FOR THE PERIOD MARCH 2001 TO DECEMBER 2001--PM 98\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by the Levin Amendment to the 1998 Supplemental \nAppropriations and Rescissions Act (section 7(b) of Public Law 105-174) \nand section 1203(a) of the Strom Thurmond National Defense \nAuthorization Act for\n\n[[Page S6011]]\n\nFY 1999 (Public Law 105-261), I am providing a report prepared by my \nAdministration on progress made toward achieving benchmarks for a \nsustainable peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  This sixth report, which also includes supplemental reporting as \nrequired by section 1203(a) of Public Law 105-261, provides an updated \nassessment of progress on the benchmarks covering the period March 2001 \nto December 2001.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to improve access to health care medically \nunderserved areas; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I join Senator Brownback in \nintroducing important legislation aimed at ensuring that a piece of the \npuzzle regarding adequate physician services in underserved communities \nis preserved.\n  By all accounts, the Conrad State 20 J-1 Visa Waiver program has been \na great success at bringing crucially-needed doctors to medically-\nunderserved areas. It has served as a wonderful resource for my State \nand for other States across our Nation. The bill we are introducing \ntoday eliminates the program's sunset date, thereby making sure that \nthis much-needed program remains available.\n  I created the Conrad State 20 program in 1994 to deal with the \nreality that many areas of the country, especially rural communities, \nhave a very difficult time recruiting American doctors. These health \nfacilities have had no other choice but to turn to foreign medical \ngraduates to fill their needs. J-1 visa waivers allow foreign \nphysicians to practice in medically-underserved communities after their \nJ-1 status has expired without first returning to their home countries. \nThese waivers allow foreign physicians to receive nonimmigrant, H-1B \nstatus, temporary worker in specialty occupation, for 3 years. In order \nto receive the waiver, the physician must agree to serve the medically-\nunderserved community for the full three years. If he or she fails to \nfulfill that commitment, the physician is subject to immediate \ndeportation.\n  Prior to the creation of my State 20 program, J-1 visa waiver \nexclusively involved finding an ``interested Federal agency'' to \ncoordinate the request. This was found to be a long, cumbersome, and \nbureaucratic process. By allowing States to directly participate in the \nprocess of obtaining waivers, my program relieves some of the burdens \non participating Federal agencies and allows decisions regarding a \nState's health care needs to be made at the State level by the people \nwho know best.\n  I have shepherded the Conrad State 20 program from its creation in \n1994 through a subsequent reauthorization and other improvements over \nthe years. By now removing the program's sunset date, the bill that \nSenator Brownback and I are introducing today will ensure that this \nimportant program remains a part of a State's tool belt in dealing with \nphysician-shortages in medically-underserved areas.\n  Our bill also provides for a modest increase from 20 allowable Conrad \nState 20 visa waivers per State per year to 30. For some time, a number \nof States have been bumping up against the State 20 ceiling, and my \nhope is that this increase will help additional medically underserved \ncommunities throughout the country procure the physician services they \nneed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Warner, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. \n        Allen):\n  S. 2675. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to establish a pilot program to make grants to eligible \ninstitutions to develop, demonstrate or disseminate information on \npractices, methods, or techniques relating to environmental education \nand training in the Chesapeake Bay watershed; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nestablish an environmental education program for elementary and \nsecondary school students and teachers within the Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed. This measure would provide grant assistance to elementary \nand secondary schools, school districts and not-for-profit \nenvironmental education organizations in the six-state watershed to \nsupport teacher training, curriculum development, classroom education \nand meaningful Bay or stream outdoor experiences. It would also enable \nthe U.S. Department of Education to become an active partner in the \nChesapeake Bay Program. Joining me as co-sponsors of this legislation \nare my colleagues Senators Mikulski, Warner, and Allen.\n  There is a growing consensus that a major commitment to education, to \npromoting an ethic of responsible stewardship and citizenship among the \nnearly 16 million people who live in the watershed, is necessary if all \nof the other efforts to ``Save the Bay'' are to succeed. The ultimate \nresponsibility for the protection and restoration of Chesapeake Bay is \ndependent upon the individual and collective actions of this and future \ngenerations. As population growth and development continue to place \nenormous pressures on the Chesapeake Bay region's natural resource \nbase, we must learn how to minimize the impacts that we are having on \nthe Bay. Our future depends upon our ability to use the Bay's resources \nin a sustainable manner. This is as much a civic responsibility as \nvoting. Developing an environmentally literate citizenry that has the \nskills and knowledge to make well-informed choices and to exercise the \nrights and responsibilities as members of a community is clearly one of \nthe best ways to raise generations who can be contributors to a healthy \nand enduring watershed. In my judgment, this can best be accomplished \nby expanding assistance for environmental education and training \nprograms in the K-12 levels.\n  In addition to stewardship, there are other dimensions to expanding \nenvironmental education opportunities in the Chesapeake Bay region that \nare equally compelling. A number of recent studies have found that \nenvironmental education also enhances student achievement, critical \nthinking and basic life skills. A 1998 report by the State Education \nand Environment Roundtable, perhaps the most comprehensive study to \ndate, documents how 40 schools in 12 States, including three schools in \nMaryland and four schools in Pennsylvania, achieved remarkable \nacademic, attitudinal and behavioral results by using the environment \nas an integrating strategy for learning across all subject areas. \nAccording to the study, students performed better in science, social \nstudies, math and reading. Classroom discipline problems declined and \nstudents demonstrated increased engagement and enthusiasm in learning \nin an environment-based context. Moreover, students' creative thinking, \ndecision-making and interpersonal skills were enhanced by environment-\nbased learning.\n\n[[Page S6016]]\n\n  The report is replete with success stories, but I will just cite two \nexamples from schools in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. According to the \nreport, students in the 4th grade at Hollywood Elementary School in \nMaryland scored 27 percent higher on the Maryland State Performance and \nAssessment Program test than at other schools in their county and 43 \npercent higher than the State as a whole after the school implemented \nthe environmental based education program. The study also found \nbehavior improvements and reduced discipline problems for 6th graders \nparticipating in the STREAMS program at Huntingdon Area Middle School \nin Pennsylvania compared to students not involved in the program. I ask \nunanimous consent that excerpts from this study regarding these two \nschools be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the State Education and Environment Rountable]\n\n Closing the Achievement Gap--Using the Environment as an Integrating \n                          Context for Learning\n\n              (By Gerald A. Lieberman and Linda L. Hoody)\n\n\n               HOLLYWOOD ELEMENTARY: A LIVING LABORATORY\n\n       Adults in Saint Mary's County, Maryland, a wedge of \n     farmland bordering the Chesapeake Bay, had tried for 25 years \n     to start a community recycling program; for some reason the \n     idea just never caught on. But once the fifth graders at \n     Hollywood Elementary School decided to solve the problem it \n     did not take long for them to turn their campus into a \n     neighborhood recycling center.\n       It was the children's enthusiasm more than anything that \n     motivated parents and neighbors to join their efforts. Soon, \n     Hollywood's hallways bulged with giant boxes of old \n     newspapers and the school's parking lot became a regular \n     Saturday-morning stop for residents eager to dump their cans \n     and glass. Teachers helped, but students ran the show. \n     Parents offered their vans, trucks, and even horse trailers \n     to help haul the goods to the nearest recycling station in \n     the next county. Eventually Saint Mary's County itself caught \n     on, set up a few recycling transfer stations of its own and \n     hired a recycling coordinator. But it all started at \n     Hollywood.\n       ``It was just as grass-roots as anything can get,'' \n     remembers Betty Brady, the teacher who initiated the project. \n     ``We were a very small school at the time, less than 300 \n     students, and we became a little place where people \n     rallied.''\n       Hollywood Elementary is not such a little place anymore. \n     Enrollment is up to 600 now, housed in a spacious new \n     facility designed to accommodate the real-world teaching that \n     Brady and her colleagues practice. But the campus remains a \n     rallying point for parents, educators, and other area \n     residents dedicated to the task of maximizing individual \n     learning through integrated, environment-based education.\n       During the past 15 years, aided by community volunteers and \n     funded through a series of small grants from the Chesapeake \n     Bay Trust, Hollywood's students have turned their 72-acre \n     campus into a living lab--blazing a nature trail, creating a \n     butterfly garden, planting a forest habitat for migrating \n     birds, and transforming a drainage pond into a natural \n     wetland. Each project capitalized on the children's innate \n     attraction to the natural world while providing unique \n     opportunities to combine traditional subject areas in a \n     meaningful whole. The results? At Hollywood Elementary, \n     education works.\n       ``As teachers, we always look at what works with and for \n     children, paying attention to what causes that learner \n     engagement that's so crucial to learning that lasts,'' \n     explained principal, Kathleen Glaser. ``We're very \n     concerned about not just teaching something so that \n     students can pass a test and then forget it a month later, \n     but teaching something that will be part of their \n     knowledge base, something they can work from to solve \n     problems and enhance their lives.''\n       Glaser and her staff, as well as the parents and students \n     of Hollywood Elementary, clearly believe the school's real-\n     world emphasis produces that kind of learning. And recent \n     empirical evidence confirms it. Since 1992, the state of \n     Maryland has required a year-end performance assessment for \n     all students in grades three, five, and eight. It is a \n     demanding yardstick, build around a child's ability to \n     perform integrated tasks, such as life-science experiments \n     and writing research reports. But it is a perfect tool to \n     measure the effects of integrated education on real-world \n     problem-solving.\n       Following five years of steady progress, Hollywood's \n     students turned in a bellwether performance in 1997. In \n     contrast to a statewide average of 38 percent, 67 percent of \n     Hollywood's third grades achieved satisfactory assessment \n     scores. At the fifth-grade level, Hollywood hit Maryland's \n     ideal 70th percentile, with 70 percent of students performing \n     in the satisfactory zone, as contrasted to 46 percent \n     statewide.\n       Glaser attributes her school's stellar performance in large \n     part to her staff of hardworking and innovative teachers, \n     including Betty Brady and Julie Tracy.\n       Tracy found Glaser's supportive leadership style reason \n     enough to choose Hollywood over another job offer when she \n     finished her master's certification program in 1990. ``I \n     think it was probably the teachers and Mrs. Glaser's \n     encouragement and her openness to suggestions,'' she said. \n     ``The other school was not as open to innovative ideas.''\n       For instance, while partnering with a class in Costa Rica \n     during a Smithsonian-sponsored study on migratory birds, \n     Tracy's students learned that loss of habitat was causing a \n     decrease in the birds' population. Their solution? Creating a \n     habitat on the school grounds. Teaming up with other classes, \n     they identified likely planting areas, including a stand of \n     recently planted trees that still lacked native underbrush, \n     and filled in the area with berry shrubs chosen from the \n     birds' regular menu.\n       Tracy believes allowing that sort of student initiative is \n     crucial to the learning. ``If you approach a project saying, \n     `we're going to go out and plant a tree,' then it's the \n     teacher's project,'' she said. ``But if the students are \n     engaged in real scientific inquiry, and they're the decision-\n     makers directing the project, then it's authentic, and \n     they're engaged in meaningful learning.''\n       With its integrated, environment-based curriculum now \n     expanding, and recognition of its effectiveness spreading. \n     Hollywood Elementary has become a living portrait of the \n     mature EIC school.\n       Looking back, Hollywood's recycling program, begun in the \n     late 1980s, constitutes an important benchmark in an \n     evolutionary process that started in 1982 when Glaser became \n     principal of the school. From her own experiences first as a \n     classroom teacher and later as a resource teacher, Glaser \n     brought a dual focus to her new position: to encourage \n     individual learning and support innovative teaching.\n       ``I think we communicated pretty early, after I became \n     principal, that what was most important was the individual \n     learner,'' Glaser said. ``I think it's also important for \n     teachers to grow professionally, so when they found a program \n     or a resource or a good working idea we began to try some of \n     those out.''\n       As Brady and her fellow teachers continued to brainstorm \n     and experiment, they made two discoveries. First, they found \n     that students learned most effectively when previously \n     disjointed subjects came together in an integrated \n     curriculum. Second, they realized that the environment \n     provided a perfect integrating context for learning.\n       Brady has a simple explanation for that: ``All things are \n     connected.'' Tracy agrees. ``All the subject areas are right \n     there,'' she said. ``You don't have to try to plug anything \n     in; it all just fits in naturally when you use the \n     environment.''\n       Add to that children's innate love of animals and curiosity \n     about nature, and Hollywood had found a sure-fire recipe for \n     effective education. ``We saw children really engaging with \n     the real world in a way they weren't engaging with the \n     textbooks,'' Glaser explained, ``and we saw the learning \n     really lasting.'' ``They see the big picture,'' Tracy added. \n     ``They see the goal.''\n       Encouraged by their early successes and Glaser's never-\n     wavering support, Hollywood's teachers began to design more \n     and more environment-based projects and to tighten the \n     teamwork so crucial to integrated learning. In some \n     instances, teachers paired up based on their differing \n     preferences: a nature nut, unfazed by bugs and dirt, and a \n     bookworm, more comfortable juggling papers and pencils.\n       ``We have such a spirit here of being a community of \n     learners and leaders that people welcome someone with a \n     different strength,'' Glaser commented. ``I'd like to think \n     that one of the things we do well is to blend the teaching \n     strengths we have available, then nuture not only the \n     students, but also support each other where we need it.''\n       Hollywood's distinctive approach to teaching caught the \n     national limelight in 1996, when Julie Tracy's idea that \n     second and third graders could turn a drainage pond into a \n     natural habitat earned her a 1996 presidential award for \n     excellence in teaching. In a project that combined biology, \n     botany, ecology, math, and language arts, Tracy's students \n     explored the types of aquatic plants and animals they could \n     expect to thrive in the little pond, then drafted a planting \n     plan, calculating depths and distances for optimal growth, \n     and recruited parents and local college students to help with \n     the work. Today, the former drainage basin is home to fish, \n     birds, amphibians, and even a raccoon or two.\n       Not surprisingly, with Hollywood's thriving EIC emphasis \n     drawing attention throughout Maryland and beyond, people are \n     beginning to take notice. Glaser has been fielding frequent \n     calls from other schools eager to duplicate Hollywood's \n     success. She is eager to respond. ``They want to know more \n     about the nature trail or the butterfly garden, how that sort \n     of thing gets organized,'' Glaser said. ``I'm getting more \n     interested in how to help other teachers integrate some of \n     these ideas. How can we help people benefit from our years of \n     experience?''\n       ``I'm seeing lots of indicators that this kind of work is \n     growing,'' Glaser said. ``Hopefully, we can be a place people \n     can visit or know about, so they can learn more about how to \n     do it.'' If American education is indeed headed toward a new \n     paradigm of integrated, environment-based instruction,\n\n[[Page S6017]]\n\n     Hollywood is already out front and eager to lead the way.\n\n\n          huntingdon area middle school: streams of knowledge\n\n       The students at Huntingdon Area Middle School are making \n     adults in their rural Pennsylvania community sit up and take \n     notice. Their active engagement in their community is an \n     outgrowth of an innovative, homegrown EIC program called \n     STREAMS--a regional grand-prize winner of the National Middle \n     School Association's Team-teaching Award.\n       STREAMS, which stands for Science Teams in Rural \n     Environments for Aquatic Management Studies, is an \n     interdisciplinary program that aims to increase students' \n     awareness of and concern for their immediate environment and \n     to engage them in the community at large. As its name \n     suggests, the program focuses on water and emphasizes active \n     learning and real-world issues.\n       Student enthusiasm for the program keeps building. Every \n     year, Huntingdon students clamor to begin projects earlier \n     and earlier. ``We used to start in January,'' said Fred \n     Wilson, social studies teacher. ``Then it was in November and \n     this year some kids were ready in September.'' The \n     accelerated schedule means more work for Wilson and his \n     colleagues. But there is a certain synergy created when \n     students are so eager, he said. And that is what gives him \n     the energy to keep up.\n       The genesis of the STREAMS program occurred eight years ago \n     when the sixth-grade teaching team, including Wilson, began \n     looking for a new theme to incorporate across their existing \n     interdisciplinary curriculum. They decided a program tied to \n     the water studies presented in Tim Julian's science class \n     would be ideal because they could tie it into all the \n     disciplines.\n       ``We wanted to examine problems in our community--such as \n     water quality, storm-water runoff and erosion--to make the \n     subject more meaningful to our students,'' Wilson explained. \n     It was a perfect choice. With four separate watersheds \n     converging within two miles of the school, he pointed out, \n     Huntingdon already had a phenomenal outdoor lab at its \n     doorstep.\n       Wilson volunteered to develop the interdisciplinary program \n     and contacted a number of organizations in his search for \n     suitable learning projects. But, while he discovered lots of \n     suggestions for activities, there was no program that could \n     be ``plugged in'' to Huntingdon's existing curriculum. By \n     1991, the first year Wilson and his teammates taught the \n     STREAMS unit, he had developed his own instructional segments \n     dealing with storm-water runoff, erosion and sedimentation, \n     water quality monitoring, household pollutants, and community \n     involvement. At the same time, Julian expanded the portion of \n     his science curriculum that dealt with water to include \n     the study of local watersheds as well as water and \n     wastewater treatment facilities.\n       Students response was overwhelming, so overwhelming that \n     the following summer Wilson and his colleagues developed more \n     STREAMS topics--wetlands, groundwater, acidity, and nutrient \n     enrichment--and added more water quality studies plus two \n     additional watersheds to monitor.\n       The team effort regularly crosses disciplinary lines, with \n     each teacher contributing his or her expertise toward common \n     projects. In science class, for instance, Julian teaches the \n     students about the properties of water, purification \n     processes, and wastewater treatment. Before they go out on a \n     field trip to conduct tests, they also learn how to use the \n     proper monitoring equipment. ``Our kids don't go out unless \n     they are prepped,'' Wilson said. ``That's so they can \n     succeed.''\n       Rose Taylor, Huntingdon's sixth-grade language arts \n     teacher, reinforces the vocabulary students need to know in \n     their studies and works with students on STREAMS-related \n     writing assignments. Math teacher Mike Simpson helps the \n     students learn to interpret statistics, construct charts and \n     graphs, and use computer database programs to report their \n     findings. He also incorporates the data they collect into \n     problems he uses to teach important math concepts such as \n     fractions and percentages. ``Rather than use cookbook \n     problems,'' he said, ``we use real field data.''\n       Wilson's part of the curriculum emphasizes the consequences \n     of land use--residential, agricultural, and mining--on the \n     water supply, as well as various types of pollution and the \n     function of wetlands. Wilson's students also learn about the \n     effects of storm-water runoff, a significant problem in the \n     Huntingdon vicinity because of over-development in what was \n     once a wetland.\n       Everything comes together out in the field, where all the \n     team members get their hands dirty. Their eagerness to dig \n     right in can be traced in large measure to their lengthy \n     history as a team. ``We've teamed together so long--15 \n     years--that we can be frank and open,'' Wilson explained. \n     Another secret of the STREAMS staff is a willingness to step \n     outside the bounds of their own disciplines. ``You have to be \n     willing,'' he said, ``to wear different hats.''\n       Indeed, STREAMS teachers seem entirely comfortable sharing \n     their teaching responsibilities all around. All the team \n     members, for example, teach reading. Tim Julian and Mike \n     Simpson capitalize on the interrelationships between science \n     and math; both, for instance, teach students to interpret \n     charts and graphs. ``Science uses a lot of math--\n     averaging, graphing, measuring speed,'' Julian pointed \n     out. ``Sometimes we work together; sometimes we handle it \n     separately.'' Julian also supports Rose Taylor's efforts \n     in language arts by having students write reports on their \n     field activities. ``I do correct their grammar,'' he said, \n     ``but I don't lower their science grade for mistakes.''\n       The teachers are equally flexible about class time. ``I \n     could go into school tomorrow and say that I need a block of \n     time,'' Wilson said, ``and we'd revamp the schedule in a \n     minute.'' STREAMS team members synchronize and evaluate their \n     lesson plans and schedules in regular weekly meetings, but \n     they can also meet daily during a common planning period.\n       Wilson conducts an annual formal assessment of what \n     students learned in the program. In the 1994/95 school year, \n     97 percent of STREAMS students failed a pre-test with an \n     average score of 38 percent. Two months after the program \n     concluded, the students' average score, on an unannounced \n     post-test, was 81 percent, with only a 2 percent failure \n     rate. In the 1996/97 school year, Wilson conducted the post-\n     test five months after they completed the initial STREAMS \n     unit. Even after that lengthy interval, the students' \n     averaged 71 percent on the test. Those results, Wilson point \n     out, indicate that most students not only mastered the \n     content, but also retained that knowledge months after \n     completing the program.\n       When Wilson and his colleagues started the STREAMS program, \n     no one dreamed how successful and far-reaching it would \n     become. Beyond the creativity and effort of the Huntingdon \n     team, Wilson said, another key reason for their success is \n     partnering with various organizations in the community.\n       Parents are another valuable resource. Without them, Wilson \n     said, he could not accommodate all the students who want to \n     do independent work, often after school and on weekends. They \n     help transport and chaperone students giving presentations to \n     public groups, civic organizations, teacher conferences, and \n     workshops, as well as those taking special field trips or \n     traveling to the biotechnology lab at Penn State. Parents \n     also help with tree-planting projects and water-quality \n     monitoring.\n       The students, too, have tapped into the partnering concept. \n     When they proposed creating a wetland near the school, for \n     example, they raised $1,000 and then found partners to \n     contribute the $3,000 needed to complete the project--proof \n     that they have learned to leverage their dollars and attract \n     broad-based support.\n       The community that spawned these savvy students and \n     teachers is by some standards an unlikely one. Huntingdon, a \n     town of 7,000, is located in south central Pennsylvania, an \n     area that historically has reported the highest unemployment \n     figures in the state. The average family income here is \n     $20,000 annually. Only 9.4 percent of adults in the county \n     have earned a post-secondary degree, compared to 18 percent \n     statewide.\n       Wilson also noted a dichotomy in the region's attitudes \n     toward education, with some residents very supportive and \n     others indifferent. Consequently, it has been exciting for \n     Huntingdon's teachers to watch a gradual shift in the \n     public's attitude toward the students' endeavors. ``At first, \n     they were taken rather lightly,'' Julian noted, ``but now the \n     community is coming and asking them for help.''\n       Without a doubt, Wilson observed, the Huntingdon teachers' \n     decision to use the environment as an umbrella for \n     interdisciplinary study and hands-on instructional strategies \n     has produced tremendous results. ``I think that our students \n     are engaged in a meaningful learning experience that will \n     help to empower them to be critical thinkers and become more \n     independent learners,'' he said.\n       As principal Jill Adams sees it, programs like STREAMS and \n     teachers like Wilson and his colleagues hold the key to \n     reshaping the entire educational process. ``The future of \n     education really depends on people like this,'' she said. \n     ``We cannot continue to teach the way that we were taught.''\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. In the Chesapeake Bay region, the Governors of \nMaryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania and the Mayor of the District of \nColumbia have recognized the importance of engaging students in the \nprotection of the Chesapeake Bay. The States have each enacted \nlegislation to integrate environmental standards into the curriculum \nfor particular grade levels. As signatories to the Chesapeake 2000 \nAgreement, they have also committed to ``provide a meaningful Bay or \nstream outdoor experience for every school student in the watershed \nbefore graduation from high school'' beginning with the class of 2005.\n  Likewise, several not-for-profit organizations including the \nChesapeake Bay Foundation, and the Living Classrooms Foundation have \nspearheaded efforts to create long-term, cohesive education programs \nfocused on the local environment. They have developed terrific \npartnerships with schools and are helping teachers develop and \nimplement quality instruction, investigations and Bay or stream-side \nprojects.\n  Unfortunately, all these efforts and programs are only reaching a \nvery small percentage of the more than 3.3 million K-12 students in the \nwatershed.\n\n[[Page S6018]]\n\nClassroom environmental instruction across grade levels is sporadic and \ninconsistent, at best, and relatively few students have had the \nopportunity to engage in meaningful outdoor experiences. Many of the \nschool systems in the Bay watershed are only at the beginning stages in \ndeveloping and implementing environmental education into their \ncurriculum, let alone exposing them to outdoor watershed experiences. \nWhat's lacking is not the desire or will, but the resources and \ntraining to undertake more comprehensive environmental education \nprograms.\n  In 1970, the Congress enacted the first Environmental Education act \nto authorize the then-U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare \nto establish programs to support environmental education at the \nelementary and secondary levels and in communities. In its statement of \nfindings and purposes, the Congress found ``that the deterioration of \nthe quality of the Nation's environment and of its ecological balance \nis in part due to poor understanding by citizens of the Nation's \nenvironment and of the need for ecological balance; that presently \nthere do not exist adequate resources for educating citizens in these \nareas, and that concerted efforts on educating citizens about \nenvironmental quality and ecological balance are therefore necessary.'' \nGrants for curriculum development, teacher training, and community \ndemonstration projects were made available for several years under this \nAct, but the program expired and was not reauthorized.\n  In 1990, the Congress enacted the National Environmental Education \nAct to renew the federal role in environmental education. The Congress, \nonce again found that ``current Federal efforts to inform and educate \nthe public concerning the natural and built environment and \nenvironmental problems are not adequate.'' Today, 32 years after the \nfirst Environmental Education Act was first authorized, those findings \nare still true. Last year, nationwide funding for the National \nEnvironmental Education Act administered by EPA was only $7.3 million. \nThat averages to a little more than $140,000 for each of the 50 States, \na sum that is totally inadequate for schools to incorporate \nenvironmental education as part of the K-12 curriculum.\n  The legislation which I am introducing would authorize $6 million a \nyear over the next three years in federal grant assistance to help \nclose the resource and training gap for students in the elementary and \nsecondary levels in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. It would require a 50 \npercent non-federal match, thus leveraging $12 million in assistance. \nThe funding could be used to help design, demonstrate or disseminate \nenvironmental curricula and field practices, train teachers or other \neducational personnel, and support on-the-ground activities or \nChesapeake Bay or stream outdoor educational experiences involving \nstudents and teachers, among other things. The program would complement \na similar initiative that I sponsored last year within the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration which is providing $1.2 million \nto support environmental education in the Chesapeake watershed.\n  The Chesapeake Bay Program has pioneered many of the Nation's most \ninnovative environmental protection and restoration initiatives. It has \nbeen a leader in establishing a large volunteer monitoring program; \nimplementing pollution control programs such as the ban on phosphate \ndetergents and voluntary nutrient reduction goals; and conducting an \nextensive habitat restoration program including the opening of hundreds \nof miles of prime spawning habitat to migratory fish. It is an ideal \nproving ground for demonstrating that strong and consistent support for \nenviornmetnal education, using the Chesapeake Bay and local environment \nas the primary instructional focus, will lead not only to a healthier, \nenduring watershed, but a more educated and informed citizenry, with a \ndeeper understanding and appreciation for the environment, their \ncommunity and their role in society as responsible citizens.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 2676. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \n10-year foreign tax credit carryforward and to apply the look-thru \nrules for purposes of the foreign tax credit limitation to dividends \nfrom foreign corporations not controlled by a domestic corporation; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senator Hatch and I are \nintroducing legislation to modernize and simplify the foreign tax \ncredit. The legislation contains two meritorious provisions that we \nhope Congress will enact this year, in that they are both long overdue.\n  The first provision addresses the problem of double taxation that \nresults when foreign tax credits expire unused under current law. To \nenhance the international competitiveness of U.S. companies operating \noverseas, and to help avoid this unfair double taxation, our \nlegislation simply extends the current 5-year foreign tax credit \ncarryforward period for five additional years to a 10-year \ncarryforward.\n  The second provision reforms current law, which unduly hinders U.S. \ncompanies in their efforts to penetrate foreign markets by imposing the \nso-called 10/50 foreign tax credit rule. Due to legal and political \nrealities, many U.S. companies are forced to operate through corporate \njoint ventures in partnership with local businesses. The 10/50 rule \nimposes a foreign tax credit limitation for each of these corporate \njoint ventures where a U.S. company owns at least 10 percent but not \nmore than a 50 percent interest in a foreign company, and thus \nincreases the cost of doing business for U.S. firms competing abroad.\n  10/50 reform would restore parity in the tax treatment of joint-\nventure income to other income earned overseas by U.S. companies by \napplying ``look-through'' treatment. Without this change, U.S.-based \ncompanies engaged in joint ventures overseas will continue to be \ndisadvantaged vis a vis foreign competitors. Congress attempted to \nrectify this problem in a large tax bill that was ultimately vetoed in \n1999. The Clinton Treasury also recommended enactment of this crucial \ntax change in its FY 2000 budget package and similarly, the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation endorsed this non-controversial provision in its \n2001 Simplification Study.\n  As indicated earlier, these two changes are long overdue and we urge \ntheir expeditious enactment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend and \ncolleague from New Jersey in introducing a bill to improve the tax \ntreatment of U.S.-based multinational companies.\n  It is apparent that our international tax code is deeply flawed. The \ncurrent wave of companies reincorporating in Bermuda, the foreign sales \ncorporation debacle, and the trend of tax-motivated foreign takeovers \nall provide abundant evidence that Congress needs to act to make our \ninternational tax rules friendlier to American-based companies.\n  The bill we are introducing today is one that I consider to be a \ndown-payment on the fundamental reform that our international tax \nsystem demands. The bill will reduce, but unfortunately will not \neliminate, the double taxation of international income that occurs far \ntoo often. This double taxation is just one of several serious problems \nwith our international tax rules.\n  The threat of double taxation, where an American corporation ends up \npaying corporate taxes to both the United States and to a foreign \ncountry on the same income, discourages U.S. firms from investing \noverseas. And since U.S. multinationals provide millions of America's \nbest-paying domestic jobs, anything that discourages overseas direct \ninvestment ends up hurting the take-home pay of our nation's workers.\n  Our bill has two provisions. The first would reform the carryforward \ntreatment of foreign tax credits. The Internal Revenue Code was \noriginally designed to make sure that U.S. corporations investing \noverseas are not subject to double taxation by a foreign nation and the \nU.S. on the same income. It does this through the availability of a \nforeign tax credit. If this system worked well, then American \nbusinesses would seldom or ever face this kind of double taxation.\n  However, the system most emphatically does not work well. For \nexample, American businesses are only allowed to use these foreign tax \ncredits when their U.S. operations are profitable. As a result, when \nthe U.S. side of the business is doing badly, firms are unable to \nimmediately use the foreign tax credits. While the current tax law \nallows\n\n[[Page S6019]]\n\nbusinesses to carry excess foreign tax credits forward for up to 5 \nyears, that timetable is unrealistic. An expanding business, with high \ndomestic expansion costs and low domestic profits, can easily go \nthrough 5 years of losses, and never get a chance to use those tax \ncredits. Once the 5-year period has expired, the credits are gone \nforever, and the result is double taxation, the threat of which \ndiscourages firms from taking on otherwise profitable overseas \ninvestment projects.\n  If we want American businesses to take the long view, a 5-year \ncarryforward just is not long enough. The legislation Senator \nTorricelli and I are introducing today will extend that horizon to 10 \nyears. If enacted, it would give U.S. firms a much better search \nthroughout the world for profitable investment projects. And again, \nprofits earned by U.S. companies throughout the world generally \ntranslates into more and better-paying jobs for Americans.\n  Our second proposal would eliminate our tax code's inhospitable \ntreatment of international joint ventures. In many developing countries \nwith rules and restrictions on foreign ownership, joint ventures are \nthe only way to get things done. Our current-law tax treatment of these \njoint ventures, known as 10/50 companies because between 10 and 50 \npercent of the joint venture is owned by the U.S. company--is \nindefensible.\n  Ordinarily, our tax code adds together tax attributes from different \ndivisions of the same firm. For example, if one division of a company \nloses a hundred dollars and another division earns a hundred in \nprofits, we offset the gain and the loss and assess no tax liability.\n  Unfortunately, when it comes to these 10/50 companies, the tax law \napplies a separate foreign tax credit limitation to each venture. This \nincreases the cost of doing business for the U.S. firms competing \nabroad because it makes it harder for firms to use their foreign tax \ncredits and also adds a great deal of complexity. The result? Double \ntaxation once again. And once again, our tax code discourages U.S. \nfirms from jumping on profitable investment opportunities, because of \nthe very real threat of double taxation.\n  When American businesses are considered overseas investment \nopportunities, we do not want that decision to turn on the arcane \ndetails of U.S. tax law--we want a code that is fairer, simpler, and \nmost of all, helps our companies better compete in the global \nmarketplace. The bill we are introducing today will not fix all of our \ntax code's many problems in the international area, but it is an \nexcellent start. I urge our colleagues to give their consideration to \nthis important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2677. A bill to improve consumer access to prescription drugs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \naffects all of our lives. This bill gets to the heart of an issue that \nCongress has been talking about for years, access to prescription \ndrugs. As the name implies, the Consumer Access to Prescription Drugs \nImprovement Act of 2002 seeks to improve access to prescription drugs \nfor every person who needs medication.\n  Today, people rely on prescription drugs for several different \nreasons. For some people, prescription drugs make life more \ncomfortable. Some would not survive without them. Prescription drugs \nhave become an intricate part of modern medicine, replacing procedures \nthat once required an inpatient stay. Ailments that once could not be \ntreated can now be cured with a little pill. The innovation that has \nbeen displayed is amazing and must continue.\n  The problem, however, is that prescription drug manufacturers have \nbeen distorting the market. Drug manufacturers are exploiting loopholes \nin existing laws to further extend their monopolies and keep generic \ndrugs off the market. The result, after years of paying monopoly \nprices, consumers continue to be cheated out of cost-effective \nalternatives. We've all heard the horror stories of people going \nwithout their medications, splitting pills, or making the choice \nbetween food and drugs. However, the consequences of actions taken by \ndrug manufacturers are actually more global. They are taking a terrible \ntoll on State budgets, forcing Medicaid to severely scale back their \ncoverage of our most needed population. They are causing employer \nhealth care premiums to go through the roof. These pressures will cause \nthe number of uninsured to increase and will ultimately limit access to \nhealth care.\n  The group that suffers the most due to drug cost growth is seniors. \nMillions of seniors have no drug coverage today. Over the past five \nyears, the 50 prescription drugs most commonly used by seniors have \nincreased in price by nearly twice the rate of inflation. In fact, over \n25 percent of these drugs increased in price by three or more times the \nrate of inflation over that time period. According to the Kaiser Family \nFoundation, the average retail prescription price for brand name drugs \nhas increased more than 58 percent in 10 years. Brandeis University \nrecently released a report on this issue. The major conclusion of the \nreport is that greater and appropriate use of generic medications can \nachieve $50-$100 billion in savings for any new Medicare drug benefit. \nThis legislation will make a Medicare drug benefit affordable and \nsustainable into the future. Senators should be aware that I plan to \noffer this legislation as an amendment to any Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit that the Senate considers.\n  This legislation will stop pharmaceutical companies from \ncircumventing the law and open the door to competition so that every \nconsumer from West Virginia to California has access to reasonably \npriced prescription drugs. However, this legislation will also go \nfurther. It will provide crucial information to physicians, consumers, \nand health care purchasers about the cost-effective generics that are \nequivalent to brand names. According to the Federal Trade Commission, \ngeneric drugs typically cost 25 percent less than brand-name drugs when \nthey first enter the market. After two years, the price difference \ngrows to 60 percent. Every patient should have access to the drug \nprescribed by their doctor, but if there is a drug out there that is \nequivalent to the brand name but will cost you half as much, don't you \nwant your physician to know about it? This bill will shine a spotlight \non the real costs and the effects of issues we hear so much about, \ndirect-to-consumer advertising, drug detailing, and sampling. We can no \nlonger afford to talk about these issues in broad, hypothetical terms. \nCongress and the public need to understand these issues better so that \nwe can be more prudent purchasers. This legislation will create the \ncorrect incentives, to innovate rather than litigate.\n\n  Finally, this legislation will expand access to drugs under existing \nprograms which are so crucial to those who rely on them. This \nlegislation will expand Medicare's current drug benefit to include all \ncancer drugs, regardless of the method by which they are administered. \nIt will allow public hospitals access to the drug prices they need to \nbe able to continue in their mission to provide care to our neediest \ncitizens. It will help states with their drug utilization review \nprograms which we all know are cost effective. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in this effort.\n  My efforts are supported by the Service Employees International \nUnion, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal \nEmployees, the AFL-CIO, Families USA, the Generic Pharmaceutical \nAssociation, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, and \nRepresentative Waxman, the author of the original legislation.\n  Representative Waxman stated:\n\n       Now more than ever, as the cost of prescription drugs has \n     skyrocketed, access to low-cost generics is essential. At a \n     time when the brand-name companies have few innovative \n     products in their pipelines, we are seeing a disturbing \n     trend: a growing number of companies are choosing to protect \n     their profits through legal maneuvers to delay generic \n     competition on their existing products. The price of this \n     anti-competitive behavior to our nation's health care bill \n     and to the health of Americans is shockingly high. It is time \n     that Congress acted to stop unnecessary delays in the \n     marketing of generic drugs. The bill that Senator Rockefeller \n     is introducing today makes a real contribution to the effort \n     to combat these problems.\n\n  This legislation is a commonsense step we can take to increase access \nto prescription drugs for all consumers. I urge Congress to consider \nand pass this legislation. I ask unanimous consent\n\n[[Page S6020]]\n\nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2677\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) prescription drugs are a crucial part of modern \n     medicine, serving as complements to medical procedures, \n     substitutes for surgery and other medical procedures, and new \n     forms of treatment;\n       (2) a lack of access to prescription drugs can not only \n     cause discomfort, but can be life-threatening to a patient;\n       (3)(A) by all accounts, double-digit prescription drug \n     price increases are forecast annually for the next 3 to 5 \n     years; and\n       (B) such increases would result in prescription drug costs \n     that would be prohibitive for many Americans;\n       (4) the Congressional Budget Office estimates that--\n       (A) the use of generic prescription drugs for brand-name \n     prescription drugs could save purchasers of prescription \n     drugs between $8,000,000,000 and $10,000,000,000 each year; \n     and\n       (B) generic prescription drugs cost between 25 percent and \n     60 percent less than brand-name prescription drugs, resulting \n     in an estimated average saving of $15 to $30 on each \n     prescription;\n       (5) expanding access to generic prescription drugs can help \n     consumers, especially seniors and the uninsured, have access \n     to more affordable prescription drugs;\n       (6) policymakers should be better informed about issues \n     relating to prescription drugs, particularly issues \n     concerning barriers to patient access to prescription drugs;\n       (7) health care purchasers should be more aware of safe, \n     cost-effective alternatives to brand-name prescription drugs; \n     and\n       (8) prescription drug coverage provided under existing \n     programs should be expanded to better reflect modern \n     technology and provide drugs to the people who rely on them \n     most, yet who increasingly find themselves uninsured or with \n     coverage that is becoming more expensive and less meaningful.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to better educate policymakers, purchasers, and the \n     public about safe and cost-effective generic alternatives, \n     barriers to market entry, and upcoming issues in the \n     pharmaceutical industry;\n       (2) to increase consumer access to prescription drugs by--\n       (A) decreasing price through increased competition; and\n       (B) expanding coverage under the medicare and medicaid \n     programs.\n\n     TITLE I--EXPANSION OF ACCESS THROUGH EDUCATION AND INFORMATION\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \ntransfer all excise taxes imposed on alcohol fuels to the Highway Trust \nFund, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the MEGATRUST \nAct, the Maximum Growth for America Through the Highway Trust Fund.\n  Next year, the Congress must reauthorize highway and transit programs \nand the system of Federal financing for them. This is a very important \nissue for our Nation. The highway and transit programs are very \nimportant in every State. Very few other pieces of legislation effect \nour country's citizens and businesses more directly than the highway \nbill. These are our ways for moving goods and people.\n  They are key to our economy and our ability to connect to one \nanother. This country needs good, safe highways in order to cross great \ndistances, and highway and transit construction and maintenance is an \nimportant part of every State's economy.\n  In order to facilitate our work in reauthorizing these programs, I \nplan to introduce a series of bills concerning important issues that \nCongress must address in that legislation.\n  This will be the first of those bills, a proposal concerning revenues \nfor the highway trust fund. But unlike other bills I will introduce, \nthis one must pass more quickly because it sets the foundation for the \nother bills I will be introducing later. This bill will represent how \nthis country will help pay for our highway and transit needs over the \nnext several years.\n  The MEGATRUST Act represents an important step in the effort to \nstrengthen our Nation's economy, and improve its quality of life, by \ninvesting in transportation.\n  It would increase revenues into the highway trust fund by several \nbillion dollars annually by making some needed corrections in the way \nFederal revenues are credited to the highway trust fund.\n  Nothing in this bill increases any tax. I repeat that. Nothing in \nthis bill increases any tax.\n  Federal dollars to help States and localities improve their highways \nand transit systems are derived largely from the Federal highway trust \nfund. Under the system today, revenues from highway user taxes are \ndeposited into the highway trust fund, and, more specifically, into \nseparate accounts within the fund for highways and for transit. Those \nare two separate accounts.\n  These revenues are, in turn, distributed to States and localities for \ntransportation investments that truly to improve our lives, create \njobs, and make our economy better. This trust fund mechanism has been \nwidely regarded as successful. But, as always, we must make adjustments \nto meet new challenges.\n  This bill would improve and extend this important financing \nmechanism, principally by making sure that certain revenues not \ncurrently credited to the highway trust fund are, in fact, placed in \nthat fund.\n  The MEGATRUST Act does several things. First, it will ensure that \ntaxes paid on gasohol are fully credited to the highway account of the \nhighway trust fund. Today, when gasohol is taxed, the mass transit \naccount of the highway trust fund receives its full share of revenues, \nas if the fuel were gasoline. But 2.5 cents of the gas tax per gallon \nthat is imposed on gasohol is credited to the general fund of the \nTreasury, not to the highway account. So the MEGATRUST Act ensures that \nthose 2.5 cents per gallon go to the highway account.\n  Second, the MEGATRUST Act will ensure that the highway system does \nnot bear the cost of our national policy to develop and promote the use \nof gasohol. This tax rate preference is part of our national policy to \nadvance the use of gasohol.\n\n  I believe the ethanol subsidy is good energy policy, good agriculture \npolicy, and good tax policy. Yet ironically, it is the highway trust \nfund that bears the burden of the subsidy. Since it is good general \npolicy--that is, gasohol--I believe the general fund should bear\n\n[[Page S6026]]\n\nthe burden of the subsidy, not the highway trust fund.\n  Gasohol, as a fuel, is taxed 5.3 cents per gallon less than gasoline. \nBut gasohol-fueled vehicles cause the same wear and tear on roads as \ngasoline-fueled vehicles. That is obvious. They use the same roads, \ntravel the same distances, et cetera.\n  Ensuring necessary and affordable energy supplies is important to the \nquality of life and economic prosperity of all Americans. Policies to \nachieve these objectives, however, should not come at the expense of \ntransportation infrastructure improvements.\n  Accordingly, the MEGATRUST Act would leave the gasohol tax rate \npreference in place but credit the highway account of the highway trust \nfund with revenue equal to that forgone to the Treasury by the gasohol \ntax preference.\n  Third, the MEGATRUST Act credits both the highway and mass transit \naccounts of the highway trust fund with interest starting in fiscal \nyear 2004. Today, the highway trust fund is one of the few trust funds \nin the Federal budget that is not credited with interest on its unspent \nbalance, which is highly inappropriate.\n  The MEGATRUST Act would change this in order to make sure that \ncollected highway user taxes are to be put to work for better \ntransportation for our citizens.\n  Fourth, the MEGATRUST Act would extend the basic highway user taxes \nand the highway trust fund so they do not expire.\n  And last, the MEGATRUST Act would require the creation of an \nimportant commission concerning the future financing of the Federal \nhighway and transit programs.\n  Why is that important? While the current mechanism has worked well, \nwe know that cars will become more fuel efficient and advancing \ntechnology will only bring us closer to increased fuel efficiency.\n  Other changes are possible as well in our dynamic economy. While \nmajor changes will not occur overnight, we have to be ready for them. \nWe have to understand what is likely to happen so we can consider \nmaking adjustments in the highway trust fund and its revenue streams, \nso we are not caught off guard and unable to adequately fund our \ntransportation system.\n  What am I saying? I am basically saying that the hybrid fuel \nvehicles--it could be fuels cells, other technologies for our \nautomobiles of the future--they do not use gasoline, they do not use \ngasohol, therefore, revenue would not be placed in the highway trust \nfund. We have to anticipate all of those changes so our highways are \nadequately funded regardless of the types of cars and regardless of the \ntype of energy that is used to propel those cars.\n  I especially thank Senators Harkin, Warner, Crapo, Graham of Florida, \nReid, Daschle, Carnahan, Bond, and Craig for working so closely with me \non this legislation.\n  In sum, through this highway trust fund proposal, I want to make \nclear to my colleagues that there are ways to increase revenue into the \nhighway trust fund without raising taxes. We will need to increase \nhighway trust fund resources to help us all structure a successful \nreauthorization bill next year, and I look forward to working closely \nwith my colleagues to that end.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 2679. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a tax credit for offering employer-based health insurance coverage, \nto provide for the establishment of health plan purchasing alliances, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Health \nInsurance Access Act'' of 2002.\n  This bill addresses one of the most serious problems facing the \nUnited States. The problem of the uninsured.\n  According to recent census data, 38 million Americans lack health \ninsurance coverage. More than the population of twenty-three States. \nPlus the District of Columbia. And lack of coverage is an even greater \nproblem in rural areas. In Montana, one in five citizens goes without \nhealth insurance. As premiums sky-rocket, I'm worried that this number \nmay grow even higher.\n  For America's uninsured, the consequences of going without health \ncoverage can be devastating.\n  Put plainly, uninsured Americans are less healthy than those with \nhealth insurance. They delay seeking medical care or go without \ntreatment altogether that could prevent and detect crippling illnesses. \nIllnesses like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. The uninsured are \nfar less likely to receive health services if they are injured or \nbecome ill.\n  These factors take an enormous personal toll on the lives of the \nuninsured. They are sicker and less productive in the workplace. Their \nchildren are less likely to survive past infancy. And they must \nstruggle with the knowledge that a serious injury or illness in their \nfamily might push them to the brink of financial ruin.\n  I just recently saw a statistic that women with breast cancer who \nlack health insurance are 49 percent more likely to die than women who \nhave insurance. Unfortunately, this statistic is just one of countless \nother statistics about the effects that lack of health insurance has on \npeoples' health and their lives.\n  But these personal struggles are not the only affect of America's \nuninsured problem. Because when the uninsured become so sick that they \nmust finally seek emergency treatment, there is no one to pay for it. \nNo insurance company. No government program.\n  So who absorbs the cost of this uncompensated medical care? We all \ndo. In the form of higher health care costs. Higher and higher premiums \nat a time when the cost of health care is already rising out of \ncontrol.\n  The situation is becoming critical. And I believe the time for \ntalking has ended. It is time for us to examine solutions instead of \ntalking about the problem.\n  That is why I have joined with Senator Gordon Smith to introduce this \nimportant piece of legislation. Our bill would lift millions of \nAmericans out of the ranks of the uninsured. It would give millions of \nfamilies the peace of mind that comes from knowing they will receive \nthe care they need, when they need it. And it would lighten the load of \nuncompensated care on our over-burdened health care system.\n  Our bill attacks the problem of the uninsured on several fronts. As \nyou know, the 38 million uninsured Americans are a diverse mix of \npeople. Some work for small employers, who simply can't afford the high \ncost of health insurance. Others have pre-existing health conditions. \nThese conditions translate into unaffordable, even astronomical, health \ncare insurance premiums.\n  Some uninsured Americans fall just beyond the eligibility levels for \npublic programs like Medicaid. And many are near-elderly individuals, \ntoo young to qualify for Medicare, yet old enough that any health \ncondition at all means expensive premiums or high deductibles. In fact, \nthe fastest growing segment of the uninsured today is the near-elderly \npopulation.\n  Our bill addresses each of these populations.\n  The first part of our bill would target uninsured Americans who work \nfor small businesses. It would give a tax credit of up to 50 percent to \nsmall firms, those with 50 or fewer employees, for the cost of health \ninsurance premiums for their employees. The credit is not limited only \nto employers who do not currently provide health benefits. It is \navailable to all qualified small employers. The credit will give small \nemployers the extra resources they need to extend, or continue to \noffer, health benefits to millions of hard-working Americans and their \nfamilies.\n  One thing I heard from my constituents traveling around the State, in \naddition to grief over increasing premiums, is that the health \ninsurance options available to individuals and small employers are \nlimited. If they could pool their resources together, even across State \nlines, they might be able to reduce their costs as a group.\n  In response to these concerns, the second part of our bill would \nprovide funding to states, private employer groups, and associations to \ncreate purchasing pools. These purchasing pools, or alliances, as we \ncall them in this bill, would provide small employers with affordable \nhealth coverage options, which would, accordingly, allow them to take \nmaximum advantage of their tax credits.\n\n[[Page S6027]]\n\n  For individuals with high cost health conditions, our bill would \nspend $50 million annually to support state high risk pools. These \npools serve a dual purpose. They offer high-risk individuals a place to \npurchase affordable health coverage. And, by isolating the costs of \nhigh-risk individuals, they help lower premiums for those who are not \nconsidered high risk or high cost.\n  Fourth, our bill would also allow states to expand health insurance \ncoverage to the parents of children who are eligible for Medicaid and \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. This will reach an \nestimated four million low-income parents who do not currently meet \neligibility levels for health insurance coverage under public programs. \nIt will also help us cover even more kids under CHIP, kids who are \neligible for coverage but not currently enrolled.\n  Finally, our bill would allow uninsured Americans between the ages of \n62 and 65 to buy into Medicare. Under current law, Americans in this \nage group are stuck in a bind: not old enough to qualify for Medicare, \nbut unable to afford the high cost of private health insurance options \nbecause of their age or health condition. This predicament explains why \nthey represent the fastest-growing group of uninsured. Our bill would \noffer the near-elderly a more affordable, quality health care package \nto tide them over until they reach 65.\n  All told, these efforts would expand access to health insurance \ncoverage to 10 million Americans who are currently uninsured. It's not \na panacea. But it's a start.\n  I commend Senator Smith for his hard work on this issue. I believe \nour bipartisan efforts prove that covering the uninsured is not a \nDemocratic issue. It's not a Republican issue. And it's not a Montana \nor an Oregon issue. It's an American issue.\n  I hope my colleagues will join this fight by helping us pass this \nlegislation, and taking a solid step towards providing quality, \naffordable health insurance to all Americans.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I would like to thank my \ncolleague from Montana for his leadership on the issue of the \nuninsured, and rise today in support of the Baucus-Smith Health \nInsurance Access Act. This bill will go a long way toward mending some \nof the holes in our nation's health care safety net.\n  And make no mistake, the safety net is torn. Currently 40 million \nAmericans, that's one in six,--live, work, and go to school among us \nwithout health insurance. That means that nationally, 17 percent of \nAmericans do not have any health insurance. They are our friends, our \nneighbors, our children, our parents.\n  And the problem is getting worse, not better. In 2001, two million \nAmericans lost their health insurance, that's the largest one year \nincrease in almost a decade.\n  Many, more than 35 million of these uninsured Americans, are in low-\nincome working families. Many people who work in small businesses are \nnot offered health insurance, and those who are often cannot afford the \nskyrocketing premiums.\n  This is particularly true if an individual or a member of their \nfamily happen to have some kind of pre-existing or chronic condition \nthat can make a simple policy totally unaffordable. Even relatively \nhealthy Americans find that when they get older, they may be unable to \nafford health care premiums after they retire, but before they become \neligible for Medicare.\n  Some people say that insurance is irrelevant, that the uninsured can \nstill get good care at public clinics and in emergency rooms. While it \nis true that public clinics do provide high quality care to millions of \nAmericans, this is not the same as having health insurance with a \nregular source of care.\n  Not having a regular source of care leads to needless delays in \nseeking care. According to a recent report by the Institute of \nMedicine, an estimated 18,000 people die every year because they don't \nhave health insurance, and don't get the care they need in a timely \nfashion. Eighteen thousand deaths a year. Millions more people suffer \nunnecessarily due to delays in care.\n  Millions of Americans are falling through the cracks in our health \ncare system, and it is our moral obligation to help them get the care \nthey need by providing access to affordable health insurance.\n  The Health Insurance Access Act of 2002 provides a number of \nsolutions to the growing crisis of the uninsured.\n  It helps small businesses, which are often unable to offer affordable \nhealth insurance to their employees. Under this legislation, small \nbusinesses would get a significant tax break to subsidize their \npurchase of health insurance. The tax break is indexed to the size of a \nbusiness, so the smallest employers get the most help if they choose to \noffer their employees health insurance. This is important because \nsmaller businesses are much less likely to offer their employees health \ncoverage.\n  In order to avoid punishing small employers who are already doing the \nright thing, our tax credit is available to all qualified small \nemployers, regardless of whether they currently offer health insurance \nto their employees.\n\n  Another problem small businesses face in purchasing health insurance \nfor their employees is finding an affordable policy with real benefits \nfor their employees. By definition, small businesses are too small to \nprovide a stable risk pool. This drives up the cost of premiums.\n  The Baucus-Smith Health Insurance Access Act of 2002 offers employers \nsome relief to this problem by providing funding for purchasing \nalliances, which lower premiums by sharing risk. This will provide new, \nmore affordable options for millions of Americans, who have until now \nhad limited health insurance choices.\n  Our bill also provides grants to states to help fund high risk pools \nfor people who have very limited health insurance options. It seems \nironic to me that many of the people who need health insurance most, \npeople with an expensive medical condition--are often unable to obtain \ninsurance.\n  For many people who have extensive health care needs and medical \nexpenses, obtaining coverage in the individual insurance market is not \na viable option. If they can find a policy to cover their illness--\noften they cannot--they may not be able to afford the premium.\n  However, in many cases, many of these individuals may not be able to \nbuy health insurance at any cost, because insurers often turn down high \nrisk individuals for coverage because of an existing or previous \nillness.\n  High-risk insurance pools attempt to fill this gap in the insurance \nmarket. Oregon has had a high risk insurance pool for people who were \nunable to obtain health insurance because of health conditions for the \npast 15 years. Since its inception, more than 24,000 Oregonians have \nbought health care coverage through this high risk insurance pool, \n24,000 people who would otherwise have had no health care coverage.\n  Operating a high risk pool in Oregon has had its costs, costs which \nare increasing every year. Our legislation will help States assist \npeople who are trying to do the right thing afford health insurance \ncoverage that would otherwise be out of reach.\n  While much of the policy discussion about the uninsured focuses on \nchildren, low income parents are substantially more likely than their \nchildren to be uninsured. The Health Insurance Access Act of 2002 would \nalso allow states to offer Medicaid and SCHIP benefits to parents of \nlow income eligible children.\n  Encouraging States to offer Medicaid or SCHIP coverage to parents \nwill significantly expand access to care for low income parents, and \ntheir children, because parents are more likely to enroll their kids in \nMedicaid or SCHIP when the family is eligible, rather than just certain \nfamily members.\n  Finally, the Health Insurance Access Act of 2002 would address \nanother hole in the insurance market: the near elderly. The near \nelderly, Americans aged 62-64, often do not have employer sponsored \nhealth insurance, because they have retired from the labor force, but \nare not yet eligible for Medicare.\n  At the same time, insurance coverage is particularly critical for \nnear-elderly Americans, as the risk of serious illness rises with age, \nand the prevalence of chronic disease is higher among this population. \nIn addition, because many of the near-elderly have pre-existing \nconditions, private insurers often deny them coverage or charge \nunaffordable premiums.\n  Allowing all Americans aged 62-64 to buy into the Medicare program \nwould create a strong risk pool that would\n\n[[Page S6028]]\n\nstabilize premiums, making them affordable to many who would otherwise \nhave been unable to afford coverage. Researchers estimate that almost \n40% of eligible Americans 62-64 would buy into Medicare if allowed to \ndo so.\n  The number of uninsured people in America is an outrage. If 18,000 \nAmericans died in terrorist incidents each year, there would be \nwidespread outrage. Yet, tens of thousands of uninsured Americans are \nat risk of dying each year from cancers diagnosed too late, or stroke \nfrom uncontrolled high blood pressure. These can be slow, painful \ndeaths. They are preventable deaths. We can help prevent these deaths. \nWe should help prevent these deaths.\n  I urge you to join me and my colleague from Montana to support the \nHealth Insurance Access Act of 2002. This legislation will touch \nmillions of lives by making quality, affordable health insurance \naccessible to individuals and families who are living at risk.\n  It is the right thing to do. It is the right time to do it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 2680. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to evaluate \nopportunities to enhance domestic oil and gas production through the \nexchange of nonproducing Federal oil and gas leases located in the \nLewis and Clark National Forest, in the Flathead National Forest and on \nBureau of Land Management land in the State of Montana, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today that is \nextremely important to the people of my State of Montana. Why is it so \nimportant? Because I hope it will take us one step closer to achieving \npermanent protections for Montana's magnificent Rocky Mountain Front.\n  The Front, as we call it back home, is part of one of the largest and \nmost intact wild places left in the lower 48. To the North, the Front \nincludes a 200 square mile area known as the Badger-Two Medicine in the \nLewis and Clark National Forest. This area sits just south-east of \nGlacier National Park, one of our greatest national treasures. The \nBadger-Two Medicine area is sacred ground to the Blackfeet Tribe. In \nJanuary of 2002, portions of the Badger-Two, known as the Badger-Two \nMedicine Blackfoot Traditional Cultural District, were declared \neligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.\n  South of the Badger-Two, the Front includes a 400 square mile strip \nof national forest land and about 20 square miles of BLM lands, \nincluding three BLM Outstanding Natural Areas.\n  Not only the Front still retain almost all its native species, only \nbison are missing, but it also harbors the country's largest bighorn \nsheep herd and second largest elk herd. The Rocky Mountain Front \nsupports one of the largest populations of grizzly bears south of \nCanada and is the only place in the lower 48 States where grizzly bears \nstill roam from the mountains to their historic range on the plains.\n  Because of this exceptional habitat, the Front offers world renowned \nhunting, fishing and recreational opportunities. Sportsmen, local land \nowners, hikers, local communities and many other Montanans have worked \nfor decades to protect and preserve the Front for future generations.\n  In short, a majority of Montanans feel very strongly that oil and gas \ndevelopment, and Montana's Rocky Mountain Front, just don't mix. The \nhabitat is too rich, the landscape too important, to subject it to the \nroads, drills, pipelines, industrial equipment, chemicals, noise, and \nhuman activity that come with oil and gas development.\n  Building upon a significant public and private conservation \ninvestment and following an extensive public comment process, the Lewis \nand Clark National Forest decided in 1997 to withdraw for 15 years \n356,000 acres in the Front from any new oil and gas leasing. This was a \nsignificant first step in protecting the Front from developing that I \nwholeheartedly supported.\n  However, in many parts of the Rocky Mountain Front, oil and gas \nleases exist that pre-date the 1997 decision. These leaseholders have \ninvested time and resources in acquiring their leases. Several \nleaseholders have applied to the federal government for permits to \ndrill. These leases are the subject of my proposed bill.\n  History has shown that energy exploration and development in the \nFront is likely to result in expensive and time consuming environmental \nstudies and litigation. This process rarely ends with a solution that \nis satisfactory to the oil and gas lessee. For example, in the late \n1980's both Chevron and Fina applied for permits to drill in the Badger \nTwo Medicine portion of the Front. After millions of dollars spent on \nstudies and years of public debate, Chevron abandoned or assigned all \nof its lease rights, and Fina sold its lease rights back to the \noriginal owner.\n  Therefore, I think we should be fair to those leaseholders. We want \nthem to continue to provide for our domestic oil and gas needs, but \nthey are going to have a long, difficult and expensive road if they \nwish to develop oil and gas in the Rocky Mountain Front.\n  My legislation would direct the Interior Department to evaluate non-\nproducing leases in the Rocky Mountain Front and look at opportunities \nto cancel these leases, in exchange for allowing leaseholders to \nexplore for oil and gas somewhere else, namely in the Gulf of Mexico or \nin the State of Montana. In conducting this evaluation, the Secretary \nwould have to consult with leaseholders, with the State of Montana and \nthe public and other interested parties.\n  When Interior concludes this study in two years, the bill calls for \nthe agency to make recommendations to Congress and the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee on the advisability of pursuing lease \nexchanges in the Front and any changes in law and regulation needed to \nenable the Secretary to undertake such an exchange.\n  Finally, in order to allow the Secretary to conduct this study, my \nbill would continue the current lease suspension in the Badger-Two \nMedicine Area for three more years. This lease suspension would only \napply to the Badger-Two Medicine Area, not the entire Front.\n  That's it, that's all my bill does. It doesn't predetermine any \noutcome, it doesn't impact any existing exploration activities or \nenvironmental review processes. It just creates a process through which \nthe federal government, the people of Montana and leaseholders can \nfinally have a real, open and honest discussion about the fate of the \nRocky Mountain Front.\n  We should look for ways to fairly compensate leaseholders for \ninvestments they've made in their leases if they decide to leave the \nFront rather than waste years and millions fighting to explore for \nuncertain oil and gas reserves. Because, a lot of Montanans don't want \nto see the Front developed, and they will fight to protect it. \nIncluding me.\n  So, developers can wait years, or decades, or most likely never, for \noil and gas to flow from the Front. Or we can look at ways to encourage \ndomestic production much sooner, in much more cost effective, \nappropriate and efficient ways somewhere else.\n  That is what I hope this legislation will accomplish, and I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S.J. Res. 38. A joint resolution providing for the designation of a \nMedal of Honor Flag and for presentation of that flag recipients of the \nMedal of Honor; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution to \ndesignate a Medal of Honor Flag to further honor those individuals who \nhave gone above and beyond the call of duty in service to their country \nand to present that flag to each recipient of the Medal of Honor. This \nidea came from a constituent of mine, retired First Sergeant William \nKendall of Jefferson, IA. Mr. Kendall had been thinking about another \nresident of Jefferson, Captain Darrell Lindsey, who was shot down while \non a bombing mission over France during World War II. Captain Lindsey \nwas able to keep his aircraft in the air long enough to allow the \nmembers of his crew to escape safely, but this action cost him his \nlife. As a result of this selfless sacrifice, Captain Lindsey was \nawarded the Medal of Honor.\n  A Medal of Honor monument commemorating this heroic Iowan now\n\n[[Page S6029]]\n\nstands on the courthouse lawn in Jefferson, IA. It was partly this \nmonument and the proud history of his fellow Iowan that inspired Bill \nKendall to ponder the heroism of all recipients of the Medal of Honor. \nHe then began to wonder why there was no official flag to honor \nrecipients of the Medal of Honor. The Medal of Honor is the Nation's \nhighest award for bravery he felt that a flag would help to show \nrespect for this award as well as all those who have earned it through \ntheir service to the United States of America. I agree.\n  The Medal of Honor is not given out lightly. To date, only 3,439 \nindividuals have been awarded the Medal of Honor and there are only 143 \nliving recipients of this award. Each of the armed services has very \nstrict regulations for judging whether an individual is entitled to the \nMedal of Honor. The award is only given for acts of exceptional bravery \nor self-sacrifice above and beyond what is expected and must involve \nrisk of life. The deed must be proved by incontestable evidence of at \nleast two eyewitnesses.\n  I should also add that there is an Iowa connection going back to the \ncreation of the Medal of Honor. In 1861, during the Civil War, Iowa \nSenator James Grimes introduced legislation in the Senate to create a \nMedal of Honor for the Navy. This first Medal of Honor was followed by \nsimilar awards for the other services. It is appropriate that another \nIowan, Sergeant William Kendall, should create the first Medal of Honor \nflag.\n  It is indeed right and appropriate to honor those Americans to whom \nwe owe so much. Bill Kendall's idea for a Medal of Honor flag is a good \none and I am honored to do what I can to help see his vision realized. \nI am pleased that the House has already acted on a similar measure and \nI hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in this important \ninitiative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this resolution be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 38\n\n       Whereas the Medal of Honor is the highest award for valor \n     in action against an enemy force which can be bestowed upon \n     an individual serving in the Armed Forces of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the Medal of Honor was established by Congress \n     during the Civil War to recognize soldiers who had \n     distinguished themselves by gallantry in action;\n       Whereas the Medal of Honor was conceived by Senator James \n     Grimes of the State of Iowa in 1861; and\n       Whereas the Medal of Honor is the Nation's highest military \n     honor, awarded for acts of personal bravery or self-sacrifice \n     above and beyond the call of duty: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this subtitle is to provide Federal support \n     through a new demonstration program to States and local \n     educational agencies, to enable the States and local \n     educational agencies to develop models for high quality \n     military charter schools that are specifically designed to \n     help mobile military dependent students attending public \n     school make a smooth transition from one school district to \n     another, even across State lines, and achieve a symbiotic \n     relationship between military installations and these school \n     districts.\n\n     SEC. 1304.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Commercial Reusable In-\n     Space Transportation Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 1302. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is in the national interest to encourage the \n     production of cost-effective, in-space transportation \n     systems, which would be built and operated by the private \n     sector on a commercial basis.\n       (2) The use of reusable in-space transportation systems \n     will enhance performance levels of in-space operations, \n     enhance efficient and safe disposal of satellites at the end \n     of their useful lives, and increase the capability and \n     reliability of existing ground-to-space launch vehicles.\n       (3) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems \n     will enhance the economic well-being and national security of \n     the United States by reducing space operations costs for \n     commercial and national space programs and by adding new \n     space capabilities to space operations.\n       (4) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems \n     will provide new cost-effective space capabilities (including \n     orbital transfers from low altitude orbits to high altitude \n     orbits and return, the correction of erroneous satellite \n     orbits, and the recovery, refurbishment, and refueling of \n     satellites) and the provision of upper stage functions to \n     increase ground-to-orbit launch vehicle payloads to \n     geostationary and other high energy orbits.\n       (5) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems can \n     enhance and enable the space exploration of the United States \n     by providing lower cost trajectory injection from earth \n     orbit, transit trajectory control, and planet arrival \n     deceleration to support potential National Aeronautics and \n     Space Administration missions to Mars, Pluto, and other \n     planets.\n       (6) Satellites stranded in erroneous earth orbit due to \n     deficiencies in their launch represent substantial economic \n     loss to the United States and present substantial concerns \n     for the current backlog of national space assets.\n       (7) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems can \n     provide new options for alternative planning approaches and \n     risk management to enhance the mission assurance of national \n     space assets.\n       (8) Commercial reusable in-space transportation systems \n     developed by the private sector can provide in-space \n     transportation services to the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration, the Department of Defense, the National \n     Reconnaissance Office, and other agencies without the need \n     for the United States to bear the cost of production of such \n     systems.\n       (9) The availability of loan guarantees, with the cost of \n     credit risk to the United States paid by the private-sector, \n     is an effective means by which the United States can help \n     qualifying private-sector companies secure otherwise \n     unattainable private financing for the production of \n     commercial reusable in-space transportation systems, while at \n     the same time minimizing Government commitment and \n     involvement in the development of such systems.\n\n     SEC. 1303.

and\n       (B) complete, recondition, reconstruct, renovate, repair, \n     maintain, operate, or sell the physical asset.\n       (g) Credit Instruments.--\n       (1) Authority to issue instruments.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, the Secretary may, subject to such \n     terms and conditions as the Secretary considers appropriate, \n     issue credit instruments to United States commercial \n     providers of in-space transportation services or system, with \n     the aggregate cost (as determined under the provisions of the \n     Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.)) of \n     such instruments not to exceed $1,500,000,000, but only to \n     the extent that new budget authority to cover such costs is \n     provided in appropriations Acts or authority is otherwise \n     provided in appropriations Acts.\n       (2) Credit subsidy.--The Secretary shall provide a credit \n     subsidy for any credit instrument issued under this \n     subsection in accordance with the provisions of the Federal \n     Credit Reform Act of 1990.\n       (3) Construction.--The eligibility of a United States \n     commercial provider of in-space transportation services or \n     systems for a credit instrument under this subsection is in \n     addition to any eligibility of such provider for a loan \n     guarantee under other provisions of this section.\n\n     SEC. 1304.

Madam President. I am pleased the Senate is considering \ntoday S. 2621, a bill I introduced earlier this month with Senator \nBiden that is also cosponsored by Senators Hatch and Schumer. This bill \nis intended to clarify that an airplane is a vehicle for purposes of \nterrorist and other violent acts against mass transportation systems. A \nsignificant question about this point has been raised in an important \ncriminal case and deserves our prompt attention.\n  On June 11, 2002, a U.S. district judge in Boston dismissed one of \nthe nine charges against Richard Reid stemming from his alleged attempt \nto detonate an explosive device in his shoe while onboard an \ninternational flight from Paris to Miami on December 22, 2001. The \ndismissed count charged defendant Reid with violating section 1993 of \ntitle 18, United States Code, by attempting to ``wreck, set fire to, \nand disable a mass transportation vehicle,''\n  Section 1993 is a new criminal law that was added, as section 801, to \nthe USA PATRIOT Act to punish terrorist attacks and other acts of \nviolence against, inter alia, a ``mass transportation'' vehicle or \nferry, or against a passenger or employee of a mass transportation \nprovider. I had urged that this provision be included in the final \nanti-terrorism law considered by the Congress. A similar provision was \noriginally part of S. 2783, the ``21st Century Law Enforcement and \nPublic Safety Act,'' that I introduced in the last Congress in June, \n2000 at the request of the Clinton administration.\n  The district court rejected defendant Reid's arguments to dismiss the \nsection 1993 charge on grounds that (1) the penalty provision does not \napply to an `'attempt,'' and (2) an airplane is not engaged in ``mass \ntransportation,'' ``Mass transportation'' is defined in section 1993 by \nreference to the ``the meaning given to that term in section 5302(a)(7) \nof title 49, U.S.C., except that the term shall include schoolbus, \ncharter and sightseeing transportation.\n  Section 5302(a)(7), in turn, provides the following definition: \n``mass transportation'' means ``transportation by conveyance that \nprovides regular and continuing general or special transportation to \nthe public, but does not include school bus, charter or sightseeing \ntransportation.'' The court explained that ``commercial aircraft \ntransport large numbers of people every day'' and that the definition \nof ``mass transportation'' ``when read in an ordinary or natural way, \nencompasses aircraft of the kind at issue here,'' U.S. v. Reid, CR No. \n02-10013, at p. 10, 12 (D. MA, June 11, 2002).\n  Defendant Reid also argued that the section 1993 charge should be \ndismissed because an airplane is not a ``vehicle,'' The court agreed, \nciting the fact that the term ``vehicle'' is not defined in section \n1993 and that the Dictionary Act, 1 U.S.C. Sec. 4, narrowly defines \n``vehicle'' to include ``every description of carriage or other \nartificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of \ntransportation on land.'' The emphasis in the original opinion.\n  Notwithstanding common parlance, the district court relied on the \nnarrow definition to conclude that an aircraft is not a ``vehicle'' \nwithin the meaning of section 1993.\n  The new section 1993 was intended to provide broad Federal criminal \njurisdiction over terrorist and violent acts against all mass \ntransportation systems, not only bus services, but also commercial \nairplanes, cruise ships, railroads and other forms of transportation \navailable for public carriage.\n  The bill the committee reports today would add a definition of \n``vehicle'' to section 1993 and clarify that an airplane is a \n``vehicle'' both in common parlance and under this new criminal law to \nprotect mass transportation systems. Specifically, the bill would \ndefine this term to mean ``any carriage or other contrivance used, or \ncapable of being used, as a means of transportation on land, water or \nthrough the air.''\n  On June 20, 2002, less than two weeks after the bill was introduced, \nthe Judiciary Committee favorably reported this bill for consideration \nby the Senate. I urge the Senate to act promptly and pass this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read three times, \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table with no \nintervening action or debate, and any statements relating thereto be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2621) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2621\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Hatch, among others.\n  The U.S. attorney has issued subpoenas for testimony at trial by \nemployees on the staffs of Senators Leahy and Hatch who received the \ncommunications and an employee on Senator Harry Reid's staff who had \ncontact with the defendant. The testimony is necessary to establish the \nreceipt of the threatening communications in Washington, DC.\n  This resolution would authorize the Senate employees to testify and \nproduce documents in this case with representation by the Senate Legal \nCounsel.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the resolution and preamble be \nagreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, with \nthe above occurring without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.
