Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will state the resolution.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       A joint resolution (SJ. Res. 22) expressing the sense of \n     the Senate and the House of Representatives regarding the \n     terrorist attacks launched against the United States on \n     September 11, 2001:\n       Whereas on September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked and \n     destroyed four civilian aircraft, crashing two of them into \n     the towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, and a \n     third into the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C.;\n       Whereas thousands of innocent Americans were killed and \n     injured as a result of these attacks, including the \n     passengers and crew of the four aircraft, workers in the \n     World Trade Center and in the Pentagon, rescue workers, and \n     bystanders;\n       Whereas these attacks destroyed both towers of the World \n     Trade Center, as well as adjacent buildings, and seriously \n     damaged the Pentagon; and\n       Whereas these attacks were by far the deadliest terrorist \n     attacks ever launched against the United States, and, by \n     targeting symbols of American strength and success, clearly \n     were intended to intimidate our Nation and weaken its \n     resolve: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     Congress--\n       (1) condemns in the strongest possible terms the terrorists \n     who planned and carried out the September 11, 2001, attacks \n     against the United States, as well as their sponsors;\n       (2) extends its deepest condolences to the victims of these \n     heinous and cowardly attacks, as well as to their families, \n     friends, and loved ones;\n       (3) is certain that the people of the United States will \n     stand united as our Nation begins the process of recovering \n     and rebuilding in the aftermath of these tragic acts;\n       (4) commends the heroic actions of the rescue workers, \n     volunteers, and State and local officials who responded to \n     these tragic events with courage, determination, and skill;\n       (5) declares that these premeditated attacks struck not \n     only at the people of America, but also at the symbols and \n     structures of our economic and military strength, and that \n     the United States is entitled to respond under international \n     law;\n       (6) thanks those foreign leaders and individuals who have \n     expressed solidarity with the United States in the aftermath \n     of the attacks, and asks them to continue to stand with the \n     United States in the war against international terrorism;\n       (7) commits to support increased resources in the war to \n     eradicate terrorism;\n       (8) supports the determination of the President, in close \n     consultation with Congress, to bring to justice and punish \n     the perpetrators of these attacks as well as their sponsors; \n     and\n       (9) declares that September 12, 2001, shall be a National \n     Day of Unity and Mourning, and that when Congress adjourns \n     today, it stands adjourned out of respect to the victims of \n     the terrorist attacks.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution? Hearing no objection, the resolution \nis before the Senate.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is with pain, sorrow, anger, and \nresolve that I stand before this Senate, a symbol for 212 years of the \nstrength of our democracy, and say that America will emerge from this \ntragedy, as we have emerged from all adversity, united and strong.\n  The America in which we awoke today is far different from the one in \nwhich we awoke yesterday. This morning, as our rescue workers and \nmedical personnel continue their heroic work, we begin to truly \nunderstand the enormity of what happened.\n  My heart aches for the people of New York, our men and women serving \nat the Pentagon, the passengers and crew of the four hijacked aircraft, \nand for their families and friends. These attacks were an assault on \nour people and on our freedom. They aimed at the heart of the American \ncommunity and the symbols and structures of our economic and military \nstrength.\n\n  As an American, as an elected representative, I am outraged. As a \nhusband and a father, I am pained beyond words. Last night we sent the \nmessage to the world that, even in the face of such cowardly and \nheinous acts, the doors of democracy will not close. This joint \nresolution we laid down today condemns yesterday's attacks, expresses \nour sympathy for the victims, and our support for the President as our \nCommander in Chief.\n  The world should know that the Members of both parties in both Houses \nstand united. The full resources of our Government will be brought to \nbear in aiding the search and rescue and in hunting down those \nresponsible and those who may have aided or harbored them.\n  Nothing--nothing--can replace the losses that have been suffered. I \nknow there is only the smallest measure of inspiration that can be \ntaken from this devastation. But there is a passage in the Bible from \nIsaiah that I think speaks to all of us at times such as this:\n\n       The bricks have fallen down, but we will rebuild with \n     dressed stone; the fig trees have been felled, but we will \n     replace them with cedars.\n\n  That is what we will do. We will rebuild and we will recover. The \npeople of America will stand strong together because the people of \nAmerica have always stood together. And those of us privileged to serve \nthis great Nation will stand with you.\n  God bless the people of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, any expression of sympathy for the suffering \ntoday is too weak. Every expression of horror at this outrage is too \nmild. But we must confront these acts and find a way to come together \nand make sure that this kind of heinous, vicious action will not happen \nagain in America. This premediated action against innocent men and \nwomen and children and their families, at the symbols of our country--\nour economic strength, our military strength, and most importantly, our \nfreedoms--is unimaginable.\n  There's no way to understand it, to explain it, to defend it. \nAmericans just don't think that way. That makes it hard for us to \ncomprehend this very difficult moment and to do what's necessary to \ndeal with terrorism and stop it in the future.\n  Our prayers are going out to the victims and their families, to those \nwho are suffering in so many ways in New York, in Virginia, and in \nPennsylvania--in all of America. We have such a debt of appreciation to \npay to those who have struggled mightily with these catastrophic events \nat the Pentagon and at the World Trade Center and in our cities and \nstates--the volunteers, those who gave their lives trying to deal with \nthis terrible moment. To our allies and to those around the world who \nsee this not just as a strike at America, but at freedom and democracy \nall over the world, and to those who already have extended hands of \ncooperation, understanding, and support, we appreciate it on behalf of \nthe American people.\n  Now, Mr. President, it's so important that we show that even these \nterrible acts cannot stop America from going forward. We must get on \nwith important work. But it is important also to make it clear that \nthis is not business as usual. We're going ahead with our \nresponsibilities. But we are going to act now, tomorrow, and in the \nweeks and months ahead to deal with those people who have taken these \nactions and with those who have supported them.\n  We will take whatever action is necessary in the Congress, working \nwith the administration, working with the American team to stop this \nkind of terrorism. Whatever we call it, we must put ourselves in a war \nfooting. We must make up our minds we're going to fight this scourge of \nthe world. We will. We have come together.\n  There are moments in history when in the past the people of this \ncountry have set aside conflicts and prejudices and passions and have \ncome together. We'll do it now. We've already done it. But we must \ncontinue to do so, regardless of region, religion, party, philosophy, \nor anything else.\n  There's much to do. We've got to find out how this happened. Congress \nhas a right and a responsibility to learn what has happened here. We \nmust find out who did it. And we must be prepared to take actions and \nfight terrorist attacks in the future.\n  This is not a time for timidity. This is not a time for \npontification. Yes, we need to be sure of our actions. We need to be \ncommitted and determined. We need to be bold.\n  Here in the Congress I hope we will think about how we most \neffectively\n\n[[Page S9285]]\n\ncan fulfill our responsibilities to do everything we can to fight \nterrorism, to provide the funds necessary in this fight and to provide \nthe aid so necessary for those who have been damaged and have lost so \nmuch.\n  Just in a few hours we will take up the Commerce-State-Justice \nappropriations bill. In that bill is funding for counterterrorism. Is \nit enough? Can we do more? What should we do? I call on the Senate, as \nI know it will, to rise to this occasion, to be bold. Let's act \ntogether. The American people expect no less.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Daschle, the majority leader, has \nasked that I announce that Senator Biden, the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, will manage the discussion on this resolution \ntoday.\n  I join my colleagues in saying that my thoughts and prayers are with \nthose individuals and families who were victimized by the cowardly \nterrorist acts perpetrated against the United States yesterday.\n  We in Congress stand united in our resolve to ensure that President \nBush has every necessary resource as he leads our great Nation forward \nin the coming days and weeks and months.\n  I am very confident that every Member of the Senate views this as an \nAmerican issue. No party affiliation, no partisanship, no attempt to \ngain political advantage--nothing--will erode our solidarity or \nundermine our united resolve as we respond to protect our country and \nour people.\n  I personally express my appreciation to our Capitol Police men and \nwomen who yesterday acted so brilliantly, so heroically, in being \ncalled to arms, literally, at a moment's notice. I am very proud of the \nCapitol Police. We all should be. Every day they put their lives on the \nline for us.\n  My heart goes out to the police officers and firemen in New York who \nlost their lives attempting to help other people.\n  I hope we will all join with Senators Durbin and Bennett to make sure \nthat every penny necessary to build the Visitors Center is provided \nthis year. We need more than a plaque on a wall for Officer Chestnut \nand Detective Gibson. In their honor, we need to build a Visitors \nCenter, because Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson gave their lives \nprotecting us, our staffs, and the millions of people who visit the \nCapitol complex every year. Building the Capitol Visitors Center is \ncritical to ensuring the safety of all those who come to the U.S. \nCapitol.\n  We will do everything in our power to support President Bush in his \nefforts to ensure that those who have done such evil and perpetrated \nthese despicable acts do not go unpunished.\n  But let me be clear about what we know. America is the greatest \ndemocracy and force for freedom the world has ever known. All of \nAmerica will stand together to make sure that we rebuild and that we \nfight back, and that Americans continue to enjoy the freedoms and \nliberty that are the hallmark of this great country of ours.\n  Perhaps of even greater importance, we must guarantee that no such \nact of terrorism ever revisits our Nation's shores. Future generations \nof Americans must never again feel the profound pain and grief that we \nfeel today from Nevada to New York and back.\n  As we mourn the loss of our fellow Americans, we must focus on the \ntask ahead. Yesterday's barbaric attacks against the United States were \nnot just acts of terror; they were acts of war perpetrated by the \nuncivilized.\n  And in the war against those who would use terror to attack innocent \ncivilians, our democratic values and our freedom, the United States--as \nthe leader of the free world and its only remaining superpower--should \nbe prepared to use every diplomatic, economic, and military means at \nour disposal to defend ourselves and to defeat these forces of evil.\n  Of course, we should deploy our best diplomatic efforts to engage our \nfriends and allies around the world in this war against international \nterrorism. Of course we should do that.\n  I personally appreciate, as I think our Nation should, and does, the \nsupport immediately expressed yesterday by President Putin and the \nRussian people.\n  As our allies around the world look to us for leadership and \nprotection, we must call upon all nations to provide their friendship \nand support in this critical time of need. However, while diplomacy \nwill play a central role in this war against terrorism, we must deploy \nthe full economic and military might of the United States against those \nwho threaten our citizens, our national security interests, our \ndemocracy, and our freedom.\n  As I supported President George Herbert Walker Bush 10 years ago in \nhis decision to use the overwhelming military force of the United \nStates in the Persian Gulf war, I stand with President George W. Bush \nin his commitment to use every means at our disposal to exterminate the \nperpetrators of yesterday's acts of terror and war. Those who kill \ninnocent Americans must be held accountable. And make no mistake about \nit, they will be. Moreover, I stand firmly with the President on this \ncrucial point: Those who aid and harbor perpetrators of terror must \nalso be held accountable. Make no mistake about that, they will be.\n  While I can assure the American people that we will hunt down those \nbarbarians who committed yesterday's acts of terrorism, we must also \nact to prevent these types of attacks from occurring in the \nfuture. International terrorism is perhaps the greatest modern threat \nto our national security interests. We must be prepared to act \naccordingly.\n\n  General Holland, the U.S. Air Force Commander in Chief of the Special \nOperations Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida, directs our \ncounterterrorism efforts on behalf of the U.S. military. He has no \ncivilian counterpart. We need to establish one.\n  The successful fight against terrorism is one that will require the \nhighest level of diplomatic skill in gathering intelligence, as well as \nthe most effective use for economic and military strength. However, \nwhen diplomacy fails, as regrettably it does on occasion, we must be \nprepared to employ alternatives. Terrorists, especially those who have \nthe capability to plan and execute the kinds of attacks we witnessed \ngraphically yesterday, require a significant level of financing and \nprotection. We should be prepared to use alternatives such as economic \nsanctions to deter and prevent nations, organizations, and individuals \nfrom aiding and abetting those who engage in terrorism.\n  When diplomacy and economic sanctions fail, as they do on occasion, \nour resolve to fight terrorism must not waiver. We must use military \nforce in the war against terrorism--and not just in response to \nterrorism but also to prevent future attacks.\n  Our friends, but more importantly our enemies, will judge us either \nby our strength and resolve to fight international terrorism or by any \nperceived weakness and complacency.\n  I assure the American people as well as our friends and allies \nthroughout the world, we as a nation are ready for this challenge. I \nmake it clear to enemies, to anyone who would consider bringing harm \nupon Americans, our democratic values, and our freedom, that we are \nstrong, we are resolved, and we will prevail.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am advised that the assistant \nRepublican leader would prefer to speak later in the day. I ask \nunanimous consent all remarks be limited to no longer than 10 minutes \nin order to accommodate as many Senators as possible. I earlier asked \nif we could alternate between the two caucuses. I also request of the \nRepublican leader that we alternate now among the four Senators from \nthe two States that are most affected by the horrendous tragedy \nyesterday, beginning, of course, with Senator Schumer and Senator \nWarner.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I seek the recognition of the Chair to note \nthat if I have to leave the floor, Senator Gregg will manage the time \non our side.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the order, the senior Senator from \nNew York, Mr. Schumer, is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I very much appreciate, first, the \nhundreds of expressions of the Members of this body and the heartfelt \nexpressions of\n\n[[Page S9286]]\n\ngrief to New Yorkers during our time of grief and our sadness. We need \nto move forward.\n  When something this cataclysmic occurs, one's mind works at many, \nmany different levels. It is very difficult to come to grips with such \nan intense and terrible tragedy, but we must; we have to. We seek as \nguidance the generations before us who had their tragedies, they who \nrose to the occasion. We must, as well.\n  There are many different levels of this tragedy. I will discuss four: \nthe individual level, the level as a New Yorker, the level as an \nAmerican, and the level of the world.\n  As an individual, our first thought goes to all who grieve. Last \nnight in my city and State, there were thousands of dinner tables with \na missing person. There were thousands of families waiting for that \nphone call, dialing their phones endlessly to try to find a loved one. \nI know a little bit of the angst they went through. I was in the gym \nwhen this occurred, getting ready to address the Supreme Court. I saw \nthe picture of the first damage to the World Trade Center. At first, I \nsaid what most said: This must have been an accident, a little \npropeller plane that accidentally ran into the World Trade Center.\n  But the fire looked too large. Then we saw the second plane crash. \nImmediately, it hit me: My daughter attends high school within the \nshadow of the World Trade Center. Most of the pictures of the \nconflagration show her high school in the background. I reached my wife \nand for 2 hours we were in virtual panic, trying to locate her to see \nhow she was. Then, praise God, she called and we were relieved. Those 2 \nhours of pure misery are now being experienced tenfold, a hundredfold, \na thousandfold by all of the families in New York and in Washington and \nin Boston and in California who have lost loved ones to this dastardly \nand disgusting act.\n\n  So we first think as individuals how this has affected the lives of \nall of us. Everyone in New York right now knows somebody who is \nmissing. I know someone on the 104th floor who worked for the good firm \nof Cantor Fitzgerald. We can't find hardly anybody from that firm. He \ncalled his parents, told them he loved them, and they haven't heard \nfrom him since.\n  On television yesterday was the search of a mother and two daughters \nfor their father and husband who worked in the World Trade Center \nrestaurant. I have two daughters about the same age. We saw those \nlittle girls. There was almost nothing you could say. I have \nsubsequently been told they found their father. Let us hope and pray \nthat the others find their fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, \nfriends. Let us hope and pray that this tragedy, which is already the \nlargest tragedy we have experienced since World War II, is as minimal \nas possible. But our hearts go out to all of those who are suffering \nnow. We are with them from one end of this country to the other.\n  Our city is a beautiful city. We have been bringing in people from \nall over the world for 300 years. In one generation we change them into \nAmericans, and they sally forth around the country, adding vim and \nvigor and new ideas. That function of New York will never die. We are \nan international city and we love being an international city. We New \nYorkers feel the loss of life as a whole, as a city.\n  Out my window in Brooklyn, the dominant scene, after the Statue of \nLiberty looking over the harbor, are the two towers. Not seeing them \nanymore, I feel violated. I feel that some horrible person has come in \nand taken something away from all of us as a city. But we will survive \nand we will prevail. We are New Yorkers. The diligent firefighters and \npolice officers, many of whom have now passed, run ``to'' tragedy, not \naway from it; their job is to save.\n  It was told to me by many people that the lines to give blood went \naround block after block. People were waiting at 9 o'clock, at \nmidnight, at 3 in the morning, standing in line because they knew blood \nwas needed. This morning I am happy to tell my colleagues that the \ncrisis, at least in terms of blood donation, is over. We do have enough \nblood.\n  I was told of the story of the merchant whose store was on the path \nfrom the World Trade Center North. He owned a shoe store. He stood \noutside and gave the fleeing women sneakers, just handing out sneakers, \ntennis shoes. He knew they couldn't run in their high heels. That is a \nNew Yorker; and there are millions of us.\n  We are going to need your help. It has already been offered. I was \ngratified when the President called me yesterday afternoon and said \nthis Nation will do anything it takes to help New York recover. I was \ngratified when just about every Member came over to me and to Hillary \nand offered us the help that we will need. We need help immediately.\n  The FEMA Director, I believe, will be flying with us to New York \nearly this afternoon to try to give help in terms of survival, in terms \nof the immediate rescue. We will need lots of help after that. We have \nsuffered a huge, huge loss. Our financial industries have to recover, \nthe lifeblood of the Nation and the world. I appreciate the offers. We \nwill be counting on everyone here and in the other body and the White \nHouse.\n  As an American, make no mistake about it, we did wake up in a new \nworld in America. It is a new era. Since World War II, we had the cold \nwar. We had a brief respite, for 5, 7, 10 years. But we are now in a \nnew era. There are forces against us, and they are in many corners of \nthe world. They hate us for our freedom. They are against the very \nprogress that we have made. They want to turn the clock all the way \nback to the Middle Ages. In the past, there have always been backward \nforces. But technology has given this group the power to affect our \nlives in ways we never before imagined.\n  Yes, this was a 21st century Pearl Harbor but a little different \nbecause they aimed at civilians, as they know our military is too \nstrong. They are ultimately cowards and bullies. It is not a nation \nthat does this, but it affects us. I say three things in that regard.\n  First, we are a resilient nation. We don't take anything on our \nknees. We will not take this. I assure the enemies of America, the \nenemies of freedom, the enemies of progress, of that.\n  Second, we must keep our freedoms as we do this. To constrict \nourselves would give them the victory. And we must keep them.\n  Third, I say this to all Americans: let us not respond in a way that \nis unseemly of America. There are millions of Muslims and Arab \nAmericans in America. They have different views than I do on the Middle \nEast, staunchly different views. But they were not for this. Let us go \nafter those who advocate terrorism and destruction but not after a \nwhole people or nationality or religion. We have to avoid that. That is \nthe American thing to do.\n  Finally, thinking as a world citizen, we are in a new world, \ninterconnected but often nasty. Technology that has given us so much in \nthe last 20 years has given this small group, these small groups, the \nability to cause huge, huge damage. As with Pearl Harbor, we are \naffected directly. Unlike Pearl Harbor, there is no name or ZIP Code or \naddress.\n  But the one common thread is this: If we stay as resolute as we did \nafter Pearl Harbor, we will win this war. We can and we will, if we \nkeep our resoluteness. As somebody involved in antiterrorism, I have \nseen us go through paroxysms after each incident--3 months, 6 months of \nattention and then business as usual. We cannot go back to business as \nusual. We will not win this war against those who seek to destroy our \nvery way of life in a day or in a month or even a year. It is going to \ntake several. If we are resolute, we will succeed.\n  They have their weaknesses and their pressure points. I was glad the \nPresident said we will not only go after the terrorists but those who \nharbor terrorists. This could not have been done without some help from \ncountries. There are countries that aid terrorists. We know who they \nare. They are on the terrorist list. They should not remain immune from \nwhat happened. In fact, they are the weak pressure point of the groups \nthat seek to hurt us and destroy us.\n  Some of these awful people who did this yesterday knew how to fly \n757s. There was no 757 in the mountains of Afghanistan. How did they \nget access to learn to do this? These are the kinds of questions we \nhave to ask in the next weeks and months ahead, if we do find, as all \nfingers seem to point, that is from where it came.\n\n[[Page S9287]]\n\n  We have to do one other thing. We have to have our European allies \nknow that this finger is not just pointed at us but at them. This idea \nthat for temporary economic advantage they can continue to have strong \neconomic relations with countries that help and abet and harbor \nterrorists must go out the window.\n  I was proud to speak to the President yesterday. I assured him \nsomething, and I think I speak for all of us: partisanship. Divisions \nare out the window. He will be our leader. He will come up with a plan. \nWe will have advice and offer suggestions. But once that plan is \narrived at, we will unite.\n  This is a long struggle. It is not an easy struggle. But because of \nour freedom, because of our American way of life, we will prevail.\n  In conclusion, this event will never leave us the same, not as \nindividuals, not as New Yorkers, not as Americans, not as residents of \nthe planet earth. But we can learn from it as we grieve. We can meet \nthe challenge and rise to the next level of civilization. I am \nconfident we will.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the order previously entered, the \nsenior Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, is recognized for not to \nexceed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and commend our \nleadership. I want to pick up on the note of our distinguished \ncolleague from New York. We will never be the same as a nation. That is \ntrue. We will be a better nation. We will be a stronger nation, as we \nstep up to meet this challenge. Yesterday our great Nation, our people, \nsuffered in a single day its greatest tragedy of a single day. \nImmediately thereafter, this Nation, arm in arm, embarked on what I \nthink history will reflect is its finest hour--hours yesterday, today, \nand tomorrow, into the future.\n  Our Nation from coast to coast locked arms, irrespective of our \nbackgrounds, our cultures, our faiths, our beliefs--indeed, our \ndifferences. We locked arms, united as a nation behind our President, \nbehind our Government, putting full faith in our Government to lead us \nin this crisis.\n  I pray that our President, our Congress, the Governors of the States, \nright on down to the city councils, the police, the firemen who are \nworking today, seize this opportunity and make our Nation even stronger \nand greater.\n  Our challenge here in our legislature, working with the President and \nothers, will be to devise, yes, a strengthened security system in every \nwalk of life for America, regrettably, every walk of life, with \nemphasis this morning on airports. But those of us who have worked in \nthe area of terrorism know that airports, yes, are vulnerable, but \nthere are many other areas in which we are vulnerable.\n  I am proud that the Senate Armed Services Committee, working with the \nother committees of this body, 3 years ago, when I was privileged to be \nchairman, instituted a special subcommittee solely dealing with those \nthreats that are emerging against the United States of America. We have \ndone a lot of work in this Congress. We have done our best to legislate \nand put our funds behind us. But now let us seize this opportunity to \nindeed make this Nation stronger.\n  Each of us will forever remember yesterday, where we were, what we \ndid. Those of us who convened here yesterday morning then went to our \nstaffs. I commend the leadership of the Congress, indeed, the police \nand others who had an orderly evacuation. I then called the Secretary \nof Defense, Don Rumsfeld and asked what could I do as the ranking \nmember of the committee to show my full support for the men and women \nof the Armed Forces and the uniformed as well as the civilians. He \nsaid: John, come over.\n  I called my colleague, the chairman, Senator Levin. We joined and \nwent over and stayed the better part of 3 hours which I will never \nforget. The Secretary had us in the room, the chairman and I, the Joint \nChiefs, the other staff. We watched the operations. The President \ncalled in. I watched the Secretary and the President. The Secretary \nhanded me the phone and said: The President wishes to speak to you.\n  America will be proud of the manner in which our command and control \nof our military and indeed the executive branch functioned to address \nthis crisis. That chapter will be written.\n  I said to my friend, the Secretary: I want very much, as a Senator \nfrom Virginia, to go and look at that area of the building that was \nstruck.\n  He said: Of course. I will escort you. And that he did for Senator \nLevin and I.\n\n  We went around that building, in which I spent over 5 years of the \nhappiest days of my life in the Navy's secretariat. We speculated as \nfar back as the late 1960s and 1970s how that building could be \nattacked. Yes, we thought of this scenario. But that is history.\n  There I saw that building and how that aircraft, Mr. President, was \nskillfully guided and piloted such as to penetrate that building \nthrough three or four of the rings. And as we are here today, the \ncasualties we know not in number, but what we do know and what I saw, \nas I sat there but a few feet from the building, all around me were \nvoluntary firemen, men and women, professional firemen and rescue men \nand women. Therein rests the greatness of our Nation as to how they \nresponded and what they were doing, unselfishly, risking their own \nlives. We saw some coming out filled with smoke and debris but doing \nwhat they could to help those trapped, dead or otherwise, in that \nbuilding.\n  Our colleagues from New York have most dramatically and \ncompassionately described what has occurred in their State. We grieve \nwith our citizens today who are suffering these losses, the dead, the \ninjured, and their families. But America remains unbowed.\n  America is stronger. America is united. And we the leadership have \nour greatest challenge in this hour.\n  Again, as we pursue the legislative challenge to balance the \nmagnificence of our Constitution, which has held us united--it remains \nthe oldest continuously performing Republic in the world today--and \nbalance the need of additional security against human rights, civil \nrights, and the rule of law, we will do it. Never before has our \nCongress been faced with a greater challenge to preserve one of the \ngreatest parts of this Nation, and yet address the future.\n  Just a personal note, I remember World War II. I was a youngster in \nthe early parts of it. My generation, at age 17, we all volunteered, in \nthe fall of 1944, 1945. I became a sailor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will proceed.\n  Mr. WARNER. I remember that period very well, how all Americans \nunited. My generation of 17 and 18, we were prepared to do our part in \nthe war. But I called my children yesterday and I said much has been \nsaid about the greatest generation, those who were privileged to serve \nin World War II, those who were here on the home front. This Nation \npulled together, met our adversaries and emerged stronger.\n  I said, we may be remembered as the greatest generation, but my \nchildren and your children will become the greater generation because \nthey will seize, with our leadership, the same challenge, the younger \ngeneration in America, and go beyond what we achieved in World War II. \nWe will relentlessly pursue the enemy wherever they are, and we will \ncarefully, under the rule of law, seek justice. We will prevail and \nbecome a stronger nation.\n  I thank this body for the privilege of addressing it and the Nation \ntoday.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I make a unanimous consent request before \nthe Senator from New York speaks.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nstand in recess between 12:30 p.m. and 1:45 p.m. today; that no \namendments or motions be in order with respect to the pending \nresolution; that at 1:45 p.m. today, the joint resolution be read a \nthird time, and the Senate vote without any intervening action or \ndebate on passage of the joint resolution; that upon the completion of \nthat vote, the Senate stand in recess until 3 p.m.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the several \nrequests?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object.\n\n[[Page S9288]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California reserves the \nright to object.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator, will \nwe have opportunities to continue the line of speakers who were lined \nup before the vote on the resolution?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from California that the leader, the two \nleaders have said that anyone who wants to speak on this resolution \nthroughout the day should be able to do so. There are some schedules \nthat have to be met, especially by the Senators from New York. They \nneed to return to their State. We need to get the vote out of the way. \nThere will be added opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the several \nrequests?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Further reserving the right to object, if I \nunderstand, then, the vote will be at 1:45, the Senate will go into \nrecess until 3, and then the floor will be open to continue; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is right.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the several \nrequests?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, could I ask the \nleadership, are we not, as a body, all 100 cosponsors? Has that \nparliamentary step been taken? If not, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers of this body be cosponsors of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from New York, the junior \nSenator, Mrs. Clinton, is recognized for not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleagues for \ntheir outpouring of support, their concerns, and their many offers of \nadditional aid that has come to the rescue of our people as a result of \nthis devastating tragedy.\n  Yesterday dawned a beautiful day in New York. My daughter told me it \nwas one of those days where the sky was totally clear, there was a \nbreeze, people were starting to line up at the polling places to vote \nbecause it was primary day, an election day, a continuation of the \ncommitment to democracy and self-government that has set us apart from \nevery society that has ever existed because of the longevity of our \ndemocracy and the will of our people to constantly renew themselves.\n  New Yorkers went from standing in line to vote to standing in line to \ndonate blood in just a few hours. I do not think any of us will ever \nget out of our minds the images we saw on television of the plane going \ninto the first tower, the plane going into the second tower, and the \nplane going into the Pentagon, but there were tens of thousands of our \nfellow Americans, people who live in New York, New Jersey, and \nConnecticut, people literally from every part of our country and, \nindeed, the world for whom this was not an event they watched in horror \non television but lived through and in too many instances did not \nsurvive.\n  We are beginning to find out what that was like. Chuck and I have a \nlot of friends who worked in those towers, who worked in the center, \nand worked nearby. We are hearing the stories of husbands and wives \ngrabbing cell phones and calling home to say: I love you; goodbye.\n  We know, and I assure every person in this body, in the House, and \nmany, many of our fellow citizens, when we finally know the names of \nthose killed and injured, they will know someone.\n  This was an attack on New York, but it was really an attack on \nAmerica. I have been very gratified, as I know that Chuck has and all \nof our colleagues in the House, by the strong support we have received \nfrom the President. I am very grateful. We have expressed our \nappreciation.\n  Chuck and I will be going to New York this afternoon with FEMA, and \nwe could not ask for more than we have received in the immediate \naftermath of this horrific attack.\n  We are by no means anywhere near the end of what it will take to \ncontinue the search and rescue efforts. We are finding people even as \nwe speak. Yet we know there is a very grim task ahead to do everything \nwe can to find every person, to account for every single person who \nwent to work. That is all they did. They went to work on a beautiful \nSeptember day in New York.\n  We will also stand united behind our President as he and his advisers \nplan the necessary actions to demonstrate America's resolve and \ncommitment, not only to seek out an exact punishment on the \nperpetrators but to make very clear that not only those who harbor \nterrorists but those who in any way give any aid or comfort whatsoever \nwill now face the wrath of our country.\n  I hope that message has gotten through to everywhere it needs to be \nheard: You are either with America in our time of need or you are not.\n  We also stand united behind our resolve, as this resolution so \nclearly states, to recover and rebuild in the aftermath of these tragic \nacts. New York was not an accidental choice for these mad men, these \nterrorists, these instruments of evil.\n  They deliberately chose to strike at a city which is a global city. \nIt is the city of the 21st century. It epitomizes who we are as \nAmericans. So this in a very real sense was an attack on America, on \nour values, on our power, on who we are as a people. I know, because I \nknow America, that America will stand behind New York, that America \nwill offer whatever resources, aid, comfort, or support that New \nYorkers and New York require because the greatest rebuke we can offer \nto those who attack our way of life is to demonstrate clearly we are \nnot cowed in any way whatsoever.\n\n  I hope that within a short period of time, I say to Senator Warner, \nwe see scaffolding on the side of the Pentagon. After we finish the \nsearch and rescue and recovery work that is being carried out \nheroically there, I hope we all see a clear signal that we are \nrebuilding, that our defenses are more resolute than ever.\n  I hope similarly that lower Manhattan has the same kind of image to \nproject because the reality will be that we are rebuilding and \nreconstructing and making clear that just as our military might is \nunchallenged and uncowed, so are our economic, our social, our \npolitical values epitomized by New York.\n  I have expressed my strong support for the President, not only as the \nSenator from New York but as someone who for 8 years had some sense of \nthe burdens and responsibilities that fall on the shoulders of the \nhuman being we make our President. It is an awesome and at oftentimes \nawful responsibility for any person. I know we are up to it, I know we \nare ready for it, and I know that everyone in this body represents \nevery American in making clear that we are united and stronger than \never.\n  It is with a heavy heart--really a sense of heartbreak--that I rise \ntoday in support of this resolution, but it is also with a great sense \nof pride, first in the people of New York who responded as New Yorkers \nalways do when times get tough. There was not a sense of panic. There \nwas order, and there was an immediate outpouring of help. Those men and \nwomen whom we sent in to rescue our fellow Americans--there is no way \nadequately to express our gratitude to our firefighters, our police \nofficers, our emergency personnel, our doctors and nurses and medical \npersonnel. They responded at the height of a tragic, unexpected attack \nwith the kind of grit and courage we expect from New Yorkers.\n  To all of those who are missing a loved one, there are no words any \nof us can express except to tell you in the clearest possible terms: We \nwill in a united American response support you, offer assistance to \nyou, stand with you, and pursue those who reached deep into your \nfamilies and homes yesterday and took someone you loved away from you.\n  There will be a lot of work ahead of us in this body and in the \nHouse, and we will pursue that. I am grateful for the support we have \nreceived. Thank you very much.\n  (Applause.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida).

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVirginia is recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, my fellow Members of the Senate, this is a \nvery sad day as we witness all of the implications and tragedies and \nlives lost from yesterday's dastardly terrorist attacks on the United \nStates.\n  Yesterday's attacks were attacks not just on the United States and \nour particular Commonwealth of Virginia or State of New York, it is an \nattack on freedom-loving people and everything we stand for as a unique \nand great nation.\n  On Monday afternoon, Senator Boxer and I were ready to introduce a \nresolution condemning the suicide bombings in the Middle East. We would \nhave introduced that resolution on Monday, but wanted to include \nanother clause recognizing the attacks in Israel on Sunday. We now see \nwith great shock and horror, that the United States is obviously not \nimpervious to these suicide bombings and such attacks.\n\n  What we need to do now is coalesce, coalesce as a people with our \nshared beliefs, coalesce to comfort those who have lost loved ones and \nthen also determine where we need to go to move forward to try to \nprevent such acts from occurring in the future. Our goal and focus \nright now must be on the rescue, hoping there are those who are still \nalive. Secondly, we need to find as many details and information as to \nhow our security was breached so as to hopefully prevent it in the \nfuture. And thirdly of course, hold those who are responsible \naccountable and bring them to justice.\n  We are hearing stories just in the first day of great heroes. Heroes \nin New York. People who knew that the building was going to collapse, \nbut nevertheless stayed there trying to usher people out. On C-SPAN \nthis morning, one of those who was just a volunteer helper knew what \nwas going on, where those who were emergency and federal FBI agents \nwere as well, knowing that the building was going to collapse, staying \nthere knowing those were the last minutes of their life trying to save \npeople.\n  The same was happening in Virginia where we have lost many lives, \nuntold numbers, as of yet, at the Pentagon as well as the passengers on \nflight 77 flying from Dulles, VA, that was hijacked and crashed into \nthe Pentagon.\n  There are great stories of bravery, with people going above and \nbeyond what is expected, and that should give us comfort as a nation. \nThis tragedy has affected many lives, and we still don't know how many \nlives. It will probably take a week if not weeks to determine how many \nlives have been lost. Even in the small neighborhood where we live, \nwhere my daughter goes to middle school, children were crying because \ntheir parents work at the Pentagon. Others work at Fort Belvoir and \nthere was worry that Fort Belvoir was being hit. There's only maybe a \ncouple of dozen houses in our development, but a youngster--who came by \nour house to get to know my children, his father was on Flight 77.\n  So, as the days go forward, we are all going to be learning these \nstories of innocent people whose lives have been lost and the families \nthat will forever be scarred with the loss of that loved one. Our \nthoughts and prayers must be with those families. Whether they're in \nNew York or people who are from Connecticut or New Jersey, people from \nVirginia, here in the D.C. area, I'm sure there are folks from Maryland \nand the District, clearly people from Massachusetts were on the \nhijacked flight from Boston. Clearly a lot of people from California, \nsince the destination of all of those flights was to be California.\n  This is truly a day that will live in infamy. History will record \nthese as the most violent, insane, cowardly acts that have ever been \nperpetrated on our homeland in the United States of America. We need to \nbe united, coalesced as Americans, but also with our allies in our \nresolve, our resolve to pursue these cowardly conspirators who \nperpetrated these murderous acts.\n  In our response to justice, we need to be sure, we need to be swift, \nand we need to be severe. In my view, we have allowed terrorism to go \non too long, thinking that we could be immune from it. But \nnevertheless, we need to recognize that we're going to have to wage \nwarfare.\n  These people have struck against the symbol of American strength and \npower. They are not, though, going to be able to weaken the will of the \npeople of the United States. We will stay united, defending our \ninterests and our principles. We will also stick together, not just as \nVirginians and New Yorkers, but as Americans aiding and helping the \nfamilies who have lost loved ones in whatever they can do.\n\n  The senior Senator from Virginia, John Warner, and I will work \ntogether to make sure that for those Federal employees that the \nGovernment is doing all they can as well as for the civilian employees. \nAnd it is not just as Virginians. I know that the Presiding Officer, \nsitting there from Florida, cares just as much as anybody else does.\n  And so we are all going to stick together in that regard. We do need \nto learn from this, though. And as we learn, we must make sure that as \nwe learn the facts, we do not allow these attacks to succeed in \ntempting us in any way to diminish what makes us a great nation. And \nwhat makes us a great nation is that this is a country that understands \nthat people have God-given rights and liberties. And we cannot--in our \nefforts to bring justice--diminish those liberties.\n  Clearly, this is not a simple, normal criminal case. This is an act \nof war, and those rules apply. But at home and domestically, we need to \nmake sure that we are not tempted to abrogate any civil rights such as \nhabeas corpus or protections against unreasonable searches and \nseizures, or the freedom of expression and peaceable assembly, freedom \nof religion. And just because somebody may come from an ethnic \nbackground, that means nothing. They are American citizens. And so \nlet's make sure that in our anger and in our efforts to bring justice, \nwe remember our basic foundational civil liberties and do not abrogate \nthem.\n  We are a nation of laws, of good-hearted people, of loving people. \nAnd so I would say in closing, Mr. President, let's make sure we pray \nfor and comfort those who have lost loved ones.\n  Let's get the facts, move swiftly and properly. But most importantly, \nas Americans, let's stay strong. Let's stay resolved, and let's keep \nmoving forward. Because, indeed, all the world is watching, not just \nthe Senate; they are watching the United States and Americans. What \nwill their response be? Let's keep moving forward. We are the beacon \nfor freedom-loving people in the world, sticking together we will \npersevere. We will bring justice. And we will come out safer and \nstronger in the end.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware, the manager of the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 10 minutes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I cannot think of any other legislative \nbody in the world where we would hear the speech we just heard by the \njunior Senator from Virginia, where his heart is aching, many in his \nconstituency have died. Part of the building in his State is still \nburning.\n  In the ultimate American way, he called at the end of his speech for \nnot abrogating the basic cherished liberties that this Nation has. I \ndoubt whether one would hear that in any other assembly in the world \nafter such an attack, and I compliment him for it.\n  My heart and my sympathy go out to our colleagues from New York and \nVirginia in particular, but all those who\n\n[[Page S9290]]\n\nhave had their fellow citizens and their constituents victimized by \nthis act. This is a time to mourn but not to despair, a time for \nresolve but not remorse, a time for sober investigation and not \nrecrimination, and a time to unite, not to debate.\n  Some have said yesterday and today that all has changed, all has \nchanged for America. I know what they mean by that, and I respect their \nview, but I pray that is not true. I pray that is not true. I pray my \njunior colleague from Virginia is correct when he says the one thing we \ncannot allow to change is the values upon which this country is built, \nfor if that were to occur, then they would be able to declare victory, \ngenuine victory.\n  I predict one thing has changed, though. I respectfully suggest the \nway of life of present and future terrorists has changed forever. The \nfuture of organized terrorist cells is about to welcome the 21st \nCentury in a way they never anticipated, for in this dastardly act they \nmay have done what no other group of people could possibly have done, \nand that is to unite the civilized world, unite our allies in Europe \nwho share our values, unite our Russian friends, our Chinese friends, \nunite the world, because that image of that plane smashing into the \nsecond tower has reverberated around the world and every leader in \nevery country can picture the same thing happening in their nation.\n  I recently visited China with three of my colleagues. They have \nbuildings in China as tall or taller than the World Trade Center. I can \npicture the President of China sitting there envisioning the same thing \nhappening. So I do not think all of a sudden there has been a \nconversion of democratic zeal on the part of those who are not often \nthought of as our allies to resolve with us to fight worldwide \nterrorism, but it is a reflection of the reality that the world has \nchanged in a way that we all are vulnerable.\n  A further reality is that no one could have undertaken this very well \nplanned, and regrettably well executed, terrorist act without an \nextensive network, without a place in which to plan it that was within \nearshot and eyesight of some country, without some people who, by their \ninaction at a minimum and their complicity, allowed this to occur. \nThere will be very few places to hide, I predict, from this moment on, \nfor these are not the acts of a single man or a single woman. They are \nand they were and they will, if they try again, have to be well \nplanned, well funded, and widely supported by dozens upon dozens of \nindividuals and individual leaders.\n  In speaking to the President, the Secretary of State, and other \nleaders in the administration, they are impressed by what they believe \nto be the heartfelt, sincere, and resolute offers of support to deal \nwith terrorism that not only come from expected quarters such as \nEngland, France, Germany, Italy, and our European allies but from \nunexpected quarters.\n  The word should go out to those who pretend they wish to be our \nfriends that they are going to have to make some very difficult \nchoices. Pakistan in particular is going to have to make a very \ndifficult choice, very soon, for we are counting. We are counting and \nwe are looking. Words will not be sufficient. Actions will be demanded.\n  All of us say we will never let this happen again. Well, the act of a \nsingle individual strapping explosives to their body is probably \nsomething no one can ever guarantee will not happen, but dealing with \nwell organized, well-funded, well-coordinated, massive actions is \nsomething that can be done only in a multilateral way, only \ninternationally.\n  No matter what we do, if we fail to lead the world in a multilateral \nunity of absolute resolve, I say to you, sadly, that this could happen \nagain. But I am convinced it will not.\n  Today, as it has for 212 years, the U.S. Congress has convened. Two \nmiles down Pennsylvania Avenue, President Bush sits in the Oval Office \nleading the executive branch and the country in a wide-ranging \ninvestigation to find those who committed these barbarous acts. Around \nthis city and around New York, dedicated public servants are back at \ntheir desks in Federal office buildings doing the people's business. \nNew York--the city that never sleeps--has worked around the clock in \nsearch of survivors, and they will find some. Around the Nation, \ncitizens of every age, every race, and every religion grieve for their \nfellow citizens. But they stand united. They stand united in support of \nour Nation, which has endured over two centuries against all enemies, \nforeign and domestic. They stand united in readiness to answer the call \nfor their fellow neighbors. As Senator Clinton and Senator Schumer \npointed out, they lined the blocks in New York City to give blood. I \nwould be dumbfounded if you did not see black faces, Asian faces, \nHispanic, every race, and every religion standing in that line. They \nstand united in support of the President of the United States, as do \nall of us here in the Senate.\n  Much will be said today and in the days ahead about the appropriate \nresponses to these heinous acts. But for now let me just say this. This \nis not a struggle over ideology. This is not a struggle over religion. \nThis is a struggle between civilization and barbarity.\n  Let there be no doubt that the United States and civilized nations of \nthe world will unite and win this struggle. Our enemies will not, and \ncan not, defeat us. This country will go on, deeply wounded by the loss \nof so many but strengthened by our resolve and our commitment to \nsustain this great democracy.\n  I see in this cataclysmic tragedy the beginning of the end of \norganized and legitimized terrorist activities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire, the Republican \nmanager of the resolution, is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Santorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware. I \nwant to say to the Senator from Delaware, those are very eloquent and \nappropriate and I think appropriately forceful remarks. I am in \nagreement with every word he said. I think you are going to see today \nthe U.S. Senate in agreement. Everyone is standing up in support of \neach other and in support of the President and the people. We are here \nfor them. We are meeting today. We are meeting for them. I think it is \nan important sign that this beacon of freedom is open and that the U.S. \nSenate, the greatest deliberative body in the world, is meeting, \ntalking, and I hope acting today, tomorrow, and for the weeks and \nmonths to come this year.\n  My wife, Karen, and I, and our whole family, watched television \nyesterday, just in amazement, in grief, in sorrow, and in tears. We \nwent to church and prayed. We didn't know what else to do but go to \nchurch and pray that somehow and in some way people would survive this \nhorrible tragedy.\n  It has been a very difficult time for a lot of us. It has been a \nhorrible time for the people of New York and the people in northern \nVirginia.\n  We are committed, as you heard the President say today, to do \neverything we can here in Washington, DC, to help those who are \nstruggling and to support those who are doing heroic things in \nPennsylvania trying to recover what is left of the plane that crashed \nin Pennsylvania. And of course in New York as well, there are \nincredible stories of heroism, and at the Pentagon in northern \nVirginia. Our sympathies and our support go out to all of those men and \nwomen and their families.\n\n  I think it is important for us to know, as the Senator from Delaware \nsaid, that things should not change here in America. I could not agree \nwith him more. Things must not change with respect to our freedom and \nour democracy. But there are certain things that must change. I think \nthe Senator from Delaware hit the nail on the head when he said that \nour actions towards terrorists must change.\n  What happened yesterday was not merely a hijacking of a domestic \nairline flight. What happened yesterday was an enemy missile loaded \nwith explosives--11,000 gallons of jet fuel--that exploded into targets \nhere in the United States of America. It was an act of war. It was an \nenemy missile that was directed at our country. We must respond \naccordingly to this act of war--to those who perpetrated it. We are at \nwar with terrorists and with those nations that harbor them, that \nfinance them, and that in any way encourage and support them. I think \nit is important that we say so here in the\n\n[[Page S9291]]\n\nUnited States Senate, at some point, that this is war with the forces \nof evil that attacked this country.\n  This is not--and I can't stress this more strongly--a time merely to \nbring people to justice. It is a time to wage war and win a war against \nthose who committed this act, and against those who harbor those who \ncommitted this act, and against those who support and encourage those \nwho committed this act.\n  In the U.S. Senate, there are things we can do, sensible things we \ncan do, to support our President and to support the American people.\n  First, as I mentioned before, we can support the American people \nright now with the resources they need to try to find survivors and \nrepair the damage that was caused in this country.\n  Second, we need to bring up the Defense authorization bill and the \nDefense appropriations bill right now. We need to make sure we have the \nnecessary tools in place to be able to defend our country. We need to \nlook at the intelligence and counterintelligence operations of this \ncountry and determine soon whether we should enhance that capability, \nwhich is obviously insufficient. We here in the United States Senate \nmust do something about it. We must do something about it now. It is \nimportant for us to come together at a time of national crisis and \nemergency, when our country is threatened, to pass the necessary bills \nfor our Government to fight the war in which it will be engaged during \nthe coming weeks, months--and maybe longer.\n  We need to make sure we have the diplomatic representation to \nrepresent us, as the Senator from Delaware said, and I agree with him \n100 percent, we need to form an international coalition. We need a U.N. \nAmbassador. We do not have an Ambassador to the United Nations. I \ncannot think of a more important time since the U.N. was created that \nwe need an Ambassador to the United Nations. And we don't have one. \nThat nomination is sitting in the Foreign Relations Committee. I hope \nwe can get that nomination to the floor as quickly as possible so we \ncan begin the very important work the Senator from Delaware has laid \nout in building a coalition necessary to fight this terrible scourge \nthat has attacked this country.\n  Finally, we need to do something about our energy needs. Members have \ntold me about places in America where they were charging $3 to $5 a \ngallon for gasoline yesterday. Yes. Energy will be a very important \nissue for this country, and very soon. We need to consider this bill. \nParticularly if we are engaged in fighting terrorism around the world, \nwe need to have more domestic security. We need domestic energy \nsecurity.\n  These are the kinds of things I hope we in the Senate can join \ntogether to pass measures that are important and to prepare ourselves \nfor the war ahead. This is a time for us to begin to put the building \nblocks in place so we can engage in a war against those who attacked \nthis country. I am hopeful, in fact I am confident, that we can do so \nin a bipartisan way, in a way that will lend great honor and \ncredibility to this great institution.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n  I want to begin by thanking my colleague from Delaware for not only \nhis managing this resolution but also for his eloquent remarks a few \nmoments ago.\n  I also commend the distinguished majority leader, Senator Daschle, \nand the distinguished minority leader, Senator Lott, and their \nrespective leadership teams for the dignity and manner in which they \nconducted business in this body yesterday. I also commend the President \nof the United States for his very eloquent remarks last evening to the \nNation.\n  I commend Don Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense for his efforts \nyesterday and for staying on the job while the Pentagon was burning. I \nknow there were probably those on his staff and elsewhere who urged him \nto leave. I presume they made a good case for it. But I admire the fact \nthat Don Rumsfeld stayed on the job yesterday to be with the men and \nwomen who were there--the injured, those who lost their lives, not to \nmention those who are fighting the blaze and trying to bring that \nincredible scene under control.\n  This is a very sad time. It has been said by others here this \nmorning, and it will be said repeatedly this afternoon. There are no \nwords I can utter in these next few moments that will serve to lessen \nthe sense of loss that all of us feel as Americans. There is a sense of \npoignancy to all of this, obviously, if you are from New York. If you \nhad a loved one who worked at the Pentagon, there is a special \ndimension. And, if you had a loved one on one of the four aircraft \nyesterday that left Newark, Boston, or Dulles there is a special hurt \ntoday. Truly, there is a human dimension to this that we don't have the \nability to understand yet.\n  It is a God-given blessing during moments such as this that human \nbeings are incapable of fully understanding and appreciating the depth \nof loss immediately. It will take days--or longer.\n  Oftentimes what we see with families when a person very close to them \nis lost, is that in the immediate hours and days after that loss, they \nfunction because they have to in order to manage affairs. But the true \nimpact of loss is sometimes not felt for days and weeks afterwards. I \nthink our country is in that state this very day.\n  So, I want to take a few minutes to talk about that human dimension. \nThere will be plenty of time for us to debate bills on the floor of the \nSenate and to discuss the priorities we ought to have and who should be \nheld responsible. But the human dimension of all of this is something I \nhaven't been able to get my hands around in these last 24 hours. I just \ncan't imagine what it must be like to be one of the victims of these \nterrorist acts, or to know that there is a loved one trapped somewhere \nin those buildings in lower Manhattan, or to be the family of a service \nman or woman who knows that just a few blocks from here their husband, \nwife, father, sibling, child, or neighbor is lying in the rubble of the \nPentagon, or to be the family of one of the passengers on the planes \nhijacked yesterday. I can't begin to imagine.\n  I want to start by telling those families that every one of us here \nin Congress wishes there were some way we could express our sense of \ngrief for you. In the days and weeks to come we will try to do that in \nways that are meaningful.\n  I would also like to mention the firemen and policemen. We were told \nlast evening that we don't know what the numbers of emergency personnel \nlost are. There may be several hundreds who lost their lives as they \nraced into those 110-storey buildings while trying to bring relief to \nothers only to lose their lives in the collapse of those buildings.\n  Again, for those of you who watched the tragedy last year in Wooster, \nMA, or other places where firemen and emergency services people have \ngiven their lives, I suppose in one sense it is not a surprise that the \ndedication we saw yesterday is seen so frequently around the country, \nbut particularly because of the magnitude of the events yesterday, we \nare struck by it. And as Senator Biden, Senator Schumer, Senator \nClinton, and Senator Warner mentioned in their very fine remarks this \nmorning, the people who donated blood and who are offering services \ndeserve our respect and admiration. So I express my gratitude to all of \nthem.\n\n  We have to respond to yesterday's events, and we will. I have no \ndoubt of this. However, building the kind of international cooperation \nnecessary to do so is awfully difficult. Indeed, if there is a slight \nglimmer of a silver lining to this tragedy, it may be in the responses \nour President received yesterday from almost every civilized head of \nstate around the globe--responses of support. Maybe in all of this \ntragedy and rubble, the possibility that the kind of response the world \nhas been seeking for so many years may emerge like a phoenix from these \nashes, and we will be able to forge the kinds of relationships that \nallow us to stamp out this cancer that has been with us for far too \nmany years in Beirut, in the Marine barracks in Saudi Arabia, and other \nplaces. I saw the list of victims of past terrorist attacks the other \nday. It\n\n[[Page S9292]]\n\nis many pages long--not of the magnitude we saw yesterday, but \nnonetheless, cumulatively hundreds and thousands of people lost their \nlives at the hands of fanatics who believe the loss of innocent life is \na justifiable means to achieve their extreme ends.\n  So maybe--just maybe--if there is any solace we can offer to the \nfamilies of the people who have lost their lives, out of this we will \nbegin to deal effectively with the scourge of terrorism. I hope that is \nthe case. I hope the President will work on that, and I know we here in \nCongress will. It will be important that in the context of being in a \nrush to respond to this--and there is a passion we all feel that makes \none want to strike out and grab somebody and make them pay for what \nthey did that we temper our anger. I hope we have enough sense now to \nknow that when we strike, it needs to be right because the coalition \nthat we need to build to respond to this requires that we act smartly, \nintelligently, and correctly. If we don't, we run the risk of \nfracturing the very kind of coalition that will be necessary.\n  These terrorists had a remarkable success yesterday. They utilized \nAmerican planes and American fuel to use as their bombs. That they went \ninto three major airports, 15 or 20 people, I am told, in teams of 3 or \n5, and commandeered 4 aircraft and attacked 2 major sites, economically \nand militarily, and apparently had a target of a third, politically, is \na stunning, stunning set of circumstances. We need to get some answers. \nToday may not be the day to get them, but I know my colleagues and \nmillions of Americans have questions on their minds. People will have \nto answer how this could occur in the country.\n  Yet, I come back to the notion of the human element of all of this, \nand the human element also requires that I speak to those who are \nMuslims in our country. There has been a lot of chatter over the last \n24 hours of who is responsible here--Islamic fundamentalists, Islamic \nextremists? I don't know if that is right or wrong. I am not privy to \nthat information. But I urge those who want to provide answers to this \nquestion to be careful. You only had to listen to the words of Dan \nInouye to understand why we should not vilify all members of an ethnic \ngroup for the sins of a few individuals. You only need to walk a block \naway from here to a monument commemorating the imprisonment of \nthousands of people of Japanese descent 60 years ago. We have wonderful \ncitizens here who are Muslims and practice the Islamic faith. I fear \nthat sometimes in our momentary passions we can indict some wonderful \nAmericans, wonderful people, innocent children in this country who were \nraised in a very proud and serious religion. So we need to be cautious \nabout the rhetoric we use and the fingers we point before we have the \nfacts before us.\n\n  Lastly, I say this. I see my friend and colleague from Texas on the \nfloor. On Monday afternoon about 4 o'clock I got a call from a former \ncolleague of ours, Bob Kerrey. He called me from a delivery room in New \nYork to tell me that an hour and a half earlier he became the proud \nfather of a young man named Henry. My colleague from Texas and her \nwonderful husband have taken on a magnificent responsibility--recently \nadopting the great love of their lives, Bailey Hutchison. I am going to \nleave here momentarily and go with my wife to Arlington to see her \ndoctor. We are expecting a new arrival. I can't tell you how proud I am \nof that blessed event.\n  I want to end on this note and say to young Henry and to Bailey and \nto my yet unborn child that we are going to build a world for you that \nis deserving of the kind of place you ought to have. Previous \ngenerations did it for us. Certainly, those of our colleagues who \nserved in World War II, Vietnam, Korea, made it possible for us to live \nin a land of peace and democracy. Our responsibility is no less to \nfuture generations. The words ``an act of war'' have been used. I agree \nwith that. We need to respond to this and to build the kind of society \nto sustain our democratic values, which we have embraced for more than \n200 years, through trials and tribulations. To Henry, Bailey, and to \nthis yet unborn child of mine, we commit to you that you will live in a \npeaceful world. That is our common goal. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized up to 10 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I cannot think of a more appropriate \nway to end a speech than the ending that was just given by the Senator \nfrom Connecticut--talking about my daughter, talking about his future \ndaughter or son, talking about our former colleague Bob Kerrey's new \nson.\n  Every time we reflect upon World War I or World War II or the Korean \nWar or Vietnam or Desert Storm, I am reminded that it is our \nresponsibility to keep the zeal for freedom alive, which was paid for \nby the blood of so many. I certainly will be committed, along with \nSenator Dodd and everyone in the Senate, to making sure that my \ndaughter, Bailey, has the opportunity to live in the same wonderful \ncountry that I have been able to grow up in and love.\n  In the coming days and weeks, we are going to be talking about \nspecifics on how we deal with this tragedy. In fact, there are some \nthings coming out now to show that we are acting decisively. I was very \nproud of the President in giving the order immediately to shut down air \ntraffic in New York, and then throughout America, within minutes of the \nsecond terrorist act on the World Trade Center it was then clear that \nit was terrorism. We shut down every airport and grounded every plane \nin America. I believe that was exactly the right thing to do and it was \nonly the first response.\n  Today, the FAA issued an order banning all knives from air crafts \nbrought on by passengers or in carry-on luggage. It used to be you \ncould take a knife on an airplane that was shorter than 4 inches, like \nthe kind many people carry on keyrings. That will no longer be allowed. \nI am glad the FAA took that immediate action because we know from early \nreports that those were the weapons used by these terrorists. The FAA \nhas also ended curbside baggage checks. Everything they are doing is \nright for our country right now.\n\n  Later this week I am going to introduce legislation to reinstitute \nthe random sky marshal program. Reinstitution of this program will have \nU.S. law enforcement personnel randomly assigned to flights to help \nensure our safety. These are some of the many things we will address.\n  I was talking to Senator Warner and Senator Allen this morning about \nlegislation that would allow the vesting for retirement purposes of \nmilitary personnel who have died in the line of duty such as the many \nvictims at the Pentagon yesterday.\n  I think their surviving spouse should receive survivors retirement \nbenefits commensurate with the number of years they have served, which \nis not presently the law. Senator Warner is going to push that bill \nthrough the Armed Services Committee because of his great leadership \nposition and because his constituents are so affected.\n  Many people are in dire straits right now, not knowing what their \nfuture is because of the number of people we lost yesterday serving our \ncountry in the Pentagon. We are going to see some measures coming \nforward in the next few days and weeks and months to try to address the \nmany issues that are now occurring because of yesterday's tragedy.\n  Today, however, is more of a solemn moment. It is a moment of horror, \na moment of grief, a moment of tragedy, and a moment for reflection. It \nis a moment which really can't be described, but we all understand \nbecause we feel.\n  It was once said that ``democracy is based upon the conviction that \nthere are extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people.'' We saw that \nyesterday--for evil and for good.\n  Yesterday's attack stunned our Nation, shocked a people, and \ndestroyed lives and buildings. The blasts and collapse were felt across \nour Nation, both physically and emotionally. But they did not destroy \nour spirit, they did not destroy our faith, and they will never destroy \nour belief in freedom.\n  Yesterday was filled with images of horror and unspeakable evil, but \nalso of the American spirit, as individuals and a nation rose to the \noccasion, met the crisis head on, came together to rescue fellow \ncitizens, and also to show\n\n[[Page S9293]]\n\na united front to those who are trying to intimidate us.\n  Ronald Reagan once said, ``No crisis is beyond the capacity of our \npeople to solve; no challenge too great.'' We are proving that to be \ntrue. Already we are being touched and inspired by the actions of \nordinary people rising to the extraordinary circumstances and proving \nthat they are heroes.\n  To those who did this and to those who support them: No, we will \nnever give up. We will never back down. And we will never let anyone \ndestroy our spirit. Freedom is too great--protecting freedom transcends \nall other of our duties.\n  That is why we, the Congress, present to you to the Nation and to the \nworld a united front. A front united by grief, horror, and a firm \nresolve to do our job to provide for the common defense. It is our \nconstitutional obligation, but it is also our personal determination.\n  As we, the Members of Congress, stood on the Capitol steps last \nnight, my colleagues and I were of one mind and one heart. We will \nremain so.\n\n  Just one person started singing ``God Bless America,'' and every \nMember of Congress just joined in spontaneously.\n  We are one with those who are struggling desperately to survive, with \nthose fighting courageously to rescue others, with those waiting \nhopefully for news of loved ones--and with those committed to punish \nthose responsible.\n  This is not just an official resolve; it is also personal, and every \none of us is going to have a personal story.\n  Yesterday I spent hours on the telephone calling hospitals. Each one \nof my staff members had a different hospital to call every 30 minutes, \nlooking for the husband of one of my staffers whose office was located \nin the Pentagon at the exact impact point of the crash. He finally was \nable to get through to her, and he was OK. He was one of the lucky \nones.\n  But there were those who were not so lucky, such as my friend, whom I \nloved dearly, Barbara Olson; that courageous young woman who had so \nmuch spunk, who called her husband Ted from the airplane that hit the \nPentagon with a cell phone, and gave us our first indication of what \nwas happening and how this was unfolding.\n  Hope is the strength of an individual; it is the strength of a \nnation. Though nothing in our history compares to this horrifying \nevent, nothing in our character will let us lose hope or let us be \nconsumed by fear.\n  We are the very beacon of freedom for the entire world--and we will \nnot let cowards extinguish that light. Through the darkness, through \nthe debris, through the clouds of dust, that light still shines, and \nfrom it, freedom and hope will continue to reign across the world.\n  I thank the Chair and yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I yield to Senator Dorgan, who is next on \nour list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I listened to my colleague from Texas \nand I share her sentiments. There are unique moments in history, that \nare too often born of tragedy, when Americans stand together with a \nrelentless determination to combat the forces of evil, and to reaffirm \nthat our freedom is secure. This, regrettably, is one of those moments.\n  Cowards struck innocent men, women, and children yesterday, but \nreally all of America was their target. It was clearly an act of war, \ncommitted by madmen, directed against our country.\n  Our hearts are broken, but our spirit is not. And the world should \nknow that we will not give in to terrorists.\n  Last evening, when I drove home from the Capitol at about 11 in the \nevening, clouds of black and gray smoke billowed from the Pentagon \nwhere one of those acts of terrorism occurred. This morning, when I \ncome back to the Capitol at about 7 a.m., smoke still rose from the \nashes of the Pentagon.\n  Only F-16s and F-15s flew over our country's capital and in the \nairspace above New York City.\n  All of America is affected by this deed in a very dramatic way--from \nyoung folks to old folks.\n  Last evening, when I arrived home at about 11 o'clock, my 14-year-old \nson heard the door close, got out of bed, and came up to me and said: \nDad, what happened? Who did this?\n  I told my son--and all of us in Congress will tell America--that we \nwill search for, find, and punish those responsible for these acts of \nterrorism. That is our pledge.\n  We must now wage war on terrorism. And we must ask all the other \ncountries in the world who believe in freedom as we do to join us in \nthis effort to eradicate terrorism.\n  Terrorist camps cannot be allowed to continue to train terrorists. \nCountries that harbor terrorist camps must, as the President said, pay \na price for harboring them. We must rededicate ourselves to those \ntasks.\n  Yesterday, I thought about the carnage that has occurred in our \ncountry, and the thousands of people who have undoubtedly lost their \nlives because of these acts of terrorism. It reminded me again of why \nour country has such an enormous burden of responsibility to lead the \nworld, and especially why we need to lead the world in combating the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in cutting the number of \nnuclear weapons, and in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  Yesterday it was a commercial airliner full of jet fuel. In the \nfuture it could be a vial of deadly biological agents that can kill a \nmillion people. Or it could be a suitcase nuclear device in the trunk \nof a rusty car parked on a dock in one of America's largest cities.\n  If ever we must understand our world leadership responsibility to \nstop the spread of nuclear and biological weapons, it is now.\n  Over a century ago, after the carnage of the Battle of Gettysburg, \nAbraham Lincoln said:\n\n       . . . we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have \n     died in vain--that this nation, under God, shall have a new \n     birth of freedom--and that government of the people, by the \n     people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\n\n  Today, in this time and in this place, we should let those words from \nnearly 140 years ago again inspire our nation's steely resolve that \nthose who died yesterday did not die in vain.\n  America's response to the deadly crime that took them from us will be \ndedicated to destroying the ability of terrorists to wage this kind of \nwar, and giving those who live a new birth of freedom from the fear and \nthe impact of terrorist acts.\n  Today the U.S. Congress says to those in New York, in Virginia at the \nPentagon, in Pennsylvania, and all around America--those who lost their \nlives, those who loved them, their relatives, their friends--You are \nnot alone. Our country grieves with you. And our country reaches out to \nyou. You are not alone.\n  Finally, Madam President, Shakespeare wrote:\n\n       Grief hath changed me since you saw me last.\n\n  We are all changed. Yesterday changed all of us. Our world has \nchanged since yesterday. We all carry the heavy burden of grief, and we \nall carry the responsibility today to ensure that our response is \nswift, severe, and just. And we all carry the opportunity today to hold \nhigh the torch of freedom, and to say to the world: Yes, America's \nheart is broken, but America's spirit will not bend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I yield to Senator Specter and will \nreclaim my 10 minutes after him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nNorth Carolina for yielding.\n  Madam President, today's resolution speaks in the strongest terms \ncondemning yesterday's cowardly act of terrorism. Tomorrow, we must do \nmore to bring the perpetrators to justice and take steps to see to it \nthat such terrorism never occurs again.\n  While there have been many public comments pointing to the so called \nsignature of Osama (aka ``Usama'') bin Laden as to yesterday's \nterrorist attacks, we cannot, consistent with our values, make any \njudgments until we know more. But what we do know is that Osama bin \nLaden has been at war with the United States since 1989. We know that \nin indictments returned by the United States District Court for\n\n[[Page S9294]]\n\nthe Southern District of New York, going back to 1998 when Osama bin \nLaden and his coconspirators in al Qaeda were indicted for killing 18 \nU.S. soldiers and wounding 73 others in Mogadishu in 1993. So Osama bin \nLaden has been at war with the United States for a long time.\n  We know further that Osama bin Laden was indicted again by the United \nStates District Court for the Southern District of New York in 1998 for \nthe attacks on U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, where at least 213 \npeople were killed, and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where 11 people \nwere killed.\n  Prior to 1986, the United States did not have jurisdiction to try \nterrorists in U.S. courts for acts committed overseas. But following \nthe murders of many people, including U.S. citizens in the Rome and \nVienna airports in December of 1985, I introduced legislation which \nbecame the Terrorist Prosecution Act of 1986, an act providing for the \ndeath penalty for anyone who assaulted, maimed, or murdered a U.S. \ncitizen anywhere in the world, which provided the legal nexus for \ntrying these defendants in a U.S. court.\n  Now, as a result of that legislation, these indictments have been \nbrought against Osama bin Laden and his terrorist group known as al \nQaeda.\n  For a fuller understanding of the way bin Laden has waged war against \nthe United States, I ask unanimous consent that the pertinent excerpts \nof these very lengthy indictments be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, there have been many declarations that \nwhat occurred yesterday with the trade towers and the Pentagon were \nacts of war. And there is no doubt about that. Similarly, what bin \nLaden did in Mogadishu in 1993 and in the Embassies in 1998 were acts \nof war. At this time, while the Congress should never act \nprecipitously, I do suggest that consideration be given to a \ndeclaration of war against the political entity which harbors and has \ngiven aid and assistance to bin Laden's terrorist organization and bin \nLaden and his coconspirators, based on the indictments which already \nhave been handed down, to which I have referred.\n  I do not propose to decide this issue today, but I do think it is \nimportant that research and factual analysis should begin.\n  More needs to be done than the resolution of today, which is very \nimportant, on condemnation of the terrorism of yesterday and the \nexpressions of sympathy to the victims and their families, those who \nwere on the planes, the passengers and the crew, and those in the \nPentagon and the trade towers. But where we do know, without prejudging \nyesterday's events, that bin Laden's terrorist organization has been \nindicted for acts of terrorism, murdering U.S. soldiers, blowing up our \nEmbassies, it is time to act.\n  Bin Laden is at war with the United States. It is time that we \nreciprocate.\n  There is a legal issue as to the status of the Taliban in \nAfghanistan, which we do not recognize as the government. The Taliban, \nhowever, control some 90 percent of the territory. For purposes of a \ndeclaration of war and for taking action, there is, in my legal \njudgment, a sufficient nation-state entity so that we can act and we \nshould not be prohibited from acting because there is no so-called true \nnation-state there at the present time.\n  While on a vastly different scale, when I was district attorney of \nPhiladelphia and we had outstanding indictments, a warrant of arrest \nwould be issued. We hunted down indictees. We brought them to court, we \ntried them, we convicted them, and we punished them.\n  The United States of America has the authority, from the indictments \nwhich have been handed down and the statement of our extraterritorial \njurisdiction in the Terrorist Prosecution Act of 1986, to take the \nsteps which are necessary to bring bin Laden and his coconspirators to \njustice. We have the capacity, we have the capability, the military \nstrength, to do what is necessary.\n  When demands have been made on the Taliban for the surrender of bin \nLaden and the Taliban or Afghanistan--or whatever entity we choose to \ndenominate it as being--declines on the grounds that bin Laden is a \nguest, and yesterday there was a news conference where someone from the \nTaliban appeared on international television trying to defend the \nTaliban's position, it is time we act. Where we have faced the \nextraordinary wounds from yesterday, and they may or may not be a \ncontinuation of bin Laden's past attacks--time will tell--but in \naccordance with our values on the presumption of innocence and not \nrushing to judgment, we will await further developments as we find out \nwhat the facts are and who the perpetrators were yesterday, even though \nthey do bear the so-called signature of bin Laden. But for the acts in \n1993 in Mogadishu, for the attacks in 1998 on our Embassies in Tanzania \nand Nairobi, Kenya, there is no doubt that we have the authority to \nact.\n  That is why I think with these outstanding indictments, which have \npinpointed the evidence as to Osama bin Laden, that consideration \nshould be given to responding to acts of war against the United States \nwith the appropriate counterattack, to see to it that we take into \ncustody bin Laden, bring him to the United States for trial, for \nconviction, and the potential of execution in accordance with the death \npenalty which is provided by U.S. law.\n  I again thank my colleague from North Carolina. I thank the Chair and \nyield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n [United States District Court, Southern District of New York, 98 Cr.]\n\n   United States of America v.

At all relevant times from in or about 1989 until the \n     date of the filing of this Indictment, an international \n     terrorist group existed which was dedicated to opposing non-\n     Islamic governments with force and violence. This \n     organization grew out of the ``mekhtab al khidemat'' (the \n     ``Services Office'') organization which had maintained (and \n     continues to maintain) offices in various parts of the world, \n     including Afghanistan, Pakistan (particularly in Peshawar) \n     and the United States, particularly at the Alkifah Refugee \n     Center in Brooklyn. From in or about 1989 until the present, \n     the group called itself ``Al Qaeda'' (``the Base''). From \n     1989 until in or about 1991, the group was headquartered in \n     Afghanistan and Peshawar, Pakistan. In or about 1992, the \n     leadership of Al Qaeda, including its ``emir'' (or prince) \n     USAMA BIN LADEN, the defendant, an its military command \n     relocated to the\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     of Al Qaeda that the United States forces stationed in the \n     Horn of Africa, including Somalia, should be attacked;\n       k. Beginning in or about early spring 1993, Al Qaeda \n     members began to provide training and assistance to Somali \n     tribes opposed to the United Nations' intervention in \n     Somalia;\n       l. On October 3 and 4, 1993, members of Al Qaeda \n     participated with Somali tribesmen in an attack on United \n     States military personnel serving in Somalia as part of \n     Operation Restore Hope, which attack killed a total of 18 \n     United States soldiers and wounded 73 others in Mogadishu;\n       m. On two occasions in the period from in or about 1992 \n     until in or about 1995, Co-conspirator helped transport \n     weapons and explosives from Khartoum to Port Sudan for \n     transshipment to the Saudi Arabian peninsula;\n       n. At various times from at least as early as 1993, USAMA \n     BIN LADEN and others known and unknown, made efforts to \n     obtain the components of nuclear weapons;\n       o. At various times from at least as early as 1993, USAMA \n     BIN LADEN and others known and unknown, made efforts to \n     produce chemical weapons;\n       p. On or about August 23, 1996, USAMA BIN LADEN signed and \n     issued a Declaration of Jihad entitled ``Message from Usamah \n     Bin-Muhammad Bin-Laden to His Muslim Brothers in the Whole \n     World and Especially in the Arabian Peninsula: Declaration of \n     Jihad Against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two \n     Holy Mosques; Expel the Heretics from the Arabian Peninsula'' \n     (hereafter the ``Declaration of Jihad'') from the Hindu Kush \n     mountains in Afghanistan.

The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield to the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I applaud the Senators from Delaware and \nNorth Carolina for leading the debate on this resolution and, of \ncourse, our leaders, Senator Daschle and Senator Lott, for bringing \nthis resolution before the Senate.\n  Most Senators will speak on the floor about yesterday's tragedy. It \nperhaps is impossible for the men and women of this body to say all the \nthings that can be said and should be said. The 100 of us, though, are \ngiven the duty and the honor to speak for over 260 million Americans. I \nknow in my case my wife Marcelle and I, like all Vermonters, pray for \nthe victims of these heinous\n\n[[Page S9297]]\n\nacts. We also pray for their loved ones who remain behind.\n  The heart of every American aches for those who died or have been \ninjured. Think how the families and friends feel. I know that in my own \nState, the head of the Roman Catholic diocese, Bishop Angell, has been \nleading his congregation in prayer while his heart aches knowing that \nhis brother and his sister-in-law died on one of the hijacked planes. \nCan you imagine the grief?\n  All day yesterday, last night and this morning, I have heard from my \nfellow Vermonters by phone and by Internet. I hear from my friends and \nmembers of my staff of the losses they have suffered of family and \nfriends. I think of my own children, each one of whom were trying to \ncall Washington yesterday when all the phones were jammed, to find out \nwhere their mother and I were. You can replicate that for hundreds of \nthousands of people around the country.\n  We have tried to answer those calls. We have tried to get the answers \nfor them and so often the answers are terrible ones.\n  I listened to the news a little after 5 this morning. I heard the \nname of a friend of mine who went into the World Trade building to help \nwith the rescue and the building came down--and he died with hundreds \nof New York firefighters, police and FMS personnel.\n  I have said for so many years that in a democracy like ours, \nterrorism should not be our Achilles heel. It is clear that now more \nthan ever we have to concentrate on the terrorist threat.\n  I applaud the Democratic and the Republican leaders of the House and \nSenate for bringing us back into session today.\n  As our Capitol was evacuated yesterday, as I stood out here on the \nplaza and saw people coming out of our buildings, I said: Lord, let us \nget back in there as soon as possible for if we let terrorism shut down \nour democracy, then terrorism wins. We had to say to the American \npeople that we were here today, including our loyal and brave staff.\n  I was proud to be in my seat representing Vermont when we opened the \nSenate and this building today. We know that quite possibly this \nbuilding was the target of the plane that crashed, but we know that \nthis building must be opened because the people's business is done \nhere. No country, and no terrorist, no matter how evil, no matter how \ntwisted, no matter how diabolic can close the symbols of U.S. democracy \nor what we do. Just as the brave men and women of our Armed Forces will \nnot stop because of this dastardly attack on the Pentagon. And, just as \nthe people in New York City who make up the fiber of ingenuity, \ninnovation, economics, and learning in our country. The rest of the \ncountry will pick up the torch.\n  Franklin Roosevelt called December 7, 1941, the day Pearl Harbor was \nattacked, ``a date which will live in infamy.'' Almost 60 years later, \nAmericans face such another day and challenge to our democracy. Just as \nthe people of this country became united in World War II, we must unite \nagainst the cowardice of evil and terrorism. As our leaders said this \nmorning: We stand here not as Republicans or Democrats, we stand \ntogether.\n  We will be supportive of our President, our institutions and of each \nother because a challenge to our freedom is going to be answered by the \nstrength of our democracy. Trial by fire can refine us or it can \ncoarsen us. If we hold to our ideals, then it strengthens us. Our \npeople, our values, our institutions are strong. President Roosevelt \nspoke of the arsenal of democracy. That arsenal--our ideals, our \nvalues, our freedom, our community, our humanity--sustains us and \npropels us forward. As much as our military weaponry these ideals are \nthe arsenal of democracy.\n  Let nobody outside our shores have any question about this: Americans \nare united. All the free world, all civilized nations, all caring \npeople will join together at this difficult time. It has meant so much \nto hear the calls from around the world.\n  Our values, our resolve, our commitment, our sense of community will \nserve us well. I am confident that, as a nation, we will seek and serve \njustice. Our Nation, my neighbors and friends in Vermont demand no \nless, but we must not let the terrorists win. If we abandon our \ndemocracy to battle them, they win. If we forget our role as the \nworld's leader to defeat them, they win. And we will win. We will \nmaintain our democracy, and with justice, we will use our strength.\n  We will not lose our commitment to the rule of law, no matter how \nmuch the provocation, because that rule of law has protected us \nthroughout the centuries. It has created our democracy. It has made us \nwhat we are in history. We are a just and good nation. We will remain a \njust and good nation, but we are a nation capable of a terrible fury, \nand our enemies must know that. Madam President, our enemies will know \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I yield myself 10 minutes, and I ask \nunanimous consent that I be permitted to deliver my remarks seated at \nmy desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I have counted the number of today's U.S. \nSenators who were around on December 7, 1941. There are not many of us. \nMany present members of the Senate were not born. The Honorable Strom \nThurmond was indeed around, and bless his heart, I am so pleased the \nable senior Senator from South Carolina is still here and active.\n  I remember that Sunday on December 7, 1941, when we came out of \nchurch and heard the news about the bombing of Pearl Harbor. As one of \nthe staff editors of the afternoon 6-day-a-week newspaper in Raleigh, \nNC, we prevailed upon the then publisher of The Raleigh Times to \npublish an ``extra''--and it was the last ``extra\" newspaper published \nin the State of North Carolina, to my knowledge. I recall that we sold \napproximately 12,000, which pleased the management of the newspaper.\n  After the paper was put to bed, I walked up the street to the Raleigh \npost office and into the Navy recruiting station to volunteer. I did \npretty well, but was turned down because of my hearing in my left ear. \nI recall my disappointment. But over in the corner was a regular Navy \nchief petty officer. Mr. President, I have never met a chief petty \nofficer of the regular Navy who didn't talk out of one side of his \nmouth.\n  He said: ``Hey, boy, come over here.''\n  I went.\n  He said: ``You want to get in this man's Navy?''\n  I said: ``Yes, sir.''\n  He said: ``I have some friends in BUPERS.'' I did not know what \nBUPERS was, but I later found it was Bureau of Naval Personnel in \nWashington. I thought he was pulling my leg, but it turned out that he \nwas not, because about 2 months later, I received a waiver; I was sworn \ninto the Navy and went to San Diego for 2 or 3 months' boot camp.\n  Which is beside the point, except to say that the recruiting station \nthat Sunday afternoon, December 7, 1941, was filled with young men, all \nwanting to defend their country. A lot of them did not know where Pearl \nHarbor was or what Pearl Harbor was, but they came anyhow because they \nrealized that their country had been attacked unfairly.\n  Mr. President, that is the reason we won the war; that was a time \nwhen the accepted and effective policy of the United States of America \nwas to seek out and find and, when necessary, destroy the leaders of \nforces resorting to violent harm to the American people.\n  That policy was in effect, as I say, on December 7, but in the years \nfollowing, some in political circles decided to substitute only a vague \nwarning to those making threats by crashing airliners loaded with \ninnocent Americans.\n  Mr. President, I was encouraged to hear the President of the United \nStates last evening and again this morning say, in effect, we are going \nto get them; they are not going to get by with it. That was the \nattitude in 1941 when Franklin Roosevelt--and I am the only one present \nin this Chamber at the moment who heard FDR say ``this is a day that \nwill live in infamy.''\n  Well, Mr. President, yesterday was another day that must live in \ninfamy. Not since the war of 1812 has the city of Washington been \nattacked by a hostile adversary. The attack on Pearl Harbor, of course, \nmatched yesterday's cowardly actions in both surprise and\n\n[[Page S9298]]\n\nswiftness that occurred yesterday. The losses are perhaps more enormous \nyesterday; in number in terms of innocent lives, than those \nastronomical numbers in 1941 at Pearl Harbor.\n  The policy I have just mentioned--of going after adversaries of the \nUnited States of America--was in effect on December 7, but somewhere \nalong the line it began to dissipate after World War II. The mind-set \nin some political circles gradually was substituted for a two-fisted \nwarning to the mean, cruel terrorists who made their threats yesterday \nby crashing airliners loaded with innocent Americans into public \nbuildings in New York City and Washington.\n  That was the kind of terrorists who created that disaster yesterday; \nI hope I will live to see the day when it will once again be the \nunmistakable policy of the United States of America to search for and \nfind that kind of sneaky slimy terrorist who created this morning's \nheadlines by crashing those airplanes and creating destruction and \ndisaster and bloodshed and loss of lives.\n  Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison mentioned the young lady who called her \nhusband from one of the planes on her cell phone. All of us had seen \nher many times on television and enjoyed her talent--and she will be \nmissed. But I hope Americans will again be two-fisted, standing \ntogether.\n  President Bush laid down the bill of particulars, and I believe he is \ngoing to say let us get back in the game and punish these cruel \nterrorists.\n  I intend to do my best as a United States Senator to encourage and \nsupplement such a revival of a policy that once protected the lives and \nproperty of innocent American people. FDR was right, December 7, 1941, \nwas a day of infamy, and yesterday, September 11, 2001, was also a day \nof infamy.\n  We must stand together and vote together and never be deterred in our \nefforts to put an end to this sort of thing, wherever it happens around \nthis world.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I say to my colleague from North \nCarolina, we have on our side 10 minutes now, but one of our colleagues \nhas to go to California and one up to New Jersey because of so many \nfolks involved in the Trade Tower. If they can split their 10 minutes, \nwill it be all right to have them go in succession? I spoke with the \nSenator from Mississippi about this.\n  Mr. HELMS. That is fine.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I understand the Senator from Mississippi has a statement \nhe wishes to make first.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I thank the Senator for yielding to me. \nThe resolution before the Senate should be considered by those who have \nplanned and perpetrated the heinous attacks in New York City and \nWashington as more than a warning. It is a promise that will be kept.\n  We pledge today our whole hearted support for President Bush and his \ncommitment to hunt down those responsible for these atrocities and to \npunish them in a way that is commensurate with their horrible acts.\n  At the same time we are committing ourselves to provide the resources \nour government and our President may need as Commander in Chief to wage \na war to eradicate terrorism. I am pleased the Senate is united in this \nresolve to help ensure that we will do all we are able to do to ensure \nthese tragedies are never repeated.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Madam President, I yield 5 minutes, or slightly more if he needs it, \nto the Senator from New Jersey. I thank him for accommodating the \nSenator from California as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I thank you for this opportunity to \nspeak. I am awestruck by the passion I feel among all of the Senators \nin this Chamber.\n  Today, America's people in the civilized world join hands and hearts \nto share our grief and our love and to steel our will. First for \nvictims, we share our grief. We share our love with the ones who are \nthe heroes of rescue, and we truly steel our will against the evil \nactors of terrorism.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, there are unknown numbers of families \nheartbroken with the horror of yesterday's tragedy. The personal \nfriendships and relationships affected in my own life are acutely \npainful. As do all of my colleagues, from the bottom of my heart I \nextend my deepest condolences to the families and friends of the \nvictims and to the courageous men and women whose life's work has been \nto protect us, to rescue us in time of need.\n  In this moment of grief, we must and we will stand together as \nfamilies, as communities, as one Nation.\n  Yesterday, America came under attack in a manner none of us thought \nimaginable. Our freedoms and liberties were challenged by cowardly, \nfaceless fanatics who thought nothing of killing innocent people, women \nand children, hard-working men and women who dedicated their lives to \nbelieving in the American promise, the American dream, the values that \nwe all cherish in a society.\n  In response to those attacks and this challenge, we need to be united \nin purpose to move swiftly, surely, thoughtfully, to uncompromising \njustice. I know we all recoil with horror as we think of those who died \nin the destruction of the World Trade Center. It was a true symbol of \nAmerica's financial and economic strength, just as certainly as the \nPentagon represents our military strength.\n\n  I worked for many years in that neighborhood I saw buried under the \nrubble yesterday. In fact, I commuted through that building for over 20 \nyears, and I fear for the many whose paths I crossed there because of \npotentially unspeakable horrors.\n  Equally shocking, it is just as difficult to imagine hijacked \nairliners being taken from Newark International Airport, where I have \ntraveled literally thousands of times. But these shocks and \ncircumstances which are not only personal to me but to everyone cannot \nallow us as a nation to weaken our resolve.\n  I boil with anger at what has occurred and share with my country men \nand women the belief that we will leave no stone unturned tracking down \nthose responsible for these acts. I, too, join in a chorus that says we \nmust hold all accountable, including those who harbor these criminals \nand give them aid and comfort. They have no clean hands.\n  Our Nation was born of strife and the horrors of war, but we built a \ncountry with the brick and mortar of freedom and democracy. That is \nwhat we have to defend. We have defended over the centuries the \nfundamental liberties that make us so strong and, as spoken about so \neloquently, including the rule of law. We have become the world's lone \nsuperpower, the world's beacon of freedom because of those bricks and \nmortar that built the American dream.\n  It is our responsibility at this moment in time to stand strong on \nthose principles. It motivates us and moves us to be ever vigilant, \nprotecting our security and freedoms. We fought too hard and, frankly, \nwe care too much. Millions of men and women have sacrificed their lives \nover time to secure those freedoms. Yesterday, others joined in that \nsacrifice. We honor them, but we must not be deterred. Our resolve must \nbe strengthened.\n  I want to make sure we do everything we can to bring those who are \nresponsible to justice, but we must be just as strong to make sure we \nrebuild and move forward in a sure and certain way.\n  I know one aspect of that in the financial world, and I am clear in \nmy own mind that we will not hesitate, that we will not step back and \nwe will marshal every resource to make sure things will move forward, \nand they will.\n  As we move forward from this tragedy, we must capture and hold those \nresponsible, but the positive is where our hearts must be. But we will \nnever forget.\n  Yesterday, Lady Liberty stood in our harbor, the New York/ New Jersey \nHarbor, and watched unspeakable horrors unfold, but today she stands \ntall. And so shall we, Madam President. I thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank my dear friend, my eloquent \nfriend, my chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, for this \nopportunity and for his eloquence, indeed,\n\n[[Page S9299]]\n\nhis vigilance on this topic. I am proud to be on his committee and to \nhead his Subcommittee on Terrorism.\n  Today, I rise with pain in my heart and great emotion to offer my \nprayers and my condolences for the people in this country who have been \ndirectly hit by an act of war, people of my State of my birth, New \nYork, looking at that skyline, the people who work at the Pentagon \nevery day, who have chosen to work to protect our Nation, and the \npeople of California who were on those planes that were hijacked and, \nof course, to every other individual who was directly affected, and all \nof us will have our stories.\n  I first thank the people of California for their outpouring of love \nand support for the people of this country. There were vigils, there \nwere prayer services in every denomination yesterday. There was an \noutpouring of people giving blood.\n  People did not know what to do. The L.A. County Search and Rescue \nTeam somehow got a plane at 4 a.m. They boarded on that plane and they \nare on the ground in Manhattan. Indeed, we are one country east coast \nto west, north to south. I have never seen such unity.\n  One of our colleagues said we remember where we were when tragedy hit \nthis country. In my lifetime, I remember too many things--not as many \nthings as perhaps Senators who are older, but I certainly remember \nwhere I was when I saw John Kennedy go down and Martin Luther King go \ndown, the Challenger disaster, and yesterday the image of our planes, \ncommercial American planes, four of them, going down crashing into \nbuildings, being used as lethal weapons against our people--an image \nthat has shaken us but has not shaken our resolve.\n  Once I was on a plane that was in some type of mechanical trouble. We \nhad to make an unscheduled landing. For an hour we really didn't know \nif we were going to make it. In that time, passengers were consoling \neach other and getting out their fears, attendants were reading the \ncrash landing manuals. I reached for the phone. I called my family. I \nleft a message. I thought: Did I tell them before how much they mean to \nme? All I could think of yesterday was about the people on those \nplanes, every one of whom had a family. Basically, as I understand it, \nthey knew they were going to go down, and in many cases, as I \nunderstand, were being told if they wanted to call their families, they \nwere crashing. The utter terror, the utter callousness of this, the \ninhumanity of this, is unbearable, what our people went through on \nthose planes and then those innocent people working in the Pentagon and \nthe World Trade Center.\n  I am going to make a very strong statement. When we look back into \nhistory and what happened in Bosnia, people suffered genocide because \nof their nationality, and to the Holocaust, people suffered \nannihilation because of their nationality. People were killed yesterday \nbecause they were Americans. People were killed not because they were \nbad people --they were good people--they were killed because they were \nAmericans.\n  It is time for us to say we will fight and stand up for them and \ntheir memories. We will take a stand against inhumanity that occurred \non our own soil. We are resolved to honor those who died. We are \nresolved to make our Nation as safe as it can be from those acts. We \nare resolved to hold those who planned these attacks and who harbor \nthese people absolutely 100-percent accountable. We will hold them \naccountable. They must pay because this is the test of a civilized \nnation. We lead the civilized nations of the world. We will not back \ndown.\n  I stand proudly with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and \nwith our President. We will be resolved to do everything--and do it \nwell and do it right--to bring justice in the world.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, we have a long list. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the next person on the list be Senator Kerry to speak for \n5 minutes and that we extend the recess for an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I was interested in the order.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The order after that is Hollings, Feinstein, Durbin, \nKennedy, Lieberman, Wyden, and Wellstone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague.\n  Madam President, never in the time I have been here--and perhaps in \nthe modern history of the Senate--has any of us come to the floor with \nsuch a weight as today, with our hearts literally heavy and aching with \nthe pain of what we have witnessed and what we know so many families \nare experiencing today, and also with a sense of outrage at the loss of \nevery innocent citizen and every single person who went to work \nexpecting a normal day, every police officer who put themselves into \nharm's way, every fireman who tried to save a life and lost their own, \nand at the astonishing number of their loss with the experience of a \nbreach in their special brotherhood and sisterhood that can never be \nhealed, the loss of emergency personnel. These losses are felt by all \nof us in a very special, personal, and searing way.\n  It is also fair to say that all of us have a deep feeling of outrage \nand resentment for the killing of our innocent citizens, for the attack \nagainst our country, for the fear and panic we saw in the faces and \nvoices of our people; children crying; parents, wives, brothers, sons, \nand daughters waiting for word.\n  Yesterday I was on the phone to the husband and daughter of a woman--\na friend--lost in the second flight to penetrate the World Trade \nCenter. The pain and depth of loss in their voices was excruciating. \nAnd the helplessness to do anything but to share that pain and offer \ncomfort brought an even deeper sense of anger and resolve for the acts \nthat occurred.\n  But it is also critical that all of us remember, as we talk about \nresponses, and war against terrorism, that our rhetoric be matched by \nour actions. If indeed there is a war against terrorism, I remind my \ncolleagues that in a war the first shots are never the last, the first \nstrike is never the worst.\n  What happened yesterday was terrible and horrendous, but we must \nprepare ourselves and steel ourselves for the possibility of worse \nuntil we achieve our goal. And to do that we have to be more prepared \nthan we are today, and we have to take the fight wherever we need to, \nand in ways that we are, frankly, not yet prepared.\n  I will say, from personal experience, when you are in a war, you do \nnot throw money at the enemy; it's bullets or other actions that are \nreal. We cannot guarantee that some fanatic is not going to find a way \nto upset civilized order. But we can guarantee that anyone facilitating \nor associated with such an act will pay the highest price.\n  There are few organizations that could achieve what happened \nyesterday. We know who they are. We know who supports them. We should \ndemand that those people cooperate with us in turning them over to us.\n  Finally, it is important for the world to see that we will go back \nimmediately to the business of a great democracy. We must--all of us--\nbe back at the work of our Nation. We must show that our effort to \nbuild a better country goes on, the mission of educating our children \nfor full citizenship goes on, the job of making our country stronger \ngoes on.\n\n  I believe one of the first things we should commit to as a country, \nwith Federal help, that underscores our Nation's purpose, is to rebuild \nthe towers of the World Trade Center and to show the world that we are \nnot afraid; we are defiant.\n  To those who might say, ``why create another target?'' The answer is \nsimple: If we are indeed at war with terrorism, there is no shortage of \ntargets in the United States. There is a White House, and a Capitol, \nand countless other tall buildings. This is not a question of targets; \nit is a question of strength and of our national resolve to stand up \nand show our strength. That is the best monument we could build to \nthose who died yesterday.\n  In Massachusetts, Madam President, we particularly grieve and feel \nthe full measure of what happened yesterday. Two of those flights came \nout of our airport. Many of those people on those\n\n[[Page S9300]]\n\nflights--the vast majority of them--came from our State.\n  So to all of those who currently await word or those who know because \nof the nature of the flights, we extend our deepest condolences and we \ngrieve together as citizens of Massachusetts and of this great country.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/12/senate-section/article/S9300-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, if I may respond, under the previous \nunanimous consent request, two of our Republican colleagues had sought \nrecognition and we had locked in time for those two speakers prior to \nthe time we recess. That will still be the order.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, we meet here today to express our \noutrage even though words cannot express the sorrow and anger that \nfills our hearts. But we must express these feelings--on behalf of the \nfamily and friends of thousands of innocent victims, many whose \nidentities we do not yet know--and on behalf of our entire nation.\n  Our young people must wonder why the United States who they are \ntaught is the beacon of hope and liberty for the world--why we of all \ncountries--should be the world's main target of such savagery.\n  I suggest it is because those teachings to our young people are true. \nIt is because our history and the principles on which our country was \nfounded go against the trend of thousands of years of human history. \nThousands of years of ``might makes right,'' of rulers and \ndictatorships of all shapes and forms, of religious intolerance and \nsubjugation. We have shown the world that it doesn't have to be that \nway. And today's tyrants and would-be tyrants cannot afford to let that \nexample stand.\n  But stand it will. If this giant, America, has been sleeping as some \nsay, it has been awakened once again and will not rest until an example \nis make of those who would murder our innocent citizens and tear at the \nvery fabric of our national existence. Part of a great nation's \nresponsibility for keeping peace in the world is the threat it must \npose to those who would upset that peace. Therefore, we must act as a \ndeterrent to outrageous activity when our interests are involved.\n  And America's response in this matter should set a lasting example of \nwhat happens to those who unleash bloody attacks especially on our own \nsoil.\n  The time for carefully measured pinprick responses to terrorists \nactivities has passed.\n  But we in this body and in the House do not have the luxury of simply \nexpressing our outrage demanding retribution. We, along with the \nPresident, set policy and we must quickly reconcile ourselves to some \nof things that we must do.\n  Since our victory in the cold war, we have become somewhat complacent \nin the notion that the most significant danger to our nation has \npassed. We see it in our military budget and we hear it in our \nrhetoric. We see it in our debates over which threat to our country is \nmost probable even though yesterday's events should remind us once\n\n[[Page S9301]]\n\nagain how faulty such predictions can be. We attempt to decide with \nprecision what the chances are of a missile attack by a rogue nation or \nby terrorists versus a suitcase bomb versus a biological attack versus \na cyber attack. Surely, we must now realize that as the world's number \none target, we must protect our citizens from all of these \npossibilities. While protection can never be complete, who is going to \ndecide which window of vulnerability we are going to allow to remain \nopen. The old Soviet threat has been replaced by new ones that are in \nmany ways more dangerous and more insidious. We have been warned about \nthis repeatedly--by the Hart-Rudman Commission, the Gilmore Commission, \nby the Bremer Commission, and by experts in numerous committee \nhearings. Surely, now we will listen. Surely now we will resist the \ntemptation to continue to squeeze out more ``peace dividends'' from the \ncold war which place our defense requirements in a secondary position \nto our domestic wish list.\n  And surely, we will reanalyze the wisdom of America contributing to \nthe proliferation of militarily useful technology simply because we \nwant the sales. It is my belief that this is what we did as late as \nlast week with the passage of the Export Administration Act.\n  If we place short term considerations, our desire for profit, or our \ndesire to maintain record high surpluses above our national security, \nwe will become much more vulnerable to the potential of experiencing \nother days like yesterday.\n  Historians tell us of another democracy which, after major military \nsuccess, cut its military budget, turned inward, and failed to react to \nprovocation in hopes of maintaining peace--a nation of leaders who \nfollowed the popular demand for more butter and fewer guns and who felt \nthat if worse came to worse technology could bail them out and that \ntreaties with dictators would substitute for defenses. That country was \nEngland after World War I and those policies contributed to causing the \nbiggest war in the history of the world. We must not make a similar \nmistake.\n  We cannot alter the past. But we can affect the future. I sincerely \nurge that we keep these things in mind as we consider our \nappropriations bills and especially as we consider what monies are \nnecessary to keep this country safe. It is not only the right and \nnecessary thing to do. It is the real tribute we can pay to our \ncitizens who have so recently paid such a dear price simply for being \nAmericans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, as some of my colleagues here today and \nso many Americans across our country, I rise to express great sorrow, \nand send our prayers to those who lost loved ones and who have been \ninjured. Unfortunately, in my own community right next door, the \ncopilot of the American Airlines Flight 11, Tom McGuinness, came from \nPortsmouth and leaves behind a 14-year-old son and a 16-year-old \ndaughter. One of the fire chiefs who went into the building to save \nlives, Jack Fanning, testified before our committee on the issue of \nterrorism just a few weeks ago. This touches all of us in \nextraordinarily personal ways, and it touches our Nation dramatically.\n  We wish to also congratulate and express great appreciation to those \npeople who are risking their lives to rescue the injured and the \nharmed--firefighters, policemen, the citizenry who are stepping forward \nduring this time of crisis.\n  There has been significant harm to our Nation. But we are a resilient \npeople and a resilient country, and we shall not allow these doers of \nevil, these perpetrators of such huge criminal activity to \nfundamentally harm our society.\n  The fact that we meet today and the fact that our Nation goes forward \nis a reflection of our strength and our commitment to maintaining the \nopenness and freedom that comes with the greatest democracy in the \nworld.\n  We stand here united and resolute that we shall not allow this \ndemocracy to be undermined by such horrific and criminal acts.\n  We as a Congress have recognized for a fair amount of time that \nterrorism is the threat which we as a nation see as most imminent. \nClearly, since the end of the cold war that has been true. We have \nattempted to address that threat. Obviously, in this instance we were \nnot successful. But I think it is important that we review where we are \nand what we need to do as we move forward because this is not the end, \nregrettably, of the issue. This is simply a sign of what our times are \ngoing to bring. We need to prepare, and we need to plan the battle \nlines.\n  The issue of terrorism and the confrontation of it basically divides \nitself into three categories. The first is maintaining adequate \nintelligence capability. The second is apprehension of people who would \ncommit terrorist acts. And the third is dealing with the events should \nthey occur, as they regrettably have in New York and here in \nWashington.\n  In hearing after hearing, we have heard regrettably that we were not \nready but that we were moving in the right direction. Unfortunately, it \nwas predicted that there would be a major terrorist event in this \nNation. In fact, at three different hearings that I know of when I was \nchairman of the appropriations subcommittee that has jurisdiction over \nthe Justice and State Departments, it was clearly stated by our \nintelligence community that they anticipated a significant terrorist \nact sometime in the future. No one was specific as to when. We now know \nwhen. It has occurred.\n  How do we prepare so it does not occur again or so we can mitigate \nthe damage?\n  First, our commitment to intelligence must be dramatically increased. \nDuring the 1980s and into the 1990s, we allowed our intelligence \ncommunity to basically atrophy in the area of human intelligence--\npeople on the ground.\n  We have electronic intelligence of immense capability. It needs to be \nimproved, especially in the area of encryption. But specifically, we \nneed more people involved in intelligence efforts. We have to, as a \nnation, recognize that this is, for all intents and purposes, a war, \nand that it is going to take soldiers, and that some of those soldiers \nare going to have to participate in counterintelligence activities that \nare covert and personal, something from which we have shied away as a \nsociety. We are going to need to commit significant resources to this.\n  In the area of apprehension, we need to get more coordination between \nour Nation and those other nations that should be helping us so that \nwhen individuals whom we know are threatening us or some other \ndemocratic government are on the move, when those individuals are \nplanning, we have the capacity to apprehend them. This means \nsignificantly increasing the efforts of the FBI in reaching across \ninternational boundaries, something our committee has tried to do, \nsomething to which former Director Freeh made a major commitment: the \nexpansion basically of the overseas activities of our premier and key \nlaw enforcement agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n  Most importantly, we need to get coordination within our own house, \nnot only in the area of apprehension but, even more importantly, in the \narea of response. We have watched what has happened in New York. We \ncongratulate the city of New York, the State of New York, and the \nFederal people who are on the ground. An extraordinary effort and a \nheroic and courageous effort has been undertaken.\n  The fact is that within our own Federal agencies we have considerable \noverlap, inconsistency, and lack of command and control.\n  Our committee has suggested, on innumerable occasions, that we \ncentralize control over counter terrorism activity and, specifically, \nresponse activity and consequence management, both in FEMA and in the \nAttorney General's office. We have to have budgetary line-item \noperational personnel control. There are 46 agencies in this Government \ntoday that have some level of responsibility to counter terrorism. The \noverlapping confusion of purpose is dramatic.\n  As the hearings showed--which I chaired, along with Senator Stevens \nand Senator Warner and Senator Shelby from the Intelligence Committee; \nthe first tripartite hearing of that nature, where we had every major\n\n[[Page S9302]]\n\nagency come before us to discuss their role--we saw that unquestionably \nthere is confusion.\n  This has to be sorted out. One way to sort it out we will have a \nchance to vote on tomorrow in the Commerce-State-Justice bill when we \napprove a Deputy Attorney General whose sole purpose will be the \ncoordination of counterterrorism activity across agency lines. That \nmust be done.\n  We were not fortunate, of course, but the fact that this occurred in \nNew York, a city that is extraordinarily well prepared, I am sure, \nsaved many lives. The next event we do not know where it will occur, \nand we need to be ready.\n  The last issue we must address is, who do we respond against? It is \nvery obvious that we are dealing with people who are fundamentally \nevil. We have, as a nation, confronted such people in the past, but \nthey have been sponsored by a nation, whether it was Adolf Hitler or \nthe forces of Japan during World War II. But today there is an \namorphousness to the threat which is hard to identify. The people who \nhave committed this act are, for most purposes, religious fanatics, it \nwould appear. They are driven by a cause for which they are willing to \ngive their life and take innocent lives in order to make their point. \nThat is a threat that is extraordinarily difficult to overcome.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. But we must be careful, as a nation, as we hunt these \npeople down--and we have to do that--and as we seek retribution against \nanyone who will have supported them, that we not cast our net so wide \nthat we catch nations which do not threaten us and people who are not \nour enemies.\n  We must be careful to use the rule of law so that we do not abandon \nwhat has made us great in order to confront this type of evil. We are a \nnation which is built on openness and law, and it would be a mistake if \nwe abandon it as we attempt to pursue these individuals.\n  No rock must be left unturned to find them; it is clear they live \nunder rocks. But in that process, let us not paint with a brush that \ncauses us to create enemies that do not exist today. Let us also not \nact in a way that creates martyrs of those people who would also act in \nthis way.\n  This is a time that will test America. America has been tested before \nand we have met it. We shall certainly be resilient in the face of this \ntest.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be allowed \nto proceed--the two of us--for 2 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, through our rage at the terrorist attacks \non our people and our free institutions shines a focused determination \nto recover our loved ones and friends who are still lost, and to assist \ntheir loved ones to cope with the devastating void into which they have \nbeen plunged.\n  Our fury at those who attack innocence is matched by our united \ndetermination to protect our citizens from more terror and by our \nresolve to track down, to root out, and to relentlessly pursue \nterrorists and those who would shelter or harbor them.\n  Last night, at the Pentagon, I joined Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, \nSenator Warner, and General Shelton in sharing that determination with \nthe American people. That resolve is reflected by the fact that the \nPentagon is functioning and the men and women who work there are \nassisting the heroic recovery efforts, although a few feet away loved \nones and friends are still missing or presumed to have been killed, and \nwhile the smoke of the savagery is still permeating the Pentagon.\n  The President, last night, spoke for all Americans and all civilized \npeople everywhere about his commitment to recover, to deter, and then \nto root out and destroy the terrorists.\n  Debate is an inherent part of democracy. And while our democratic \ninstitutions are stronger than any terrorist effort to shake them, in \none regard we operate differently in times of national emergency. We \nset aside our differences to join forces together, with decent people \neverywhere, to seek out and defeat a common enemy of the civilized \nworld.\n  Our unity is unshakable, and, God willing, we will persevere and \nprevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/12/senate-section/article/S9302-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma, the assistant Republican leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. Yesterday was a \ntragic day in U.S. history. It is a tragic day for people who love \nfreedom, who cherish freedom. Some may claim it was a victory for \nterrorism. I don't think so.\n  This act of terrorism has brought our country together in a way that \nwe haven't been able to do among ourselves. Yesterday I was with \nDemocrats and Republicans who said: We are going to be united against \nthis type of senseless violence. We are going to stand together and say \nit will not stand. It will not be successful.\n  I compliment President Bush and his Cabinet, not only for his speech \nlast night but also for the Cabinet he has assembled. He has assembled \na Cabinet of unequaled reputation, quality, who have proven themselves \nto meet the challenge in the past, whether we are talking about Vice \nPresident Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Colin Powell or Secretary of \nDefense Don Rumsfeld.\n  In witnessing the events yesterday, it took me back to the tragedy we \nsuffered 6 years ago in Oklahoma City where 168 people lost their lives \nto another act of terrorism. The most deadly act of terrorism in U.S. \nhistory happened in Oklahoma City that year on April 19. Until we saw \nit replaced by an even more horrendous act, an act that certainly was \ndesigned by people who wanted to do the maximum amount of deadly \noperations they could against the United States.\n  They will not be successful in any way, shape, or form. The United \nStates, under the leadership of President Bush and his administration \nand a united Congress, Democrats and Republicans, will stand up and say \nthat type of violence will not stand. It will be punished.\n  Our condolences go to the families, to the victims of this terror. It \ncomes home to all of us in different ways. The thousands of people who \nwere injured or lost their lives in the World Trade Center, the many \npeople in the Pentagon, the hundreds of people who were on the \nairplanes, those were husbands, mothers, fathers, wives, children, \ngrandparents. They disrupted thousands of lives. Those were friends.\n  I happen to have a friend who was on one of the planes: Barbara \nOlson. She worked for me for 2 or 3 years in the Senate as my general \ncounsel. Many people in the Senate got to know Barbara Olson. I got to \nknow her very well. I got to admire her, to respect her. She was an \noutstanding staff member and friend, a frequent visitor on the \ntelevision shows. I think many Americans, when they saw her face on CNN \nyesterday, realized this has an impact. This brings the real tragedy \nhome.\n  My prayers and condolences go to her husband and also my very dear \nfriend, Ted Olson, who happens to be Solicitor General of the United \nStates. What a tragic loss, the loss of life for Barbara Olson and the \ncountless others, thousands of people whose lives were destroyed or \nfamilies who were broken as a result of this terrorist activity.\n  We must act together. I am confident that we will. I am confident \nthat Congress will act and give the administration the tools necessary, \nboth legal and financial, to rebuild, to assist in fixing the damage. \nThrough FEMA and the capable leadership of Joe Allbaugh, I think we \nwill do that. I know that was important in my State of Oklahoma. I am \nsure we will do that both with the Pentagon and the World Trade Center.\n  It is also important that we stand together and confront terrorism. \nIt is important that we combat terrorism. In\n\n[[Page S9303]]\n\nsome cases in the past our rhetoric has maybe exceeded our success. I \ndon't believe we were successful in bringing the perpetrators of the \nbombings in Kenya and Tanzania to justice. I don't believe we were \nsuccessful in bringing the perpetrators of the Khobar Towers bombing to \njustice. I don't believe we have been successful as of yet in bringing \nthe perpetrators of the bombing of the USS Cole to justice and bringing \nthose people and/or possibly even countries to justice and who may have \nhelped finance and orchestrate and maybe even organize these terrorist \nactivities.\n\n  It is important that we do so, not just in rhetoric but in deed, not \njust today and not just in the next week but, frankly, on a continual \nbattle. We must, when we say this type of terrorism won't go \nunpunished, we must mean what we say. I feel confident with this \nPresident we will show the resolve. Our country will show the resolve. \nFreedom-loving people all across the world will show the resolve that \nthis will not go unpunished.\n  Yesterday was a very sad and tragic day in our U.S. history, a very \ntragic day, one that I believe our country will pull together and say: \nThis type of terrorism will not prevail. We have so many good people in \nthe United States, so many people who are coming together to assist the \nvictims, so many people who are coming together worldwide to assist to \nmake sure this type of tragedy will not go unpunished and also to \nalleviate the pain and suffering of the innocent victims in this \nterrible tragedy. My heart, my sympathy, my prayers go out to the \nvictims. Our resolve has never been stronger to stand together to fight \nthis type of terrorism.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. There is an order in effect now that each Senator will have \n10 minutes to speak. The way the day has been going, we have \napproximately 85 Senators still wishing to speak. If we use the 10 \nminutes each, we simply cannot finish and allow each Senator to speak. \nI have conferred with the minority and they are in agreement that each \nSenator should have 5 minutes, and we alternate back and forth. I \npropound a unanimous consent request that Senators be allowed to speak \nfor up to 5 minutes each rather than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield? I want to express on behalf of the \nmajority leader and minority leader appreciation for the cooperation. \nEveryone wants an opportunity to speak. But for this unanimous consent \nagreement, that would not be possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, as a Senator from Minnesota, I rise \nto thank the religious community, the faith community in my State--\nChristians, Jews, and Muslims--for coming together and for their \nprayers for all of the men, women, and children who were murdered in \nour country. That is the very best of Minnesota. That is the very best \nof our country.\n  Let me also thank and pray for all of the loved ones of our \nfirefighters and law enforcement community who have lost their lives in \ntrying to protect people and save people's lives.\n  I believe people in our country will come together and that one \nmessage for these terrorists who have committed this murder on a mass \nscale is that they will not change our values. They will not change our \nway of life. They will not change who we are as Americans. We will \nnever give way to the politics of hatred. We are a diverse people of \nmany different colors and religions and backgrounds. We will continue \nto respect and support one another.\n  President Bush is certainly right when he says we will leave no stone \nunturned in getting to the bottom of who committed this act of murder. \nAs a Senator, I certainly believe we must hold them accountable.\n  Most importantly, we have to do everything within our power, \nregardless of political party, to take the steps and to do what is \nnecessary to make sure people in our country are safe and secure.\n  Madam President, one more time, I want to finish up in the few \nminutes I have by saying that murder is never legitimate, and this was \na mass murder of men, women, and children. I think the thing that I \nwill never be able to get out of my mind is that so many innocent \npeople, so many innocent Americans could be murdered in a single day in \nour country. To me, in my adult life, yesterday was the worst day for \nour country, and there are going to be many more difficult days because \nwe don't even have a sense of the loss of life.\n  I am absolutely convinced this will bring out the best in us. I am \nabsolutely convinced that Americans will be their own best selves. I am \nabsolutely convinced that these terrorists will see Americans coming \ntogether and I hope the whole international community that represents \ncivilization will come together so these kinds of acts of murder can \nnever be committed again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have no words to describe or condemn \nadequately the enormity of yesterday's attacks on the United States or \nthe depravity of those who are responsible for them. All we can really \noffer now are our prayers and support for the victims and their \nfamilies, and the assurance to our fellow citizens that America will \nrecover from these atrocities, resume the life of a great nation, \nstrong, resolute and free, and destroy those who seek to destroy us.\n  We are greater than our enemies. We are greater because the very \nvirtues our enemies revile and seek to destroy make us so. Our enemies, \nthose who unleashed these attacks, and those who support them, are not \nour enemies alone. They are the enemies of freedom and independence and \njustice and peace, and they wage war on the United States because we \nare and will remain the principal guarantors of freedom for ourselves \nand for all nations who claim their right to that condition. All people \nwho possess or aspire to freedom were attacked yesterday, and when we \nanswer we do so in their name as well as ours. And answer we will.\n  These were not just crimes, they were acts of war, and have aroused \nin this great nation a controlled fury and unity of purpose not just to \npunish but vanquish--vanquish our enemies. Americans know now that we \nare at war, and will make the sacrifices and show the resolve necessary \nto prevail. I say to our enemies, we are coming. God may show you \nmercy. We will not.\n  We must break the back of this international network of terror in all \nits guises, and deprive its architects, executioners and sponsors of a \nsafe harbor anywhere in this world. We will commit all necessary \nresources to its accomplishment. Our responses must be diplomatic, \neconomic and military.\n  Let us go to our allies, all of our allies, to ensure them of our \nresolve and to enlist them in this war against our shared values and \nsecurity. The Atlantic Charter claims an attack on one member of NATO \nis an attack on all NATO members. We will expect our allies in NATO, \nAsia and elsewhere to respond to this attack on us as we would respond \nto an attack on their territory.\n  We should make an immediate statement of our resolve that we no \nlonger intend to tolerate sanction given to our enemies by any nation. \nWe should demand that Afghanistan immediately extradite to the United \nStates Osama bin Laden. We will know in due course if he is the \narchitect of yesterday's attacks, but we already possess sufficient \nevidence to have indicted him for orchestrating the attacks on our \nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He has claimed responsibility for the \n1992 attempted bombing of 100 U.S. servicemen in Yemen who were there \nto assist U.N. famine relief operations in Somalia. He proudly \nannounced his material and personnel support for the Somali forces that \nfought and killed American servicemen in Mogadishu. The mastermind of \nthe 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was a known associate of bin \nLaden. He is a declared enemy of the United States and our allies. And \nit is long past time that we and our allies brought an end to the war \nhe began.\n  Should the Taliban refuse our demand, then they must know that they\n\n[[Page S9304]]\n\nwill be treated as allies of our enemy, and thus, are themselves our \nenemies, and will suffer much for their allegiance.\n  This campaign will be long and difficult, and will not end with the \ncapture or destruction of Osama bin Laden alone. The American people \nmust, and I am sure, will understand that we will wage this war to its \ncomplete resolution however long and difficult the road ahead. But they \nshould not be expected to wait one day longer than necessary for our \nenemies to be vanquished, for the full measure of justice to be done, \nfor freedom and righteousness to prevail.\n  We will prevail. We will prevail because the foundations of our \ngreatness cannot be vanquished. Our respect for Man's God-given rights \nto life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness assures us of victory \neven as it has made us a target for the unjust enemies of freedom who \nhave mistaken hate and depravity for power. The losses we have suffered \nare grave, and will never be forgotten. But we should take pride and \nunyielding resolve from the knowledge that we were attacked because we \nare good.\n  May God bless us in this trial, comfort us, strengthen our resolve, \nand make our justice as terrible and certain as His.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Arizona has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, yesterday was a day that will live in all \nof our memories. America was struck by an unprecedented and unprovoked \nact of violence, so vicious and calculated that the entire world has \nreacted in horror and revulsion. In that hour when so many were taken \nfrom us, America did not bend or buckle. We stood strong.\n  That strength is best exemplified by the police, firefighters, and \nemergency services personnel who courageously raced to the scene. When \neveryone was running away from the danger, they were running toward it. \nHere in Washington, as the U.S. Capitol was being evacuated, our \nCapitol Police were standing guard.\n  All of these public servants deserve our thanks. And their families, \nespecially the families of the police and firefighters in New York who \nare currently missing, should know that our prayers are with them in \nthis difficult time.\n  We pray for those lost and for their families. In Iowa, Doug and \nBetty Haviland, our former neighbors in Ames, IA, are going through a \ndifficult time right now. Their son, Tim, worked on the 96th floor of \nthe World Trade Center, and Tim is currently missing. I want Doug and \nBetty to know that my thoughts and prayers are with them today. I am \nhoping for the best.\n  The sister of my long-time friend Kasey Kincaid, an attorney in Des \nMoines, Karen Kincaid, an attorney here in Washington, born in Waverly, \na graduate of Drake Law, was on the ill-fated flight that crashed into \nthe Pentagon yesterday.\n  When the smoke clears, we will comfort all the families in their time \nof need. We want them to know that although their loved ones may be \ngone, they are not alone. All of America stands with them. We are \nAmericans and we take care of our own. The tallest buildings may \ncrumble, but no one will bring down our spirit.\n  We have survived tough times before; we will do so again. Let me be \nclear. These cowardly acts against our great Nation will not stand. I \nstand with President Bush in calling on every resource of our \nGovernment to track down the cowards who committed these acts and to \nbring them to swift and certain justice. We will seek out not only the \nterrorists but their backers and financers as well. Americans will do \nwhat we have always done. We will come together, get down to work, and \nwe will demand justice.\n  Mr. President, when we do strike back, we must be very careful. We \nmust ensure that when we train our sights on the enemy, we do not harm \ninnocent people in the crossfire. I want to quote the words of Cardinal \nTheodore McCarrick, the Archbishop of Washington, who spoke at a mass \nyesterday. He made a point that we should all take to heart:\n\n       Let us pray for those who have lost their lives or who have \n     been seriously injured in this calamity. But we must resist \n     the temptation to strike out in vengeance and revenge and, in \n     a special way, not to label any ethnic group or community for \n     this action, which certainly is just the work of a few \n     madmen. We must seek the guilty and not strike out against \n     the innocent or we become like them who are without moral \n     guide or direction.\n\n  I could not agree more strongly. We must not use these events of \nyesterday to paint with a broad brush all Muslims, those of the Islamic \nfaith or of Arabic descent. It has happened before; it should not \nhappen again.\n  Those who perpetrated these murders yesterday are not associated with \nMuslims or with the Islamic faith. If they claim they are on some kind \nof mission for Islam, that is just a lie. They are using the cloak of \nreligion to justify the murder of innocent people. Again, we have seen \nthis before.\n  We must also make sure we do not fall prey to the theory that in \norder to defeat this enemy, we must become more like them. I am old \nenough to remember the McCarthy era, when there were those who said in \norder to defeat communism, we had to become a police state. There were \nreasonable voices that said: No, we do not have to; we can defeat \ncommunism and still maintain our freedoms. That, Mr. President, is what \nwe must do.\n  We as Americans respect civil rights and human rights and diversity. \nWe are of diverse backgrounds and faiths. Muslims are part of the \nfabric of America, part of our strength. Let us be sure we go after the \nreal enemy, and let us not paint with a broad stroke those who are of \nthe Islamic faith who are Americans, who are Muslims, who are part of \nour great society.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The time of the Senator from Iowa \nhas expired.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask that the distinguished Senator from \nWyoming be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank the Senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n  We all have very strong feelings at this time, and most of all those \nfeelings have been expressed, eloquently I might say, and now we have \ntime for the real challenge.\n  Yesterday was a very sad day. The sadness, of course, continues for \nthose who were injured and the families of those who were lost.\n  Acts of war have been committed against our Nation. Forces of evil \nhave struck at the center of our Government, our families, and our \ncommunities.\n  There are no words that can possibly explain the devastation or \nconvey sufficient sympathy for the men and women who lost their lives, \nnor even do words exist to describe our collective anger.\n  It is a somber day, but our sadness will lead to resolve.\n  Powerful symbols of our democracy have been destroyed, but the root \nof our strength--our personal commitment to our country and our \nfamilies--is even stronger.\n  Our focus now must be on the victims, of course, and those who still \nface the challenge of life and rescue. America will take care of its \nown.\n  Let me assure people today that the functions of Government will \ncontinue. As you can see, Congress is meeting and most Federal agencies \nin Washington are open and doing their jobs. There is no amount of \nterror that can be committed that will throw us off our course to \nprotect and serve democracy today.\n  The next great test for the Government and for every American will be \nthe challenge to move forward--and that is a necessary part--to comfort \nthose who have lost everything in their lives and rebuild the physical \nstructures that have been lost. Our democracy will continue to exist \nuninhibited and unintimidated.\n  Next we must strive to devise updated security and intelligence \nmeasures to serve us better in the future so this will not happen \nagain.\n  Next, and at the appropriate time with the intelligence information \nthat is required, the United States will exact a supreme measure of \njustice against the criminals who have perpetrated terror on this \ncountry, and\n\n[[Page S9305]]\n\nthey are not long for this world. Those terrorists should understand \nwell we are coming for them and nothing will deter us from seeing that \nthey are eliminated, as well as other terrorists around the world, even \nthough they may not be specifically involved with this terrorism.\n  We all offer our condolences and prayers to the families of the \nmissing. I offer my hopes for those who are working these tragedies \ntoday and rescue efforts. God bless them. God bless America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming yields back his time.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, on Tuesday morning this Nation witnessed an attempt to \npitch into darkness the light of American liberty. It was nothing less \nthan an offensive against the freedom our Nation represents. It was \nnothing less than pure evil that cast a shadow over our country darker \nthan the smoke from any explosion.\n  Yesterday, fanatics challenged our Nation to war, striking at \ncivilians and service members alike. Today the Senate is making it \nclear that we will not bow to this brutality. We believe passionately \nin our country in due process, in the rule of law. But the effort to \nfind justice cannot be allowed to degenerate into the all-too-frequent \nendless debate. America must act decisively.\n  Families across this country are in their darkest hour right now. At \nthe moment, not all of the victims' names are known out of the \nthousands believed lost in the tragedy. In the coming days, they are \ngoing to become familiar to us, and their lives and legacies will be \nshared with the world. But we already know them. These victims are \nhusbands and wives, daughters and sons, brother and sisters to every \nAmerican.\n  We honor the memory of those whom we have lost, but we also make it \nclear today that we will not allow this Nation to be sapped by terror. \nAmerica is not going to be drained by devilish acts of rage.\n  The light of hope is burning across this country. The voice of a New \nYork firefighter who says he will not stop searching until the last \nstone is turned is a voice of hope.\n  The courage of the Federal employees who returned to work today \nacross the country is a courage ground in hope.\n  Hope shines in the people willing to wait for hours to help, as we \nsaw yesterday when they donated blood. It shines in the hearts of those \nwho are praying today in churches and synagogues and mosques across the \ncountry.\n  Here is my bottom line, Mr. President: The light that shines in \nAmerica is going to be relentless when it is turned on those who have \ndeclared themselves our enemies. The dark forces that perpetrated these \nacts ought to make sure today that they are in their hiding places \nbecause we are going to come after them. The blinding beam of our \ndetermination and the long arm of the United States of America is going \nto expose them and extract justice.\n  Our entire Congress stands united behind the President of the United \nStates and against our enemies and against those who would shelter \nthem. Our whole Nation stands together with a very clear intention: To \nendure.\n  Our enemies should know the entire free and democratic world stands \nunmoved in its dedication to liberty for all. We speak with one voice, \nand we will move in concert to protect principles that we hold dear.\n  The flame of democracy is going to be fanned even brighter. We will \nnot just carry the torch, but we are going to make sure that standard \nis held higher than ever before.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon yields back his time.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask that the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico, Mr. Domenici, be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, it is a pleasure to speak to the \nSenators who are present and listening.\n  An era has come to an end. As many commentators have noted, most say \nit was an era of innocence. I agree. Americans now know firsthand the \nkind of mindless terrorism and brutal disregard of all concepts of \nmorality that afflict our world. What will be our measure of response \nas a nation?\n  Our people in the world will watch, listen, and wait, for, as \nFranklin Roosevelt said, ``We defend and we build a way of life not for \nAmerica alone but for mankind.''\n  We will, of course, support the President in every respect, provide \nany and all resources, including emergency funding for New York City, \nfor Washington, DC, for Arlington, VA, sparing no expense to save our \nneighbors who need our help in this time of great distress.\n  Whatever it takes--and I repeat, whatever it takes--to pursue those \nwho planned, funded, aided, harbored, and carried out yesterday's \ndestruction, we will go to the fullest extent possible. All the \nresources of this great nation must be brought to bear to demonstrate \nour unity and our power. We know something else now. We understand that \nthe threshold of possible terrorism has gone up.\n  We know more, but the terrorists know more, too. We must commit to an \nall-out effort, not just to a war against terrorism but to new weapons \nin this war. We must do everything possible to prevent the possibility \nof calamities above this threshold. The Federal Government must pursue \nevery avenue. Our defense programs--our national laboratories, \nuniversities, and other research institutions--must take the next \ntechnological steps to win the war that terrorists declared yesterday \non our people.\n  Congress can do two or three things, less obvious perhaps, but more \nimportant in the long run. We can set aside petty bickering. We can \nunify in concrete terms by attending to the Nation's business. The \nAmerican people can judge barbarians who committed this act of war \nyesterday, but they will judge us in Congress, too.\n  We in this time of grave challenge must rise above the political \nbickering that has affected us for too long. We must quickly unify on \nthe issues that have divided us, whether it is defense spending or \nenergy policy. By doing so, we can show by our actions that truly \nyesterday was the end of an era.\n  I am not naive. I understand politics. But now is the time to lay \nthem aside and, as the American people, unite behind our President. Let \nus in Congress rise to this historic challenge by joining hands and \nhearts and doing the Nation's business now.\n  A final word of advice, too, for those who committed these \natrocities. How little you know of our Nation, for you are so cowardly \nyou have no way of understanding us. No act these criminals could have \ncontemplated will unify this Nation more, nor galvanize our will more \nfirmly than yesterday's destruction. They have done what many feared \nperhaps could no longer be done. They have hardened this Nation's \nresolve, prompted our patriotism, and unleashed our power. They have \ncommitted an act of war. They have awakened a sleeping giant, and they \nwill inherit the whirlwind.\n  My heart goes out to all of those suffering today. I know that New \nMexicans have suffered losses but, we understand, nothing like New \nYork. I know other Americans have suffered losses. I share in their \ngrief, and I hold them up in my prayers and in the prayers of our \nfamily.\n  Let us understand if we have been awakened, as I believe we have, by \nunifying and eliminating the bickering, we can move our Nation ahead \nand we can begin to solve and get rid of terrorism here and everywhere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico for that eloquent comment, thank \nhim for his extraordinary leadership on this particular subject, and \nfor the years he has served as a leader to our Nation.\n  Let me begin by thanking the many people in Louisiana, first our \nspiritual leaders, our military leaders, our elected officials at every \nlevel, our emergency personnel, every citizen who through prayer or \naction is engaged in helping this Nation at this time. We all \nappreciate their efforts.\n\n[[Page S9306]]\n\n  In the darkest hours, America has always risen to her promise. We \nfind ourselves again in the very darkest of times. For only the second \ntime in American history, our borders have been penetrated and \nAmericans attacked.\n  The greatest generation of Americans responded to the first attack, \nPearl Harbor, with an unwavering commitment to defend the ideals of \ndemocracy around the globe.\n  Our generation will be remembered for how we respond to this attack \nagainst our Nation, our liberty, and our freedom. I have no doubt our \nNation will rise to the challenge and find light in our darkest hour.\n  Through the endeavors of our people and the providence of God, our \nNation prevailed in the struggle with the Soviet Union. It was a \nstruggle lasting over 40 years, spread over every continent, costing \nthis Nation the treasure of its youth and resources beyond imagination.\n  After yesterday, the American people must understand that today we \nbegin to undertake a task no less daunting. President Kennedy's \ninaugural address is remembered for its impact in rallying the resolve \nof our Nation at that time. I can think of no better place to turn to \ntoday. His eloquence is as relevant this morning as it was 40 years \nago: Now the trumpet summons us again. Not as a call to bear arms, \nthough arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are, \nbut a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle year in and \nyear out, rejoicing in hope, patient in our tribulation, a struggle \nagainst the common enemies of man--tyranny, poverty, disease, and war \nitself.\n  Yesterday we heard the pages of history turn in explosions which \nbrought down skyscrapers. The sound heard around the world was \ndeafening, perhaps a fitting beginning to what we may come to know as \nthe silent war; a silent war where cowardice of our enemies is their \ngreatest asset. Yet no deception, no amount of subterfuge, no resort to \nvillainy will protect our enemies from the righteous anger of the \nAmerican people called to war.\n  It is important for our people to know we are all being called into \nthis struggle. In a silent war, we are all targets and, therefore, we \nare all combatants. Sacrifices to the unparalleled freedom that we \nenjoy, costly expenditures, and the employment of our military men and \nwomen may all be required before this war is over.\n  Yesterday's terror may have broken the hearts of American families, \nbut it will not break the American family. Yesterday's terror may have \ndestroyed lives but it will not destroy this Nation's destiny. \nYesterday's terror may have shattered buildings, but it will not \nshatter the American spirit.\n  This morning, not that long ago, over the crater that used to be part \nof the Pentagon, the Sun broke and hit an American flag flying over the \nrubble. It is in that spirit America will prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nMaine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as did all of my colleagues and all \nAmericans, I woke up this morning with a broken heart but not a broken \nspirit.\n  The unimaginable and horrific attack on the World Trade Center and \nthe Pentagon was an attack on all Americans and against every freedom-\nloving nation of the world.\n  Today, our prayers and our deepest sympathies are with the families \nof those innocent victims who lost their lives, as well as those who \nwere injured in these monstrous tragedies. We can scarcely comprehend \nthe images that have flashed before our eyes over the past 24 hours, \nbut we know that so many of our fellow Americans are grieving for lives \ncut short and possibilities ended. And so today we grieve as one \nnation, under God, indivisible.\n  Our hearts are heavy but our resolve is strong. This outrageous \nattack has reverberated through every level of our society. But let \nthere be no mistake, and let the word go forth from the Halls of \nCongress and from the White House and from every house across our \nindomitable Nation that we will find who is responsible, we will hold \nthem accountable, and we will persevere.\n  The soul of this country and the ideals upon which it was built \ncannot be torn asunder neither by war, nor by assassination, nor by the \nblunt and bloody instruments of faceless cowards. The forces of \ndarkness have challenged our country's determination before. As we rose \nto the challenge then, so will we rise at this most solemn of times.\n  Clearly, the attacks on our Nation were coordinated, and they were \ncalculated. Yet clouded by their own twisted fanaticism--whatever brand \nof fanaticism that may prove to be --the perpetrators of this crime \nagainst humanity and the American people failed to understand that ours \nis a nation in which the principle of individual freedom is exceeded \nonly by our commitment to protect our freedom.\n  The American spirit is stronger than stone and water, tougher than \nsteel and glass, and more enduring than any pain or suffering that can \nbe inflicted on our national conscience. It cannot be collapsed by fire \nand terror.\n  To the contrary, today we stand united behind our President and the \nentire leadership of the Congress. Today, solidarity eclipsed politics \nand partisanship. And this will remain so for every minute of every \nhour of every day that it takes to right this injustice.\n  We must remain always vigilant but never fearful. We must \nrelentlessly seek justice, and we must do all that is within our power \nas a free nation to prevent such catastrophic terrorist attacks both at \nhome and abroad.\n  There are events in our lives that will be forever etched on the \nlandscape of our consciousness. We all know where we were and what we \nwere doing at the precise time they happened. As we remember the \nassassination of President Kennedy and, for many of my colleagues, \nPearl Harbor, our children will remember this day.\n  We are angry as a nation, and we have every right to be angry. But \nnow it is time to focus our energies on responsible actions and swift \nresponses when the masterminds are found. Now is also the time to heal \nand to tend to our neighbors and families and friends.\n  In typical American fashion, heroes rushed to the aid of those in \nperil, even as the sounds of blasts still echoed across Manhattan and \nour Nation's Capital.\n  For the unthinkable numbers of people in New York, Virginia, \nPennsylvania, military personnel at the Pentagon, passengers on planes \nfrom across America, policemen, firefighters, and emergency personnel \nwho gave their lives, their memory will live on with the memory of this \ntragedy. To the families, our Nation shares in your unspeakable loss.\n  America will never be the same, just as we were forever changed by \ntwo World Wars and numerous other conflicts throughout the world. Now \nterrorism has come to American soil on a scale most dared not imagine. \nWe are changed, but we are far from broken. Ours is a nation born of \nadversity, forged by perseverance, and defined by our ability to unite \nagainst those who would tear us down. We must never forget that some of \nAmerica's finest hours have followed our darkest days.\n  To whomever is responsible for this tragedy, hear this loud and clear \nbecause America speaks with one voice: You will be found. You will be \nheld accountable, and this injustice will not stand.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues. Very \nfrankly, my heart is filled with a great deal of mixed emotions. On the \none hand, I want this country to smash back. On the other, I want us to \nbe sure that we are on firm ground, that we know what we are doing, and \nthat we are successful in our mission.\n  Yesterday was one of the darkest days I can remember. Many have \nspeculated that the loss of life may well only be exceeded by the \nbattle, 1-day battle at Antietam during the civil war. It will \ncertainly be more than the loss at Pearl Harbor.\n  One of the things that I have recognized, and what should be \nabundantly clear, I think to all of us, is that there are those out \nthere without a heart who are willing to carry out this kind of attack, \nand to do it with malevolence and cunning that defies conscience and \nhumanity. That is really what we are up against.\n  I really consider what happened in New York and at the Pentagon to be \na\n\n[[Page S9307]]\n\ndeclaration of war against the United States. I believe we must respond \naccordingly in a well-considered military way.\n  I join the President, the congressional leadership, and particularly \nSecretary of State Colin Powell, whose remarks this morning share that \nsame determination.\n  Let there be no mistake. This attack was deliberately planned. It was \nplanned to have the largest possible impact and to maximize the loss of \ninnocent human life.\n  The terrorists deliberately selected the largest planes with the \ngreatest fuel loads to create the biggest explosion, to kill the most \npeople, and to do it at a time of day when that would happen.\n  They deliberately selected important symbols--one, the military \nheadquarters of the United States, and the other a major center of \nAmerican economic entrepreneurism.\n  What is now emerging is genuine acts of heroism aboard our planes. \nHeroism aboard UAL Flight 93, which left Dulles International Airport, \nmay well have prevented Flight 93 from striking the White House or the \nUnited States Capitol.\n  Californians were aboard that plane. One Californian, Thomas Burnett \nof San Ramone, phoned his wife. He told her the flight was doomed but \nthat he and two other passengers were determined to do something about \nit. ``I love you honey'' were Burnett's last words to his wife. He \nsaid, ``I know we are all going to die, but there are three of us who \nare going to do something about it.'' He worked for a company called \nThoratec. He leaves three children. You might say he and others made \nthe ultimate sacrifice.\n  Yesterday firmly establishes in my mind that the major threat and No. \n1 national security problem facing the United States is the \nasymmetrical attack, the unconventional and unpredictable horrific act \nof terrorism.\n  I don't believe America can be a paper tiger in response. I think the \nUnited States should spare no effort to uncover, to ferret out, and to \ndestroy those who commit acts of terrorism, those who provide the \ntraining camps, who shelter, who finance, and who support terrorists. \nWhether that enemy is a state or an organization, those who harbor \nthem, who arm them, who train them, and permit them must, in my view, \nbe destroyed.\n  It is interesting to note that 3 weeks ago the British press carried \narticles which said that the bin Laden operation was prepared to \nlaunch--and this a quote--``an unprecedented attack against the United \nStates.'' We know that the organization is wanted as well for two prior \nmajor terrorist attacks against the United States.\n  It seems to me that there is a good indication we will shortly find \nwho is responsible for this act of war against our country. And then we \nmust strike back against them hard.\n  It is also critical that America lead an international effort that \nmakes clear to all nations that countenance terrorism, that harbor \nterrorists, that aid and abet their actions, that that country is an \nenemy of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a couple additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  All civilized nations, whether it is NATO, our European allies, \nRussia, China, the moderate Arab States, or anyone else--I received a \ncall this morning from the Chinese Embassy saying the President of \nChina had called our President yesterday to indicate China's solidarity \nwith the United States and to offer any help. Indeed, that is a giant \nstep forward. It is a beginning. I believe we must create a critical \ndivide between civilized nations that will not sanction terrorism and \nspell out those that do and do something about it.\n  Presently, the United States spends about $12 billion, spread among a \nnumber of Departments dealing with terrorism. The proposed budget will \nshortly be before the Senate. If we are to engage against this threat, \nI think we must also organize and coordinate our Government's effort. I \nspeak now as chairman of the Technology and Terrorism Subcommittee of \nthe Judiciary Committee and also as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee. We must see that these dollars are wisely spent, not \nfrittered among more than 40 Departments. I do not believe those \ndollars are well spent at the present time.\n  We must also understand that homeland defense should be our highest \npriority: coherent and carefully balanced, with trained personnel in \nevery State, and an intelligence network that provides a coordination \nbetween all branches of Government and each of our States.\n  America has at its disposal a wide array of tools, but these tools \nmust be directed carefully, with a coherent policy. This is not now the \nsituation. I believe we must remedy it promptly.\n  We Americans are a resilient, a determined, and a patriotic nation. \nWe will not lose the spirit that makes us the greatest democracy on \nEarth by going after terrorists full scale. We have always been ready \nto respond in defense of freedom. And now that challenge is before us \nin a manner, shape and form that offers unprecedented challenges. We \nmust respond.\n  Let me also speak a few moments as a Californian. The four planes \nthat were hijacked were all going to California; three to Los Angeles, \none to San Francisco.\n  Two hundred sixty-six people died on the planes. It is certain that \nmany of them have families in California. To them, I extend my \nheartfelt sorrow. But I also extend a commitment that I will do \neverything in my power as one Senator to see that these deaths were not \nin vain.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask that the able Senator from Arkansas \nbe recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, on this day of mourning and on behalf \nof all Arkansans, I offer my deepest and most sincere condolences to \nthe families of the victims of the cowardly attacks on the World Trade \nCenter and the Pentagon.\n  I especially want to mention the Arkansas flight attendant, Sara \nLowe, and offer my sympathy and condolences to her parents Mike and \nBobbie, and to her sister Allison. There may well be other Arkansans \nwho were aboard, but Sara served, and served well, on Flight No. 11.\n  While New York bears the brunt of the pain today, I am reminded, as I \nthink of Sara Lowe from Batesville, AR, that there are hundreds of \ntowns and hamlets and villages all across the Nation that share in the \ngrief and the suffering today. Our Nation is grief stricken but our \nNation is strong. Our Nation is united, and our Nation is resolved to \nbring those responsible to justice.\n  I honor today the courage and compassion of the rescuers in New York \nCity and at the Pentagon. Your Nation is grateful and your Nation is \nindebted.\n  We all woke up yesterday and prepared to go about our normal business \nin a world that looked the same as it did the day before. Today \neverything is different. The New York skyline is changed, and so is the \ngeopolitical landscape of the world.\n  We stand at the violent birth of a new era in international relations \nand national security. The strategic pause that we enjoyed after the \ncold war ended is over. I pray that we have used this interlude \nproperly; and I fear that we may not have.\n  But this needs to be clear: Any nation that harbors, shelters, or \nabets these terrorist thugs will be regarded as full participants in \nthese acts of war and will be held equally accountable.\n  We will devote as many resources as necessary to find and punish the \nperpetrators of these acts. We must make a national commitment to \nbreaking the back of international terrorism.\n  On the Armed Services Committee, I am fortunate to have served as a \nmember of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee under the leadership of \nSenator Roberts from Kansas.\n  As frightening and as horrific as the toll and the results of the \nincidents yesterday are, I fear that a biological or a chemical attack \nupon this country would make the tens of thousands of victims yesterday \npale in comparison to the millions that might be the victims of such an \nattack. But the American people should be assured that we will utilize \nevery resource at the disposal of our great country to protect them.\n\n[[Page S9308]]\n\n  We Americans will stand together, united, determined, and ultimately \nvictorious.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I was sickened by the actions that were \ntaken against our country yesterday. I felt very much like I was back \nin the Vietnam war in the Tet Offensive of 1968 of which I was lucky to \nsurvive. When I looked out my window and saw the smoke coming from the \nPentagon, I literally felt, for the first time, that I was under attack \nin my own country. That is a terrible feeling. I think many Americans \nshared that feeling.\n  My staff is still trying to recover. They still have traces of tears \nin their eyes and on their faces from the suffering that we have seen \non television by our fellow Americans.\n  For the first time, I guess certainly in a long, long time, American \nblood has been shed on American soil by a foreign enemy. That gives us \nall pause to get the most out of this historic moment. That is what I \nam trying to do in my own mind as I rise to pay tribute to those \nwonderful rescue workers who have come to the aid of our fellow \nAmericans in New York and in this great city of Washington, DC.\n  But I think of the families as well who have suffered forever the \nloss of a loved one. Many children will go without fathers tonight. \nMany families will go without loved ones. And that grieves me greatly. \nBut what are we to do? What are we to make of this?\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee for the last 5 years, I \nhave been growing impatient, and in many ways frustratingly concerned, \nabout the growth of terrorism and its impact on this country. In fact, \nSenator Warner, a couple years ago, created the Emerging Threats \nSubcommittee, which the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts, \nchaired for a couple years. And now Senator Mary Landrieu from \nLouisiana chairs that subcommittee.\n  Without speaking for them, I can say that over the last couple years \nwe have had increasing evidence in testimony before our committee that \nthe real threat, the emerging threat to America was going to come \nthrough some terrorist act, maybe biological, maybe chemical, maybe no \nmore than just an explosive in a backpack, some terrorist act below the \nradar screen, someone or something that had no return address. This has \nindeed happened. What are we to make of it?\n\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I feel this challenge \nvery personally, to make something of this worthwhile for our Nation \nand for our country, to come to terms with what we ought to do about \nit.\n  In the wake of Pearl Harbor, I know there was a board of inquiry set \nup to find out what happened. Admiral Kimmel there in Hawaii got blamed \nfor the attack, probably wrongfully so. Those of us on the Armed \nServices Committee, those of us in this great body, do have some \nresponsibility, maybe through the regular committee structure, to find \nout what happened, find out what the recommendations from our best \nprofessionals are, and then go about the business of making sure this \nnever happens to our country again.\n  My heart is sickened at the loss of life. I would be even more \nsickened by the loss of this incredible opportunity, this spur for \naction, this spur for greater knowledge about where we are in our \nintelligence community. Do we not have the resources? Do we not have \nthe human intelligence? Do we not have the people? Have we not been \nmindful of the real threats to this country as evidence upon evidence, \ntestimony upon testimony continues to grow, as we hear increasing \nevidence in background briefings from our intelligence community that \nthese are the kinds of threats we can expect not only now but in the \nfuture?\n  Are we underfunding some aspect of our homeland defense? Are we \novermatched and undercoordinated in our ability to respond? Are we \nforever to live from crisis to crisis under threat of terrorist attack? \nI don't think that is the way Americans are supposed to live or were \nborn to live.\n  My mind recalls the great words of F.D.R. that launched the greatest \ngeneration on its great crusade, World War II, the four freedoms, \nRoosevelt's famous speech. What are the four freedoms that Americans \nhave an inherent right to enjoy? First, freedom of expression, the \nability to talk in this great Chamber and express our opinion and the \nability of any American to express the same; second, freedom of \nreligion, which unquestionably is part of our national Bill of Rights; \nthird, freedom from want; all of us feel this country is, as Lincoln \nsaid, the last best hope of Earth; finally, as F.D.R. put it in 1941, \nfreedom from fear.\n  Many Americans are fearful today. They are fearful for the future of \ntheir homeland, their communities, their families. We do not deserve to \nlive in fear.\n  I dedicate myself, as a Member of this body, as an American, as \nsomeone who has seen combat and who has lived in fear, to make sure \nthat I rededicate myself to the task remaining before us: That we will \nwork out, with the President of the United States and this \nadministration, every aspect of a plan to rid ourselves of \ninternational terrorism and to work with other nations, other civilized \nnations, other nations committed to democracy and opportunity that \nbelieve in the four freedoms as we do, to work out with them, in \ncoordination with them, an assault on terrorism.\n  Yesterday was a declaration of war by terrorists on this country. \nThis resolution we pass today in a unanimous fashion is, in my opinion, \na resolution of guts and courage that this body sends forth, that we \ndeclare war on international terrorism.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I yield to the able Senator from Kansas, \nMr. Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing \nsupport for this resolution, a resolution of the Senate of the United \nStates expressing our very prayerful condolences to those who lost \ntheir lives as a result of this heinous crime, not only against \nthemselves but against America and, just as important, against \ndemocracy and freedom.\n  First, let me say this Congress stands behind our President and his \ndetermination to punish those who harbor terrorists as well as the \nterrorists themselves.\n  Second, our fight against terrorism will necessitate more cooperation \nthan we have ever seen or experienced from our allies and other \ngovernments. I am a little encouraged. They know we are not alone. \nSeveral Arab state leaders, long American allies, have expressed \nsupport. I understand that similar expressions have come from Russia. \nThis will take an unprecedented diplomatic and foreign policy \nundertaking.\n  As we determine how best to address this ongoing threat, it will not \nbe necessary to start anew or to reinvent the antiterrorism wheel. I \nhave had the privilege, as some have said, of serving for 3 years as \nthe chairman of the newly created Subcommittee on Emerging Threats. \nThat is a subcommittee created by our distinguished former chairman, \nJohn Warner. The committee is now ably chaired by Senator Mary \nLandrieu.\n  Our subcommittee is now compiling the testimony of the many witnesses \nwe have had over the past 3 years and the recommendations we have made \nwhich we will make available to the administration, to the Pentagon, to \nthe American public, and, yes, to the 46 Federal agencies that have \nclaimed jurisdiction of one kind or another with regard to homeland \nsecurity.\n  In this respect, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a \nletter that five Senators representing the Senate Armed Services, \nIntelligence, and Appropriations Committees and two subcommittees, \nincluding the Emerging Threats Subcommittee, sent to Vice President \nCheney as of last July.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 2001.\n     Hon. Richard B. Cheney,\n     Vice President of the United States,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Vice President: The hearings conducted by the \n     Senate on May 8, 9 and 10, 2001 demonstrated that some \n     Federal agencies do not have a firm grasp of their roles and \n     responsibilities for preventing, preparing for, and \n     responding to acts of domestic terrorism. This lack of \n     clarity is due to the absence of a true, comprehensive \n     national\n\n[[Page S9309]]\n\n     strategy. Currently, our national policy is embodied in two \n     Presidential Decision Directives, the Attorney General's Five \n     Year Plan, and two Federal response plans, one maintained by \n     the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and one maintained \n     by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). This \n     ``patchwork quilt'' approach is not a substitute for a \n     national strategy, the purpose of which would be to \n     coordinate our Federal agencies into an effective force.\n       The attached report contains seven recommendations that \n     emerged during the course of the hearings. They merit your \n     strong consideration as you move toward bringing all of the \n     Federal entities involved in combating terrorism under a \n     single umbrella of clear leadership and a consolidated \n     national strategy. The recommendations identify and propose \n     actions to address weaknesses in our overall national system \n     to combat domestic terrorism.\n       We hope these recommendations will be useful to you as you \n     chart a new course for this nation's domestic terrorism \n     policy. With respect to the review itself, we strongly \n     recommend that you solicit input from and incorporate the \n     worthwhile suggestions of members of the first responder \n     community, including fire, law enforcement, medical, and \n     emergency management personnel. In addition, just as you have \n     requested the assistance and support of the Director of the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency, we urge you to also draw \n     upon the experience and expertise of the Attorney General and \n     the Department of Justice. This will ensure that you have all \n     the necessary information and resources at your disposal, and \n     that your review is balanced and thorough. We in the Senate \n     stand ready to assist you in this historic and critical \n     enterprise.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ted Stevens,\n       Committee on Appropriations.\n     John Warner,\n       Committee on Armed Services.\n     Richard Shelby,\n       Select Committee on Intelligence.\n     Pat Roberts,\n       Subcommittee on Emerging Threats & Capabilities, Committee \n     on Armed Services.\n     Judd Gregg,\n       Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary, \n     Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                      Report to the Vice President\n\n\n  Findings Pursuant to the Senate Hearings on U.S. Federal Government \n               Capabilities to Combat domestic Terrorism\n\n       I. Leadership.--During the course of the hearings, several \n     agencies announced the creation of a new position that would \n     coordinate those agencies' terrorism-related activities. HHS \n     is appointing a Special Assistant, DOD is designating an \n     Assistant Secretary of Defense, and FEMA has appointed a \n     Deputy Director. To improve coordination and centralize the \n     policy-making structure within the Department of Justice, we \n     recommend establishing in law a Deputy Attorney General for \n     Combating Domestic Terrorism (DAG-CT). The position would \n     have as its principal duty the development and coordination \n     of the department's overall policy for combating domestic \n     terrorism. The DAG-CT would report directly to the Attorney \n     General. The DAG-CT and the Deputy Director of FEMA, as Co-\n     Coordinators, should share responsibility for coordinating \n     the Federal structure for combating domestic terrorism, \n     including all of the relevant agencies, and for coordinating \n     the national strategy.\n       II. The National Strategy.--The Congress, the President, \n     and the National Security Advisor must be able to look to the \n     Co-Coordinators to coordinate a single national strategy to \n     safeguard this country from domestic terrorism. The national \n     strategy should establish the policies, objectives, and \n     priorities of the Federal government for preventing, \n     preparing for, and responding to domestic terrorist attacks. \n     The strategy should include specific objectives to be \n     achieved. Also, it should include a recommendation concerning \n     the role each Federal department and agency and State and \n     local government entity should perform in combating domestic \n     terrorism, as well as a recommendation concerning Federal \n     training, equipment, exercise, and grant programs. The \n     strategy should rest on four pillars: prevention/\n     intelligence, preparedness, crisis management, and \n     consequence management.\n       The sharing of information, especially by intelligence \n     agencies and law enforcement organizations, will be critical \n     to preventing acts of domestic terrorism. The Department of \n     State also has an important role to play in preventing \n     terrorism through its diplomatic and non-proliferation \n     activities. The Co-Coordinators should work in close \n     cooperation with the Department of State to ensure that we \n     have a unified strategy for combating both domestic and \n     international terrorism. Our level of preparedness will \n     depend on our commitment to training, equipment programs, and \n     regularly scheduled exercises which allow us to hone our \n     skills. Our ability to respond to a domestic terrorist attack \n     will require the close coordination of all entities with \n     responsibility for combating domestic terrorism. Pre-\n     established guidelines outlining agencies' missions and order \n     of operations during a range of plausible threat scenarios \n     must be developed and distributed.\n       The Co-Coordinators should be responsible for coordinating \n     agencies' and departments' programs and policies so that they \n     complement the national strategy. It will be the \n     responsibility of the Federal departments and agencies to \n     keep the Co-Coordinators appraised of any changes in their \n     organization, management, or budgets as they pertain to \n     combating domestic terrorism. All agencies and departments \n     involved in combating domestic terrorism should participate \n     in an annual review process coordinated by the Co-\n     Coordinators, who should undertake this review on behalf of \n     the President. In conducting this review, the Co-Coordinators \n     should consult with the appropriate entities, including \n     Congress and the State and Local Advisory Group. The Co-\n     Coordinators should make specific recommendations regarding \n     agencies' policies, programs, and objectives for combating \n     domestic terrorism as well as monitor their progress in \n     implementing the national strategy.\n       III. Justice Reorganization.--One office within the \n     Department of Justice should oversee the work of the entire \n     Department on domestic terrorism issues. This office must \n     work on a daily basis with FEMA as well as with the FBI's \n     Counterterrorism Division. The DAG-CT, along with the Deputy \n     FEMA Director, should be nominated and confirmed by the \n     Senate. The DAG-CT would not be in any other chain of command \n     within the Department of Justice and would not be considered \n     as a successor to the Attorney General. As with the Deputy \n     FEMA Director, this position is recommended solely to address \n     domestic terrorism, and in no way should compete with the \n     present Deputy Attorney General position.\n       The National Domestic Preparedness Office (NDPO), currently \n     under the FBI, should be transferred to the DAG-CT. The \n     original mission of the NDPO was to serve as a point of \n     contact for State and local governments. Because of its \n     strong ties to the emergency management community, FEMA \n     should assume the role of ``one stop shop'' for State and \n     local responders seeking information about Federal assistance \n     and training programs.\n       IV. Budget Reviews.--There is currently no mechanism for \n     coordinating Federal spending for combating domestic \n     terrorism and domestic preparedness programs. There is no \n     process through which the President may determine what is \n     lacking and what is redundant in our national strategy to \n     combat domestic terrorism. A five year budget plan to \n     implement the national strategy should be coordinated by the \n     Co-Coordinators in consultation with the program managers \n     from the relevant departments and agencies. The Co-\n     Coordinators should work closely with the departments and \n     agencies as they prepare their annual budget submissions.\n       V. Chain of Command.--The Senate hearings demonstrated that \n     there is still a need for a coherent chain of command at the \n     Federal level during the response phase of a terrorist \n     incident. During a recent exercise, agents from the FBI and \n     Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) argued for an \n     hour over who was ``in charge'' at the scene, while actors \n     playing the part of the wounded and dying got hypothermia. \n     This confusion is the result of a poorly understood and \n     communicated chain of command.\n       The Federal Response Plan (FRP) and Concept of Operations \n     Plan (CONPLAN) identify which agencies must respond at what \n     point in time and what function each agency must perform or \n     lead. These plans have not been effectively communicated to \n     responders at all levels, from local to Federal. Furthermore, \n     these plans were designed for a number of different disaster \n     scenarios. This ``one size fits all'' approach coupled with \n     the lack of detailed understanding of the plan at all levels, \n     is responsible for the confusion encountered by responders at \n     the scene.\n       We recommend that the Co-Coordinators develop ``challenge \n     specific'' plans based on the FRP and CONPLAN to suit each \n     particular type of terrorist incident: nuclear, chemical, \n     biological, radiological, cyber, agricultural, and \n     conventional. The plans should focus on application of the \n     unified command structure across territorial, jurisdictional, \n     and intergovernmental lines. The resulting matrix of response \n     plans should also reflect the possibility of a simultaneous \n     attack involving two different types of weapons, particularly \n     a cyber attack.\n       The purpose of creating a separate response plan for each \n     type of attack is to minimize delays in decision-making and \n     expedite action-taking. A plant that is tailored to the \n     specific response requirements of a chemical, biological, \n     nuclear, radiological, or conventional attack will provide a \n     chain of command that is automatic. We further recommend that \n     FEMA expand its efforts to provide FRP and ``challenge-\n     specific plan'' training and education to Federal, State and \n     local response personnel. To this end, FEMA should support \n     and cooperate with existing DOJ training and planning efforts \n     to ensure the broadest dissemination and to avoid \n     duplication.\n       VI. Risk and Threat Assessments.--Federal programs to \n     combat domestic terrorism are being initiated and expanded \n     without the benefit of a sound threat and risk assessment \n     process. Although it is not possible to reduce risk for all \n     potential targets of terrorism, a rigorous and continuous \n     assessment of risk can help ensure that training, equipment,\n\n[[Page S9310]]\n\n     and other safeguards are justified. Such programs must be \n     implemented based on the threat, the level of uncertainty \n     surrounding that threat, the vulnerability to attack, and the \n     criticality of assets.\n       Because the threat terrorists pose is dynamic and \n     countermeasures may become outdated, risk assessments must be \n     continually updated. A multi-disciplinary team of experts \n     selected by the Co-Coordinators should generate these \n     assessments as well as a plan for ensuring their currency. \n     Regularly scheduled exercises will provide an opportunity to \n     demonstrate and validate the national strategy. This process \n     is crucial to ensuring that initiatives are based on \n     reality and are proportional to the threat.\n       VII. Research and Development.--The research, development, \n     testing, and evaluation (RDT) of technologies to combat \n     domestic terrorism is currently under-exploited, yet holds \n     enormous potential to prevent--mainly through detection--\n     domestic terrorist incidents. The United States will never be \n     able to prevent all domestic terrorist incidents, but we have \n     an obligation to do more. If we fail to prevent, then we must \n     be ready to respond. Our expertise must be more aggressively \n     focused on technologies for detecting and analyzing chemical, \n     biological, explosives, nuclear, and radiological materials.\n       We recommend that the Co-Coordinators coordinate with all \n     the institutes in this country currently involved in RDT of \n     combating terrorism-related technologies. Among these \n     entities should be the first responders, the training \n     centers, the National Laboratories, the National Institute of \n     Justice, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, \n     the National Institutes of Health, the National Academy of \n     Sciences, private universities, and private industry. \n     Terrorist cells are increasingly adaptive with respect to \n     technology, and we must be able to anticipate future \n     capabilities. The Co-Coordinators should therefore be tasked \n     with coordinating a technological blueprint for the remainder \n     of the decade. This plan should be based on sound needs and \n     threat asscssments and should be set specific goals to be \n     accomplished within a defined time frame.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. This letter followed 3 days of hearings in which \nbipartisan Members of Congress asked detailed questions of some 46 \nFederal agencies. Senators Stevens, Warner, Shelby, Gregg, and Roberts \noffered this letter as a blueprint from which to eliminate the current \npatchwork quilt approach and renew attempts to forge a national \nstrategy to combat terrorism and safeguard our national security.\n  Let me warn that this act of terrorism may well be just the \nbeginning. We must understand our enemy. In this regard, I quote from a \nretired Army officer and author, Ralph Peters, who warned several years \nago:\n\n       These warriors are made up of the true believers, those who \n     will die for a cause, whether religion, a nationalist vision, \n     or a conviction of ethnic superiority, and a desire to avenge \n     wrongs suffered whether real or imagined. Even when they are \n     our enemies, they are heroes to their own people--another \n     thing we do not understand--witness the young Palestinians \n     waving flags upon learning of the terrorist attack against \n     the United States.\n       They do not deal rationally with our standards and we \n     falter when we rely on them to do so. Repeatedly, we have \n     failed to see the appeal of the upright man, perceived as \n     such by his own people, who hates us and who is willing to \n     propagate endless slaughter to drive us away and to use \n     weapons of mass destruction when required.\n       This pool certainly includes the Osama bin Ladens of the \n     world.\n\n  Again, we should not underestimate the nature and character of our \nenemies. And they are our enemies. Let me recommend to all of my \ncolleagues the book by Samuel P. Huntington, ``The Clash of \nCivilizations and the Remaking of the World Order.'' His book should be \nrequired reading for all of my colleagues and those within the national \nmedia and all interested in preserving democracy, freedom, and Western \nvalues.\n  He quotes Arthur Schlesinger Jr. as stating Europe and America are \nthe unique source of individual liberty, political democracy, and the \nrule of law, not to mention human rights and also cultural freedom. It \nis precisely these unique concepts that are now under attack and why we \nmust have an international response.\n  The principal responsibility of Western leaders, especially now, is \nnot to attempt to reshape other civilizations in the image of the West, \nwhich is beyond our power, but to preserve, to protect, to renew the \nunique qualities of Western civilization where they have been nurtured, \nappreciated, and taken root. That responsibility overwhelmingly falls \nto the United States of America.\n  That statement has foreign and national security policy ramifications \nthat deserve a great deal more comment on this floor at a later time.\n  I will add one other thing. Every witness before the Emerging Threats \nSubcommittee, when we asked about the threat against the United States, \nsaid: It is not a matter of if but when.\n  When is now. The tragedy is now. It will not stand. It will not \nstand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. CANTWELL. Mr. President, yesterday's vicious terrorist attack \nleft an uncounted number of Americans dead and injured, and countless \nothers grieving for friends and loved ones they have lost. We offer our \nhearts and prayers to those people, who have suffered a pain so deep it \nis beyond understanding. We support them in their pain and grief, we \nalso share it.\n  Every American was wounded in yesterday's attack, because it was an \nattack on our freedom and fundamental values as a people. Some have \ncalled this attack an act of madness, but it was not. It was an act of \nwar--an organized, coordinated, premeditated murder of thousands of \nAmericans, designed and carried out for political advantage. We will \nnot allow it to go unpunished.\n  We will stand behind our President as he brings our law enforcement, \nmilitary, and intelligence forces together to find these murderers and \ntheir allies. And as he takes the steps necessary to demonstrate \nclearly to all the world that terrorism against our nation will not be \ntolerated.\n  Here at home we must continue to work together to bind up the wounds \nof this nation and heal the widespread injuries and anxieties that \nthese acts have caused. We are profoundly grateful for the efforts and \nsacrifices made by the relief workers, police, and firefighters--and we \ndeeply grieve for those heroes who lost their lives yesterday in New \nYork trying to save others.\n  This isn't the first time terrorists have tried to attack the United \nStates--and it won't be the last. An orchestrated terrorist attack was \nstopped in Washington State when terrorists bringing explosives into \nthe United States from Canada were intercepted. They intended to plant \nbombs at a New Years Eve celebration in downtown Seattle and to kill as \nmany people as they could. Fortunately, that plot was uncovered and \nstopped. This time, we weren't so lucky.\n  Attacking this country is not enough to defeat it. It never has been. \nThis is something our enemies have discovered again and again. \nAmerica's history is the story of a Nation, of a people, who have \nrepeatedly overcome what have seemed like insurmountable challenges.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, America began as a nation by overcoming tyranny. We \nwill continue by overcoming terrorism, and we will do it without \nsacrificing who we are as Americans. We will do it by supporting those \nwho have been injured and giving sympathy and support to families who \nhave lost loved ones. We will do it by refocusing our efforts on more \nsecurity efforts, and we will do it by upholding the principles that we \nall believe in of ``liberty and justice for all.''\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as our Nation mourns, my prayers--our \nprayers--are directed to the victims and the families of the victims \nwho died yesterday at the hands of world terrorism.\n  As many have noted today, America finds itself at war. The question \nstill must be answered: Against whom? And what exactly will be our \nresponse? But the fact itself cannot be doubted. At this time, most \nobservers suppose that yesterday's terrorist attacks were perpetrated \nby a well-known terrorist group. My remarks will be based on that \nreasonable supposition. It is further supposed that these attacks could \nnot have been mounted without state complicity. There are strong \nsuspicions as to which state has primary culpability. Once that \ndetermination is made with reasonable certainty, the U.S. response must \ninclude a strategic assessment toward that regime, or possibly regimes, \nas well as tightening domestic security and reassessing our attitude \ntoward terrorism as war.\n  In the comments about yesterday's events, it is good to note that \nmost are\n\n[[Page S9311]]\n\ntalking about being at war rather than our usual tendency to look at \nthese acts as exclusively criminal acts. For example, in past U.S. \npolicy toward foreign-instigated terrorist attacks, such as the World \nTrade Center bombing in 1993, the U.S. Embassy attacks in Kenya and \nTanzania, Khobar Towers, or the U.S.S. Cole, they have been based on \nthe ``criminal model.'' This is the notion that our main task is to \ngather evidence, identify and apprehend perpetrators, and build a case \nsufficient to convict them beyond a reasonable doubt in the court.\n  This criminal model obscures the strategic implications, which should \nbe our main concern. The criminal model should be replaced with a \nwarfare model adapted to 21st century conditions in which war no longer \nmeans a confrontation along a defined front between armies fielded by \nindustrial states. Instead, under conditions in which the distinction \nbetween state and private violence is not relevant, war means \ndetermining within a moral certainty the responsible actors--state or \nnonstate--and delivering a devastating punitive and exemplary reprisal. \nConsideration should be given to a congressional declaration of war \nagainst such state and nonstate actors.\n\n  Based on past experience, it is inevitable that part of the response \nwill involve a further tightening of security procedures right here in \nthis country. These measures, which almost never are removed once they \nare put in place, have little utility, except to tighten Federal \ncontrol over Americans, and it really should be minimized. That is not \nto say we ought not look at them, consider them, and where they are \nbest used, estimate their value--but not overestimate the outcome. More \nimportantly, they are a measure of our failure of strategic vision.\n  Instead, we should concentrate on identifying the hijackers who flew \nthe airplanes to their targets, and determining how they entered the \nUnited States. This is what we ought to be about. Misguided efforts to \nrelax bars to aliens on whom security agencies have derogatory \ninformation should be shelved. Border controls should be tightened.\n  While targeted reprisal is a necessity, it should be accompanied by a \ncomprehensive reexamination of U.S. post-cold war strategy. Currently, \nthat strategy is largely based on cold war inertia, consisting \nprimarily of maintaining, extending, and perpetuating our status as \n``the world's sole-surviving superpower''--in effect, exercising global \nhegemony, and preventing the emergence of any potential rival, such as \nChina or Russia.\n  This policy, with its focus on global dominance rather than domestic \ndefense, where it should be, makes the United States more vulnerable to \nterrorist attack, not less. We have to look at global policy, but \nclearly we must focus now more than ever on domestic defense.\n  This policy must be replaced by one that places a priority on the \ndefense of our sovereignty, our people, and our territory. With regard \nto yesterday's attacks, our global strategy should be reexamined to \ninclude undermining the harboring regimes or regimes by diplomatic and \npossibly military means; adopting a more positive policy toward nearby \ncountries opposed to such regimes; and pressuring countries with which \nthe United States has friendly relations, but that may be supporting \nthe harboring regimes, to cease that support.\n  These efforts will require a thorough assessment of American policy. \nNo part of it can be left out. We do not stand in a situation of \nisolation today. Our neighbors will gather around us. Let us examine \nourselves into the 21st century. Let us use our ability in that context \nto shape a new foreign policy and resolve that what happened yesterday \nin this country shall never happen again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the calendar and history rarely \nperfectly coincide. It was remarked that the 20th century really began \nin August of 1914 with the commencement of European hostilities. It \nmay, on reflection, prove to be true that the 21st century did not \nbegin when that famous ball fell in Times Square; it began on September \n11, 2001.\n  The world has now been introduced to a new and difficult struggle \nagainst terrorism, asymmetrical war, held along the fissure lines of \nculture, prosperity, and commitment to law.\n  I regret that the front lines of this new struggle have formed \nthrough the communities I represent in northern New Jersey and our \nneighbors in New York City. Last night, children waited at home for \nparents who never arrived. Spouses held dinner for husbands and wives \nwho never came home. The battlefield of this new war was Manhattan and \nJersey City and Fort Lee and Queens. We are all soldiers.\n  There is a temptation to accept that this new chapter in the war on \nterrorism in a new century is merely a continuum of the same. Perhaps \nthe scale and the intensity is only different from Lebanon or Saudi \nArabia or, indeed, the World Trade Center itself 8 years ago.\n  By definition, it is fundamentally different. The very scale of this \nattack and the premeditation of those involved suggest that the \norganizations or the nations that planned this attack intended to \nstrike at the Government of the United States itself.\n  I offer these observations not because I differ from the President of \nthe United States but because I offer my support and because I believe \nthat, as a Congress and as Americans, we must all stand together in \nthis moment when we are all tested. But I do offer a difference in my \nobservation. The arbiter of this act of terrorism will never be a jury. \nIt is history. It is not those who were agents in the commission of \nthis crime that we seek but the organizations that are responsible.\n  At the outset, it must be made clear this is not a law enforcement \nmatter. It does not matter who rented the cars or even who flew the \nairplanes. They are agents of others. I will find no satisfaction in \ntheir indictment, whether they are alive or deceased. It is those who \nwrote the plan, harbored the conspirators, gave them sanctuary within \ntheir borders.\n  It is not enough that we are pursuing a legal case against those who \nare responsible for this crime. It has become axiomatic to suggest an \nact of war has been committed against the United States. Those are our \nwords. But our deeds are suggesting that we believe we were simply \nvictims of a hijacking, that a murder was committed, a crime of large \nproportions but ordinary in concept.\n  We are missing the point. If those who committed this crime wore \nuniforms or had a flag or a capital, the response of the United States \nwould be clear: This operation would be run from the military, not the \nJustice Department. It would be the Air Force, not the FBI, conducting \noperations.\n  I support the President of the United States, but I do believe, with \nall respect, we are not properly conceiving the magnitude of the \nmoment. A fissure of history was reached yesterday, and in all of our \nsorrow and our grief, we are not yet seizing the moment.\n  It is my belief the President of the United States should come to \nthis Congress and ask for a declaration that since September 11, 2001, \nthe U.S. Government is engaged in general hostilities against a series \nof terrorist organizations; that in these hostilities, we will not \nrespect the sovereignty of those nations that give safe harbor to those \nwho committed acts against our country and our people.\n\n  I recognize that it is not possible with precision to identify every \norganization that was complicitous or involved. I also do not believe \nthat it is necessary. Many of these terrorist organizations previously \ncommitted acts against the United States. Others are known to have \nplanned such operations. Many have the intention of committing such \nacts. Together they represent a network that is a worthy and legitimate \ntarget of our hostilities.\n  Second, I cannot return to the people of New Jersey who have lost \nhundreds or, tragically, even thousands of citizens without explaining \nthe role of the U.S. Government in their defense. The scale of what \noccurred in the last 48 hours may have been unpredictable, but the \nsource and the means and the targets were not.\n  The American people have trusted this Government through our \nintelligence communities to defend our Nation and its people and our \nvaried interests. This has not occurred. It is my\n\n[[Page S9312]]\n\nbelief that the President of the United States should form a board of \ngeneral inquiry to review the actions of the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity and the failures which led to this massive loss of life and \ncompromise of national security.\n  It can never be enough to explain that the unforeseeable happened to \nthe unprotectable because neither is the case.\n  Only two decades into the 20th century, Winston Churchill remarked: \nWhat an extraordinary disappointment the 20th century has been.\n  Here in our first year of a new century, on behalf of all those at \nhome who suffer, who have dealt with unconscionable acts, let me simply \nsay what a disappointment the 21st century has already been.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today our entire Nation confronts an evil \ninflicted upon it by those who resent our values and our way of life. \nAll of us address the Nation as Americans, not partisans. That is as it \nshould be when we are hit by a tragedy of this magnitude.\n  I first want to join my colleagues in assuring our fellow Americans \nour Government is carrying on the business of the people. Our Nation \nhas not bowed and will never bow to violence and terror.\n  Second, I join in expressing our love and concern for the victims of \nthese evil deeds. We will never forget them.\n  Third, if our words are to have effect, we have to change the way we \ndeal with terrorism. Things have changed. No nation can ever be \ncompletely safe from threats to its security, but sadly today our \nNation is forced to recognize what many of us have long known: that \nAmerica is vulnerable to attack. But there are steps we can take to \nmake it safer.\n  As members of the Intelligence Committee, and as chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate Judiciary's Subcommittee on Terrorism, \nrespectively, Senator Dianne Feinstein and I have held a series of \nhearings on recommendations about how to deal with terrorist threats. \nSome have to do with the overall organization of our Federal Government \nto deal with these threats and the aftermath of such attacks. Others \nbring Federal law into conformity with law enforcement and the \nintelligence community needs to pursue evidence and information \nnecessary both to thwart terrorist attacks or to prosecute the \nperpetrators.\n  Former FBI Director Louis Freeh testified before our Terrorism \nSubcommittee for several years that he needed certain legal authorities \nto investigate these kinds of crimes, including things such as trap and \ntrace authority which would give the FBI greater ability to trace \ncomputer crimes to their source; additionally, recommendations to put \ncountries on the terrorist lists that are not currently there but that \nought to be; to make a better effort to limit fundraising of terrorist \norganizations right here in the United States; to examine the so-called \nDeutch requirements pertaining to criteria for recruiting agents--this \ncripples our efforts to infiltrate certain terrorist organizations--to \nenhance information sharing and cooperation between law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies such as the FBI and the CIA; to examine the \nsafety of our airlines and our airports. Clearly, measures must be \ntaken to increase security here.\n  Two years ago, the major airlines at Boston's Logan Airport and the \nPort Authority were found to have committed 136 security violations. In \nthe majority of incidents, screeners hired by the airlines to staff \ncheckpoints in terminals routinely failed to detect test items such as \npipe bombs and guns. These glaring security failures must be the \nsubject of prompt congressional scrutiny. We must reevaluate our \nintelligence-gathering activities worldwide and devote appropriate \nresources.\n  The Nation had no warning of this attack, though it was clearly long \nplanned and very well coordinated. I join my colleagues in calling for \nprompt hearings to examine this failure of our intelligence network.\n  We must now assess how we ascertain what information is credible \nabout attacks from abroad and how we might have missed what was clearly \nan elaborate plot to undermine and demoralize the United States. In the \nprocess, we should recognize the information which would justify the \naction is very difficult to come by in cases such as this.\n  A very important point is that our Nation must decide how it is going \nto deal with terrorists and the nations that harbor them after attacks \nof this kind. President Bush, in his statement yesterday, emphasized \nthis point.\n  Terrorists are frequently protected internally by certain nations or \nthey are very much on the move and difficult to find. But after we have \nidentified who is responsible, if the perpetrators cannot be brought to \njustice in the United States, then, as other speakers have noted, we \nmust be prepared to take other appropriate action.\n  The legal authority to do that could be in a new form of declaration \nof war, a war on the terrorists who engaged in this evil activity, as \nwell as those who harbor and support them. In the end, the greatest way \nfor us, as leaders, to confirm our commitment to the victims of this \nevil is to dedicate ourselves to a real and forceful battle against \nthis terrorism. Action not words, that is the challenge before us. As \nPrime Minister Winston Churchill said in 1940, ``Let us brace ourselves \nto our duties.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, we awoke yesterday to a much different \nworld than the world we are required to accept today. On the most basic \nand fundamental level, we have lost the lives of heroes and victims, \nand we know that behind the devastating numbers we have all been seeing \nare real people, with real families, with real lives, with real \naccomplishments, and real hopes. We also know sadly for all of us that \nwe can never, ever reclaim those lives.\n  We can honor them and remember them, and in their names we can devote \nourselves to take every action to assure that no other Americans have \nto make this supreme sacrifice.\n  My Scripture teaches us to weep with them that weep and be of the \nsame mind one toward another.\n  I speak now to the families of those who have been taken. We in this \nChamber cannot erase yesterday, although we wish with everything inside \nus that we could. In the difficult days and years to come, we will keep \ntheir lives and their names and their sacrifices in our hearts, and we \nwill translate our grief and our anger into a determination to prevent \nthis tragedy from ever being repeated.\n  I know this is little solace for their extraordinary loss, but it is \nan important commitment that I truly believe every one of them would \nwish us to make. We will not forget, and we will act.\n  For 225 years now, America has been more than a nation--state, more \nthan a set of borders, more than a piece of land. America is an idea, \nand that idea is freedom: Freedom of thought, freedom of movement, \nfreedom to shape our lives and our society the way we choose.\n  Yesterday morning, it was not just America that came under attack. It \nwas the hopes and aspirations of freedom-loving people all over this \nworld.\n  There is a reason America does not bow to terrorism. There is a \nreason we live by the rule of law and not the rule of the jungle. There \nis a reason we return to our homes and offices and reclaim our skies \nand our pride. There is a reason we will marshal our resources, all our \nresolve and the awesome strength of our military to catch these death \nmongers, to punish them, to make them pay for what they have done to us \nand our people because we surrender our freedom to no one.\n  I commend President Bush for his leadership in this extraordinarily \ndifficult time. I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nstand with him.\n  From time to time, from issue to issue, the votes in this Chamber are \ndivided, but when it comes to defeating terrorism and hate, the Senate \nwill not be divided.\n  Some have wondered, in the aftermath of this tragedy, whether our \ncountry will ever be the same. We need to make our airports safer, and \nwe will. We need to make our flights more secure and their flight \npatterns more inviolate, and we will. We need to do\n\n[[Page S9313]]\n\nmore to root out terrorism in the countries where it is tolerated, \nfunded, and harbored, and the world can rest assured that we will.\n  The strength of our Nation is measured not in airport scanners or in \nflight controls; it is measured in the grit and the will of our people \nwhen it is needed the most. By that standard, America is the strongest, \ntoughest, most resilient Nation on the face of the Earth.\n  Scripture also tells us ``whoever shall be great among you, let him \nbe your minister; and whoever shall be chief among you, let him be your \nservant.''\n  Mr. President, we glimpsed that greatness yesterday in the rescue \nefforts in New York City and at the Pentagon--policemen, firemen, \nmilitary personnel, and so many brave volunteers putting themselves and \ntheir lives in harm's way to help others. Too many of them paid the \nultimate price for their acts of courage.\n  My Senate office was flooded yesterday with calls from concerned \npeople in North Carolina, people who wanted to give blood, to donate \nclothes and blankets, to open their hearts in this time of solidarity. \nI am especially proud that a group of Marines from Camp LeJeune in \nJacksonville, NC, is preparing to leave for New York now to assist in \nany way they can.\n  Today, we can't help but think how fragile is the safety and security \nwe have been taking for granted. But throughout our history, we have \nweathered war and pestilence; we have met every kind of disaster, both \nnatural and manmade; we have mastered every challenge and conquered \nevery foe.\n  The spirit of America is strong. The power of freedom will overcome. \nAnd by reaffirming that freedom through strength, justice, and \ncompassion, we will honor the memory of those who have departed and \ngive renewed purpose to those of us who must now carry on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, President Bush last night did what many of \nus do in times of trouble: He prayed. When we prayed last night, we did \nso not only for those who were injured or killed yesterday, but for \nwhat our nation and people are still to face.\n  After the horror of yesterday, there are still other horrors to come. \nOne of those horrors will be the casualty figures. The disaster is so \nlarge we don't even yet know how large it is. Some time, in the next \nfew weeks, we are going to hear a number, the number of the dead and \npermanently missing. It will probably be in the thousands.\n  I would like to take a moment to mention Capt. Jason M. Dahl, the \npilot of United Airlines Flight 93. This 43-year-old Ken-Caryl Ranch, \nCO, father spent most of his workdays training others to fly Boeing \n757's and 767's. That way, according to newspaper reports, he got to \nspend more time with his wife and teenage son, Matthew. But trainers \nmust fly every so often, and Dahl apparently scheduled himself on \nFlight 93. He died yesterday morning when the plane slammed down into a \nPennsylvania field. This is one name, one short background, and there \nwill be thousands more.\n  But America is strong. No terrorist can undermine our country. There \nis no casualty figure that could come from this that will make us lose \nour fundamental purpose as a nation and a people. Anyone who doubts \nthis only needs to look at the flags popping up on streets, the lines \noutside blood donation centers, the supplies being gathered for the \nsurvivors. America has long exported compassion by responding to \nAfrican droughts and Central American hurricanes and European \nearthquakes. Now we have to deal with a massive tragedy in our own \nland, and I am sure we will do so strongly.\n  I was in a meeting yesterday dealing with Middle East security when \nmy Chief of Staff came in and told us that the building was being \nevacuated. It occurs to me that aspects of life in the Middle East--\nterrorist attacks, public fear and public mourning, heavy domestic \nsecurity, checkpoints, rigid airline safeguards--could quite possibly \nbe incorporated into the American way of life as well. Things that we \nhave seen before only on TV broadcasts from foreign lands could be \nbrought home to us, right here in America.\n  I trust the Nation will understand that these new measures might \nchange our lives, but not our way of life. Increased security might, \nfor instance, add to travel time, but not effect our ability to travel. \nJust as we learned to live with safety wrapping on store bought items \nand metal detectors in public buildings, we are going to have to learn \nwith new airport and border security.\n  Our Nation once also learned, through necessity, to deal with the \npotential of nuclear war. Some of the old Cold War defenses we \nincorporated into our lives were even able to assist us in this new war \nwe face. The North American Areospace Defense center--NORAD--in \nColorado Springs was monitoring the highjacked airplanes yesterday.\n  We in the Government are going to have to answer ``What next?'' The \nSenate has already approved supporting increased resources in the war \nto eradicate terrorism, and supporting the president in punishing the \nperpetrators of the attacks.\n  The phrase ``war on terrorism'' has been used lightly before. This is \na war. And this war cannot be fought by, as I have heard it mentioned, \nby just using cruise missiles to blow up tents in a desert.\n  I thank again the thousands of personnel who have responded, in New \nYork, Pennsylvania and Washington, to the crisis. Especially those \nwhose response only meant that they themselves became victims of this \nhostile tragedy.\n  This morning New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said ``we are better than \nthey are.'' A simple statement, but it accurately reflects a truth. \nAmerica is better than evil terrorists, America is better than sneak \nattacks on innocent civilians, America is better than fanatics, and \nAmerica will prevail in this crisis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today we know our duty as Americans. We \nwill bury our dead, we will comfort our wounded, we will honor our \nheroes, and we will protect and defend our Nation. We will stand as one \nagainst the treachery visited on America on Tuesday, September 11, in \nthe year 2001.\n  We invite our friends and allies among the civilized nations to not \nonly share our grief but also to share our determination to end the \nscourge of terrorism. The enemies of America, the enemies of freedom, \nunleashed their fury yesterday in New York and at the Pentagon in an \neffort to destroy our resolve. Our enemies have failed.\n  Today our hearts are heavy for all of the innocent lives lost and \nscarred by these barbaric terrorists. But our resolve has not been \nshaken. We stand as one, committed to freedom. We stand as one, \ncommitted to tolerance. We stand as one against those who kill the \ninnocent in the name of righteousness. We stand as one against those \nwho in the name of God perpetrated godless acts.\n  In the days ahead, we will undoubtedly learn of unparalleled, \nselfless courage by so many, the firefighters and police, who awakened \nyesterday as they did every day of their professional lives, pinned \ntheir badges and shields over their hearts, and risked their lives for \npeople whose names they never knew, of the hundreds of firefighters who \nstreamed into that inferno at the World Trade Center while every human \ninstinct told them to flee the overwhelming danger. We will never know \nthe details of their many courageous acts nor about the battles waged \non the airliners hijacked by the terrorists. But we owe the deepest \ndebt of gratitude to all of those Americans who demonstrated remarkable \nheroism at America's time of testing.\n\n  I say to the families of those fallen heroes and to all of those who \nsuffered a loss from this violence: This Nation will stand by you as \nyou rebuild your community and your life.\n  I say to our friends in Israel: This attack on America was an attack \non our alliance and our common values.\n  The terrorists set out to bring America to its knees. Instead, they \nhave brought America to its feet, stronger than ever in our alliance \nwith Israel and more understanding of the price terrorism exacts from \nthe heart and soul of people.\n\n[[Page S9314]]\n\n  A word of caution to all of us: As we identify the sources of \nterrorism, it is possible we will look to an Arab person, or a group of \nArab people, or those of the Muslim faith. We should never allow those \nfacts, if they turn out to be true, to cloud our judgment when it comes \nto our fellow Arab Americans and those who believe and practice the \nMuslim faith. Many of them share with us the pain and sorrow of \nyesterday's tragedy.\n  Let me bring this tragedy very close to home. During the course of \nthe Civil War, Abraham Lincoln came to Washington as the new President. \nThe States began to divide into the Confederacy and the Union. When he \narrived, this Capitol dome which you see outside was under \nconstruction. Many people went to the President and said: Mr. \nPresident, we can't afford to wage a war and build this Capitol dome. \nHe said: Yes, we can, because that Capitol dome represents the unity of \nthis country and what we will be after this war. During the Civil War, \nhe continued the construction of that great dome we see today. And \nLincoln was right.\n  We should a take lesson from that. As we talk about security in \nAmerica, we should understand that one of the prime targets is the \nbuilding I speak from--this Nation's Capitol, which attracts millions \nof visitors every single year. We owe those visitors, their families, \nand the thousands of people who work here the security and peace of \nmind of knowing that we have done everything we can to protect them in \nthis age of terrorism. That means building a national visitors center, \none which provides the security they deserve. This beautiful 19th \ncentury building should have 21st century security. I am happy to say \nthat Senator Bennett of Utah as well as leaders on both sides of the \naisle believe this is the moment when we should make that commitment to \nthe national visitors center.\n  The last item to which I will make reference is a small one, but it \nis especially irritating. Yesterday in my home State of Illinois, after \nthis tragedy was reported in New York, many gas stations across our \nState raised the price of gasoline dramatically to as high as $5 a \ngallon. Profiteering in a time of national crisis is the lowest form of \ncitizenship. It is little better than looting during a national \ntragedy. I have called on the residents of Illinois to report to me \nthose stations that did it. They should be ashamed. And we will report \ntheir findings and their stories to the investigation of the unfair \ngasoline prices we have seen in the Midwest.\n  Let me close by saying this: America will be tested now. We will be \ntested because of this tragedy yesterday. Some people said if we can \njust identify that one person who is the leader of this terrorist group \nand somehow capture or take him away, we will end the terrorism. That \nis so naive. Cutting off the head of one serpent doesn't clear a \nviper's nest. This is a network of terrorism throughout the world that \nreally threatens every civilized nation, and we have to understand the \ncomplexity of the challenge we face.\n  In closing, I am reminded of the comments of Winston Churchill in the \nHouse of Commons on October 8, 1940:\n\n       Death and sorrow will be the companions of our journey; \n     hardship our garment; constancy and valor our only shield. We \n     must be united, we must be undaunted, we must be inflexible.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, perhaps because I represent the State \nthat has the youngest age population in the country, I approach this \nsubject from a different point of view.\n  Many have said that this terrible, cowardly attack against our \ncountry by terrorists is similar to the experience we had at Pearl \nHarbor. I think perhaps Senator Inouye and Senator Akaka might have had \nsimilar experiences. But those of us who were alive and part of the \nyounger generation then did not have the experiences that our young \npeople had yesterday as they watched and were just mesmerized by the \nlive coverage as two great buildings collapsed, of people jumping from \nthose buildings, of the knowledge of how many people were killed and \ninjured, of seeing our Pentagon struck.\n  This vividness has affected the young people of our country much more \nthan Pearl Harbor affected us. We had been acculturated to the fact \nthat we were going to war. We had watched in the newsreels in 1939, in \n1940, and 1941 the Germans marching across Europe and the Japanese \nraping Nanking. Such things came at us in a small bite, as we might \ncall it today, with a little exposure here and there.\n  If our generation truly is the greatest generation, it is because of \nour parents and our guardians and our teachers. They prepared us for \nwhat we knew would be our duty to fight a war to restore freedom in the \nworld.\n  Our young people yesterday saw just this total exposure to death and \nthe effects of terrorism. I think we have to be aware of that. They \nhave not been prepared as young people in this period of time, when \nthey have all of these freedoms to the exposure through so many means \nof communication and acquisition and knowledge. I believe our young \npeople are in a state of shock. It is time we thought about that and \nwhat it means to America to have this sudden awareness by so many \npeople, particularly young children and the younger generation, \nbecoming exposed to the visible impact of terrorist activity.\n  We don't live in a country like Israel where they have been attacked \non the streets and they have seen bombing every day. We have really \nbeen living the life of luxury in terms of not being exposed to this \ntype of activity. But it is here now. We were exposed to it yesterday. \nI don't think it is over.\n  I call on the Senate and the Congress and the President. I hope we \nthink about the young people. I hope we take the time to explain to \nthem why we are going to retaliate. I hope we take the time to explain \nto them why we are going to change some of the security procedures of \nour country in terms of getting on and off interstate and even local \ntransportation. I hope we explain to them why there are no people in \nthe gallery here today--which I object to, by the way.\n  But I think it is incumbent on those of us who are mature to try to \nguide these people toward the goal we hope they will pursue with us; \nthat is, the goal of pursuing the perpetrators of these vicious \nterrorist attacks against the United States, and to support us in what \nwe have to do. We should take time to understand their feelings. We \nshould take the time to try to explain to them why we may not react the \nsame way they would.\n  I had calls from all over the country yesterday. I don't know if \neveryone else did. I assume so. I certainly had an enormous number of \ncalls from home. They were asking if I was safe and if my family and my \nstaff were safe. And the totality of the experience they had, people \naround the country, in viewing what went on--I have to say myself, I \nwas totally shocked when I saw that first tower come down. And then \nwhen the second one came down, I just felt a lump in my stomach.\n\n  The point is, I hope we act in terms of understanding that we have a \njob to lead the country, to have people understand what we are going to \ndo in the future. If I have anything to do with it, we will finish our \nwork here very quickly. I think we should bury our differences, find a \nway to move the appropriations bills, deal with the subjects we have to \ndeal with, and go back to our homes to try to assist people in \nunderstanding why we are going to act as we must act; that is, we must \ndeliver the most fierce retaliation against these people that the world \nhas ever seen, because if we do not--if we do not--we are going to have \nsome copycats around the world who think they, too, can take a crack at \nthis country. That is something I would not like to see.\n  But I hope we all keep in mind and think of the young people, think \nof the children, and try to explain to them what they saw and why we \nare going to do what we must do.\n  Mr. President, II Corinthians, 4:8-9, states:\n\n     We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed;\n     Perplexed, but not in despair;\n     Persecuted, but not abandoned;\n     Struck down, but not destroyed.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yesterday's terrorist atrocities against \ninnocent Americans were vicious and horrifying. They were acts of \nunspeakable cruelty unleashed against the American people in a shameful \nattempt\n\n[[Page S9315]]\n\nto spread chaos throughout our nation and instill fear in the hearts of \nour citizens. But such acts will not succeed, and they never will \nsucceed.\n  No American will ever forget watching a hijacked civilian aircraft \ncrash into the towers of the World Trade Center, or seeing the plume of \nsmoke rise from the Pentagon in the aftermath of the terrorist attack. \nNo American will ever forget the sense of anger and vulnerability that \nswept our nation yesterday, when thousands of innocent lives were \nsuddenly, and senselessly ended by the vicious acts.\n  My heart goes out to the victims of this attack and their loved ones. \nThe American people share our anger, our grief--and our resolve. We \ncannot bring back the lives of the fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, \nbrothers, sisters, relatives, and friends--although we wish desperately \nthat we could. We cannot yet fully answer the complex questions that \nhaunt the country about this atrocity. As we search for and find the \nanswers, we pray for the victims and their loves ones, and we hope that \nthey will find a measure of peace and comfort from our prayers.\n  This is a massive tragedy for America, and we must make clear that \nour national resolve will not be weakened. Our country has been tested \nand tried in the past, and we have always emerged stronger and wiser. \nWe will do so again now. America's commitment to the values of freedom \nand justice has not been shaken in the past. It will not be shaken by \nthese acts of terrorism.\n  I commend President Bush for his strong statement last evening about \nfinding and punishing the perpetrators of this atrocity. Those who \nmurder American citizens must have no safe hiding place, and those who \nshelter terrorists must be punished as well. America will do everything \npossible to apprehend the perpetrators and to identify and punish those \nwho give them aid and comfort.\n  Like December 7, 1941, September 11, 2001 will be remembered as a day \nthat will live in infamy. Just as the Pearl Harbor attack galvanized \nthe American people in their resolve to prevail in the war against \nfascism and tyranny, I am confident that yesterday's attack on the \nAmerican people will galvanize our citizens and strengthen our spirit \nto prevail in the ongoing war against global terrorism.\n  It is tragic that these criminals were able to succeed in carrying \nout the most brutal terrorist attack in history on American soil. I \npledge to work with the President, the Congress, and the families of \nthe victims to seek answers to the many questions that exist, and to do \nall we can to strengthen the security of our people and to prevent such \natrocities in the future. The American flag flies high today, and so \ndoes our commitment to our ideals here at home and all around the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend my friend from Alaska for talking \nabout the impact of this extraordinary violence on children. I think \nmany of us have heard about and seen, as we were getting ready to come \nto work this morning, the counseling that is being provided to \nAmerica's parents and children about how to cope with this violence.\n  As we seek to find those who perpetrated the crimes, we must also be \nresolute and sensitive to the extraordinary concerns about violence \nthat will have an impact on a whole generation of children.\n  We have not focused extensively on this subject in the hours that we \nhave discussed this resolution, but I thank the Senator for bringing \nthis up. He is active in supporting the interests of children, and I \nthink his point is extremely well taken.\n  This resolution was overwhelmingly supported by all Members. It is \nwhat we can do today. There will be other opportunities to support \nactivities to address this tragedy.\n  The resolution recognizes the extraordinary suffering and the losses \nthat have been experienced by so many families in America today. I \nthink the focus, rightfully so, has been on New York, Pennsylvania, and \nalso the Pentagon. But in my own State of Massachusetts, we have 39 \nparents who will not be returning home this evening. We have dozens of \nchildren who will be missing one parent, and in some instances, even \ntwo parents. There are scores of people who worked in the World Trade \nCenter who were from Massachusetts as well. And that has been generally \ntrue about so many other States.\n  Although the targets were in New York and the Pentagon--and Lord only \nknows where the other plane was headed--all families feel an \nextraordinary threat to their lives and well-being and to the lives and \nwell-being of their children. So we all reach out to them.\n  I can remember very well the extraordinary way people came together \nin my State when five extraordinary firefighters perished in a fire in \nWorcester, MA, just a little over a year ago. They were brave \nvolunteers, who sought to save two homeless people, and we now know \nthat the homeless people had left after the fire had started. Because \nof the concern for the two homeless people, they volunteered and went \nin, and all of them perished. I remember the impact that this had not \nonly on Worcester but on our State.\n  When I heard, for the first time yesterday, of the loss of some 225 \nfirefighters, more than 50 police officers, and scores of rescue \nworkers, it is something that families in my State felt very deeply \nabout. I know Americans across this country feel very deeply about it.\n  We say our prayers for the victims and their families. We reach out \nto them. We feel, to the greatest extent that we possibly can, the \nsenselessness of this violence. And we resolve with them to bring to \njustice the perpetrators.\n  I support this resolution because it commits this Nation to bring the \nperpetrators of the terrorism to justice. We have all heard the \nspeeches here, and we are all resolute in this.\n  I join with my colleagues who hope that we will have the opportunity \nfor resolution. It appears from the briefings we have received that we \nhave had good fortune in moving the investigation forward, and I hope \nthat we will be able to identify those who perpetrated the crimes and \nthose that supported them. There is some indication for that hope, as \nwe have heard over the last days. But as has been pointed out, we will \nneed to be resolute in this undertaking.\n  We have 13 families in Massachusetts who lost relatives Pan Am Flight \n103. Yet, it was only a few months ago that many of our colleagues were \ntalking about lifting the sanctions. Many of our European allies, many \nof our oldest friends in Europe wanted to abolish those sanctions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I can still name the names of those families who lost \npeople on Pan Am flight 103.\n  Years after the Pan Am flight, if we are interested in combating \nterrorism, we are going to have to stay the course, stay resolute, \npersevere, and stay consistent.\n  Finally, I hope at this time we will not look for scapegoats. I hope \nthat we are going to be careful, particularly with regard to our Arab-\nAmerican friends. I hope that we will free ourselves from scapegoating \nand from the kind of conduct which would be helpful to terrorists who \nare interested in dividing this Nation in so many different ways.\n  We reject that. We must stick with the facts and follow them where \nthey lead us and not involve ourselves in that kind of activity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I think all of us who have an \nelection certificate and who have been called upon to represent the \ncitizens of our State feel an obligation today to come together as \nAmericans, not as Republicans and Democrats but to come together in a \nway that says symbolically and in reality to our constituents that our \nship of state is still on course.\n  Yesterday, America was called to endure yet another day of infamy. \nAnd in times of infamy, in times of tragedy, I find it helpful for us \nto refocus on the fundamentals that make us a great nation and a great \npeople.\n  So I say to my friends, my constituents of the great State of Oregon, \nthat this is a time to come together as a country the way the U.S. \nSenate today is showing it can.\n  Indeed, it is time, as individuals, to reach out to our neighbors, to \nlove them better, to hold our families closer, and to serve our country \nwith more\n\n[[Page S9316]]\n\ndetermination than ever in the way we live our lives.\n  Yesterday I was, like all, shaken beyond words at this tragedy and \nwas soon hustled into a room--a secure room--where I was in the \npresence of Senator Daschle, Senator Lott, Senator Nickles, Senator \nReid, Tom DeLay of the House, and a number of others.\n  It was not a large group, but it was a group that normally has daily \ndifferences. Those differences melted away, and what remained were \nAmericans determined to seek the greatest good of our country.\n  That is the kind of unity that has preserved America through days of \ninfamy of the past and can sustain us yet again today and in the \nfuture.\n  When I spoke about focusing on fundamentals, this morning I got out \nmy little copy of the Constitution. The preamble is worth reading, as \nwe, Members of this body, consider our responsibilities:\n\n       We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the \n     general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this \n     Constitution for the United States of America.\n\n  That preamble, that set of values, brought people of diverse \ninterests together to make of States united States and the United \nStates the leader of the free world. Freedom is not free. America knows \nthat now in a renewed fashion.\n  Our duty in this Senate, in this Congress, and in this country is now \nto rescue what victims remain alive and to comfort the families of \nthose victims who have perished. It is to restore our institutions and \nset aright the shaken confidence many feel.\n  Then it is to seek retribution that is careful but certain and as \nswift as possible. When I say that freedom is not free, I believe the \nAmerican people will expect of us a heightened sense of security, but \nthe balance, we must remember, is that as we seek security we not \ntrample on liberty.\n  The great test of our time in this tragedy, as one who supports \nwithout reservation the State of Israel, is how we treat our Arab \nbrothers and sisters who are citizens of this land. We must not repeat \nthe mistakes of the past. We must be careful.\n  We are the leader of the free world. We must not trample on freedom, \nas we continue to lead. We are the leader of the civilized world. Our \nretribution must not target in any way innocent civilians. They are the \nleaders of the uncivilized world, and we saw their work yesterday. \nAmerica is called to lead in a different way. We are called to lead the \ncivilized and the free.\n  I say, God bless our fellow citizens who perished yesterday. I say, \nGod bless America.\n  I take this opportunity to recognize some Oregonians who are doing \ntheir part to respond to this tragedy. The Oregon Disaster Medical \nAssistance Team has assembled and is prepared for immediate deployment \nby the Office of Emergency Preparedness. Many of their colleagues have \nalready been deployed; the Oregon team is still on the ground awaiting \navailability of air transport. Their courage and willingness to serve \nis one of many bright lights that have brightened this dark day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to support this resolution.\n  Yesterday was a terrible day of terror. Today to me seems even worse. \nYesterday, perhaps because the acts of war that were carried out \nagainst our people were so horrific, we responded. We moved forward. \nBut it all seemed unreal. Today when I awoke, it seemed painfully real. \nIt reminded me of terrible days in my personal life when I have \nexperienced a loss of a loved one. You cope, and then you wake up with \nthe reality and the pain is deeper.\n  We all feel that today, and we can only imagine, therefore, how deep \nand pervasive is the pain of those many families whose lives have been \ndevastated by the acts of terror that were carried out yesterday.\n  I pray that God will be with them and the souls of their loved ones \nwho are gone, that they will find comfort in good memories and strength \nfrom their faith in God.\n  I have been very proud to be a Member of the Senate over these last \nfew days. And it continues today, as I listen to the statements we have \nheard in this Chamber which should leave no doubt of our resolve nor \nour unity in holding accountable those who attacked us yesterday and \nsought to destroy our Nation.\n  Today we are filled with the deepest feelings of anger and outrage. \nWe want retaliation, and we will have it. We will not rest until we \nknow who perpetrated these evils, and we will then respond with the \nfull force of the righteous might that President Roosevelt summoned in \n1941.\n  We must be careful not to mistake swift punishment for lasting peace. \nWe are at war. That is true. But this war is dramatically different \nfrom the one we engaged in after Pearl Harbor. In this struggle, \nvengeance is not victory. Retaliation for yesterday's atrocities is \nonly the end of the beginning of what should be our response, not the \nbeginning of the end of that response.\n  If, in fact, as this resolution says, we are acknowledging that we \nare in a war against terrorism, then we must understand that this war \nis not against a single known enemy but a broad and elusive threat from \nthe forces of terror. And if we are to win this war, if we are to \nprotect our security and freedom, we must adapt both offensively and \ndefensively to the true nature of this threat and commit ourselves to a \nlong and difficult struggle.\n  We have several challenges ahead of us. First, of course, we must \nidentify and punish the perpetrators. We must also honestly then assess \nour vulnerability here at home and then take swift and strong action to \nfortify the security of our critical national infrastructure from \nattack and to improve the ability of national and State and local \nauthorities to respond to such attacks. We must consider with renewed \npurpose the proposals that have been made to create a new agency with \nresponsibility for defense of our homeland, for the decades of security \nthat our two oceans have given us are over. Our enemies can strike at \nus with terrorism, with cyberattacks, or with ballistic missiles. We \nmust raise our guard here at home to those attacks.\n  We have been warned by many experts that the threats we will face in \nthe 21st century would be different and more diffuse than those we had \nfaced over the last half century. That is why we have embarked on a \npath of transforming our military and other Government agencies to \nbetter prepare to wage and defend this new warfare.\n  We must now move, after yesterday, with far greater urgency, for our \nenemies will not wait. They will not delay. They will continue to work \nwith single-minded determination to find our points of weakness and \nstrike at them.\n  We must match and exceed their focus and determination. In doing so, \nwe must not work and fight alone. This is not just our war. This is a \nwar against democracy itself. In defending against those attacks, the \nworld's other democratic nations must join together with us.\n  I am grateful for the decision by the North Atlantic Council today to \nfind the acts of yesterday essentially acts, under article 5, acts of \nwar against us which are acts of war against all of them.\n  If we are truly involved in a war against terrorism, then our allies \nin Europe and elsewhere must come to our side as we came to theirs in \nWorld War II and not tolerate and deal with and maintain normal \nrelations of commerce or diplomacy with nations that harbor terrorists. \nWe must convince them that they will either be allies of allies or \nallies of our enemies.\n  History rarely offers respite to victors. We won a magnificent \ntriumph in the cold war. After World War II, we were once again at the \npinnacle of power. But, once again, we face a new form of tyranny. I am \nconfident that we can and will rise to defeat this new challenge just \nas we defeated the communism that rose to face us after World War II. \nOur love of liberty has not diminished, nor has our common sense of \npurpose in protecting it.\n  Succeed we can and succeed we must. The lives of our people, the \nsecurity of our society, and the strength of our democracy depend on \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n[[Page S9317]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, yesterday was a day of great darkness, the \nlikes of which we have never seen before. Yesterday we saw the face of \nevil in a cowardly and reprehensible act against the United States. The \ntragic events were a grave reminder of our Nation's vulnerability.\n  Sadly, the light of a new day has continued to show us that the \nhorror of yesterday was all too real. Our worst nightmare has come \ntrue.\n  We all lost something yesterday, something very precious and \nsomething very real. I don't think we will ever again look at the \nfootage of terrorist activities overseas quite the same way again. The \ncomforting thought that protected us in the past, ``It can't happen \nhere'' is no longer comforting, because it has been shown to us in very \nreal and stark terms--it can happen here.\n  President Bush has stated his resolve to find those responsible for \nthis attack and bring them to justice. I support him in this effort and \nI am confident that President Bush, together with the members of \nCongress and the people of America will come together in the next days \nand weeks as we mourn our dead and honor the memory of those who died \nin the attacks or subsequent rescue efforts.\n  Yesterday threatens to increase the anger we already feel in our \nhearts and make us cry out for revenge against someone, anyone.\n  We will not allow that to happen. We all know the real goal of \nterrorism is to turn neighbor against neighbor to make us fear and \nmistrust the people of our communities. With God's strength and \nsupport, and our faith and trust in Him, we can show that we are bigger \nand stronger than that.\n  Our strength as a nation comes from the different backgrounds, \ncultures, talents and abilities of our people. E Pluribus Unum, One out \nof many, is our Nation's motto for a reason. Yesterday we saw people of \nevery race, religion and creed working together as Americans to help \nthose affected by yesterday's attacks.\n  We will continue that work in the coming weeks, and, as we do, we \nwill do something we have not had to do for many, many years. The task \nof cleaning up, repairing and building that looms before us is great, \neven for the greatest nation on earth.\n  Yesterday's events will raise a lot of questions that will need to be \nanswered as we do our work. How did it happen? Why did it happen? What \ncan we do to ensure it does not happen again?\n  They are all good questions and they will be investigated and \nanswered. Vice President Cheney has already been working on ways to \nimprove and increase our intelligence gathering efforts. Now these \nimprovements must be given the highest priority. As the Ranking Member \nof the International Operations and Terrorism Subcommittee of the \nForeign Relations Committee, I pledge my time and my efforts to work \nwith Members on both sides of the aisle and the Administration to \naddress all the issues raised by these cowardly attacks.\n  As do most Americans, I find it difficult to understand how someone \ncould plan and carry out an attack such as the one we witnessed \nyesterday. Part of our work will be to review and reconsider our \nforeign policies and to increase our awareness and sensitivity to the \nfact that our actions abroad are not always supported by some members \nof the international community. We need to be aware that there are \nthose who hate the United States for who we are and what we represent \nin the world. There are those who view our nation and the freedom we \nrepresent as a threat to themselves and their way of life.\n  We will rebuild our cities, we will refresh our spirit, and we will \nrenew our commitment to the principles upon which our country was \nfounded. As Mayor Giuliani said this morning, as we roll up our sleeves \nand get to work, we will emerge stronger than ever and face the future \nwith a renewed spirit, united more strongly as one nation under God \nthan we ever have been before.\n  It is time for us to reassure each other, to reach out to our \nneighbors, and to console our children that the world isn't a bad \nplace, although there are bad people who live in it to be sure.\n  As we prepared to go to bed last night, I thought about the days \nyears ago when I, as a father, would listen to my children say their \nprayers before they went to sleep at night. ``And now I lay me down to \nsleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, \nI pray the Lord my soul to take.''\n  I thought about our children all over this country and around this \nworld who went to bed last night who said those words and found a \nterrifying and frightening new meaning in them. They will all need the \ncalm and reassuring touch of their mothers and fathers to assure them \nthat they are safe and we are there to protect them.\n  Those that are responsible for this act of terrorism tried to take \nour spirit just as certainly as they tried to take as many lives as \nthey could. They acted without regard for those in their path, just as \nthey acted without regard for our freedoms or our way of life.\n  There is a price that will be paid for their actions. Maybe not today \nor tomorrow, but we will soon know who is responsible for these \nterrible acts of violence and they will be held accountable.\n  There will be a time for that, someday in the future. As the Bible \ntells us, there is a time for everything and a season for all things.\n  Now is the time to find the facts, develop a plan and make sure that \nevery step we take in these next few days is warranted and necessary. \nFor we are the most powerful nation on earth, and that brings with it a \ncertain responsibility. The world looks to us now to see what we will \ndo next, how we will handle the leadership the world has seen us \nexercise so well for so many years.\n  Now is also a time for healing and rebirth--for coming together in \npride as Americans. Now is the time to renew our commitment to freedom \nand the principles upon which we are founded. Now is the time to reach \nout in prayer to God and to each other.\n  But for those who hear the sound of my voice and think we may falter \nin our commitment to America and our way of life, make no mistake. The \nlight of freedom may flicker from time to time, but it always returns \nto a brilliance and luster just like the torch held proudly aloft by \nthe Statue of Liberty.\n  One thing the terrorists never understood is that we are a nation of \nmore than just symbols, and landmarks and monuments, though they are \nall important and beloved by us all. We are a nation of strength and \nspirit and freedom and we will never yield our commitment to our \nprinciples, to each other and to our shared future.\n  Last night, today, and for a long time to come, people in Wyoming, in \nWashington, in New York and all over the country will be holding prayer \nvigils, attending Church services, and reaching out to one another in \nan embrace of faith, hope and love. That is how we will continue, one \npeople, one step at a time, to assure each other of our support for \neach other and to ensure that this terrible tragedy never happens \nagain.\n  We also join in prayer for the victims of this tragedy, for their \nfamilies, friends and loved ones. We proudly recognize the efforts of \nour brave firemen, police and rescue workers who risked their lives to \nhelp those in need. Your efforts were greatly appreciated. You will \nnever be forgotten.\n  Yesterday we witnessed both chambers of this great Congress come \ntogether as one, united in plan, purpose and resolve. May we continue \nto work together to make our nation stronger and the world a better \nplace for us all. It won't be easy, but that never has not and never \nwill stop us. May God bless and keep us all firm in our resolve.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today not as a Democrat or as a \nRepublican, but as an American. The vicious, premeditated terrorist \nattack on our country cannot stand. We are joined in common purpose to \ndefend our Nation and to strike back against those who have committed \nthese crimes against humanity. Operating under the cloak of secrecy, \nthey destroyed the lives of thousands of men, women, and children who \nwere completely innocent.\n  Those innocents were not combatants in any cause. They were merely \ntraveling to rejoin their families, or going to work, or heading for a \nholiday. They were harming no one. But terrorists bent on destruction \ntransformed airliners into flying bombs and attacked them, attacked us, \nand attacked America.\n\n[[Page S9318]]\n\n  Let the word go out that we will not be deterred, we will not be \ndefeated, we will not be denied basic justice. These evil perpetrators \nof mindless violence will be pursued and found, and they will be held \nto account.\n  Let these adversaries understand that they have aroused the awful \nwrath of a mighty nation. We are united, we are determined, we are \ncommitted, and we will prevail. God bless America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me, on behalf of the people of the \nState of Wisconsin, express our condolences to all those who have lost \nloved ones and, of course, offer our expressions of concern to those \nwho are injured, and all the family members and friends who are \nsuffering today from this tremendous tragedy.\n  I want to join with others who have thanked the courageous \nindividuals in New York and Washington and elsewhere who are helping to \ntry to save whomever they can. And, of course, I share the intense \nfeeling of rage and resolution when it comes to these acts. I had the \nsame reaction a lot of other people did when I heard the news. It \nhappened when, for the first time in my life, during the recess I had a \nchance to visit Pearl Harbor and tour with the admiral there and get a \nsense of just how terrible and surprising that attack was.\n  For many of us, that is why this action yesterday was so reminiscent \nof Pearl Harbor. It was an attack on our territory. It was an evil act. \nSo when some of us make the comparison, that is not to suggest which \nsituation was more dangerous or what was a greater sacrifice. Really, \nwhat it is about is an expression of gratitude and love across the \ngenerations but at different times in our history. Whether it be Pearl \nHarbor or yesterday's attack, the American people are asked to do \nextraordinary things --to defend our freedom.\n  In that context, I want to mention two elements of resolve and two \ncautions. The first resolve is that, obviously, this situation is \nalmost certain to require military action. As a number of people have \nsaid today, this is not about simply bringing people to trial or \nfinding a legal standard. I agree with those who say that these were \n``acts of war.''\n  As one who has frequently questioned our military intervention and \nthe wisdom--for example, our intervention in Kosovo and Bosnia, whether \nwe really went about it the right way--this situation is different. It \nrequires a strong and aggressive military response when we are able to \ndetermine exactly who we should be going after, and I understand we are \npretty close to being certain of that.\n  One reporter already asked me if what we did today constituted \nsomething similar to the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. Of course not. It \nis not a blank check.\n  We as Americans are all united on this issue. We can respect article \nI of the Constitution if we are talking about a declaration of war. We \ncan respect the War Powers Act. We can act together as an executive and \nas a Congress to be sure we are unified, not just emotionally, but as a \ngovernment and a country when the necessary acts have to be taken to \nretaliate against those who have committed these deeds.\n  The second resolve relates to the suggestion by some that perhaps the \nAmerican people will grow weary of our involvement in the Middle East \nand our concern about the Middle East. We will not retreat from our \ncommitment to peace in the Middle East and, more specifically, we will \nnot reward these terrorists by reducing one iota our support for the \nState of Israel, which is the only democracy in the Middle East, which \nis our steadfast ally militarily and otherwise. If those who committed \nthese deeds believe this is the way to destroy Israel or destroy the \nlink between our two nations, they have just made a very large mistake.\n  Let me also mention two cautions, and others have already done this \ntoday, but it is important to express this. One is, as we look for \nanswers and we look for solutions and we look for the things we must \ndo, domestically as well as externally, we must continue to respect our \nConstitution and our civil liberties in this country. I am the chairman \nof the Constitution Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. I \nrecognize this is a different world with different technologies, \ndifferent issues, and different threats, but we must examine every item \nthat is proposed in response to these events to be sure we are not \nrewarding these terrorists by giving up our cherished freedoms that \nthey do not believe in and that they would like to destroy.\n  Finally, the other caution, which has been mentioned by so many, \nparticularly eloquently by Senator Schumer, the senior Senator from New \nYork, this should not be an occasion for ill-treatment of Arab \nAmericans, Muslim Americans, South Asians, or others in this country. \nIt is wrong. They are as patriotic as any other Americans and are \nfeeling extremely stressed as a result of this situation. I have \nalready heard some reports of some acts, and I roundly condemn them. We \nmust stand together, all Americans of all backgrounds, to condemn these \nactions.\n  Let me finally say, already in the middle of this enormous sadness, I \ncan already see our country responding. I can already feel from the \ncontacts we have had back home and the comments and actions of our \ncolleagues here that we are responding in the best possible way to this \nunprecedented challenge.\n  I thank all my colleagues for the way in which things have been \nhandled in the last day, and I look forward to working together to make \nsure our enemies understand that we will not stand back and we will \nremember this, we will remember it every day until we have rooted out \nthose who perpetrated these vicious actions against our country. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murray). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I appreciate the words of my colleagues on such a \nserious matter before this body. I, as an American, as a Kansan, and a \nMember of the Senate, am deeply saddened at the loss and tragedy our \nNation has suffered, the shock of which still stuns us today.\n  I also express the complete unity of all of us in the Congress in our \nabsolute determination to respond to this atrocity quickly, wisely, and \nforcefully. We will rescue survivors, bury our dead, rebuild our \ncenters of commerce, and find the killers. Already there is order; soon \nthere will be justice.\n  Kansans and Americans must be assured that our country will remain \nstrong and will become stronger through this trial. Every hour I hear \nof new reports of Americans volunteering their time, their medical \nexperience, their resources, and their blood to help their fellow \ncitizens. We are responding to the evil of terrorism with the best of \nhuman nature, and I thank everyone who has sacrificed to help those in \nneed in Washington and New York. The unsung heroes and untold stories \nare the bright lights in this dark sky.\n  We will not only help the hurting, but we will seek out and find \nthose killers. To terrorists and the nations that harbor them, we have \nthis to say: We will find you, and we will deal with you as you \ndeserve. Justice will be done.\n  If there are rogue nations or terrorist groups that think they can \nintimidate our country, they are mistaken. I strongly agree with \nPresident Bush's statement that:\n\n       America and our friends and allies join with all those who \n     want peace and security [and that]. . . .We will make no \n     distinction between the terrorists who committed these \n     acts and those who harbor them.\n\n  I hope, from this dastardly act of terrorism, we will find support \ncoming from many quarters of the world to fight this global scourge of \nterrorism. Already I have been in touch with people in several \ncountries and spoken with them about their need to help us and found \ntheir quick statements of willingness to help us in support.\n  I have spoken with Jordan's King Abdullah, who is vigorously \nassisting the United States, and also there are other Arab countries, \nto encourage calm and reason in the Middle East and to support us in \nfinding those who have conducted these heinous acts. We appreciate the \nefforts of Jordan and thank her people and her King.\n  There is another point that needs to be made. The culprits are \nterrorists, not the Arab people or those of the Muslim faith generally \nor any other group. Individuals are guilty of crimes,\n\n[[Page S9319]]\n\nnot classes of people. In this instance, as always, we should reject \nunfair characterizations or generalizations targeted at groups of \npeople.\n  We had already been investigating reports on another matter in our \nState associated with gasoline price gouging. We are confident that the \nproblems will be resolved in short order. Oil supply channels remain \nopen. Measures are being taken to ensure the uninterrupted flow of oil, \nand anyone who does engage in the disgusting practice of price gouging \nin a time of tragedy will be prosecuted.\n  I encourage my fellow citizens to contact offices in their States and \npublic authorities if there is any way we can be of assistance in \ndealing with this matter.\n  The Congress will be convening in both joint and special sessions \nthroughout the remainder of this week. That is an important statement \nof our resolve to continue to conduct business, even though it is not \nbusiness as usual. I certainly intend to be at every session and \nmeeting that involves our current national crisis.\n  I assure every American, particularly Kansans back home, that we are \nunited, we are resolved, and we will seek justice to be done, swift and \nsure.\n  I ask for your prayers for all the victims and their families and \noffer my deepest condolences to the families and appreciation for the \nmany prayers that have been offered and the help that has already \nflowed so richly to those who need it.\n  I finally note, in the weeks and months ensuing, we will be a changed \nnation. There are many things with which we will need to deal. We will \nneed to deal with this battle, this war that we are in with terrorism, \nand we are going to have to fight it much more aggressively. It is an \ninsidious conflict. We are going to have to get at it at its roots \naround the world, and we are going to need much help from many \ncorridors. We will seek that, and we will fight and win this battle \neven though it is different from any other we have fought. We will pull \ntogether as a nation and do it. This will not be a Republican or a \nDemocrat issue; this will be an American issue, as wars have been in \nthe past, and we will wage it successfully.\n  I pray we will continue and we will grow from this experience. May \nGod keep the souls of those who have lost their lives. May God save \nthose who at this hour await rescue. May God lift the weighted hearts \nof the families of the missing and the dead. May God preserve all those \nwho love freedom in this world. May God bless the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, not since December 7, 1941, has the \nUnited States suffered such a damaging blow on our own soil as the \ncowardly and hateful terrorist attack our Nation sustained on what will \nbecome, I am certain, a new day of infamy: September 11, 2001.\n  While our enemy may not be another nation in the traditional sense, \nthe strike against America was, in fact, an act of war. Our Nation now \nneeds to demonstrate the same kind of moral clarity and courage that \ncharacterized the World War II generation. Three immediate steps need \nto be taken.\n  First, of course, is that our Nation extends its prayers and its \nassistance to the victims of this monstrous and shameful attack. I am \nproud that South Dakotans have overwhelmingly responded with offers of \nblood and other assistance.\n  While our Dakota homes may not often be at direct risk from attacks \nof this nature, we fully understand the strike against New York and \nWashington was a strike against all Americans, wherever we might live.\n  The numbers are staggering, but we recognize in those numbers are \nreal lives and real people, real children who have lost their parents, \nreal parents who have lost their children. The people of South Dakota \nare grateful to the heroes who did so much to save so many, many of \nwhom gave their own lives in the course of that effort. We share the \nsorrow of the rest of the Nation for those lives that were lost, those \nfamilies who have forever been devastated by this hateful and shameful \nattack.\n  Second, we recognize we must respond in a spirit not of revenge but \nof justice. Our enemies, however, must understand that justice can be \nsevere indeed. We must make careful but swift determinations about the \nguilt of our enemy and make it very clear we will not distinguish \nbetween terrorists and those who attempt to provide a safe harbor for \nterrorists.\n\n  Anything short of the capture and punishment of these people will \nonly serve to encourage more terrorism against the United States and \nagainst all other liberty-loving nations throughout the world.\n  Third, the United States, in conjunction with its democratic allies \nall over the world, needs to make substantial improvements in our \nantiterrorist strategies. That means far better intelligence gathering \nand infiltration of terrorist cells so that plans for violence against \ninnocent people, wherever they may be, can be intercepted before they \nare carried out. It means far better air transportation security \nefforts than anything, frankly, that has yet been developed.\n  As a new member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I vow I will \ndo all I can to work with this administration to make certain that \nadequate financial resources are made available for all of these \nefforts.\n  Make no mistake, the recent attack against the United States of \nAmerica was intended as an attack against the principles of democracy, \nof personal liberty, and of religious tolerance. Our security is at \nstake, but even more importantly our fundamental values are under \nsiege.\n  American citizens, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, have denounced this \nterrible violence. It is important we condemn the guilty but recognize \nthat our American principles, the principles of our Constitution, keep \nus from unfairly stereotyping any ethnic or religious group. We need \nnow, more than ever, to remain united as Americans, to put aside \npartisan politics, in this new war against the evil forces of hatred, \nintolerance, and barbarism.\n  God bless our Nation, and on this very difficult day, God bless the \nfamilies who have lost so much. God bless our effort for renewed vigor \nin maintaining the principles of our democracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I have heard so many sincere speeches by \nMembers of the House and Members of the Senate, and I have heard a lot \nof redundancy. We certainly have the resolve to do all we can to go \nafter those who were responsible.\n  The one question I have heard over and over again is: Did we receive \na warning? Were we warned this was going to happen? I look at this in a \nlittle different context in that this should serve as a warning to us. \nIt is time to get something on the record in the Senate as to what this \nmeans and what it really could mean in the future.\n  Ironically, at the time this happened I was on the ninth floor of the \nHart Building in the Nation's Capitol complex, and I was looking out \nthe window as I was speaking to a group. The last phrase of my speech \nwas the same as it has been since 1995, and that is: We in the United \nStates are in the most vulnerable and threatened position now as a \nnation than we have ever been in this Nation's history. As I said that, \nit happened to be right at 9:30 and I saw this billowing smoke come up \nfrom the area of the Pentagon, to find out later the tragedy really \ntook place.\n  We are vulnerable, and we are vulnerable in three areas, certainly in \nconventional forces being one-half the force strength we were in 1991. \nWe have to understand this; the American people have to understand \nthis: We deployed our very rare resources to places where we should \nnever have sent an American, such as Bosnia or such as Kosovo.\n  More than any other reason our vulnerability is that we had the \nopportunity to have a missile defense system in place by fiscal year \n1998, and I say this criticizing the previous administration because \nthey did not realize the threat was out there, the threat was real. We \nhave veto messages from President Clinton that said: I will veto any \nbill that has money in it for a national missile defense system because \nthe threat is not there. In fact, a threat is there. So in looking back \nat what\n\n[[Page S9320]]\n\nhappened yesterday, I think we should have that as a warning to us of \nwhat could be even more devastating than what we witnessed yesterday.\n  I mention what I consider to be six incontrovertible facts. First of \nall, we are facing enemies who have the weapons and the skills and the \nmentality to strike without warning. We know that.\n  No. 2, they are willing and able to target innocent civilians within \nour borders.\n  No. 3, virtually all countries have weapons of mass destruction \ntoday, biological or chemical or nuclear.\n  No. 4, at least three countries--I say at least because we know North \nKorea, Russia, and China have ICBMs that will reach the United States \nfrom anyplace in the world but we do not know for sure that they are \nthe only three countries because we do know China has been trading \nsystems and technology with countries such as Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, \nand Pakistan. So we do not really know how many there are, but we know \nat least they exist out there.\n  No. 5, we have absolutely no defense. I hope Americans understand \nthat if a missile came over from anyplace in the world, we would be \ntotally naked. We have no defense against an incoming ICBM.\n  No. 6, the will is out there. No one can question that the will is \nthere. We can remember even China saying back during the Taiwan Straits \ndemonstration: We are not concerned about America coming to the aid of \nTaipei because they would rather defend Los Angeles than Taipei. Then \nwe remember what Saddam Hussein said in 1991: If we had waited just 10 \nyears to go into Kuwait, the Americans would not have come because we \nwould have had the ability to launch a missile. And here it is, 10 \nyears later.\n\n  I hope no one has any doubt, there should not be one Member of the \nSenate that has any doubt--of the fact that if someone is willing to \ndrive an airplane into those towers, they would deploy a missile to the \nUnited States of America.\n  I, like everybody else, watched TV. I watched that skyline and the \ndevastation in New York. I saw the skyline of New York City and the two \ntowers imploding. If that weapon had been, instead of an airplane, a \nnuclear warhead, we would be looking at a cinder. It would not be \n10,000, 20,000 or 30,000 people who lost their lives; it would be \neverybody in that area. We would be talking millions. It is a very real \nthreat. The ultimate weapon of a terrorist is a missile with a nuclear \nwarhead. We now know that. We have been warned.\n  We should make our No. 1 priority not just to go to our intelligence \nsystem and our conventional forces but to immediately get busy on being \nable to deploy a system at least to defend America against a limited \nmissile attack. This should be our No. 1 priority. We are now warned. \nThe ultimate weapon of a terrorist could become a reality very soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, no words can ever convey our regrets, our \nsadness, our shock, our loss from the great tragedy of September 11, \n2001. The newness of the century, of a millennium, has been tarnished \nforever by the blood of innocent victims shed by anonymous assassins, \nterrorists whose only motivation is an evil hatred.\n  All our prayers are with the victims and their families and friends. \nWhen the final list of casualties is known, I am certain that every \nstate, and perhaps every nation in the world, will have been touched by \nthis calamity. Our prayers will be with them forever. We will remember \neach and everyone as long as we live and then our descendants will \nremember them too. It will be their memories that guide us in the \ndifficult days ahead.\n  Their deaths have reminded us of our common humanity, that what we \nshare is greater than what separates us, and that the fabric of beliefs \nwhich makes us Americans is strong enough to resist any cowardly act by \nterrorists. Where one American falls, another will stand. Each of us \nshine as a beacon of our shared beliefs in freedom, liberty and \njustice. In the dawn after this dark day we will all shine. Those who \nexpect us to be weakened will be sadly mistaken.\n  Those who think Americans are soft and fearful will be astonished by \nour strength and determination. I was a young man when Pearl Harbor was \nattacked. I witnessed the bombing of Pearl Harbor by Japanese torpedo \nand bomber planes from my dormitory in the hills above Pearl Harbor. \nThen we knew our enemy and he thought our will could be shattered by \none frightful day of disaster. Instead our enemies in Europe and the \nPacific learned that where we had been broken, we healed and became \nstronger.\n  Today we begin to become stronger. We begin by mourning our dead \nbrothers and sisters. We begin by comforting the survivors. And as we \npick up the bricks and the steel and sweep away the glass and dust, we \nbegin to identify our enemies and design the strategy for defeating \nthem.\n  There will be no place that our enemies can hide, no sanctuary for \nthem to cower in. We will seek them out and justice will be done. It \nwill be a long process but it will be thorough. We have come brutally \nto understand that terrorism is an evil beyond our borders that still \nthreatens our homeland. We have come to understand that our enemies \nwant to extinguish the light of freedom which shines from America. We \nhave come to understand that the only way to resist the darkness of \nhatred is to spread that beacon of light even farther from our shores. \nFrom this battle we hope will come not just a stronger, safer America, \nbut a better, more secure, freer world.\n  May God bless America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, yesterday, terrorists attacked the temple \nof American capitalism and the center of American democracy. With all \nof their terrible sophistication, they naively have seemed to believe, \nby destroying buildings and killing our people, that they can kill an \nidea. Capitalism and democracy are the most powerful ideas in the \nworld. They are the crowning achievement of mankind on this Earth and \nthey are not going to be destroyed by terrorists.\n  Our task today is to find out with certainty who did these terrible \ndeeds, and then it is our obligation to make war on them. I am not \ntalking about criminal justice. We are not going to be reading anybody \ntheir rights. No one is covered by Miranda. Any country, any city, any \nregion, and any person who makes common cause with those who make war \nagainst America is making war against America, and the wages of sin is \ndeath. I believe these people have a hate that we cannot comprehend or \nunderstand. We are only going to be safe when these people are captured \nor killed.\n  We are hearing a lot of talk today about what we can do to be safer. \nI want to be safe. But let me make it clear: I don't want to change our \nway of life. I want to change their way of life. If we start infringing \non our own freedom, if we start limiting our own freedom to move about \nour country and engage in our business and live our lives, then we are \ngiving up what this war is about. We want to change their lives. We \nwant to hunt them down in any dark corner, in any hiding place on this \nEarth.\n  We want to be relentless, and we don't want to be constrained.\n  I believe it is important that the people who did this terrible thing \npay for it. I think if they pay for it, then we can make the world \nsafer.\n  Finally, let me say that any American who watched the bravery of \nordinary citizens in New York and in Washington, who watched police \nofficers and firemen risk their lives, had to be proud of what \nAmericans did yesterday. I have never been more proud to be a citizen \nof America than I was yesterday--ordinary people doing extraordinary \nthings under terrible circumstances.\n  I know when we start getting the names of people, especially in New \nYork and here at the Pentagon, who were killed, there are going to be \nmany people on that list who we know. I knew Barbara Olson who was \nkilled on the airliner that crashed into the Pentagon. She was a \nstaffer here--a dedicated, brilliant woman. She called her husband, Ted \nOlson, our Solicitor General, and even facing death was talking about \nwhat she could do to try to resist. I am not surprised that she was \nbrave because I knew her. My heart goes out to her and to everyone else \nwho suffered.\n\n[[Page S9321]]\n\n  We cannot tolerate this act. We cannot simply go through the motions. \nWe have to hunt these people down and kill them. They deserve it. They \nmade war against America.\n  I want people to stop talking about bringing them to justice. This is \nnot about justice. This is about war. These people brought war to the \nmainland of America and killed thousands of our citizens. They have no \nrights. I think we have to hunt them down wherever they are and use \nwhatever power we have in order to see that they don't do this again, \nand that no one else ever has the courage to do it again.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, I am pleased to have been on the floor \nto hear that speech from the senior Senator from Texas. The Senator is \na great patriot, and his forthrightness is going to be missed.\n  The victims and the loved ones of this horrible act of war should be \nin our prayers. The perpetrators and those who give them shelter should \nbe in our bombsights.\n  After Pearl Harbor, the Japanese remarked that the ``sleeping giant \nhas been awakened.'' I pray that ``the sleeping giant'' has again been \nawakened, and that we are ready to change the way we do things.\n  For too long, after terrorist attacks have happened, it seems \nAmerica's first and foremost interest has been to please our friends, \nand then, if permitted, punish our enemies.\n  After yesterday and from here on out, that must be reversed. \nAmerica's first and foremost interest must be to punish our enemies, \nand then, if possible, please our friends.\n  Our response should not only be swift but it must be sustained. As I \nsaid yesterday, our will as a country has been tested. Too often in the \npast terrorist attacks have not been answered as forcefully as they \nshould have been. Oh, yes, there has been indignation, even outrage. \nThere has been wringing of hands and sad talk. We have shaken our \ncollective heads in dismay, sighed over our cocktails, then have gone \nhome, had a nice dinner and got into a comfortable bed, feeling safe \nand secure that it is not going to happen here, that it is not going to \nhappen to us.\n  Well, it has happened to us. It has happened here. Our world has been \nturned upside down. It will never be the same again, and it shouldn't.\n  We must strike the viper's nest--even if the viper is not there. We \nknow that the Taliban and the Government of Afghanistan have nurtured \nOsama bin Laden for years. The diabolical plot was probably hatched \nthere. Certainly similar plots have been. And it is time for us to \nrespond.\n  I say, bomb the hell out of them. If there is collateral damage, so \nbe it. They certainly found our American civilians to be expendable.\n  I also believe that we could immediately turn our attention to the \nsecurity of our airlines. There is a large pool of willing ex-military \npersonnel out there who possess the rudimentary skills to be effective, \ntemporary air marshals if given a crash training course on the basic \nrequirements of that job. Another option may be to have active duty \nmilitary personnel do that job.\n  We should also install ``communications hardware'' aboard each \naircraft that would let pilots make emergency transmissions to air \ntraffic controllers. With today's ``star wars'' capability, I believe \nit is possible to outfit each aircraft with an emergency transponder \ncombined with an ``open mike'' type system that would be strictly for \none-way communication from aircraft to air traffic control. The pilot \nor crew members could push a button, much similar to a silent bank \nalarm, that would instantly alert authorities. It could also serve as a \nhidden microphone in the cockpit or in the passenger cabins.\n  Those are some of my thoughts today for whatever they are worth at \nthis terrible time.\n  To paraphrase President Roosevelt, this Nation will endure as it has \nendured, but we must change the way we do business drastically.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I am honored to have the opportunity \nto say a few words today after the most terrible tragedy that we \nsuffered yesterday. It was a dastardly attack on our Nation that has \noccasioned the greatest loss of life domestically I suppose in our \nNation's history--men, women, and children, police, firemen, soldiers, \nand all of the families and friends will be with us on this Earth no \nmore. Our hearts go out to those who suffered pain and injury. Our \nhearts go out to the families and friends who are grieving tonight. All \nover America, this great Nation hurts.\n  My own church, just for example, the Ashland Place United Methodist \nChurch, had a time of prayer yesterday for our families, our Nation, \nand its leaders. That is happening all over this country. As President \nBush said, prayer is an important factor in providing this Nation \nstrength.\n  We must ask ourselves: Now what can we do? What are our \npossibilities?\n  I believe we can do a better job of preventing these events. Our \ntechniques work for some time, but after a period of time people learn \nhow to get around them. We can improve that. We can do a very good job \nof identifying the people who commit these crimes.\n  Second, in almost every single terrorist act that has involved the \nUnited States, this Nation has been able to identify the people who \nwere behind it.\n  Third, we can take steps at which we have not been so successful; \nthat is, taking action against the people who perpetrate these horrible \nacts.\n  We have been, to some degree I think, handicapped by seeing these \nevents in terms of our criminal justice system. As a Federal \nprosecutor, I know about the difficulties that have to be overcome to \nprosecute a person and convict them beyond a reasonable doubt. You \ndon't have that burden when you are in war. We are in war today, or at \nleast much closer to war than we are to a criminal justice case. \nThinking in terms of war will give us more freedom, once we identify \nwho the people are, to act effectively against them. Locating them, \nhowever, is a difficult problem. We can identify them, but where are \nthey at a given time?\n\n  I believe it was Branch Rickey who said: Luck is merely the residue \nof design. As a prosecutor, I know in investigating cases you have to \nhave some luck, but you won't have luck if you are not out there \nworking. You will not have the break in the case that identifies where \nthese people are until and unless you are out there shaking that tree, \ndoing everything possible throughout this world to identify where they \nare. Then you make your luck.\n  So that is what we have to do with regard to locating these people. \nAnd make no mistake, I am absolutely confident that, if we remain \nsteadfast and determined, we will locate these people. Then we have to \ndevelop a plan to apprehend or destroy them. We have to trace them back \nto their lairs and make sure they are no longer capable of inflicting \nthis kind of death and destruction on this Nation or the world.\n  The Romans, a number of years ago, in the Mithridatic wars faced this \nproblem. The pirates had grown in strength. They were all over the \nMediterranean. There were tens of thousands of them. Shipping was \nthreatened very seriously. They had to face a decision; and they made \nthat decision. According to ``Appian's Roman History'' this is what \nhappened:\n\n       When the Romans could no longer endure the damage and \n     disgrace they made Gnaeus Pompey, who was then their man of \n     greatest reputation, commander by law for three years, with \n     absolute power over the whole sea within the Pillars of \n     Hercules, and of the land for a distance of 400 stades from \n     the coast. They sent letters to all kings, rulers, peoples \n     and cities, that they should aid Pompey in all ways. They \n     gave him power to raise troops and to collect money from the \n     provinces. . . .\n\n  And they raised an army. And they developed a plan. They set about to \nexecute that plan, and it was a brilliant plan. They killed 10,000 of \nthe pirates, and the rest surrendered. It was the end, and it broke the \nback of this kind of activity.\n  We have a similar time today. We simply have to be determined. We \nhave to remember the friends that have been lost. And I, too, as \nSenator Gramm, remember, with so much sadness, Barbara Olson, such a \nwonderful, vivacious person who loved life and gave herself to it. It \nis just a tragedy that she will\n\n[[Page S9322]]\n\nnot be with us, one who worked in this Senate as a staffer. So all of \nus have those whom we have lost.\n  In conclusion, every single person, every group, every organization, \nevery nation must know that if they perpetrate an attack on the United \nStates, or they support those who attack the United States, they will \npay a cost far more than their gain. Those individuals and groups must \nbe hounded to their lairs and destroyed. We simply cannot tolerate this \nkind of activity in the future. Only in this way can we ensure that the \nlives lost yesterday will be given their full meaning. And only in this \nway can we prevent further attacks on this Nation. Because to fail to \nact effectively we will everywhere encourage more groups to attack this \ngreat Nation. And a great nation never encourages attacks upon itself \nbut discourages attacks upon itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. Our Nation will, I am confident, \nfulfill its role as the greatest nation in the world, defend its people \nand its territory, and bring justice to those who have damaged us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. For the information of Members, we have a prayer service \ntonight, as has been previously announced. It starts at 7:30. We are \ngoing to have to end business today at about 7:15 so Senators have an \nopportunity to gather here to move over there.\n  I see Senator Hatch and Senator Breaux are here. I hope we will \nunderstand that at 7:15 we are going to end the proceedings for \ntonight. There appears to be enough time for everybody if they stick to \nthe 5 minutes. There will be some time perhaps tomorrow. The leaders \nare talking about that now. Maybe in the morning, before we go to the \nappropriations bill, we could do that. Perhaps we might not, but that \nannouncement will be made later.\n  If everyone would do what they could to expedite matters, we will \nhave another announcement later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, we have suffered an egregious loss. We \nmourn for those who have perished. We pray for those who suffer. We are \ninspired by the courage and heroism of the people of New York, \nparticularly the brave firefighters and police officers. We are \ninspired by the fidelity to duty of our men and women in uniform at the \nPentagon and around the world.\n  Ages ago, the Greek historian Thucydides reminded us:\n\n       [T]he bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision \n     of what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet \n     notwithstanding, go out to meet it.\n\n  Yesterday we saw the bravest: firefighters and police officers who \nrushed into a burning and collapsing skyscraper, a chief of the New \nYork City fire department, a deputy chief, and department chaplain who \nstayed at their posts as the building collapsed around them; soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, airwomen at the Pentagon who struggled through \nwreckage to take out survivors, and returned today to work at their \nposts; office workers in New York who carried fellow workers down 60 \nflights of stairs to safety.\n  Their bravery and their courage is an inspiration to all of us. And \nwe are profoundly angered by those terrorists who have struck this \ndevious, horrific blow against us all.\n  The emotions of yesterday and today must and will coalesce into a \nsteely resolve to mete out justice to the terrorists, to those who \nharbor them, to those who train them, and to those who encourage them.\n  We must work with our allies to destroy the network of terrorism that \nis committed to imposing its fanatical and suicidal pathology on free \nmen and women everywhere.\n  Yesterday we lost what little innocence that remained in our view of \nthe world. We have been bloodied. But we retain a common and constant \nfaith that free men and women, committed to individual progress, and \nmindful of the dignity of all men and women, will prevail over the \nfanatic dedicated to destruction and darkness.\n  Archibald MacLeish, the American poet, gave voice to many of the \nemotions we feel when he spoke of those who fell in battle:\n\n     The young dead soldiers do not speak.\n     Nevertheless, they are heard in the still houses: who has not \n           heard them?\n     They have a silence that speaks for them at night and when \n           the clock counts.\n     They say: We were young. We have died. Remember us.\n     They say: We have done what we could but until it is finished \n           it is not done.\n\n     They say: We have given our lives but until it is finished no \n           one can know what our lives gave.\n     They say: Our deaths are not ours; they are yours; they will \n           mean what you make them.\n     They say: Whether our lives and our deaths were for peace and \n           a new hope or for nothing we cannot say; it is you who \n           must say this.\n     They say: We leave you our deaths. Give them their meaning.\n\n  We will rebuild New York and the Pentagon. And although we can never \nreplace the lives that were lost, we will give them their meaning. Let \nour foes everywhere know that our words are more than a lamentation; \nthey are a call to action and a promise of swift and certain justice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, yesterday was one of the bloodiest days in \nAmerican peacetime history. When suicide terrorists attacked New York \nand Washington, DC, they attacked our whole country.\n  The horror we witnessed yesterday when we saw New York's proud \nskyline shattered will be with us forever. Few Americans will remain \nuntouched by the mass graves of our citizens that we will now have in \ndowntown New York, in the Pennsylvania countryside, and, of course, at \nour Pentagon.\n  These terrorists killed innocent Americans from every part of our \ncountry. We were so saddened to learn that Mary Alice Wahlstrom and her \ndaughter, Carolyn Beug, of Kaysville, UT, were struck down by this \nsenseless violence.\n  Mary Alice's husband of 52 years, Norman, described Mary Alice as the \n``happiest lady you'll meet.'' As one of the ``kids,'' she joined with \nher only daughter to help her twin 18-year old granddaughters settle in \nat art school on the East Coast. In this time of grief, we join Norman, \nher four sons, and eighteen grandchildren in hoping that our love and \nfaith will continue to sustain each of us during this tragedy.\n  We also were devastated to hear of the loss of Barbara Olson, who \nperished on the plane hijacked to the Pentagon. Barbara was one of the \nbright lights among conservative commentators and legal experts, and \nher passing will most certainly leave a void not easily filled. My \ndeepest condolences go to her husband, Ted, our Solicitor General, at \nthis terrible, terrible time. I called him yesterday. He was \ndevastated. This is a terrible time for him and all of us.\n  Many of us were equally grief-struck to learn that Lisa Raines, was \non board American Airlines Flight 77. Lisa, although only 42, was a \nsenior officer of Genzyme Corporation. In Congress, we recognized Lisa \nfor her incredible talent, intelligence, integrity and energy. She was \nseen a key leader in the biotechnology industry and one of the most \neffective biotechnology leaders with whom I have worked. My staff and I \nwill miss her terribly. We share in her family's sorrow and extend our \nprayers and deepest sympathy to Lisa's husband, Steve Push.\n\n  The grief all Americans feel today is barely speakable. I, for one, \ncannot express in words the sorrow I feel for the thousands of families \nprofoundly shattered by the acts of war perpetrated against us \nyesterday by the cowards. I commend my colleagues who have spoken so \neloquently at such a great moment of national tragedy.\n  As many of my colleagues have noted, our grief is leavened by the \ncountless stories of sacrifice and heroism. News reports yesterday from \nNew York said that approximately 50 percent of New York's first \nresponders to the attacks on the Twin Towers are missing. These were \nthe policemen, firemen and emergency personnel who rushed to the \nbuildings and entered them in a race against collapse--a race that they \nlost. I hope that every American who sees a fireman or a policeman \ntoday thinks of the sacrifice that these everyday individuals are \nprepared to make for the good of our society, for the good of ourselves \nevery day.\n  There is no calamity America will withstand that will not be met \nwith,\n\n[[Page S9323]]\n\nand overwhelmed by, the decency, courage and selflessness of Americans \ncoming to the aid of their own. It will be years before we can collect \nall of these stories and I expect, we never will, because it is \nimpossible to measure the courage and bravery of Americans. As John \nsays in the Bible, ``Greater love hath no man than this; that a man lay \ndown his life for his friends.''\n  I also commend my colleagues for their unanimous support for the \nadministration of President George W. Bush. Americans are not partisan \nwhen we are to face a common foe, nor are their representatives.\n  We will face this foe together, and together we will prevail.\n  At this moment, we do not know definitely or definitively who is the \nperpetrator of this calculated, coordinated and devastating attack on \nAmerican's citizens, symbols, economy and government. And it is up for \nthe administration to determine when they want to announce the \nperpetrator. I suspect that when that announcement comes, our \nretaliation will already be underway. The administration knows that \nthey have the complete, unwavering support of this Senator, as the \nresolution we passed this afternoon will record the support of this \nbody for the administration as it prepares its response to this act of \nwar.\n\n  President Bush was absolutely correct last night when he said that we \nwould make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these \nattacks and the countries that harbor them.\n  We have reached the end of ambivalence when it comes to dealing with \nterrorism.\n  And while we may have a difficult battle before us, the United States \nwill prevail, and the world of freedom-loving people will benefit.\n  My colleagues know that I have focused a great deal of time on the \nOsama bin Laden through the years, who is widely believed to be the \nmajor perpetrator of this attack. While the United States government \nhas made no official determination over the mastermind behind \nyesterday's barbarisms, we have previously determined that bin Laden is \nan armed and active threat against this country and its interests--and \nhe has been for over a decade.\n  We will have plenty of time to discuss policy in the coming days and \nweeks, but I say today that the threat of Osama bin Laden and his \ncohorts must be eliminated. And his protectors--the Taliban regime of \nAfghanistan, which has become a front for the violent, anti-American \ninternationalist jihad movement that the vast majority of the Afghan \npeople reject--must be removed from power. The government of Pakistan, \na country with whom we have had many constructive relations in the \npast, must fully cooperate with us on these goals from this day on.\n\n  I am very grateful for the expressions of support we have heard from \naround the world. But I am extremely troubled by the reports I have \nread and watched of some communities celebrating this attack against \nthe U.S. The United States was attacked yesterday and thousands of our \ncitizens perished. Now is the time that we note where the rest of the \nworld stands, and I assure you that I will forever appreciate all of \nthe support we receive from our allies and friends around the world--as \nI believe American policymakers must take note of all of those who \noffer rhetorical or other support for the attackers on America.\n  The U.S. Congress will, I know, provide all of the support and \nresources the administration needs to respond to this act of war, so \nthat we can pursue the perpetrators, eliminate them where we need to \nand bring them to justice where we can.\n  I commend my colleagues for this resolution. Elaine and I offer our \nprayers for the victims and their families, as well as the thousands of \nbrave rescue workers, including Utah's Urban Search and Rescue team. \nThe team consists of fire department personnel from Salt Lake City and \nCounty. Our prayers go to the members of our armed forces--the greatest \ndefenders of freedom a nation has ever known. And our prayers go to \nPresident Bush and his administration, who are dedicated to peace and \nmust now respond to war.\n  May God bless America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Madam President, today--all across America and the \nworld--hearts are heavy with grief.\n  We mourn for the victims and families whose lives have been ripped \napart by yesterday's horrific and unprecedented attack on innocent men, \nwomen and children.\n  Like all Missourians, I am deeply grateful to the rescue workers and \nvolunteers whose heroism saved thousands of lives.\n  Tragically, many of those heroes are now among the victims.\n  Their sacrificial deeds stand in sharp contrast to the barbaric acts \nwe witnessed during yesterday's air attacks on peaceful people.\n  The terrorists wanted to do more than destroy our buildings. They \nwanted to destroy our influence in the world, the core of who we are as \na people, and the beliefs we stand for as a democracy.\n  They will not succeed.\n  I can remember as a young girl the shock and sadness we felt with the \nsneak attack on Peal Harbor.\n  But I also recall the undaunted spirit of America and our resolve to \nwin a victory over tyranny.\n  We dropped everything we were doing and devoted our full energy and \nresources to eradicating the threat to our freedoms.\n  That resolve is as firm today as it ever was.\n  The pursuit of freedom is our destiny as a people.\n  We will not now, or ever, flinch in the face of any aggressor or \nthreat to our homeland.\n  Let those who practice terrorism or harbor terrorists have no doubt \nabout America's resolve. There is no hiding place.\n  We will find you.\n  And you will pay a heavy price for your acts against mankind.\n  We have withstood worse enemies than you.\n  We conquered the evil of fascism in Europe and Asia, we rescued \ndemocracy, and we built a better world.\n  We defied communism for decades powered by the certainty that freedom \nwould ultimately triumph over oppression.\n  Tyrants will not take these gains from us.\n  Admittedly, today's foes are different.\n  They are faceless fanatics with no clear address or even purpose.\n  They target innocent people, sitting in offices and airplanes.\n  But they are sophisticated and well-funded.\n  Their days are numbered. We will stand united against their \naggression, and we will do so in a manner that is consistent with the \nConstitution that is the foundation of our greatness.\n  During this time of national tragedy, we stand behind our President \nand our national leaders.\n  We will make the necessary sacrifices, direct the necessary \nresources, and use American might, technology, and ingenuity to secure \nour homeland.\n  But most of all, we will rely on America's courage and faith, knowing \nthat our country has been a source of progress for humankind for over \ntwo centuries; knowing that peace-loving people around the world will \njoin with us to eliminate this evil that plagues us all.\n  To the families who grieve and the victims who suffer, I say we mourn \nwith you this day.\n  But there will be a dawn tomorrow and many tomorrows after that.\n  There will be many dawns for America.\n  We will prove again what the poet Carl Sandburg once said: ``We are \nAmericans. Nothing like us ever was.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I join my colleagues in support of \ntoday's resolution condemning those who perpetrated these barbaric and \ngodless acts against our country. Our hearts ache for those who have \nlost loved ones even as our minds struggle just to comprehend this \nunspeakable horror.\n  The scope of these evil acts is breathtaking. The economic losses are \nstaggering, but they pale in comparison to the loss of life that \ntouches so many. The greatest and most immediate losses, of course, \nhave been suffered by the tens of thousands of Americans who have lost \nfamily members, who have lost loved ones. Those are wounds that time \nwill never heal.\n\n[[Page S9324]]\n\n  As a nation, we have not faced a sterner test in modern times. So I \nwant to say to those responsible: Do not doubt our resolve. We will not \nstop until we find you and destroy you.\n  Our country is united. I have never before seen the unity that is \neverywhere in this country. In Tennessee, all across the country, \nAmericans are joined together in their commitment to the destruction of \nthis evil. We invite freedom-loving people from around the world to \njoin our cause. The American spirit is alive. Americans are also united \nin our desire and willingness to help. Blood banks are overwhelmed with \ndonors. Special response teams from around the country are organizing \nto help. A medical group just arrived from Tennessee to assist at the \nPentagon.\n  In the coming days, those of us in Government will be making \ndecisions intended to help restore the protections and the peace of \nmind that all too often we take for granted.\n  This is no simple task, and I realize that America will never be the \nsame after the events of September 11. As an open society with enormous \nrespect for civil liberties, we are vulnerable to those who would \ntarget innocent civilians. Airplanes used as flying bombs have joined \nother terrorist weapons from which we have been working hard to protect \nourselves.\n  Devastating as yesterday's damage is, we are forever exposed to huge \nrisks from biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons. All Americans \nshould know that we are rededicating our efforts to better protect \nourselves from all of these risks, even as we strive to maintain the \nfreedoms that we all hold so dear.\n  President Bush will take the lead, and we in Congress will work \nclosely together with him in the search for answers. Pray for us as we \ngo about our work. But take comfort in knowing that even though our \nchallenges are great, our commitment is greater. As the President said \njust this morning, this is a monumental struggle between good and evil, \nand good will prevail--the good of the American people and civilized \npeople everywhere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). I recognize the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, for so many Americans the day began with a \nbright, sunny morning, with beautiful, clear skies. It ended with \ndarkness and a profound sense of vulnerability and a profound sense of \nanger of all Americans. It will certainly be a day that we as Americans \nshould, and I argue will, never forget. Our greatest sympathies go out \nto those who have suffered the greatest of losses, the death of members \nof their families, their loved ones. Especially our thoughts today are \nwith those people from the New York area and also for the people from \nthe greater Washington area who are most directly touched by this \ntravesty.\n  Indeed, all of us have been touched in our own ways by what happened \nyesterday. My own office has been working with a Louisiana constituent \nwho is trying to find out the status of her husband who was attending a \nmeeting yesterday at the World Trade Center. She talked with him after \nthe first plane struck the first tower, but she has not been able to \nhear from him ever since.\n  Mr. President, the American people want and expect us to act. They \nexpect us to act quickly, they expect us to act decisively, and they \nexpect us to act with great determination so that this will never \nhappen to us again. President Bush and his team have given us their \nassurances, and all of us pray for his leadership and pledge our \nstrong, bipartisan cooperation and support in his efforts.\n  We must all act as one. We must all act as one Nation and we must all \nspeak with one voice. Let us at the same time all be mindful of some \npoints that I think need to be remembered. First, these perpetrators \nare not American citizens. They are not entitled to the protection of \nthe U.S. Constitution. They are not entitled to a presumption of \ninnocence. They are not entitled to a trial by jury of their peers, and \nthey are not entitled to the services of a free attorney. They have \nthemselves, in fact, chosen the field on which they will be judged, and \nthe field that they have selected is clearly the battlefield and not a \ncourtroom.\n  I urge our Government to proceed carefully but also to proceed not as \nif we were preparing for an indictment to be followed by a trial in \nwhich we must prove our case beyond the shadow of a doubt. What they \ndid to us was to physically invade our country and slaughter innocent \npeople in the process. What they did was to declare war on the United \nStates of America and the people of our country.\n  We must respond in kind. Our military must be fully utilized. The \nworld is watching our Nation and what we do should be remembered for \nlonger than what they did. After they are removed as a cancer in this \nworld, we must also address our own internal security. People in our \ncountry must know that they can fly without fear, that we can gather in \nlarge numbers and celebrate and be entertained without worry, and that \nour loved ones can live in a country in which we are all safe and also \nsecure.\n  That is our goal. That is our challenge. We will meet that challenge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this has been quite a day for \nall of us. I have the very sad duty in the State of Florida to call the \nloved ones of a number of people who were on the respective flights. \nIndeed, I have the sad duty that I will be calling the widower and the \ndaughter of a mother from Boston, who also lived in Miami, who was on \nthe flight from Boston to Los Angeles. And it just brings all the more \nhome the poignant tragedy for all of us and for this Nation.\n  Mr. President, we need to go get the perpetrators. The resolve of \nthis Nation and of this Congress is clearly there. We need to find \nthese people. We need to hunt them down and we need to let the message \ngo forth that no terrorist act such as this will ever be tolerated in \nthis country again. That goes for the terrorists and that goes for the \npeople who are harboring the terrorists.\n  We have experienced all too personally a new kind of warfare, and in \nthe process of us exacting this justice--I say justice; I did not say \nrevenge--we will protect the constitutional rights of all people; we \nwill respect them.\n  It is important for people in this country to rise above ethnic or \nreligious prejudice because we are a nation of all peoples and all \nfaiths. But we are going to get the perpetrators in the cross hairs of \nthe bull's eye, and we are going after them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, we have all experienced a daunting \nnational tragedy. It touches every single one of us. As Americans, we \nstand united behind our President, speaking with one voice as we move \nforward in the wake of this tragedy, and move forward as a nation we \nwill.\n  This is the time to bring to bear all of our country's formidable \nresources of heart and mind. We must reach out to those families who \nhave suffered grievous loss and to the communities torn apart by this \nsavage act.\n  The challenge we now face will not be surmounted overnight. We must \nseek out the facts which will be the basis for our response. We must \nhave a binding determination, a steely resolve to see that those \nresponsible for these heinous acts will be held accountable.\n  We should not fool ourselves that we will find a quick or simple \nanswer, but we will persevere, and we will work in concert with \ndemocratic forces the world over to see that this terrible scourge, \nwhich has just had such devastating consequences, is eliminated \naltogether.\n  I thank and praise the heroic efforts, the courage, and the sacrifice \nof our police, our firefighters, our emergency medical service \npersonnel--all of the rescue workers who have been involved in \naddressing this tragic situation in New York, in Pennsylvania, and here \nin Washington.\n  In fact, numerous firefighters and emergency medical service \npersonnel from my own State have responded to the attack upon the \nPentagon, and my thanks go out to all of them for their prompt efforts.\n  This morning, the Baltimore Sun ran a very strong editorial entitled \n``Answer Terror with Resolution.''\n  Answer terror with resolution. It went on in the course of that \neditorial to say:\n\n\n[[Page S9325]]\n\n\n       The Nation needs unity, clarity, purpose . . .\n       Courage and steadfastness of an unremarkable, everyday \n     persevering kind, are required. A well-directed and effective \n     response from government is required. Resolve is required to \n     continue on our path to do what is right. These are the ways \n     the terrorists lose.\n\n  We are resolved and determined that they shall lose.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full editorial from this morning's \nBaltimore Sun be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From The Sun, Sept. 12, 2001]\n\n                     Answer Terror With Resolution\n\n\n    Attacks on u.s.: nation needs unity, clarity, purpose to thwart \n                        terrorists' objectives.\n\n       The American people will rise to the challenge of the most \n     depraved terrorist atrocity in history. We were all attacked. \n     We are all in it together, sharing shock, fear and grief.\n       Acts of heroism and altruism amid the carnage in New York \n     and Washington were too many to be noticed, honored and \n     rewarded.\n       The nation's heart goes out to the victims, the pawns, the \n     innocent chosen at random and their loved ones.\n       Terrorism is war. It is also publicity stunt. Its purpose \n     is to be noticed, to spread fear, to undermine confidence and \n     to provoke the wrong responses so as to alienate more people. \n     Terrorism has little function if the cause is not known. \n     Usually the perpetrators seek recognition, as well.\n       This plot showed extreme sophistication in coordinating \n     four plane hijackings, apparently inserting suicide pilots, \n     and going for targets that could be hit with weapons that \n     were not the ones against which the United States was \n     conspicuously guarding.\n       All that suggests a large and well-funded operation, not a \n     lone wolf. A great deal of thought went into the terrorism. A \n     great deal of cool rational thought should go into the \n     responses.\n       A civil and open society is vulnerable. But this attack \n     brought the nation and much of the world's business to a \n     standstill. Clearly, airport security for all its nuisance to \n     passengers is not as good as U.S. experts thought, and the \n     terrorists must have experimented and known how to \n     penetrate it.\n       The president has vowed to find and punish the terrorists, \n     as indeed he should. Virtually all Americans must want that. \n     In this kind of war, it is important to get the identifies \n     right. To hit the wrong ones, to make people suffer who did \n     not do it or even help those who did, only archieves what the \n     terrorists want.\n       Most suspicion points to Osama bin Laden and the network of \n     affinity groups linked to him. The Saudi-born, Yemenite-\n     descended exile in Afghanistan has orchestrated a great deal \n     of terrorism, including the bombings of the New York World \n     Trade Center in 1993, of two U.S. embassies in Africa in \n     1998, for which he has been indicted, and of the USS Cole in \n     port in Yemen last October.\n       Vows to get bin Laden have only fueled his mystique. Yet \n     knee-jerk assumptions he was behind the 1995 Oklahoma City \n     bombing were made foolish by the home-grown terrorist Timothy \n     McVeigh.\n       Attacks at wrong targets would only help him. The notion of \n     a war between Islam and the United States of America is his. \n     The United States has no quarrel with Islam. Most of the \n     world's Muslims have no quarrel with the United States.\n       The attacks produced all sorts of precautions across \n     Maryland and the nation. A review must examine which were \n     sensible and which were not. Certainly transportation was \n     needed to get school children and commuters home, whether \n     from Washington or the Baltimore suburbs.\n       Panic, chaos, confusion and unnecessary shutdown all reward \n     the terrorist.\n       Terrorism must be fought with steely resolve, but also with \n     common sense and precision.\n       The United States is supposed to be the only superpower, in \n     an era of peace. Clearly the very good things about American \n     society make it vulnerable. But we are not the first people \n     to endure terrorism.\n       Now Americans understand better what Israelis have been \n     living through, what British people lived through before the \n     IRA cease-fire, what ordinary law-abiding Colombians are \n     living through from FARC.\n       Life, the nation's business and civil society go on. \n     Otherwise, the terrorists win.\n       The policies of the nation, including the search for a just \n     peace in the Middle East, go on. Otherwise, the terrorists \n     win.\n       Courage and steadfastness, of an unremarkable, everyday \n     persevering kind, are required. A well-directed and effective \n     response from government is required: Resolve is required to \n     continue on our path, to do what is right. These are the ways \n     the terrorists lose.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Yesterday's horrific and tragic events \nwere much more than a carefully planned terrorist attack against the \nUnited States. The slaughter of innocent civilians, the total \ndestruction of the World Trade Center, and the significant damage to \nthe Pentagon by hijacked commercial airplanes were a brutal and \noutright assault on America, and all humanity.\n  Make no mistake, our country is at war, and this Congress should \nconsider a formal declaration. The world must understand that America \nwill respond with the overwhelming force and conviction that her \ncitizens demand and expect. Let me be clear: America will identify \nthose responsible for yesterday's violence, and they will be destroyed. \nThere shall be no mercy.\n  America is at war against fanatics who appear threatened by our \nfreedoms, prosperity, and respect for the rule of law. In the past, \nthis war was undeclared, but undeniable. The American lives lost in the \n1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, the terrorist attacks against \nU.S. facilities in Kenya and Tanzania, and the more recent assault \nagainst the U.S.S. Cole serve as concrete evidence of the ongoing and \nescalating battle.\n  As we sift through the rubble of buildings and comfort those whose \nlives have been shattered, America stands as a strong and united \nNation. The shocking events of yesterday did not weaken or undermine \nthe foundations of our democracy, foundations that were forged over two \nhundred years ago and have been continuously strengthened throughout \nour history. We fought for our freedoms then, and we will continue to \ndefend them now. Whatever the political objectives of yesterday's \nterrorists, they have failed. And the extent of their failure will \nbecome abundantly clear in the coming days.\n  America did not seek this conflict, but we will not shy away from our \nresponsibility to protect life and liberty. Nations that harbor or \nshelter terrorists must also be treated as terrorists themselves. A \ndeclaration of war would make clear to the world that the United States \nwill no longer stand for violence against innocent men, women, and \nchildren be they in midtown Manhattan or Murray, Kentucky.\n  As the world's sole superpower, we bear an awesome responsibility to \nassist those democracies with shared values and strategic interests. \nThese nations, in turn, bear a responsibility to support the United \nStates in times of emergency. Israel, a nation long at war against some \nof the very radicals who may be responsible for yesterday's death and \ndestruction, has already pledged to join arms with the U.S. in the \nstruggle against fanaticism. We should embrace Israel's offer, and \nenlist the assistance of other democracies in what may be a long and \ndifficult war.\n  In the days, weeks, and years to come, America, alone, or with her \nallies will take action to prevent and lessen the opportunities for \nsuch carnage to occur in the future. These measures should include: (1) \nreassessing and improving intelligence operations and capabilities that \nmust provide early warning to deter terrorist attacks at home and \nabroad; (2) identifying terrorist organizations worldwide and actively \nsubverting their capabilities and very existence; (3) reassessing and \nimproving airport security and the integrity of aircraft cockpits; (4) \nenhancing security and emergency response procedures for America's most \nvulnerable targets, including mass transit systems and historic or \nsymbolic sights; (5) increasing citizen awareness of suspicious \nactivities; (6) restricting assistance and imposing sanctions against \nthose countries harboring terrorists; and, (7) investing in the \npromotion of democracy and the rule of law abroad.\n  Once before in our history, America was the target of a surprise and \ndeadly attack. As with Pearl Harbor, violence has been met with resolve \nand common purpose to defeat the enemies of our Nation. As in December \n1941, our Nation is led by capable and dedicated leaders who are up to \nthe task of responding to terrorist attacks, both foreign and domestic. \nPresident Bush and the Administration know full well that they have the \nsupport and backing of the American people.\n  On December 8, 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt addressed the \nNation on ``America's Answers to Japan's Challenge.'' His words ring \ntrue nearly six decades later: ``When we resort to force, as now we \nmust, we are determined that this force shall be directed toward \nultimate good as well against immediate evil. We Americans are not \ndestroyers, we are builders. . . . We are\n\n[[Page S9326]]\n\ngoing to win the war and we are going to win the peace that follows.''\n  The dark minutes and hours of yesterday failed to bring our country \nto its knees. America's strength is its diverse people, just \ninstitutions, and shared values. No terrorist attack will ever \nextinguish the flames of freedom and democracy.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, a brutal and cowardly act of \nterrorism has taken thousands of lives, destroyed great symbols of U.S. \npower and wealth, and stolen from every one of us a measure of the joy \nand confidence that Americans take as our birthright. As the poet Yeats \nonce wrote, ``everything is changed, and changed utterly.''\n  In this dark hour we all stand with President Bush and the military \nand intelligence leadership of this Nation in the search for the \npropagators of this great evil, and for an appropriate and strong \nresponse.\n  America must respond to this crime, this act of war, rapidly and \ndecisively, with an intensity and determination that reflect the \noutrage every American and I feel. A response whose violence and \nmagnitude makes it clear to every terrorist that their lives are in \ndanger, and makes it clear to every nation that the cost of supporting \nterrorism is too high to bear. We will not hesitate to put the \nstrongest military on earth to use as it was intended: to protect the \nlives, safety and property of American citizens, everywhere in the \nworld.\n  But we must also respond with a defiant embrace of our way of living.\n  The United States must continue to make military and foreign policy \ndecisions based on our understanding of what is right and what is \nwrong, and what is in the best interest of the American people and \nallies with whom we are proud to stand.\n  This Nation must remain a free and open society, people of every race \nand background must be accepted and embraced without fear and without \nprejudice.\n  And America must continue to prove to the world the worth of our \nbeliefs and of the society we have created by remaining the most \ndynamic force for growth, creativity and opportunity this earth has \never seen.\n  For all that must and will change, for all that has changed already, \nsome things must remain constant: America must remain a moral, open and \nvital society embarked on a new era of triumph.\n  Franklin Roosevelt said that ``the only thing we have to fear is fear \nitself.'' Fear is the terrorists' greatest weapon. Together, looking \nconfidently ahead, we can disarm this cowardly and elusive foe.\n  The Senate will be searching for the reasons behind this tragedy and \nfor strategies that will prevent another, similar disaster. I will \nreport to the people of West Virginia regularly, consistent with \nnational security.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I would normally express that \n`it's at a moment like this' when words cannot suffice to express the \nanguish of yesterday's attack, but there has never been a moment quite \n`like this' in our history as a sovereign nation.\n  The magnitude of the events that transpired yesterday will be \nmeasured in an infinite number of ways for years to come. We will mourn \nwith words and photographs and stories as we try to wrap our arms \naround this tragedy and try to make sense out of that which seems so \nsenseless.\n  We are One Nation Under God--a God who is bigger than terrorism, who \nis bigger than hate, and who cannot be destroyed by acts against \nhumanity.\n  As I have listened to my colleagues today, I have been deeply moved \nby their compassion and I share their grief and sense of loss. I join \nwith them in expressions of determination to hold those who are \nresponsible accountable--to the fullest extent possible.\n  In an effort to find hope in the midst of this pain, I have focused \non the truth that terrorism cannot expunge the virtues on which this \ncountry was built. Yes, the landscape has been irrevocably changed and \nlives on Earth tragically and abruptly ended, but our composition, our \nprinciples and our freedom remain the same.\n  We Americans are a people whose spirit of freedom and democracy will \nnot be defiled by those who choose terrorism over the lives of our \nmothers and brothers and sisters and fathers.\n  America's freedom and democracy--the real targets sought by the \nenemy--will never be compromised. Ever.\n  Yes, those virtues can be challenged. And they have been to a most \nunconscionable degree. Make no mistake. We are at war. But this is not \na conventional war fought by conventional means, rather this is an \ninvisible war where the targets are uncertain and the attacks are \nunpredictable. There are no tanks, no troops, and no clear military \nobjectives in this new war. We have worked to define and counter these \nnew threats to world stability. But yesterday those new threats, which \nwe have sought to define, were made real.\n  But just as those threats were made real, the spirit of America was \nrenewed. Firefighters and policemen in Pennsylvania and New York and \nWashington have worked--and continue to work--selflessly to salvage \nlives, as well as clues from the wreckage. These men and women are \nheroes--every one of them. Over two hundred workers have perished in \nthe line of duty. Each has made the ultimate sacrifice. This display of \ncourage has been an important first step toward healing.\n  As we survey the emotional and physical damage, we will not brush \naside the implications of the attack. The world is on notice. America \nis more than bricks and mortar. Her citizens are strong. I am convinced \nwe will show the world how great nations stand resolute in the face of \ngreat adversity. The American people have responded with the will and \nthe spirit that has served as the mortar in the construction of our \ncountry. America is back on the job, and will continue to lead the \nworld.\n  In the days ahead, we will investigate, pursue, prosecute and punish \nthose responsible for these despicable acts. America will not be \ndeterred. America will not negotiate or compromise in our pursuit of \njustice.\n  Let our enemies know, and let those who harbor our enemies know, that \nwe have declared this to be a new day, a new chapter in history, a time \nin which America will renew and strengthen its resolve and its \ncommitment to defeat terrorism and those who give succor or shelter to \nterrorists.\n  To our friends, we thank you for your expressions of sympathy, and to \nall people committed to peace, we ask for your cooperation, your \nsupport, and your common dedication to defeating the forces of terror \nand championing the ideals of free societies.\n  So as we move forward to sustain life and freedom, we will continue \nto meet challenges with resolve and resiliency. We will learn from this \nexperience and put that knowledge to good use. We will overcome this \ntragedy. But we will never forget.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, on September 11, 2001, a day that will be \nseared into our national memory, the United States was suddenly, \ndeliberately and viciously attached by ruthless terrorists. Thousands \nof innocent civilians were killed in a brief, violent, and \nunprecedented massacre. They died because they were Americans.\n  Through the actions of Tuesday, the United States was violently \nshaken from a post-cold-war stupor. The attacks were well planned, well \nresourced, and well coordinated by deadly warriors willing to kill \ninnocent civilians. It was an act of war. From a formidable, unseen \nenemy.\n  Today, in the aftermath, America sifts through the rubble and debris, \nsearching for survivors, victims, evidence, and answers. While the \nsmoke still billows from the Pentagon and site of the World Trade \nCenter, the sickening feeling of senseless devastation places an icy \ngrip on our hearts. The outrage builds in our national soul as we hear \nof the phone calls to loved ones that ended with a dead line and of \nrescuers who became victims; as we learn the identities of the lost and \nbegan to understand the scope of this deliberate act of war perpetrated \non American soil.\n  September 11, 2001, is likely to emerge as the deadliest day in the \nhistory of the United States. More than 2,400 Americans perished in the \nattack on Pearl Harbor and nearly 1,500 lost their lives on the beaches \nof Normandy during the D-Day invasion. The Battle of Antietam, the \nbloodiest day of the Civil War, resulted in more than 4,800 deaths and \n2,800 missing. The death toll\n\n[[Page S9327]]\n\nof Tuesday's terrorist attacks may reach the tens of thousands. The \nmagnitude of these losses is unimaginable and is yet to be fully \ncomprehended.\n  The cold-blooded murderers who committed this act attempted to strike \nnot just the twin towers of the World Trade Center but the twin pillars \nof America, our economic strength and our military might. They damaged \nthe symbols of each--but they could not penetrate the essence of our \nNation. America's indomitable spirit is undaunted. We've seen it in the \nactions of rescue workers who risked, and gave, their lives to save \nothers. We've seen it in reports of brave actions attempted on the \nhijacked planes. We've seen it in the lines of volunteers outside blood \nbanks and the prayer services held throughout this Nation. We've seen \nit in the steely determination of those ready to rebuild what has been \nlost. We've seen it in the resolve of a President and our military, \nready, willing, and able to strike back at whoever we determine \ncommitted this horror. Our Government stands in unity. Republican and \nDemocrat. House and Senate. In support of our Commander-in-Chief.\n  We are at war with the scourge of our time: terrorism. This was not \njust an attack upon America. As Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair \ncommented, it was an attack upon democracy. It was a blow against the \ncivilized world. Our allies and those opposed to terrorism must unite \nwith resolve and commitment to rid the earth of this plague. We cannot \ndeliver a glancing blow, we must go at the root and strike at the heart \nof terrorist organizations and those nations granting them safe harbor.\n  America will be forever changed. As with Pearl Harbor, our very way \nof life has been threatened. We must look at whatever shortcomings in \neither intelligence or security procedures allowed this tragedy to \nhappen. But we must not relinquish the freedoms that make us Americans. \nIf we abandon the liberties we cherish, the terrorists will have won.\n  America will stand together, as we always have when our Nation is \nthreatened. We will defeat this enemy.\n  As President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said on December 8, 1941:\n\n       No matter how long it may take us to overcome this \n     premeditated invasion, the American people, in their \n     righteous might, will win through to absolute victory . . . \n     Hostilities exist. There is no blinking at the fact that our \n     people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger. \n     With confidence in our Armed Forces, with the unbounding \n     determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable \n     triumph. So help us God.\n\n  As I arrived at the Capitol early Wednesday morning, I was greeted by \nthe sounds of fighter jets and military helicopters in the air above \nWashington. But I heard something else as well, a clear sound that \npierced the morning air, a lone trumpeter nearby played the National \nAnthem.\n  God bless the United States of America.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, America, sadly, has a new date that will \nlive in infamy for the rest of our lives and generations to come.\n  Today, more than 24 hours after the first terrorist strike that took \nthe lives of countless U.S. civilians, we are only now beginning to \nrealize that we will spend many days, weeks, months and years trying to \ncome to grips with the magnitude of yesterday's attack on our freedom.\n  We are left with searing images of a horror that could not be \ncontained, acts of terrorism that unfolded before our eyes, gripping \nthis Nation and the world in raw and vivid devastation, touching all of \nus with feelings expressed in public and in private; from panic to \nhelplessness; helplessness to anger; and anger to loss.\n  This morning we stand in this capital as one to condemn these \nattacks, comfort the victims and their families and commit our full \nsupport to bring those responsible to justice. Our heartfelt thoughts \nand fervent prayers go out to those who have been lost.\n  Our response in the days ahead to the mass murderers who planned and \ncarried out the attack and to any nation or nations that gave them aid \nmust be as decisive as was our steadfast determination to defend our \nhomeland and punish the aggressors in the immediate aftermath of a day \nthat we will remember as one of the worst in American history.\n  The challenge ahead will require strengthening U.S. defenses and \nintelligence at home in ways consistent with American values. Embassies \nand military bases must be better defended along with domestic airports \nand other civilian targets.\n  But this does not mean that we can allow terrorists to alter the \nfundamental openness of U.S. society or the government's respect for \ncivil liberties. If we do so, they will have won.\n  Some have rightfully declared that yesterday's attacks amount to an \nall out declaration of war against America. If so, then we will have to \nmake sacrifices by accepting greater inconvenience in public places and \nperhaps developing and cultivating a heightened sense of awareness \ncommon in other free nations that have come to accept terrorist \nactivity as a price for openness and democracy.\n  But above all, a state of war means a national bipartisan commitment \nto attack and defeat our Nation's enemies. There can be no greater \npurpose to our foreign and defense policy in the years ahead.\n  This means that we must embark on an unprecedented effort that will \ntake us beyond arresting individual suspects or engaging in isolated \nattacks as has been done in response to previous incidents such as the \nattack on U.S. military in the 1996 Khobar towers bombing in Saudi \nArabia, or the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and \nTanzania by Osama bin Laden's network to name a few.\n  In the past, the United States has failed to fully confront those \nlinked to terrorist attacks against Americans. Yesterday, it was made \nclear that we can no longer afford to do so.\n  The United States must now seek to assemble an international alliance \nto identify and eliminate all sources of support for the terrorist \nnetworks that would wage war on our nation including the identification \nand destruction of the larger networks behind these attacks.\n  So many have drawn a comparison between September 11 and December 7, \n1941. And while there are differences, what President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt said after Dec. 7 in Pearl Harbor, ``a date which will live \nin infamy,'' applies to yesterday just as well. ``Always will we \nremember the character of the onslaught against us,'' Mr. Roosevelt \nsaid. ``No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated \ninvasion, the American people in their righteous might will win through \nto absolute victory. I believe I interpret the will of the Congress and \nof the people when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to \nthe uttermost, but will make very certain that this form of treachery \nshall never endanger us again.''\n  Yesterday the world changed for every American. What those \nresponsible for these barbaric acts will come to learn is that our \nresolve has not.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, as a Nation we mourn the loss of so many \nAmericans whose lives were tragically ended by these vicious attacks, \nthe folks on the airplanes, the soldiers and civilians at the Pentagon, \nthe office workers at the World Trade Center and the rescue workers who \ntried to save them. Each one of them had family, friends, and loved \nones, and plans for the future. We cannot begin to fathom the \nincomparable grief their deaths have produced--of mothers who lost \nsons, husbands who lost wives, children who lost parents.\n  While we bow our heads in prayer for those whose lives were taken, we \nremain unbowed in the face of this heinous assault on our Nation. The \nterrorists who perpetrated this crime may have succeeded in striking \nthe symbols of American power, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, \nbut they cannot touch the spirit of the American people or our \ncommitment to defend our liberty, our democracy and our way of life.\n  I have full confidence that the United States has the will and \nability to determine which terrorist group is responsible for this \nassault on our homeland, as well as those states that are giving them \nrefuge, and those entities that are providing them aid and financial \nsupport.\n  We must deliver a punishing blow to these terrorists and those who \naid and abet them, because terrorists only understand one language, the \nlanguage of force.\n\n[[Page S9328]]\n\n  Anything less than a full response to these cowardly attacks within \nour borders would be appeasement. And history shows that appeasement \nagainst a determined enemy only encourages more attacks. The terrorists \nwho came to our country to kill and maim its citizens, along with those \nwho protect them, must be made to pay a price. And the United States \nshould be ready to act with a clear conscience in its self-defense.\n  Let there be no doubt: We are at war. It is not a war we choose to \nfight, but one that we will finish and win.\n  The last time an act of war was committed against the U.S. on our \nsoil, at Pearl Harbor, our military and economic power combined to form \nthe greatest fighting force the world had ever seen. Admiral Yamamoto \nhad called us a ``sleeping enemy.'' He woke us to his great regret. The \nterrorists who committed these crimes have made a similar mistake, they \nhave awoken a sleeping giant. Americans are slow to anger, but once \nroused we are indomitable.\n  Today, the men and women in this great chamber are not Democrats or \nRepublicans, but Americans. And as Americans, we in Congress stand \nunited in support of our Nation's leader, the President of the United \nStates. You will not hear partisan bickering. You will not see members \ntrying to lead from Capitol Hill. The United States must speak with one \nvoice and act in concert for the good of our nation.\n  We will stand united, because Americans always unite in the face of \nadversity. We cannot allow these acts of terrorism to divide Americans \nby race, ethnicity, or religion. If we start fighting, neighbor against \nneighbor, then the terrorists have won. We will have destroyed the very \nfoundation of our country's greatness, the fact that people of all \nbackgrounds can join together in the great American experiment.\n  As our Nation prepares to confront the threat of terrorism, we must \nbe careful not to destroy the freedom which makes this country great. \nWe must not abandon civil liberties within our borders or our ability \nto act unilaterally outside our borders if we want to be safe. As \nThomas Jefferson warned us, ``Those who desire to give up Freedom in \norder to gain Security, will not have, nor do they deserve either \none.''\n  Nevada is proud of our slogan, that we were ``Battle Born.'' It is on \nour State flag. It reflects the firmness of purpose and the willingness \nto fight for what is right that is so much a part of the character of \nthe Nevadan people.\n  This is as true today as it was when our state entered the Union \nduring the Civil War. The nature of the challenges may have changed \nover the years, but not the nature of the Nevadans fighting to overcome \nthem.\n  I know that Nevadans--and, indeed, all Americans will rise to this \nchallenge. We can give blood and donate to charities that are helping \nthe victims like the Salvation Army and the Red Cross. We can go out to \nour front yards and proudly fly the American flag to send a signal \nacross oceans that we will not be cowed by terrorists.\n  The Nevadans in our Armed Forces stand ready to fight and die to \ndefend their Nation. Let us pray for them, for all our men and women in \nuniform. Let us pray for President Bush our military leaders, and for \nall the rescue workers and victims. And most importantly, let us pray \nthat, in this struggle between good and evil, the righteous will \nprevail.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today, I join with my Senate colleagues in \nunited support for this joint resolution. I share their horror and \noutrage at the terrible atrocities committed yesterday against our \ncountry and our citizens. Those criminal acts will not be forgotten, \nand they will be avenged, at the right time, against their evil \nperpetrators.\n  One hundred years ago, at our Minnesota State Fair, Theodore \nRoosevelt spoke his famous words: ``Speak softly, and carry a big \nstick.'' Today is a day to speak softly and briefly. Words can barely \ndescribe our reactions, our revulsion, and our resolve.\n  Let there be no doubt: our Nation will recover from these despicable \nacts. We will learn the painful lessons necessary to strengthen our \ndomestic and foreign intelligence capabilities, our air traffic \nemergency system, and our guarantee to our citizens of their safety \nwherever they live, travel and work.\n  We will support our President and his associates as they identify \nthose responsible for these vicious assaults and retaliate against \nthem. We will move forward and we will move ahead. No one anywhere \nshould doubt our national strength and resolve; our private and public \nactions in the days and months ahead will prove it.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Americans woke up this morning a sadder \nand angrier people. It is very difficult to wrap one's mind around the \nterrible tragedy this country suffered yesterday, and still harder to \ncomprehend what must have been in the hearts of the people willing to \ncommit such atrocities against their fellow human beings. It is very \nhard even to find the words to speak about it.\n  But speaking about it is something that we must do. The American \npeople and the government of the United States of America must today \nspeak with crystalline clarity. The families and friends of those \nkilled or wounded in these awful terrorist attacks must know that the \nprayers of every American, and of millions upon millions of people \naround the world, are with them this day. The heroic firefighters, \npolice officers, rescue workers, National Guardsmen, doctors, nurses, \nand volunteering citizens who are even now struggling to find and save \nthe lives of surviving victims must know that our hearts and deepest \ngratitude are with them in their vital work. Our commander-in-chief and \nall the men and women of our armed forces, our law enforcement \ncommunity, and our intelligence agencies must know that we stand behind \nthem as perhaps never before in my lifetime, as they set about with \ngrim resolution to ensure that justice is done to those responsible.\n  And the evil people who planned and committed these atrocities, and \nthose who may have aided and abetted them, must know that far from \nparalyzing the American people and dividing us fearfully against each \nother, what they have done instantly is to unite us into one people. We \nawoke this morning united in the solidarity of grief and commitment to \nour fellow-citizens, and utterly single-minded in our determination to \nremain unbowed and to see justice done.\n  These, then, are the messages that we must send today--and that we \nmust keep sending with relentless determination in the difficult weeks \nand months ahead. America lost a measure of innocence yesterday, a \ndegree of that special separateness that has helped to keep our land of \nliberty safe from some of the storms that have long battered other \npeoples in an often turbulent world.\n  We are clearly not as separate, nor as safe, as once we thought. But \nno one should doubt our resolve and our resilience. It is in moments \nlike this that the special character or our great Republic can and \nshould shine through with particular brilliance. It shines through in \nour sacrifices in helping our fellow citizens in terribly trying times. \nIt shines through in our commitment, even in adversity, to the bedrock \nvalues that make our system of government worth protecting even as \nthese values draw the murderous ire of twisted souls whose only answer \nto the discourse of liberty is a vocabulary of violence, terror, and \ndeath.\n  As we rescue survivors and comfort the bereaved, we also will set \nabout finding those responsible. We must respond to these horrors in \nways befitting our voice as a free and united people. But let there be \nno doubt. Respond we must, and respond we shall.\n  As difficult as it is to find a voice to talk about the horrors we \nexperienced yesterday morning, I believe that by finding our voice \namidst such shock, rage, and pain, we reaffirm our most cherished \nprinciples. With God's help, we will persevere, find comfort in our \ngrief, and find strength in the days ahead.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, yesterday I was in a meeting here in the \nCapitol, when I looked out the window and I saw something that I will \nnever forget.\n  I saw black clouds of smoke filling the sky over the Pentagon.\n  Yesterday, terrorists attacked our country, our financial center, our \nmilitary headquarters, and our sense of security. Yesterday's horrific \npictures are fixed in our minds forever.\n\n[[Page S9329]]\n\n  But today, we see something else. We see a country that's come \ntogether. We see a government that speaks with one voice to denounce \nterrorism. And we see people who have volunteered--to search the \nrubble, to help the injured, and to donate blood.\n  These acts of terror were meant to divide us. But the truth is \nthey've brought us all closer together.\n  This afternoon, I want to extend my prayers to all the victims, their \nfamilies and friends.\n  I want to thank all of the emergency personnel who responded with \nsuch courage: including the brave men and women of our armed forces, \npolice, firefighters and medical personnel.\n  And I want everyone to know that our country is unified behind the \nPresident. We will help the injured. We will protect our citizens. And \nwill punish those who committed these cowardly acts. Every resource we \nhave will be made available to support the recovery effort.\n  Yesterday we were attacked, but today, we stand united.\n  As our work resumes, we will work together to plug the security holes \nthat this attack has uncovered.\n  I want all of my colleagues to know that, as chair of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee, my top priority is the \nsafety of the traveling public.\n  We will do what it takes to ensure the safety of our Nation's \ntransportation system.\n  In the coming days and weeks, we must evaluate our security system, \nour intelligence abilities and the safety of our transportation \nnetwork.\n  Out citizens have a right to feel secure at home, at work, at school, \nand on our Nation's transportation system. We are going to make sure \nAmericans have the safety and security they deserve.\n  Ours is a great Nation. We have withstood many challenges. We will \nlearn the lessons of this challenge, and together, we will build a \nstronger country.\n  So as we take stock of this unspeakable tragedy, as we learn the \nnames of the victims, as we hear stories of the heroism and compassion \nin the wake of this attack, we are standing together we are speaking \nwith one voice and will do everything we can to ensure our safety and \nto answer this evil act with justice.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, yesterday the United States of America \nsuffered a horrible national tragedy the images of which will forever \netch the date, September 11, 2001, in the collective minds of the \nAmerican people.\n  As Father Eugene Hemrick of St. Joseph's Church said this morning at \nmass, our lives will never be the same.\n  As one who has lost a child, I know this is especially true for the \nfamilies of those who were the victims of this act of war and of those \nwho laid down their lives to save them. My thoughts and prayers are \nwith them.\n  As Members of Congress, our first responsibility, working with the \nPresident on a bipartisan basis, is to secure the support that the \nvictims and their families will need in the days and months ahead--\ntheir grief should not be compounded by worrying about how they will \ndeal with their tragedy financially.\n  We must provide the resources our country needs to guarantee that \nyesterday's tragedy will not be repeated during the lifetime of our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  We must prioritize how we allocate these resources including the \nmoney to upgrade the technology and personnel that secure our airports, \nand we must respond to the human capital needs that caused former \nDefense Secretary James Schlesinger, who now represents the U.S. \nCommission on National Security in the 21st Century, to say before the \nOversight of Government Management Subcommittee earlier this year:\n\n       . . . it is the Commission's view that fixing the personnel \n     problem is a precondition for fixing virtually everything \n     else that needs repair in the institutional edifice of U.S. \n     national security policy.\n\n  We must also dedicate ourselves to meeting a number of other \nchallenges, including: providing the resources that will help improve \nour signals intelligence capabilities, or, in other words, our ability \nto ``listen in'' on unfriendly nations; stepped-up law enforcement to \nprevent terrorism; coordination of effort between various Federal \nagencies such as CIA, FBI, NSA, etc.; coordination of effort between \nFederal, State and local governments and law enforcement to maximize \nour ability to stop terrorist activity; and greater use of electronic \nsurveillance and satellite imagery to track the enemies of peace.\n  Finally, we must identify those responsible for committing these \ncowardly acts of war as well as those who have encouraged them by \nsilence, assistance or asylum and we must hold these individuals or \nNations accountable.\n  I agree with what President Bush said in his address to the Nation \nlast evening:\n\n       we will make no distinction between the terrorists who \n     committed these acts and those who harbor them.\n\n  We must also join the President and declare war on terrorism and \nconvince world religions and political leaders that terrorism is a \nthreat to peace in the world and a prelude to Armageddon. We need more \nvoices in the world like Pope John Paul II who said:\n\n       . . . the ways of violence will never lead to genuine \n     solutions to humanity's problems.\n\n  Our determination to winning the war on terrorism must have the same \nhigh priority that we gave to winning World War II, and we must engage \nour allies in this war.\n  We should make the same preparation that we made for D-Day and the \nworld's entry into the Persian Gulf war. Our actions must be ongoing \nand relentless, and be dedicated to excising the cancer of terrorism \nwherever it raises its ugly head.\n  Our efforts cannot be another catharsis after a national tragedy, and \nthey must not fade with time into business as usual. We owe it to \nyesterday's victims and their families, especially their children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Most of all, we owe it to the American people and the world community \nto bring an end to terrorism everywhere and forever.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, all of us share in the overwhelming \nshock and grief at the horrible events of these past 24 hours. All of \nus are struggling to find the right words to say--struggling to \nunderstand our own emotions--struggling to answer the question, ``Where \ndo we go from here?'' Despite our uncertainties, we share a common \nbond--the deepest sorrow and sympathy we feel for those innocent people \nwho have lost their lives or their loved ones in those instants of \nunspeakable inhumanity. I join with the people and leaders of the world \nin expressing my profound sadness and extending my personal condolences \nto all of those who have been victimized by these acts of terror.\n  Ten years ago, the Soviet Union crumbled and the Warsaw Pact \ndisappeared. The cold war, many have said, is over. The nation moved \nquickly to reduce the size of our military and to reorder our national \npriorities to attend to pressing national issues of health care, \neducation, justice, and so forth. All of us celebrated the nation's new \npriorities. Hopes for the future of our nation and the evolving \ninternational system were high. What we were only beginning to \nunderstand, however, was that the end of the cold war did not mean the \nend of America's need to ensure its security in new and different ways.\n  In the wake of the cold war, military experts around the country \nbegan to discuss their concerns about the nation's new vulnerabilities. \nThe prospect of a pitched battle between heavy tanks on the fields of \nEurope was no longer the most likely threat to which our military \nforces would be asked to respond. Experts began discussing the idea of \n``asymmetric warfare''--that is, the ability of America's enemies to \nattack us where we are most vulnerable. The cold war structure of our \nmilitary and its weaponry was designed to meet adversaries with similar \ncapabilities--not to meet adversaries who chose different, often less \nsophisticated ways to get the job done.\n  Slowly, too slowly, we have begun to understand the full extent of \nour country's vulnerability. Many are concerned that potential enemies \nare developing intercontinental missiles with destructive warheads and \nthat we have no missile system capable of thwarting an attack of that \nkind. Others have warned that our enemies could deliver packages of \ndestruction in suitcases, rental trucks, or on shipboard. Still others \nhave observed our inability to\n\n[[Page S9330]]\n\nintercept low flying aircraft or cruise missiles heading to American \ntargets. The events of the past 24 hours demonstrate another horrible \nscenario of America's vulnerability to terrorist attack, an attack that \nwas indiscriminate in those who were targeted.\n  Our priorities are clear at this point. First, rescue these victims \nand help those who survive, their families, their children. Second, \nresolve to identify and punish those who perpetrated these heinous \nacts. And finally, we must put in place the safeguards and protections \nso that this type of heinous act can never occur again in this country.\n  My colleagues have referred to September 11th as a day of infamy--\nrecalling the same shock and horror the nation experienced at the news \nof Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. President Roosevelt offered the \nnation some vital words on that occasion. He said:\n\n       No matter how long it may take us to overcome this \n     premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous \n     might will win through to an absolute victory. This is a time \n     of national resolve. This is a time for us to also recall \n     President Roosevelt's directive that ``the greatest fear we \n     have, is fear itself.''\n\n  We cannot permit ourselves to stand still, overcome by shock, in \ntimes such as these. We must move forward as one, resolved to seek \njustice, and solutions to our national security laid bare by this \nhorrible event.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, on September 11, 2001, the United States \nsuffered the worst combined acts of domestic terrorism in our Nation's \nhistory. The world stood shocked and outraged at unprovoked acts of \nviolence committed upon thousands of innocent Americans.\n  President George W. Bush has ordered the Federal Government to assist \nthe victims of violence, investigate these acts of terror, and take \nsteps to bring those responsible for these tragedies to justice. I \nfully support President Bush's actions, and will do whatever I can to \nhelp him, and our country in this time of need. Terrorism cannot and \nwill not be tolerated. I know the President will take all measures \nnecessary to seek out and punish those who so viciously attacked \ninnocent and defenseless Americans.\n  As Americans, we are a strong and resilient people. We will heal and \nemerge stronger than ever. Our strength and spirit of democracy will \nshine through. We will not simply endure, we shall prevail. And we will \nsend a sharp message to these cowards, showing that terrorist acts will \nnot be tolerated. They will never be able to destroy our freedom and \nour way of life.\n  My heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to those who so tragically \nlost their lives and those friends and families who lost their loved \nones. This was far more than a tragedy--it was an outrageous act of \nterrorism that killed and injured so many innocent and decent citizens \nof our country. Nothing I can say to express my sympathy for those \nsuffering is enough. My outrage toward this cowardice act remains \nunwavering. For now, we must mourn those who have passed on and care \nfor those injured.\n  We must let the President, law enforcement, military and the \nintelligence community do their work. As a law-abiding Nation, we must \nbe sure to place blame on the guilty. Taking independent action against \nthe innocent and guests in our country is wrong. Many like me are \nfilled with anger and an unyielding desire for revenge, but we must \nremain calm and focused. In the heat of passion fired by the outrageous \nand despicable acts of those who are guilty, our leadership must be \ncalm and dispassionate in determining who is responsible and how we \nmust deal with them. Have no doubt: we will find those responsible. I \nsay to those responsible, ``You have no where to hide.'' Justice will \nbe served swiftly and harshly.\n  September 11, 2001, is another day that will forever live in infamy. \nYesterday's acts represented a well-planned, well-financed attack on \nour freedom by a faceless and gutless enemy. Make no mistake, we are at \nwar. Our military is on highest alert. Our armed forces are ready.\n  I stand firmly behind our Commander-in-Chief, President Bush. There \nis no doubt of our unity and resolve to track down, root out and \nrelentlessly pursue terrorists and the states that support them and \nharbor them. I stand by to support our military and intelligence \ncommunity and fight for any and all of the resources they need to \nensure our national security. Let us not forget this as we consider our \nfunding bills.\n  This is a great Nation with a strong and brave history. Americans \nhave come together and triumphed through difficult times like these. We \nwill again, and we will punish those responsible. America is united and \nstrong. Our military might remains unchallenged. America remains \nresolved in its efforts to find those who so cowardly committed these \nhorrific acts.\n  To quote a few words from out Battle Hymn of the Republic, those \nresponsible will soon understand the true meaning of the line, ``he \nhath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword'' as \nAmerica will indeed march on.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, first and foremost, my thoughts and \nprayers are with the hundreds of injured and the families of the lost. \nWords cannot fully describe what happened to these victims yesterday. \nBut our actions in the days and months ahead must do them justice as we \nhonor their ultimate sacrifices.\n  I also extend my gratitude to the scores of emergency service \nproviders police, firefighters, medical personnel who rushed to the \nWorld Trade Center and the Pentagon to save lives, only to lose their \nown. And we remember the many military and federal law enforcement \npersonnel who were working in those buildings at the time of the \nattacks who also lost their lives.\n  As we sort through the details of the savage terrorist attacks \nyesterday, and the wreckage left in their wake, we begin to comprehend \nmore fully the scope of this tragedy in our history. On December 7, \n1941, more than 2400 lives were lost at Pearl Harbor. And, during the \nBattle of Antietam on September 17, 1862 the day with the highest death \ntoll on American soil--approximately 22,000 lives were lost. No matter \nwhat the final count will be of lives lost yesterday, what \ndistinguishes us from the terrorists is the value we place on those \nlives as we learn more about the enormously sad events of this newly \nwritten chapter in our nation's history.\n  This morning all Americans woke up to a different world. The horrific \nterrorist attacks yesterday on our economic and military institutions \nwere a frontal assault not only on America, but on freedom and \ndemocracy enjoyed by millions of people around the world.\n  We Americans learned again that our freedom comes with a cost, and \nthe new battlegrounds are not on foreign soils or far away beaches. \nWhile we must always seek peace we, as a nation, will always defend \nourselves from any enemy.\n  America has been challenged before, and now America once again will \nrise to meet this challenge head-on.\n  The terrorists who perpetrated yesterday's carnage will be held \naccountable for their senseless acts of violence. Towards that end, I \nstrongly support the statement President Bush made last night to the \nnation and his commitment that ``we will make no distinction between \nthe terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.''\n  The time has come to quit treating terrorists as mere civil \ndisobedients, and begin treating their acts as acts of war.\n  The time has past when renegade nations can give safe harbor to \nterrorists with impunity. The President and the U.S. military have my \nfull support to strike and strike hard when the perpetrators and their \naccomplices are identified and found. For this Senator, that time can't \ncome soon enough.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice in our united \nsupport for the Joint Resolution we are adopting today.\n  American citizens, American aircraft, American buildings have been \nbrought down by barbaric terrorist attacks. Yet the American people, we \nas their elected representatives, and our free and open society stand \nunbowed and united.\n  America's spirit and resolve remain strong.\n  Today, we express condolences to those who suffered unspeakable loss. \nThe victims and their families are in our thoughts and prayers.\n  We commend the rescuers, working even now to save lives, the brave \nfiremen and police, doctors and nurses and\n\n[[Page S9331]]\n\ngenerous volunteers helping others and giving blood.\n  The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which my Appropriations \nsubcommittee funds and oversees, is coordinating Federal assistance. \nDirector Albaugh and FEMA have mobilized urban search and rescue teams. \nA top-notch team from Montgomery County and 7 others from around the \ncountry are hard at work at the Pentagon and in New York. All 20 other \nteams are ready to go. FEMA has also mobilized Army medical support, \nthe Army Corps of Engineers to help debris removal, and Army mortuary \nteams.\n  We are cooperating to confront this tragedy with President Bush and \nthe Administration, within Congress, and with allies around the world.\n  We condemn these barbaric attacks.\n  We are committed to tracking down the terrorists, punishing them and \nthose who harbor them, and preventing future attacks.\n  America is being tested by terrorism and America is rising to the \nchallenge. I am proud of the American people, who are responding not \nonly with shock and grief, but with unity, resolve, and generosity.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution \ncondemning yesterday's terrorist attacks. These assaults were a strike \nnot only against America, but against freedom itself.\n  My deepest condolences go out to those who lost loved ones during \nthis tragedy, and also to those rescue workers who risked, and many \ntimes lost, their lives in an effort to save the victims of this \nhorrific event. Even as we pause to pray for the victims and their \nfamilies, we promise to be unwavering in our pursuit of the cowards \nresponsible for these acts. It is a day we will never forget, but a day \nthat only strengthens our resolve to protect the freedoms that are the \ncornerstone of our society.\n  Watching this tragedy unfold, I recalled the day when our sovereign \ncountry was violated by the attack on Pearl Harbor. Over the years, I \nhoped and prayed that our hallowed lands would never again be defiled, \nand now they have once again been attacked. This time, however, our \nenemies remain nameless. These cowardly acts of terrorism will not be \ntolerated, and those who are responsible for these atrocities will \nsuffer the consequences of their actions. Let there be no mistake, we \nhave faced adversity before, and the United States of America will once \nagain prevail.\n  If this assault was intended to weaken the American spirit, these \ncowards will be very disappointed. When speaking on the purpose and \nmeans of war, the military theorist Carl Clausewitz stated that the \nfighting forces of the enemy ``must be put in such a condition that \nthey can no longer carry on the fight''. Mark my words, we stand united \nand prepared to use whatever means necessary to respond and destroy \nthose responsible.\n  The acts of heroism and generosity by Americans in New York City, \nWashington, D.C., and across the Nation has been extraordinary, but not \nsurprising. It is in difficult times that we are fortified by unity, \nand this will be no exception.\n  On December 8, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed \nCongress in response to Pearl Harbor. His words then inspired our \nNation to victory. Once again, his words ring true, ``With confidence \nin our armed forces--with the unbounding determination of our people--\nwe will gain the inevitable triumph--so help us God.''\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, much has been said on the Senate floor \nabout the events of the last 24 hours. I, too, want to express deep \nsadness and remorse for those that lost family and loved ones. We, as a \nNation, share your loss. The free world shares your grief. This was an \nattack on liberty, an attack on freedom, we are all victims.\n  As a veteran of the last World War, I know personally the horrors of \nwar. Pearl Harbor woke us from the dream that we would not be dragged \ninto World War II. Many commentators have made the parallel between \nyesterday's attack and the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. We were \ncompelled to act to defend our country from an unprovoked attack.\n  The events of yesterday, like those during Pearl Harbor, shattered \nour innocence and exposed our vulnerabilities as a Nation. In my view, \nyesterday's attack was worse than an act of war because, unlike Pearl \nHarbor, the enemy preyed upon unsuspecting, defenseless civilians to \nmaximize the loss of innocent human life and spread terror. Our freedom \nand the openness of our society, essential virtues that define us as a \nNation, were exploited to inflict terror upon our society. These were \ncoordinated, well-organized attacks on our Nation. Unlike the wars of \nthe past, today we face an enemy we cannot immediately identify and \nwhose exact location is unknown. The President and his national \nsecurity team have committed all the resources possible to find those \nwho are responsible. I stand with the President and the American \npeople, we must seek those who are responsible and respond with \noverwhelming force.\n  While this is still an emotionally charged time, we must begin the \nprocess of looking forward and addressing our security vulnerabilities \nexposed by yesterday's attacks. It is important to note that as the \nevents were unfolding, the Senate was debating the appropriations bill \nfor the Departments of Commerce, Justice and State, the funding \nlegislation that directly addresses counter-terrorism. And while it may \nnot provide immediate relief for the situation that we're faced with \ntoday, it is one of the legislative vehicles through which we can \nimpact the Nation's ability to address counter-terrorism.\n  We must have better organization and coordination of our counter-\nterrorism efforts. Sen. Judd Gregg and I have worked to organize an \nOffice of Counter-terrorism under the Attorney General and provide \nadequate funding for the Department of Justice. As we have argued, we \nmust redouble our national commitment and sustained effort to address \ncounter-terrorism. It begins with a coordinated effort organized in the \nDepartment of Justice, it is enhanced by improved security standards, \nand it is sustained through adequate funding.\n  This attack has highlighted the need for a new national security \nparadigm. It has showed us that the tools of our economic strength, \nsuch as civilian aircraft, can be used as instruments of destruction. \nTherefore, we must analyze the security threats associated with all \nmodes of commerce. Obviously, we must take immediate action to review \nand enhance the security at our Nation's airports. Moreover, we know \nthat current, inadequate security at our nation's ports makes us \nvulnerable to future attacks. With this knowledge, Senator Graham and I \nintroduced a bill to address security at our ports. The legislation \nseeks to enhance security at U.S. seaports through better interagency \ncoordination and more sufficient resources.\n  Seaports are international borders that currently are not subject to \nany security guidelines enforced by the federal government. Drug \nsmuggling, immigrant smuggling and trade fraud are prevalent crimes \nalong the Nation's seaports, and the lax security measures make \nterrorist activity an imminent threat as well.\n  Terrorism affects us all. We as a nation must stand together and \nstate resolutely that we will not tolerate terrorism, in the United \nStates or abroad. We will work in Congress to put in place the \nprotections necessary to defend our country from future terrorist \nactivity and uphold the liberties and freedom we hold dear. As stated \nby the Commander-in-Chief, the United States and its allies will stand \nfirm and take decisive action.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday a cowardly act of terrorism \nwas committed against this Nation. But, today, this Nation stands \nstrong and unified--a Nation of freedom and of hope, a Nation hurting, \nbut resolute in our determination to stamp out terrorism, now even on \nour own shores.\n  We can no longer ignore the threat that international terrorist \ngroups present to other nations. Yesterday, we faced the reality of \nthat threat. Until yesterday, we had rested in the belief that such an \natrocity by foreign hand could not occur on U.S. soil, but now it has, \nand we must respond. We must safeguard our shores from further acts of \nviolence. We are at war with an enemy of rogues and cowards and they \nmust be crushed. We have received a rude awakening, and now we must \nact. There is a lot for us to do. More than a year ago, I was critical \nof the diversion of funds from human intelligence\n\n[[Page S9332]]\n\nto high tech counter-terrorism efforts. Tomorrow, we will resume that \ndebate, but today is a day for national mourning.\n  My prayers go out to all the victims and their families. I pray that \nGod will grant a comfort and peace that is unspeakable in its depth to \nthose who are hurting and for the families of the victims. I cannot \nadequately express my sympathy to those who lost loved ones in these \ntragedies, and across America we share in their grief.\n  Outside of Union Station, a block from the Capitol, fly the flags of \nall 50 States. It is right that these 50 flags now fly at half mast, \nfor this is a day that will directly touch millions of families across \nthis Nation. We have already learned that at least one Iowan, Karen \nKincaid, a native of Waverly, IA, was abroad the hijacked plane that \nstruck the Pentagon on Tuesday morning. Our prayers go out of Karen's \nfamily and her loved ones. I fear that in the days to come we may \nlearn of other Iowans whose lives have been destroyed by these \ntragedies. We all must look for ways to help. We can pray for peace. We \ncan give blood.\n\n  In the face of all of yesterday's evil, thousands of courageous \nAmericans rose to the challenge. Men and women, filled with the basic \ndecency and goodness that embodies all that is America, rushed to the \nrescue of the injured and the dying. Firefighters, police, EMTs, \ndoctors and other volunteers have been working around the clock, and we \nthank them. Unfortunately, we have learned that many of these brave men \nand women have given that last full measure of devotion. We mourn for \nthem and honor their sacrifice. The greatness of our people stands in \nsharp contrast to the unnamed cowards who have perpetrated this evil.\n  I also want to recognize and thank Secretary Thompson for his effort \nto bring 7000 doctors, nurses, and health care professionals to New \nYork.\n  Now, we must go on, unified behind President Bush's leadership. \nToday's resolution demonstrates the unity of Congress to stand behind \nthe President in the effort to bring the perpetrators to justice. We \nmust commit ourselves to the task of preventing tragedies such as this \nfrom ever again happening on our shores. We are a Nation strong and \ndogged in our commitment to seek out and crush the men who committed \nthese acts of violence against our country.\n  Terrorism is our national enemy and we must fight it as a Nation. \nThese great tragedies were perpetrated not against a particular race, \ncolor, religion, or creed. Yesterday's violence was born in a hatred of \nAmerica and what it stands for. It was an open attach on all our people \nand our values. Freedom itself was under assault. Truly this was an act \nof war on America, and we must act accordingly.\n  Our friends in the International community, we now ask you to work by \nour side to quash those who have engaged in these heinous acts. We will \nneed your assistance to identify and punish those who are behind these \nacts.\n  State sponsored terrorism is an enemy to all democracies. To see \nvictory over terrorism, we must not just retaliate against the \nterrorist, but as President Bush said last night, we must also punish \nthose countries who harbor and assist them. Justice must be brought to \nthe terrorists and to the States from which they plan and wage their \nevil schemes.\n  We must all be unified in this effort to combat terrorism. I am proud \nto be an American.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Smith \namendment allowing American veterans--our U.S. citizens--who were used \nas slave laborers in Japan during WWII to have their day in court.\n  I appreciate the sensitive nature of this issue. Just prior to the \nrecess, I received correspondence from my dear friend and former \nSecretary of State, George Schultz. He outlined the provisions of \narticle 14 of the 1951 peace treaty with Japan which seemingly settles \nthe question of restitution for the former POWs. His letter, quite \nproperly, has been referred to in order to address this issue. I must, \nhowever, respectfully disagree with my valued friend and adviser.\n  I believe we must look at the entire treaty. Article 26 contains a \nprovision which states that if Japan enters into any future treaties \nwith other countries providing better terms than those extended to the \nUnited States, then those more favorable terms will be extended to the \nUnited States as well. It is my understanding that several other \ncountries such as Sweden and Denmark have received such terms.\n  I have listened closely to my esteemed colleague from Hawaii speak on \nthis subject, and I recognize our duty to honor our treaties. However, \nwe must be sure to look at the entire treaty and honor our obligations \nto our veterans who survived under such horrible conditions.\n  I have been contacted by a significant number of veterans from my \nState, and I feel duty-bound to let them have their day in court. I ask \nmy colleagues to consider their views and the entire treaty when making \ntheir vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/12/senate-section/article/S9332-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             HUGH C. GRAHAM\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a distinguished \nconstituent of mine, Hugh C. Graham, upon the occasion of his \nretirement from the American Legion Department of Connecticut.\n  As a member of the American Legion for 57 years, Hugh served as an \nAdjutant for 32 years, the longest-serving Adjutant in the country. \nDuring his tenure within this revered national organization, Hugh \nadmirably dedicated himself to promoting the health and well-being of \nour veterans, both in Connecticut and beyond.\n  Hugh himself served his country with distinction during World War II. \nHaving enlisted with the United States Army in New Haven on February \n16, 1942, he served as a rifleman in the 45th Infantry ``Thunderbird'' \nDivision of the 180th Infantry Regiment. For 511 days, he fought \nbravely in the European theater, seeing combat in Italy, France, and \nGermany, and participated in five amphibious assault landings. For his \nvalor and wounds received at Anzio Beach, Hugh was awarded the Purple \nHeart Medal. He was also awarded the European-African Theater Medal \nwith five campaign stars, the World War II Victory Medal, and the \nCombat Infantryman's Badge. Hugh received an honorable discharge from \nthe Army on September 5, 1945.\n  Over the years, Hugh's work with and for veterans has received well-\ndeserved recognition from numerous organizations. He has received \nvarious service and achievement awards from the Forty and Eight \nSociety, the Veterans Administration, and the American Legion \nDepartment of Rhode Island.\n  Although Hugh is retiring from active duty in the American Legion, I \nknow that he will continue to promote veterans affairs and that his \nlegacy will live on within the organization. Once again, I would like \nto congratulate Hugh upon the occasion of his retirement and I \nsincerely thank him for all of the service he has given to both \nConnecticut and our nation. I wish him all my best in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/12/senate-section/article/S9332-4", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9332-S9333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING JAMES L. VOSS, DVM\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to day to pay tribute to a \nman who has had a profound impact on Colorado State University, the \nCity of Ft. Collins, CO and the veterinary community nationwide.\n  According to US News and World Report, Colorado State University \nboasts\n\n[[Page S9333]]\n\nthe second best veterinary medicine program in the nation. One of the \nreasons CSU is so nationally renowned is because of its wonderful \nVeterinary Teaching Hospital. And one of the reasons that hospital \nexists is because of Dr. James L. Voss.\n  Currently the Dean of the CSU College of Veterinary Medicine and \nBiomedical Sciences, Dr. Voss received his Doctorate of Veterinary \nMedicine from CSU in 1958 and was hired by the University as an \ninstructor. While a student, he was one of my best instructors. As the \nuniversity was growing and seeking to enhance its veterinary teaching \ncapabilities, plans for a news Veterinary Teaching Hospital got \nunderway. Dr. Voss became the faculty representative of the hospital \nbuilding committee. In 1979, the Hospital was completed. And now, the \nHospital will bear his name.\n  I am proud to join all CSU veterinary School alumni in saying that no \nfiner man deserves this honor. This building and all the science and \nteaching that has taken place in it since 1979, are direct results of \nDr. Voss' determination, dedication and love of veterinary medicine. \nBecause of Dr. Voss and his long service to the university and our \nprofession, CSU has produced some of the finest veterinarians in the \nnation. CSU and Ft. Collins have become central locations in national \nand international veterinary science.\n  When one man does so much for an institution and a profession like \nDr. Voss has, it is only fitting to honor him in this manner. I am \nextremely pleased that from this day forward, the James L. Voss \nVeterinary Teaching Hospital at Colorado State University will continue \nto serve the university, the veterinary medical community, and \nscience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/12/senate-section/article/S9333-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO THE GEORGE KHOURY ASSOCIATION OF BASEBALL LEAGUES, INC.\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize an outstanding organization that is dedicated to youth \nbaseball, the George Khoury Association of Baseball Leagues, Inc. I \ncommend this extraordinary program that is celebrating its 65th \nanniversary.\n  The George Khoury Association of Baseball Leagues, Inc. was founded \nby George M. Khoury in 1936 in Saint Louis, MO. It is dedicated to \npromoting America's favorite pastime, and commited to giving youth a \nchance to play the game and learn about sportsmanship. In 1936, there \nwere only four baseball teams in the Khoury league. However, after \nWorld War II, the program began to expand into other states, like \nKentucky and Illinois. Now there are leagues in several states all over \nthe country and even in some foreign countries. The Khoury league not \nonly includes baseball teams, but also softball, soccer, and other \nexciting team sports.\n  I commend the George Khoury Association of Baseball Leagues, Inc. for \nits dedication to youth sports and the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/12/senate-section/article/S9333-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/12/senate-section/article/S9333-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/12/senate-section/article/S9333-4", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:48 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 434.

Res. 159\n\n       Whereas there are 105 historically black colleges and \n     universities in the United States;\n       Whereas black colleges and universities provide the quality \n     education so essential to full participation in a complex, \n     highly technological society;\n       Whereas black colleges and universities have a rich \n     heritage and have played a prominent role in American \n     history;\n       Whereas black colleges and universities have allowed many \n     underprivileged students to attain their full potential \n     through higher education; and\n       Whereas the achievements and goals of historically black \n     colleges and universities are deserving of national \n     recognition: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to submit a Senate Resolution \ndesignating the week beginning September 16, 2001, as ``National \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities Week.'' It is my privilege \nto sponsor this legislation, honoring the Historically Black Colleges \nof our Country, for the sixteenth time.\n  Thousands of young Americans have received quality educations at the \n105 Historically Black Colleges and Universities in this Country. These \ninstitutions have a long and distinguished history of providing the \ntraining necessary for participation in a rapidly changing society. I \nam pleased that eight of the 105 Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities are located in my State of South Carolina. Historically \nBlack Colleges offer our citizens a variety of curricula and programs \nthrough which young people develop skills and talents, thereby \nexpanding opportunities for continued social progress.\n  Studies have shown that Historically Black Colleges and Universities \nhave graduated the majority of black professionals in the Nation. The \nadoption of this resolution will affirm the United States' support for \nthese institutions and the critical contributions of their alumni to \nour society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/12/senate-section/article/S9341-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 160--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 2001, AS \n                        ``FAMILY HISTORY MONTH''\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \nBennett, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Craig, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Cleland, \nMr. Hutchinson, and Mr. Inouye) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                              S.
