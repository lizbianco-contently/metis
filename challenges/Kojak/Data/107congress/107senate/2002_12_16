Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about S. \n1497, the Virgin River Dinosaur Footprint Preserve Act and its \ncompanion measure in the House, H.R. 2385. This bill would convey \ncertain property to the city of St. George, Utah, in order to provide \nfor the protection and preservation of certain rare paleontological \nresources on that property.\n  This legislation would provide vital protections to one of our \nnation's most recent, and most intact pre-Jurassic paleontological \ndiscoveries. In February 2000, Sheldon Johnson of St. George, UT, began \ndevelopment preparations on his land when he uncovered one of the \nworld's most significant collections of dinosaur tracks, tail \ndraggings, and skin imprints in the surrounding rock. Without any \nadvertising, the site has attracted many tens of thousands of visitors \nand the interest of some of the world's top paleontologists.\n  This was a fantastic discovery that has added important new insights \ninto the Jurassic period. However, now that these prints have been \nuncovered, the fragile sandstone in which the impressions have been \nmade is in jeopardy due to the heat and wind typical of the southern \nUtah climate. We must act quickly if these footprints from our past are \nto be preserved. This bill would authorize the Secretary of the \nInterior to purchase the land where the footprints and tail draggings \nare found and convey the property to the city of St. George. The city \nwill work together with the property owners and Washington County to \npreserve and protect the area and the resources found there.\n  We owe a debt of gratitude to Sheldon and LaVerna Johnson who made \nthis discovery on their land and have dedicated thousands of hours of \ntheir personal time and much of their own money to trying to preserve \nthis site. They have done all they can to protect it, while at the same \ntime opening up their land for visitors and scientists to view the new \nfindings free of costs. They have given so much to this cause, but they \ncannot keep it up indefinitely. They desperately hope that the \nGovernment will step up and help carry the burden of managing this \nprecious resource, and with passage of this legislation tonight we will \nprovide them with the relief they deserve.\n  I thank Senators Bingaman and Murkowski, the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, for \ntheir assistance in seeing this measure passed by Congress and sent to \nthe President. I also thank Representative James Hansen, my good friend \nand the sponsor of the companion measure in the House for all he has \ndone to make this legislation possible.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-\nreported amendments be withdrawn; that the bill be read the third time \nand passed; and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The committee amendments were withdrawn.\n  The bill (H.R. 2385) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before we get to the next matter, let me \nexpress my appreciation to the Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett. He has \nbeen here all night. But for him, we would not have made the progress \nwe have. All Senators should be very grateful for his weighing in on \nthese delicate matters. I appreciate what the Senator from Utah has \ndone to help us get to this point.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the assistant majority leader. I \nwish to make it clear that without his leadership and cooperation, we \nwould not be doing what we are doing. It takes two hands to clap. We \nwere waving our hands uselessly in the air until the Senator from \nNevada stepped in. I am very grateful to him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/12/16/senate-section/article/S11804-1", "month": "12", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe following enrolled bills, previously signed by the Speaker of the \nHouse, were signed on November 21, 2002, by the President pro tempore \n(Mr. Byrd):\n\n       S. 1010.
