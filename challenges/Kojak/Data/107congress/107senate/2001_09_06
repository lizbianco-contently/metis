When we commit our problems, plans, and projects to You, You \ninstigate thoughts we would not have conceived without Your help. Show \nus how the sublime secret of intellectual leadership works. The \nPsalmist knew that secret: ``Commit your way to the Lord, and trust \nalso in Him, and He shall bring it to pass . . . rest in the Lord, and \nwait patiently for Him'' (Psalm 37:5, 7).\n  We claim Your presence; You are here in this Chamber and with every \nSenator and staff member in the offices and committees and hearing \nrooms of the Capitol. We praise You for Your superabundant adequacy to \nsupply our needs spiritually and intellectually. You establish our \nthinking and energize our work. Bless the Joint Session of Congress \nthis morning as we welcome Mexican President Vicente Fox and continue \nto strengthen the ties between Mexico and the United States.\n  We commit the day; You will show the way, and we will receive Your \nstrength without delay.

Mr. President, with respect to S. 149, which is before \nthe\n\n[[Page S9130]]\n\nSenate, it is our anticipation that upon returning from the joint \nmeeting and going back into session at noon, we would be able then to \nmove expeditiously. There are a couple of amendments that I presume \nSenator Thompson and Senator Kyl will offer. We have had an opportunity \nto review those amendments. We think they strengthen the bill. We are \nprepared to accept those amendments.\n  There is a question of the blue ribbon commission on which an \nagreement has not been reached. I do not know whether Senator Shelby, \nwho authored that amendment, will proceed to offer it or not. If he \ndoes, we will have to take it up and, of course, be open to amendment. \nWe hope to be able to resolve that issue rather quickly. We have a \nmanagers' amendment to be adopted. And then we anticipate going to \nfinal passage.\n  So that is the sequence that we envision. We think that could be done \nin short order. I don't think that it will really take a lot of time to \ndo all of this, maybe an hour at most, and we could get this bill \ncompleted and off the floor. I say to the majority whip, we would be \nable then to move on to other legislation in the early afternoon. But \nthat is my expectation of how we will proceed.\n\n  I want to acknowledge and thank Senator Thompson, Senator Kyl, and \nSenator Enzi--Senator Gramm was involved in the discussion that Senator \nEnzi had with the other two Senators--for moving this matter along.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Will the Senator yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I think the Senator very well states the \nstatus of the situation and what has occurred. We have been discussing \nthese matters as late as 30 minutes ago. I do anticipate that we will \nhave two short amendments that have been discussed and we will be able \nto agree upon which will improve the bill. As a part of our \nunderstanding, there will be two letters from both advocates and \nopponents of this legislation to the White House on a couple matters \nthat we believe are very important but that should first be addressed \nby the White House, such as the deemed export rule, which is a very \ncomplex matter that we believe should properly be handled by Executive \norder. So with those two amendments and those two letters, I think we \nare in a state of agreement with regard thereto.\n  The only other matter, as Senator Sarbanes indicated, is the question \nof the commission. I anticipate that we will certainly know by 12 \no'clock what the situation on that will be. We will either have a vote \non that or not. But if we do, I would anticipate that would be the only \nrollcall vote that we would have, and we would be able to proceed \nforthwith to final passage.\n  Mr. ENZI. Will the Senator yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. ENZI. I would add my thanks and appreciation for all the hard \nwork, particularly of Senator Thompson and Senator Kyl and their staffs \nand Senator Gramm and his staff. The meetings and the work on this did \ngo late into the evening last night and began this morning so we could \nhave as little interruption and expedition of the business that needs \nto be done by the Senate. Their cooperation, their attention to detail, \nand their willingness to discuss throughout the whole process the last \n3 years we have been working on it is very much appreciated, \nparticularly the hours they and their staff put in last evening and \nearly this morning.\n  Mr. SARBANES.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 149, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 149) to provide authority to control exports, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, as we debate our system of export \ncontrols in this new era, we hear an array of arguments that reflect \nAmerica's preeminent role in the world, our military and economic \npower, and the absence of the threat of major war that has prevailed \nsince the demise of the Soviet Union a decade ago. We hear proud claims \nthat trade is the new currency of international politics; that the \nstrength of our economy, now more than ever, underpins our national \npower and global influence; and that in the brave new world of the \nInformation Age, most technological flows are uncontrollable, or \ncontrols are meaningless due to the availability of the same technology \nfrom foreign competitors.\n  The business of America is business, we are told, and those of us who \nbelieve national security controls exist to protect national security, \nrather than simply expedite American exports, are accused of old \nthinking, of living in a dangerous past rather than a prosperous and \npeaceful present. For many, the new definition of national security--in \na haunting echo of the thinking that inaugurated the last century--\npredicates the safety and well-being of the American people upon the \nfree flows of trade and finance that make our economy the envy of the \nworld, and our business leaders a dominant force in our time.\n  I am an ardent free trader, and I believe economic dynamism is indeed \na central pillar of national strength. But I do not believe our \nprosperity requires us to forego very limited and appropriate controls \non goods and technologies that, in the wrong hands, could be used to \nattack our civilian population here at home, or against American troops \nserving overseas. Experts agree that both rogue regimes and hostile \nterrorist organizations are actively seeking components for weapons of \nmass destruction, many of which are included in the list of goods we \ncontrol under our current export licensing system.\n  Unlike in the Cold War era, when we created our export control regime \nto keep sensitive technologies out of the hands of the Soviet Union, \nthis era is characterized by an array of diverse threats emanating from \nboth hostile nations and non-state actors. Hostile nations like Iran \nand North Korea are disturbingly close to developing multiple-stage \nballistic missiles with the capability to target the United States. \nThese and other nations, including Syria and Iraq, receive significant \nand continuing technical assistance and material support for their \nweapons development efforts from China and Russia, with whom much of \nour trade in dual-use items is conducted. The intelligence community \nhas made startlingly clear the proliferation record of China and \nRussia, as well as North Korea, and the adverse consequences of their \nweapons development and technology transfers to American security \ninterests.\n\n[[Page S9131]]\n\n  I do not believe that S. 149 adequately addresses these threats. \nUnfortunately, the Senate yesterday rejected a reasonable amendment \noffered by Senator Thompson allowing the relevant national security \nagencies to receive a 60-day time extension to review particularly \ncomplex license applications. This reform, proposed by the Cox \nCommission, and a number of amendments adopted by the House \nInternational Relations Committee in its markup of the Export \nAdministration Act, properly addressed some of the deficiencies in the \ncurrent version of S. 149.\n\n  S. 149 has the strong support of the business community and the Bush \nAdministration. In the short term, proponents of this legislation are \ncorrect: loosening our export controls will assist American businesses \nin selling advanced products overseas. In another age, proponents of \nfree trade in sensitive goods with potentially hostile nations were \nalso correct in asserting the commercial value of such enterprise: \nBritain's pre-World War I steel trade with Germany earned British \nplants substantial profits even as it allowed Germany to construct a \nworld-class navy. Western sales of oil to Imperial Japan in the years \npreceding World War II similarly earned peaceful nations commercial \nrevenues. In both cases, friendly powers caught on to the destructive \npotential of such sales and embargoed them, but it was too late. Such \ntrade inflicted an immeasurable cost on friendly nations blinded by \npure faith in the market, and in the power of commerce to overcome the \nambitions of hostile powers that did not share their values.\n  I resolutely support free trade. But I cannot with a clear conscience \nsupport passage of legislation that weakens our national security \ncontrols on sensitive exports to a point that we may one day be \nchallenged, or face attack, from weapons derived from the very \ntechnologies we have willingly contributed to the world. Our peaceable \nintentions, our love of prosperity and stability, are not shared by \nthose who would do America harm, and whose hostile ambitions today may \nwell be matched tomorrow by the ability to deliver on that threat. We \nshould make it harder, not easier, for them to do so.\n  Our export control regime should undergo significant reform to \naddress the challenges and opportunities of our time. Proponents of S. \n149 focus on the opportunities this legislation affords American \nbusiness. I have worked with Senators Thompson, Kyl, Shelby, Helms, and \nWarner to highlight the reality that this bill does not adequately \naddress the national security challenges we face today. National \nsecurity controls cover only a tiny fraction of total American exports; \nthe overwhelming majority of export applications for dual-use items are \napproved by our government; limited controls properly exist to help \nprevent highly sensitive technologies from falling into the wrong \nhands; and such safeguards are more relevant than ever in the face of \nthe multifaceted and unconventional threats to our country unleashed by \nthe information revolution.\n  A number of proponents of S. 149 argue that American companies should \nnot be straitjacketed by U.S. national security controls even as their \nforeign competitors remain free to peddle similar technologies to \nproliferators and rogue regimes. This argument overlooks the fact that \nAmerica continues to lead the world in technological innovation; our \nproducts are often unique when compared with those produced by \nbusinesses in France, Germany, or Japan. More fundamentally, such an \napproach only emboldens potential enemies who seek access to our \nmarkets in sensitive goods. In concert with friends and allies, we \nshould endeavor to shame foreign companies who sell dangerous items to \nrogue buyers by making their identities public--not scramble for market \naccess in dangerous technologies at their expense, as if nothing more \nthan corporate profits were at stake. We should also make it a \ndiplomatic priority to construct a new multilateral export control \nregime, in concert with like-minded nations, to fill the vacuum created \nby the collapse of COCOM, which regulated Allied exports during the \nCold War to keep critical technologies out of Soviet hands.\n  As a proud free-trader, I maintain that we should continue to \ncarefully review our most sensitive exports; we can, in fact, exercise \nsome control over their end use. I fear we shall one day reap the \nbitter harvest we sow in our neglect of the consequences to America's \nsecurity of an overly complacent export licensing regime. As a nation, \nwe may have to learn the hard way that winking at the proliferation \nthreats we face today, in light of clear evidence that nations to which \nwe export sensitive technologies continue to apply and share them with \nour enemies, diminishes our national security to a point for which no \namount of corporate profits will compensate.\n  I thank Senator Thompson for his efforts on this legislation. I do \nnot believe that his amendment yesterday should have been defeated. I \nthought it was a reasonable amendment. I think it is also another \nexample of a compelling requirement for campaign finance reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, S. 149 is, in fact, a balance that \nmodernizes our export control laws to account for the geopolitical, \ncommercial, and technological changes of this past decade.\n  This bill recognizes that on occasion exports must be controlled for \nnational security and for foreign policy reasons. S. 149 substantially \nincreases the President's authority to impose controls when in fact \nthey are necessary.\n  I have great respect for the few opponents of this legislation. \nHowever, I believe it is a misstatement to suggest that this bill \nsomehow diminishes our Nation's ability to control technology which \nneeds to be controlled when in fact this legislation imposes greater \ncontrols where necessary and significantly increases penalties and \ndecreases the likelihood of sales that are inappropriate.\n  At the same time this legislation acknowledges that a vibrant \nAmerican economy is a critical component of our national security. \nSenator Bennett, our friend from Utah, spoke eloquently to this point \nyesterday.\n  Advancements in high technology allow us to ``run faster'' than our \nenemies. To foster continued advancements, we must take great care not \nto punish American businesses by limiting unnecessarily their \nmarketplace, if those same products will simply be provided by our \nforeign competitors.\n  The observation is made, well, what about unique American technology? \nThis legislation takes that into account. It allows for strong \nlimitations where it is truly unique and where those sales would, in \nfact, pose some jeopardy to our Nation's security.\n  S. 149 balances our national security interests and our commercial \ninterests with a first and foremost concern for national security--\nappropriately so. But it does recognize that our prosperity and our \nsecurity are, in fact, interrelated.\n\n  This has been a thoroughly bipartisan process--a process, frankly, \nthat I would like to see more often the case on the floor of this body.\n  I have great gratitude for the work of Chairman Sarbanes, ranking \nmember Gramm, Senator Enzi, and some others who have contributed in a \nconstructive way to this legislation. And Senators Thompson and Kyl \nhave made valuable suggestions to enhance the bill. I thank them for \ntheir role and their sincere concern for our Nation's security. I thank \nSenators Dayton and Roberts for their constructive input on this \nlegislation as well.\n  I urge the House to move expeditiously to pass the EAA so the White \nHouse can sign this bill into law. This is a high priority for the \nWhite House.\n  For those who may have some concern about the expertise of the vast \nbipartisan majority of this Senate in support of this legislation out \nof national security concerns, I again remind the body that this \nlegislation not only had the overwhelming bipartisan support of \nthoughtful Senators on both sides of the aisle but is urgently \nsupported by President Bush, by Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, \nSecretary of State Powell, Commerce Secretary Evans, and National \nSecurity Adviser Condoleezza Rice. Certainly those in the White House \nhave taken national security as a first and foremost concern. Any \nsuggestion that somehow that issue has been taken lightly by the \nadvocates of this bill is simply incorrect.\n\n[[Page S9132]]\n\n  This has been, frankly, a model for how the Senate can work together \nfor the good of our Nation. It is not a Republican bill. It is not a \nDemocrat bill. But it is a bill put together across the aisle with the \ncooperation of the White House. It has been extremely gratifying, \nfrankly, to have been so closely involved in the creation of this \nreauthorization.\n  To reject this legislation, to fall back on the Executive order, \nwhich is under legal challenge, and which extends far less authority to \nthe White House to control the sales of high-tech items around the \nworld, would be a tragic mistake. This Nation needs a modern dual-use \ntechnology trade regime. This legislation provides that.\n  Those in our Government who are given the great responsibility of \nnational security have applauded this bill. It is the kind of balance \nour country needs. I believe the Senate has performed its work very \nably to bring this bill to this point.\n  It is my hope we can conclude this debate very soon, work with our \ncolleagues in the other body, and deliver this bill onto the desk of \nthe President, who has urged us over and over again to pass this bill \nand to again have in place a strong, powerful, dual-use technology \ntrade regime for our Nation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1527\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1527:\n       On page 197, line 15, strike ``substantially inferior'' and \n     insert ``not of comparable quality''.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, this amendment addresses the issue of \nforeign availability. As all who have listened to our discussion up \nuntil now realize, one of the more important pieces of S. 149 has to do \nwith foreign availability. Essentially, what this bill does is say if \nthe Department of Commerce makes a determination that some item has \nforeign availability status, then that item is essentially \ndecontrolled. It does not go through the licensing process anymore, the \nidea being that it is out there and anybody can get it, and why control \nit.\n  Frankly, I think it is not a good idea. I think that foreign \navailability should be taken into consideration, as we always have in \nour export policy taken foreign availability into consideration. We do \nnot want to try to stop the export of items that are clearly out there \nin the domain, but it should not be an overriding consideration. We \nshould not be deregulating whole categories of items, and not even \nbeing able to keep up with how much we are shipping to some country, \nand what kind of item we are sending to some country.\n  This foreign availability concept takes these large categories \ntotally outside the regulatory process that we are fearful might \ncontain something that might turn out to be harmful to our national \nsecurity. We ought to have a way for the appropriate representatives in \nour Government to judge these matters, item by item, and case by case, \nto make a determination. It may take a few days, a few weeks in some \ncases perhaps, to make this determination, but it is well worth it \nbecause the reason for export control laws is not primarily commerce; \nit is primarily national security.\n  If you look at this bill, you will see that the purpose of the export \ncontrol law is to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and things that are detrimental to our national security or \nthings that potentially are. But, anyway, I am in the minority on that.\n  The administration supports this concept of foreign availability. The \nmajority leadership supports this concept. So that being the case, we \nhave attempted to enter into discussions whereby, hopefully, we could \nconvince our colleagues on the other side of this issue that there is \nsome validity to our concern and, hopefully, the idea being that they \nwould make some accommodation to us on this concept.\n  I am happy to say that we have been able to reach some accommodation \non this issue that addresses some of our concerns.\n  This amendment that I have just offered makes an important change to \nthe definition of ``foreign availability.'' Under S. 149, items could \nbe decontrolled and bypass any kind of review so long as similar items \nthat were available from foreign countries were not substantially \ninferior to U.S. items. In other words, foreign availability would kick \nin and the decontrol would kick in under the bill as long as countries \ncould get things that were not substantially inferior.\n  Our belief is that we ought to make sure, before we decontrol our \nitems, they can really get items that are comparable to what we have. \nIf they can get items that are inferior to what we have, then we should \nstill maintain controls because we have something they cannot otherwise \nget. And they are sensitive matters or they would not have been on the \ncontrol list. So we ought to be careful about that.\n  So this amendment changes that standard of ``not substantially \ninferior'' to ensure that the items are of ``comparable quality'' to \nU.S. items. It is a small but significant change that ensures that we \nwill not decontrol superior American technology just because inferior \nitems are available overseas.\n\n  So I think this strengthens this provision in an important way. It \ncertainly does not address all of our concerns, but it does strengthen \nthis provision in an important way to make sure if we are going to \nenter into this, what I consider to be a very large decontrol process, \nin a very dangerous time, to very dangerous countries, that we ought to \nat least make sure that if we are claiming they can get these items \nanyway, it is really the same kind of items we have, the same quality \nwe have. I think this amendment would go a long way toward ensuring \nthat.\n  I thank my colleagues on the other side of this issue for entering \ninto real discussions with us on it. Hopefully, we have come to an \nagreement on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nhis contribution throughout this debate. As he said, we have listened \nand considered carefully. I am perfectly prepared to accept this \namendment. And I think introducing this quality concept about which he \nspoke yesterday is an important improvement and addition to this bill. \nI am happy to be supportive of it.\n  Mr. ENZI. I, too, thank the Senator from Tennessee for his \ncooperation and diligence in the months of working on this bill with \nus, and with the 59 other changes in the bill as well, and for his \nwillingness to work with us on this change. We are happy to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If not the question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 1527.\n  The amendment (No. 1527) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ENZI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I withhold the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I suggest that while we are waiting on \nanother Senator, who I believe has one more amendment to consider, we \ndiscuss the matters of deemed exports and commodity classification. We \nhave had some discussions about those subjects also. If I may, I will \nsimply relate what my understanding is with regard to those issues.\n  First of all, on the deemed export issue, we have had concerns on \nthis side that the legislation did not adequately address the problem \nof deemed\n\n[[Page S9133]]\n\nexports. As most who follow this issue know, a deemed export comes \nabout when, in a typical situation, sensitive information is passed to \na foreign national who perhaps is working at one of our National \nLaboratories or working in one of our businesses on sensitive \ninformation, who may or may not have a government contract, the idea \nbeing that with regard to the physical exporting of an item, that \ninformation should then be controlled when giving it to a foreign \nnational. That should be reported. We should go through a reasonable \nprocess to make sure no damage is being done.\n  We learned from hearings with regard to our National Laboratories, \nfor example, that we were woefully behind as a government from even \nprivate industry; that we were not paying attention in our National \nLaboratories to the deemed export requirements. There were hardly any \ndeemed export notifications or licenses issued by our laboratories. Our \nlaboratories contain probably the most sensitive matters that we have \nin this Nation, including the maintenance of our nuclear stockpile, our \nStockpile Stewardship Program, including information concerning our \nmost sensitive weapons.\n  We believed we should deal with the deemed export issue. The \nadministration has said it would like to address this complex issue--\nand it is complex--through regulation rather than include it in the \nlegislation. We have agreed that a letter will be sent to the \nadministration from both supporters and opponents of this bill asking \nthe administration to review existing regulations and address this \nissue.\n\n  Continued control of deemed exports is an essential component of our \nexport control process. Right now there is substantial noncompliance, \nas I said. This letter is designed to urge the administration to \ndevelop new regulations that ensure understanding of and compliance \nwith the responsibility to control deemed exports.\n  I understand there are some in the business community who do not like \nthe concept of deemed exports at all. My understanding and intention, \nas far as this letter is concerned, is not to give the administration \nthe option of continuing a deemed export policy or not; it is to \ntighten up the policy and make sure it is updated and clear in terms of \nwhat responsibilities are under that policy.\n  It is a reasonable request that they be given the opportunity to \naddress it. It is a very complex issue. We don't want to create onerous \nrequirements. These foreign students and scientists who come to America \nmake valuable contributions in many different ways. But we simply have \nto exercise common sense and protect ourselves and go through an \nappropriate process when it comes to deemed exports.\n  I am happy. I believe we have reached some agreement that we write \nthe administration and express generally those thoughts.\n  Could I get an amen on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, again, I appreciate the care, concern, and \ndetail in which the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from \nArizona, and others who have participated on this, have expressed their \nconcerns about the deemed export controls. We do recognize that the \nproblem is not primarily in the private sector; that it is primarily in \nthe government and educational and health institutions. The private \nsector has some proprietary rights they try to preserve, but it would \nbe a problem there, too, and we wanted it addressed in all those \nsectors.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1529\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I have an amendment I send to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1529.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 296, strike line 1 through line 7 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(3) Refusal by country.--If the country in which the end-\n     user is located refuses to allow post-shipment verification \n     of a controlled item, the Secretary may deny a license for \n     the export of that item, any substantially identical or \n     directly competitive item or class of items, any item that \n     the Secretary determines to be of equal or greater \n     sensitivity than the controlled item, or any controlled item \n     for which a determination has not been made pursuant to \n     section 211 to all end-users in that country until such post-\n     shipment verification is allowed.''\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me explain what this amendment does and \nindicate to my colleagues that I believe I have the concurrence of the \nchairman of the committee and the ranking member of the subcommittee \nand have met this morning with the ranking member of the Banking \nCommittee who worked out the language with us. In fact, much of this is \nhis language.\n  This is the amendment I spoke to yesterday regarding the post-\nshipment verification that sometimes has to occur when we say, in the \ngranting of an export, we will grant the license to send the item \noverseas but for a peaceful purpose, for a commercial purpose, or \nresearch, or university, a business purpose; we don't want you to take \nthis item and put it in your defense facility or a nuclear weapons \nfacility, something of that kind. We are going to verify, after we ship \nit, that it went to the right place.\n  Remember these are dual-use items. They have two different uses. They \nmay be very useful in a private way, business way. They may also be \nuseful in a military way. Let me give an example.\n  Not too long ago, some folks in Germany developed a very important \nmedical device called the lithotriptor which, with a high-energy beam, \nliterally zaps kidney stones so they break up into a million little \npieces and surgery is not necessary to remove them. It is a very \nimportant medical treatment now for people. It is nonintrusive, no \nsurgery, and has a great success rate.\n  These are very sophisticated pieces of equipment. They have some \nspecial switching components in them. It turns out that Iraq has found \nthat those switches are useful in their nuclear weapons program. This \nis a good example of a dual-use item. It was not invented for defense \npurposes. It has an item in it that can be used for weapons. We know \nthat. We don't want that item to be used for that purpose.\n  Saddam Hussein has ordered 50 of these. I don't think there is a need \nfor 50 lithotriptors in Iraq, frankly. We want to be careful about the \nexport of items that are available on the market. Any hospital can buy \na lithotriptor if they have enough money. They are available. By now I \nam sure there are more companies than just the one German company that \nmake them. These are items that can be acquired. They have dual-use \ncapabilities.\n  In the granting of an export license on this kind of product, you \nhave to be careful that it is not used for military purposes.\n  It may be that the example I used isn't technically correct in the \nway the bill would work, but I think I make my point.\n  The bill has a provision in it which says that if a company to which \nyou sell, let's say a company in China, uses this product improperly, \nor they don't let you inspect to see where they have used it to verify \nthat the shipment went to where it was supposed to go, then the \nSecretary shall cut that company off from further exports; they can't \nbuy anything else from the United States.\n  But since countries such as China have established a rather gray \nrelationship between the Government and businesses, there also needs to \nbe a way of making the same point with the Government of China or any \nother government.\n  I am not trying to pick on China. There happen to be some very \negregious examples of the Government of China right now not living up \nto agreements or post-shipment verification. We need to have some kind \nof enforcement mechanism in a country such as China as well. I proposed \nthat we have the same kind of provision and say if the Chinese \nGovernment won't permit a post-shipment verification, then the \nSecretary shall stop such exports until\n\n[[Page S9134]]\n\nthey begin to comply. Well, supporters of the bill said, ``That is too \ndrastic; why don't you say `may' so that the Secretary has total \ndiscretion?'' I was willing to do that. That would have been the \nsimplest way to solve the problem.\n  That is something I would like to offer in the spirit of cooperation \nwith my friend Phil Gramm, who said, ``Let's try to work a few of these \nthings out; since we know the bill will pass, you can make it \nmarginally better.'' So we sat down with him. Frankly, the language we \nare offering is not what I would have personally offered, but it is \nacceptable to him and it marginally makes the bill better. I will read \nit and offer it. It is simple. It says: If the country in which the end \nuser is located refuses to allow post-shipment verification of a \ncontrolled item, the Secretary may deny a license for the export of \nthat item, any substantially identical or directly competitive item or \nclass of items, any item that the Secretary determines to be of equal \nor greater sensitivity than the controlled item, or any controlled item \nfor which a determination has not been made pursuant to section 211 to \nall end users in that country until such post-shipment verification is \nallowed.\n  That latter reference to section 211 has to do with the item subject \nto foreign availability. It would have been simpler to say the \nSecretary may deny a license for any item on the list until post-\nshipment verification is allowed by the country in question. Total \ndiscretion of the Secretary would have been easier. We have created \njobs for lawyers now. I am not necessarily against that, but when we \nhave terms such as this in the statute, we are going to have litigation \non what it means. It would have been easier to do it the other way. But \nthis is the language I will offer. The Secretary, at least with respect \nto some items on the control list, can say to a country such as China, \nfor example: Until you are willing to allow post-shipment verification \nof items A and B, which you already have, then we are not going to \ngrant a license on items X, Y, and Z. They can pick what those items \nare if they so choose.\n  In closing, I will give examples of what would happen to illustrate \nthe need for this particular provision. In 1998, very recently, China \nagreed to allow post-shipment verification for all exports. They signed \nan agreement. But the Cox Commission issued its report and deemed the \nterms of the agreement wholly inadequate, from the U.S. point of view, \nto ensure that these verifications really occur.\n  The amendment I proposed is designed to try to fill a void the Cox \nCommission identified in the U.S.-China agreement. For example, the \nCommission's report discusses a number of weaknesses in the agreement \nas it relates to the export of high-performance computers. According to \nthe Bureau of Export Administration, out of 857 high performance \ncomputers that have been shipped to China, only 132 post-shipment \nverifications have been performed. Some of these have been outstanding \nfor a long time. First you get foot-dragging, and then you get a \n``no.'' On other occasions they say: If you allow us to do the post-\nshipment verification, that ought to suffice. But, of course, it does \nnot. These items would not necessarily be subject to the terms of this \nsection, although they might. I think it illustrates the nature of the \nproblem that exists if you don't have an enforcement mechanism. You \nhave to have the will to enforce.\n\n  I think there will be great questions as to whether or not the \nSecretary, in the exercise of his discretion, is going to be willing to \ndeny a license to an American company which, after all, hasn't done \nanything wrong and is simply trying to make a buck, in order to get \nChina to enforce the limitation. Let me respond to that point.\n  Any American company which understands that the item it is wanting to \nexport to a third-tier country, countries of concern here, has dual-use \ncapability has to exercise some responsibility. I think it has to take \nsome of the consequences of the person to whom it is exporting not \nbeing willing to guarantee that the item is going to be used for \nappropriate purposes.\n  So I don't think you can make the case that all we are doing here is \npotentially punishing American businesses that are totally innocent and \ntherefore we should not really be very forward-leaning in the \nenforcement of this section.\n  The fact is that any American business worth its salt should want to \nensure that the terms of the export license are being complied with. It \ndoesn't want to sell dual-use technology to a country that could use it \nagainst us militarily. It ought to be willing to ensure that the \nverification of the end user has in fact been established and enforced.\n  So it seems to me there is no argument that all we are doing here is \nhurting American businesses. Any American business would have the same \ninterest as the U.S. Government in ensuring that the end user is in \nfact who it is supposed to be, both from a national security standpoint \nand being able to make future exports.\n  There has even been an idea advanced, that I think has some merit, \nwhich would put all of the burden on American business. It would \nbasically privatize this enforcement and say the Government is going to \nget out of this business; it cost a lot of money, and we have trouble \ngetting in the door to verify these things. Private industry, in \neffect, has to certify that the item it sold abroad went to the user \nthat filled out on the form the certificate. And if the company isn't \nwilling to verify that, or isn't able to certify it under penalty of \nsome financial detriment here in the United States, then it is going to \nbecome much more careful about to whom those items are sold and how the \npost-shipment verification is actually implemented.\n  So my suggestion to American businesses is, if you really want to \ncontinue to be able to export, then help us work out a system that \nensures that these items you are exporting, which have a dangerous \npotential use, get to the proper people and are not misused. If you are \nnot willing to help us do this and if you are going to argue against \nenforcement of a section such as this, then something worse could \nhappen. You could have the enforcement responsibility put on your \nshoulders. And if you are not able to certify that it went to the right \nplace, you are not going to be able to make exports in the future. \nEverybody should have an interest in making this work.\n  Let me close with a note about some testimony that verified the need \nfor this. David Tarbell, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \nTechnology Security Policy, testified in July at a hearing before the \nHouse International Relations Committee regarding the right to perform \npost-shipment verifications. He very diplomatically said:\n\n       The Chinese government has been unwilling to establish a \n     verification regime and end-use monitoring regime that would \n     get all of the security interests that we are interested in \n     to ensure that items that are shipped are not diverted.\n\n  Impressed further by Chairman Hyde about whether the post-shipment \nverification regime is a failure, Secretary Tarbell delicately said:\n\n       I am not sure I would characterize it as a complete \n     failure, but it is close to it. It is not something I have a \n     great deal of confidence in.\n\n  The point here is to create something that we do have confidence in, \nthat we know would work, that we can enforce and ensure the safety and \nsecurity of the United States in the future, knowing we have not \nallowed the wrong people to get the wrong things into their hands in a \nway that comes back against the United States in a military way.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment I have \noffered and which has the concurrence of Senators Gramm and Enzi and, I \nbelieve, the Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Again, we appreciate the participation in the 59 changes \nbefore and now this change. It shows the level of detail in which \nSenator Thompson and Senator Kyl have approached this bill. We \nappreciate this change. We are willing to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1529) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n\n[[Page S9135]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Maryland if we \nmay make a brief statement as to our understanding on the second letter \nwe have discussed. That will complete our business, I believe.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, this has to do with commodity \nclassification. We have had some concern that when people in the \nbusiness of exporting items come into the Department of Commerce and \nthey get a different classification for a commodity--in other words, \nsomething might be subject to license and they believe it should not be \nsubject to license anymore--they can come in and get that \nconsideration. That is appropriate. That needs to be done, but it needs \nto be done in a manner which protects the Government and the country's \ninterest from a national security standpoint.\n\n  The executive branch has traditionally dealt with this issue through \ninteragency agreements. We think they need to be updated. The existing \nagreement is 5 years old and needs to be updated to create an increased \nrole for the Departments of Defense and State.\n  Both the opponents and supporters of this legislation will send a \nletter to the administration requesting the issuance of a new Executive \norder on commodity classification to ensure the participation of the \nNational Security Agency. We believe that with regard to many of these \nissues, as the administration is trying to staff up and with our \ndiscussions with them and among each other, we have realized just how \noutdated the existing agreement is. We are going to send a letter to \nthem to bring this to their attention further, and suggest they issue \nan Executive order.\n  We assume this will be done in an appropriate manner, and we will not \nhave to take additional action. That option, of course, is always \nthere. Pending that, we think this is an appropriate way to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee again \nfor his emphasis. It is important that there be updates on the \ndifferent procedures, particularly the ones that are done through memos \nof understanding between the agencies.\n  We appreciate the willingness of the Senator from Tennessee to allow \nthat to continue to be done that way so there is more flexibility to \nreact to current crises under that kind of ability. We have prepared a \nletter to that effect, and we will be sending it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, one final note. We have had some \ndiscussion in this Chamber concerning the possibility of an amendment \nthat would create a so-called blue ribbon commission to address \nadditional concerns as to how our export policies might be affecting \nnational security. I believe it is fair to say, not having heard from \nmy other colleagues on this issue, that we have not been able to reach \nagreement with regard to that.\n  Without a doubt, we will continue to work together among ourselves to \ntry to agree on the composition of such a commission. I think we all \nagree the concept is a good idea, and that we ought to take a long \nimpassioned look at what we are doing. We will continue to work on \nthat, but for right now I believe we can take that off the table.\n  That concludes our comments on the bill in terms of these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee for his very positive and constructive contributions \nthroughout.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1530\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I send a managers' amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes], for himself, Mr. \n     Gramm, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Johnson, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1530.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Flight \n     safety requirements are defined as airworthiness directives \n     issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or \n     equipment manufacturers' maintenance instructions or \n     bulletins approved or accepted by the FAA for the continued \n     airworthiness of the manufacturers' products.\n       On page 325, line 6, strike ``(k)'' and insert ``(l)''.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, the managers' amendment consists of \nprovisions intended to clarify, correct, and improve the bill.\n  Section 211: This provision amends the term ``interested party'' in \nSection 211 (foreign availability and mass market status) to ensure its \nconsistency with terms used in the rest of the bill. Sections 205, 302, \nand 307 all refer to ``interested person(s)''. The managers' amendment \ncorrects the references in Section 211 by replacing ``interested \nparty'' with ``interested person''.\n  Sections 214 and 701: This provision clarifies the duties of the \nOffice of Technology Evaluation. Section 214 of the bill establishes an \nOffice of Technology Evaluation to analyze information and provide \nassessments for use in export control policy. The managers' amendment \nclarifies that when assessing the effect of foreign competition on \ncritical US industrial sectors, the Office is to consider imports of \nmanufactured goods. It also modifies Section 701 (annual report) to \nensure that the Commerce Department's annual report to Congress \nincludes a description of such assessments. The managers worked closely \nwith Senator Hollings to include this provision.\n  Section 311: The next provision modifies Section 311 (crime control \ninstruments). Section 311 preserves authority contained in existing law \n(Section 6(n) of the Export Administration Act of 1979) to ensure that \ncrime control and detection instruments and equipment may be exported \nonly subject to an export license. The managers' amendment further \nprovides that any item or technology that the Secretary of Commerce \ndetermines is a specially designed instrument of torture or is \nespecially susceptible to abuse as an instrument of torture can be \nexported only pursuant to an individual export license. In addition, \nthe Annual Report of the Bureau of Export Administration must describe \nthe aggregate number of licenses approved during the preceding calendar \nyear for the export of any such items by country and control list \nnumber. This provision was included in the Managers Amendment at the \nrequest of Senators Leahy and Biden.\n  Section 401: The next provision makes a technical correction to \nSection 401 (export license procedures). Section 401 requires Commerce \nto take four actions--hold incomplete applications, refer applications \nto other agencies, confirm commodity classification, and return \napplication--at the beginning of the license review process. As \ndrafted, however, some of these actions are mutually incompatible (for \nexample, Commerce cannot hold an incomplete application while \nsimultaneously referring the application to another agency). The \nmanagers' amendment revises the language to correct this inadvertent \nincompatibility.\n  Section 506: This provision amends the term ``interested parties'' in \nSection 506 (enforcement) to ensure its consistency with terms used in \nthe rest of the bill. Sections 205, 302, and 307 all refer to \n``interested person(s)''. The managers' amendment corrects the \nreferences in Section 506 by replacing ``interested parties'' with \n``interested person''.\n  Section 506: The next provision makes technical amendments to Section \n506. Sections 506(h), (i), (l), and (o) all contain funding \nauthorizations for personnel or activities of the Bureau of Export \nAdministration. The managers' amendment clarifies that the funding is \nto remain available until expended.\n  Section 602: This provision clarifies a provision in Section 602 \n(confidentiality of information). Section 602 outlines the treatment of \nconfidential information obtained after 1980. The managers' amendment \nclarifies that the provision applies to not only to information \nobtained through license applications, but to information obtained \nthrough enforcement activity or other EAA operations.\n  Section 602: This provision further clarifies Section 602 \n(confidentiality of information). Section 602 provides that information \nobtained through licenses, classification requests, investigations, \ntreaty, or the foreign availability/mass-market process shall be kept \nconfidential unless its release is in the national interest. It goes on \nto provide penalties against those who violate this prohibition. The \nmanagers' amendment makes three changes: it (1) clarifies the \ninvestigations referred to are those carried out by Department of \nCommerce officials; (2) ensures that penalties on violators are imposed \nwith the agreement of the violators' employing agency; and (3) allows \nviolators to be denied further access to confidential information and \nto be removed from office.\n  Section 603: The next provision adds a technical provision relating \nto the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 \n(TSRA). TSRA established restrictions on sanctions dealing with \nagricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices. The managers' \namendment adds a new Section 603 that is intended to hold TSRA harmless \nby (1) ensuring that no authority in this Act may be exercised contrary \nto TSRA; (2) clarifying the limitations on national security controls; \nand (3) clarifying the application of TSRA procedures to foreign policy \ncontrols. Senators Roberts and Dayton were instrumental in crafting \nthis language, and worked with bill managers to perfect the text.\n  Section 702: This provision corrects a technical reference in Section \n702 (technical and conforming amendments). As drafted, the reference \nwould have affected the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage \nRelief Act of 1990. The managers' amendment removes the reference and \nthus any inadvertent impact on the Forest Resources Act.\n  Section 702: The next provision corrects a drafting error in Section \n702 (technical and conforming amendments). Section 702(j) preserves \nauthority contained in existing law (Section 17(c) of the Export \nAdministration Act of 1979) to ensure that standard civil aircraft \nproducts remain subject to the EAA. As drafted, Section 702(j) \ninadvertently departed from current law by breaking the original \nparagraph into subparagraphs. Because this structure could cause \nconfusion in interpretation, the managers' amendment returns the text \nto its original structure.\n  Section 702: This provision addresses a humanitarian issue. U.S. \naircraft manufacturers cannot export critical aircraft safety parts to \ncountries subject to U.S. embargo. Without those parts, the planes may \ncrash, with terrible humanitarian implications. A presidential waiver \nto export such parts is available, but is rarely invoked and takes \nyears. The managers' amendment provides that exports of civil aircraft \nequipment to comply with flight safety requirements for commercial \npassenger aircraft may be authorized on a case-by-case basis. Senators \nDodd, Bond, Murray, and Roberts expressed particular interest in \naddressing this problem.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, the managers' amendment to S. 149 adds a \nnew provision to address a pressing humanitarian issue: flight safety.\n\n[[Page S9137]]\n\n  U.S. aircraft manufacturers have sold commercial passenger aircraft \ninternationally since the 1950s. Moreover, some European-made \ncommercial aircraft are made with U.S. components. As a result, U.S. \naircraft are used widely around the world.\n  The safe operation of these aircraft depends on the replacement of \nworn parts, repair of unsafe components, and receipt of technical \nbulletins and airworthiness directives. These parts, services, and \ninformation are highly specialized, and often are available only from \nthe original manufacturer.\n  Over the years, several nations that operate U.S.-made aircraft, or \nEuropean-made aircraft that incorporate U.S. parts, have become subject \nto U.S. embargo. As a result, U.S.-made aircraft items cannot be \nexported to those countries. This poses a significant threat to the \nsafe operation of those airplanes. Without replacement parts, repair, \nand technical information, the planes literally may fall out of the \nsky, with terrible humanitarian implications for passengers and those \non the ground. We all remember with horror the terrible 1992 crash, \nresulting from a failed part, of an El-Al plane into an Amsterdam \napartment complex. All 4 crew and an estimated 70 Amsterdam residents \nwere killed. The risks are real for U.S. citizens traveling to \nembargoed countries, or making up part of United Nations delegations. \nCitizens of U.S. allies are at risk. And not least of all, innocent \ncitizens of embargoed countries are particularly vulnerable.\n  Under current law, the administration has some flexibility to allow \nflight safety exports to nations such as Sudan and Syria. However, \nexports to Iran or Iraq require a presidential waiver--a process that \ntakes years and is rarely invoked. The difficulty of obtaining such a \nwaiver has meant that U.S. manufacturers cannot provide critical flight \nsafety parts or information to those nations.\n  The managers' amendment addresses this humanitarian issue while \nretaining the integrity of the embargo. It provides that aircraft \nequipment exports to comply with safety requirements for commercial \npassenger aircraft may be authorized on a case-by-case basis. It is \ntightly circumscribed: it applies only to parts for civil aircraft used \nfor commercial passengers, and it requires a case-by-case analysis.\n  Senators Dodd, Bond, Murray, and Roberts are keenly interested in \nthis provision and should be commended for addressing this critical \nhumanitarian problem.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, this managers' amendment has been \ncarefully worked over. I do not think there is any matter of \ncontroversy in it. I am prepared to go to adoption of the managers' \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 1530.\n  The amendment (No. 1530) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, we are prepared to go to third reading \nof the bill, and then there are going to be some comments. If we can go \nto third reading of the bill.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I simply want to make a closing statement \non this important bill. I begin by thanking the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Sarbanes, for his leadership, and Senator Johnson \nfor the work, they have done on the bill. I especially want to thank \nSenator Enzi for his indispensable leadership on this bill; it is no \nunderstatement to say that we would not be here today were it not for \nSenator Enzi's leadership on this bill for the past two years.\n  I have had the privilege of serving in the Senate now going into my \n18th year, and I have never seen a Senator do the things Senator Enzi \nhas done on this bill--in terms of being willing to meet the various \nagencies involved in export administration, sitting for endless hours \nand watching how the process works, and doing something we seldom do in \nthis line of work: learn how the process works practically. We are \noften not willing to spend the time or get our hands dirty. The quality \nof the bill before us is due in very large part to Senator Enzi, and I \nwant to publicly and personally thank him for his leadership. It sets a \nnew standard for what a Senator ought to be in terms of hard work \nbehind the scenes, getting the facts, understanding the mechanism. We \nlike to deal with theory and leave the practical matters up to somebody \nelse. That is not the way Senator Enzi does business.\n  I thank our two colleagues, Senator Thompson and Senator Kyl. Maybe \npeople listening to this debate wonder why I would thank them, given \nthat we have some fundamental disagreements, but good law is made by \nbasically trying to accommodate people who do not agree with you while \nmaintaining your principles. I think, quite frankly, they have improved \nthe bill.\n  Counting the two changes that Senator Sarbanes, Senator Enzi and I \nagreed to this morning, we have made 61 changes in this bill in trying \nto build a consensus. I believe the product we have produced is a \nquality product, it will stand the test of time, and it will work.\n  The points I want to make are: In listening to some of the critics, \none may have gotten the idea that somehow this bill lessens our \ncommitment to national security. We have an apparent conflict in \nAmerica between our desire to produce and sell items that embody high \ntechnology, and we want to produce and sell them because the country \nthat develops new technology creates new jobs and creates the best \njobs.\n  So, while we want to be the world leader in that technology, we have \na conflicting goal in wanting to prevent would-be adversaries and \ndangerous people from getting technology that can be used to harm us or \nto harm our interests. That is what this bill is about.\n  Today, 99.4 percent of the applications for a license are granted. \nWhen a process is saying ``yes'' 99.4 percent of the time, it is a \nnonsense process.\n  We have about 10 times as many items on this controlled list as we \nshould have. We need to build a higher fence around a smaller number of \nitems, and when people knowingly violate the law and transfer this \ntechnology we ought to come down on them like a ton of bricks.\n  Under this bill, the penalties can run into the tens of millions of \ndollars and people can end up going to prison for life. Those are \npretty stiff sentences.\n  We have put together an excellent bill. It represents a compromise \nbetween two competing national goals. It is legislation at its best. \nMany times we claim bipartisanship on bills when they really are not \ntotally bipartisan. This bill is about as bipartisan as anything we \nhave ever done on the Banking Committee since I have been in the \nSenate, and I think it represents good law.\n  It is supported by the President. We have some 80 Members of the \nSenate who have voted basically to maintain the position. I am very \nproud of it, and I commend it to my colleagues. This is a good bill we \ncan be proud of.\n  I am ready to vote, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are now in agreement on the unanimous \nconsent request I will now propound.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a vote on final passage of S. 149 occur \nat 4:00 p.m. today, with rule 12, paragraph 4 being waived; that no \nsubstitute amendments be in order; that the committee substitute \namendment be agreed to; the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that the time until 4:00 be divided between the majority and \nminority for morning business, with the exception of 8 minutes prior to \nthe 4:00 p.m. vote, which would allow Senators Enzi, Gramm, Sarbanes, \nand Thompson each to have 2 minutes prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator would withhold, our able staff indicated I \nmisread\n\n[[Page S9138]]\n\nthis. It is right before my eyes, so if I could just repeat this.\n  The vote will occur at 4:00 p.m. today, with rule 12, paragraph 4 \nbeing waived; that no other amendments be in order; that the committee \nsubstitute amendment be agreed to; the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; the time until 4:00 p.m. be divided between the \nmajority and minority for morning business, with the final 8 minutes \nprior to 4:00 p.m. being allotted to Senators Enzi, Gramm, Sarbanes, \nand Thompson each allowed to speak 2 minutes prior to the vote on the \nbill.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I do \nbelieve it would be appropriate to divide the final few minutes equally \nbetween the proponents and the opponents.\n  Mr. REID. That would be very fine. So what we say is 4 minutes for \nthe opposition and 4 minutes for those propounding passage of the \nlegislation be divided equally.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Further, I want to take a few minutes right now in \nmorning business or as a part of this UC, either one.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend that will be certainly appropriate. We \nwill get this unanimous consent request agreed to and the Senator can \nhave lots of time. Senator Torricelli wants 15 minutes, but we will be \nglad to wait until the Senator from Tennessee has completed his \nstatement.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That is satisfactory to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request as modified? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The committee substitute, as amended, is \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Export \nAdministration Act of 2001 and urge its passage.\n  Congress has not reauthorized the Export Administration Act on a \npermanent basis since 1990, and for close to a decade the export of \ndual-use goods--items with both civilian and possible military \napplications--have been governed in an ad hoc way by the President \nusing Executive orders under the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act and without a comprehensive regime in place to monitor \nexports.\n  Such an approach creates obvious problems in trying to assure that \nthe proper balance is struck between the need of U.S. businesses to be \ncompetitive in the international economy and the need to prevent \nsensitive technologies that have military applications from falling \ninto the wrong hands.\n  The Export Administration Act will allow the U.S. government to \neffectively focus attention and exert control over sensitive \ntechnologies that have military implications, improve the export \ncontrol process, and enhance national security.\n  The major provisions of the Export Administration Act of 2001 will:\n  Give the President the power to establish and conduct export control \npolicy, and direct the Secretary of Commerce to establish and maintain \nthe Commerce Control List of items that could jeopardize U.S. national \nsecurity and to oversee the licensing process for items on the Control \nlist.\n  Authorize the President to impose national security controls to \nrestrict items that would contribute to the military potential of \ncountries in a manner detrimental to U.S. national security, directing \nthe Secretary of Commerce, with the concurrence of the national \nsecurity agencies and departments, to identify items to be included on \na National Security Control List. This strengthens the hand of the \nnational security agencies in the export licensing process by giving \nthem for the first time a formal procedure by which to be involved in \nthis process.\n  Provide specific control authority based on the end-use or end-user \nfor any item that could contribute to the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  Authorize the President to set aside ``foreign availability'' or \n``mass-market'' determinations in the interests of national security, \nand establish an Office of Technology Evaluation to gather, coordinate \nand analyze information necessary to make to these determinations.\n  Establish procedures for the referral and processing of export \nlicense applications, and establish an interagency dispute resolution \nprocess to review all export license applications that are the subject \nof disagreement.\n  Declare it U.S. policy to seek and participate in existing \nmultilateral export control regimes that support U.S. national security \ninterests, and to seek to negotiate and enter into additional \nmultilateral agreements. Given the wide availability of some of these \ndual-use items, multilateral agreements are critical to assure that \nthey do not fall into the wrong hands.\n  Establish new criminal and civil penalties for knowing and willful \nviolations of the export procedures.\n  By streamlining and bringing transparency to the licensing process \nthis legislation, then, strikes a good balance between assuring that \nthe export licensing process is good for trade, the U.S. economy, and \njobs, and national security concerns.\n  This legislation is supported by the President and has been endorsed \nby the Secretary of Defense, by the Secretary of State, and by the \nPresident's National Security Adviser. It also has the support, I \nbelieve, of the majority of my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to move forward with passage of the \nExport Administration Act.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. \n149, the Export Administration Act of 2001. From my perspective, \nconsideration of this legislation is long overdue. Congress has \nextended the Export Administration Act on a temporary basis since 1984, \nand in doing so has completely ignored the extraordinary changes in \ntechnology that have occurred in that timeframe. Current export control \npolicy, formulated during the Cold War several decades ago, no longer \nfits either the current global context or our specific national \nsecurity needs. It is time to bring U.S. law into conformity with \ninternational reality.\n  Over the past year I have been involved in two high-level advisory \npanels that have carefully examined the existing U.S. export control \nregime. The first was a study group focusing on Enhancing Multilateral \nExport Controls for U.S. National Security, and was sponsored by the \nHenry L. Stimson Center and the Center for Strategic for International \nStudies. The second consisted of two study groups, one on Technology \nand Security in the 21st Century and one Computer Exports and National \nSecurity, sponsored entirely by the Center for Strategic for \nInternational Studies. Each of these groups concluded that existing \nexport control policy and procedures are outdated, unsound, \nineffective, unrealistic, and counterproductive. Taken as a whole, they \nimpede coordination between the U.S. government agencies responsible \nfor export control policy, they hinder our efforts to cooperate with \nour most important allies, they ignore the new threats and \nopportunities in the international system, they expend significant \nhuman and financial resources insulating easily available technologies, \nthey limit the ability of our best companies to innovate and compete \nand, in the final analysis, they harm our military and commercial \nnational security interests.\n  The studies I have mentioned offered a range of extremely important \npolicy recommendations, but fundamental to them are three important \noverarching conclusions, all of which are relevant to the debate at \nhand.\n  The first conclusion is that globalization has resulted in what the \nDefense Science Board has previously called a ``leveling'' of access to \ntechnology and the capacity of the United States to obtain and control \ntechnologies critical to its national interest. This concept suggests \nthat access to commercial technology is now universal, and its use for \nboth commercial and military ends is largely unconstrained. Enabling \ntechnologies necessary for modern warfare, examples being \nsemiconductors, computer hardware and software, simulation and \nsurveillance devices, advanced telecommunications, and so on, are \navailable to nearly any country that wishes to access them, ally and \nadversary alike. The result of these changes is an export control \nregime that is, to quote the Defense Science Board, ``for all practical \npurposes ineffective at manipulating global access to dual-use \ntechnology and . . . only marginally more successful in the \nconventional\n\n[[Page S9139]]\n\nweapons arena.'' This is the context within which we debate export \ncontrol reform today, and these are the changes that the proposed \nlegislation is trying to address.\n  The second overarching conclusion is that is that we need to put \nhigher fences around much smaller, but more critical, sets of \ntechnologies. Because access to advanced technology and technical \ncapabilities have spread so widely and because research and development \nis now global in nature, it is time that we focus our efforts at export \ncontrol on limited technologies that directly affect our national \nsecurity. In particular, we should concentrate on protecting and \ndeveloping the software and databases that sustain and strengthen our \nmilitary superiority. The primary objective in the current export \ncontrol regime is to prevent potential adversaries from obtaining \ntechnological components that would allow them to develop weapons \nsystems and manage warfare in a more effective fashion. Unfortunately, \nthis objective is still considered rational, this in spite of the \nradical changes that have occurred in the international political \neconomic environment. Commercial computers that can be obtained online \nor through retail outlets can now perform the vast majority of \nbattlefield applications. As a result, a coherent and compelling \nargument can be made that we need to concentrate on controlling the \ntechnologies that will allow advanced components to be integrated into \neffective systems. This should be one of our primary considerations as \nwe reconsider export control, and this is one of the goals the proposed \nlegislation is trying to achieve.\n  The final overarching conclusion is that it is time that we begin \ncreating a new international framework that will allow more effective \nexport control between the United States and its allies. Changes in \nadvanced technology and the global environment has undercut or weakened \nexisting agreements, and we must begin creating a foundation upon which \nnew cooperative mechanisms can be established. In the recent past, much \nof this required change has been blocked by the United States, the \nprimary reason being that its export control system was based on \nmeasures, computer MTOPS being the most salient example, that are no \nlonger relevant in the current international environment and are not \nadhered to by our allies. Regulatory reform in the United States must \noccur before new international frameworks can be established, and this \nis one of the goals the proposed legislation is trying to address.\n  There are those among my colleagues who would argue that even if the \ninternational system has changed to this extent, even if globalization \nhas changed the international equation, the United States has a moral \nobligation to limit access to certain key technologies for a specific \ngroup of countries. The example used most frequently on the Senate \nfloor is China, but certainly other countries could be inserted in its \nplace.\n  Let me state here that I would not disagree that certain countries \nshould be singled out as potential threats to the United States and \ntechnology limited to the extent that it is feasible to do so. But the \nproposed legislation accomplishes this objective. The arguments on the \nSenate floor that the proposed legislation somehow diminishes our \ncapacity to control sensitive and critical technologies is specious at \nbest. On the contrary, many levels of restrictions remain in place to \nprotect U.S. national security interests. What the proposed legislation \ndoes do is provide the U.S. government with the flexibility and focus \nto address concerns over advanced technology and adapt to changes in \nthe current international environment.\n  It is time that we change our anachronistic system of export control. \nThis legislation reflects several years of hard work on the part of my \ncolleagues, and I believe it represents a balanced and strategic \napproach to the problems at hand. The legislation was voted out of the \nBanking Committee by a 19-1 vote. As the statements on the floor will \nattest, the legislation has the bi-partisan support of most of the \nMembers of the Senate. President Bush supports it, as does all the \nrelevant officials in his Administration. President Clinton supported \nit, as did all the relevant officials in his Administration. It is \nsupported by a broad range of organizations, many of which are led by \nkey officials from previous Democratic and Republican Administrations.\n  However, with that said, I find it disappointing that the legislation \nhas not addressed the important issue of U.S. commercial satellites and \nspace-related component exports. The Defense Authorization Act for FY \n1999 moved responsibility for export licensing of these items from the \nDepartment of Commerce to the Department of State. By doing so, \ncommunications satellite and space-related items were placed on the \nU.S. Munitions List, effecting a crippling blow to the U.S. aerospace \nindustry. It makes timely deliveries to overseas customers and our \nallies nearly impossible, and excludes commercial satellite sales from \ncompetitive rate financing offered by the Export-Import Bank. While our \nU.S. companies may find themselves hard-pressed to find institutions to \nprovide reasonable financing for foreign customers, their competitors \nmay not. Last year, the Aerospace Industries Association claimed \nsatellite exports had fallen over 40 percent in the period from late \n1999 to early 2000, and the forecast was for the trend to get \ncontinually worse. I certainly hope this issue is addressed in the \nupcoming conference.\n  We have examined the issue of export control many times over. It is \ntime to recognize the importance of export control reform to the \nnational interest of the United States and pass this legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to express my support for S. 149, \nthe Export Administration Act of 2001. I want to commend Senators \nSarbanes, Gramm, Johnson, and Enzi for crafting a balanced, bipartisan \nbill that brings long-overdue clarity to the regulation of dual-use \nexports. This bill removes several unnecessary restrictions on exports \nthat only hinder international trade, puts in place a system to track \nand license those technologies that have the potential to impact \nnational security, and establishes realistic penalties and sanctions \nfor violations of these regulations.\n  I am pleased that the managers of the bill have accepted the \namendment that Senator Biden and I proposed that will place controls on \nthe export of items that are used to perpetrate acts of torture. The \n``torture trade'' is a critical problem that has received too little \nattention from policymakers, the public, and the press. Too often, \ncompanies have exported items, apparently designed for security or \ncrime control purposes, that are actually used to torture people by \nsome of the most inhumane methods imaginable. Amnesty International \nreports that, over the past decade, more than 80 U.S. companies have \nbeen involved in the manufacture, marketing, and export of these types \nof items, like thumbscrews and electro-shock stun belts, which have \nbeen used to commit human rights abuses around the world.\n  The Leahy-Biden amendment is a modest step to improve the \ntransparency, oversight, and accountability associated with the trade \nin these items. It builds on existing regulations and requires a \nlicense, subject to the approval of the Secretary of Commerce and the \nconcurrence of the Secretary of State, before such items can be \nexported. It also contains an annual reporting requirement to disclose \nthe aggregate number of licenses to export these items that were \ngranted during the previous year.\n  This amendment is designed to make sure that certain goods and \ntechnologies are not used to commit acts of torture and other human \nrights abuses. While our amendment moves us in the right direction, I \nrecognize that more can and should be done. Representatives Hyde and \nLantos have included an amendment in their version of the bill which \ncontains additional protections that could be very helpful in \ncurtailing the torture trade. I strongly urge the conferees to take a \nserious look at the Hyde-Lantos amendment when determining the final \noutcome of the Export Administration Act.\n  Finally, I believe that the Administration should work with other \nnations to develop strict standards of export controls for these items. \nI understand that the European Union is in the process of doing this, \nand our government should encourage and support that effort.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will oppose the pending legislation to \nreauthorize the Export Administration Act.\n\n[[Page S9140]]\n\nI agree with the bill's proponents and with the Administration that we \nshould have a statutory export control process. I am concerned, \nhowever, that the process provided for in this legislation is far too \nrelaxed and could be harmful to our national security--the very \nsecurity that the EAA is supposed to protect.\n  I commend the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, and the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. Kyl, for their leadership on this important issue.\n  It is troubling that the debate on this important piece of national \nsecurity legislation has revolved around what is good for American \nbusiness rather than on what is necessary to protect the national \nsecurity interests of this country.\n  As a number of our colleagues have said during this debate, the \npurpose of the EAA is not to promote U.S. exports. The purpose of the \nEAA is to protect the national security of the United States, which may \nmean barring certain types of sensitive technology from being exported. \nI fear that this bill tips the scale dangerously in favor of expanded \ncommerce at the expense of our national security.\n  I disagree with the argument put forth by some during this debate \nthat the foreign availability and mass market provisions included in \nthis bill are key to ensuring that American companies can compete in \nthe foreign market. Just because other countries choose to make a dual-\nuse product available to international buyers does not mean the United \nStates should as well. We should do everything we can to stem the flow \nof potentially dangerous dual-use technology around the world. We \nshould not use the questionable export decisions of other countries to \njustify selling products that could be used to harm our country.\n  There is nothing wrong with having a deliberative process for \nconsidering applications to export dual-use technologies. I disagree \nwith the contention that so many in the affected industries have \nadvanced--that the licensing process puts them at a disadvantage \nbecause they have to wait for the licensing process to be completed \nbefore they can export the technology. This is not a race. And the \nobject of the EAA is not to unduly delay the approval of export \nlicenses. We should consider carefully each license application. I fear \nthat this bill, and in particular its provisions regarding mass market \nand foreign availability determinations and the export of high \nperformance computers, will have the practical effect of rendering our \nexport control process meaningless.\n  Supporters of this bill argue that American businesses need the \nrelaxed controls included in this bill in order to compete in the \ninternational marketplace. That is not the case. The vast majority of \nexport license applications submitted to the Department of Commerce are \napproved. The purpose is to ensure that sensitive technology does not \nfall into the wrong hands.\n  Other countries look to the United States for guidance on such issues \nas export controls and non-proliferation efforts. If we relax controls \non dual-use items because other countries are selling them, we are \nfollowing, not leading. Just last week, the United States imposed \nsanctions on a Chinese company that transferred missile technology to \nPakistan. The administration reportedly has told the Chinese Government \nthat one of the conditions to having these sanctions lifted is for the \nChinese to develop a system of export controls to regulate the transfer \nof sensitive technology. It is curious that the Senate is debating \nrelaxing U.S. control of dual-use technology--a move the administration \nsupports--at the same time the administration is calling on the Chinese \nGovernment to implement export controls.\n  I think we have to examine closely all sides of this issue, and again \nI want to thank Senator Kyl and Senator thompson for the outstanding \nwork they have done to bring concerns about this legislation to the \nfore.\n  The fact is that there is a great deal of pressure from the super \ncomputer industry to pass this legislation. I don't say that to impugn \nthe motives of any Member who supports this bill, because we are having \nan honest debate here about different points of view. But I do think \nit's important for the American people to understand who some of the \nstrong supporters of this legislation are, so I would like to take a \nmoment to Call the Bankroll on this issue.\n  The computer industry has a huge stake in the passage of EAA. They \nwant a relaxation of the export controls on supercomputers, and they \nare lobbying hard for their cause. And, as is usually the case, \nlobbying means donating big money, and that means donating soft money \nto the party committees. In this case, the computer industry gave $20.5 \nmillion in soft money during the 2000 election cycle. The industry \nranked seventh in overall donations in the last cycle, a meteoric rise \nfor an industry that ranked 55th in donations a decade earlier. This is \nclearly an industry that has learned how to play the soft money game, \nand play it well.\n  I'll just name three soft money donors in the industry who are \npushing for passage of EAA:\n  Unisys Corporation and its executives gave more than $142,000 in soft \nmoney in the 2000 election cycle;\n  Sun Microsystems gave more than $24,000 in soft money during the last \ncycle; and\n  United Technologies and its subsidiaries gave a whopping $338,300 in \nsoft money in the 2000 election cycle.\n  As I said, this is in no way a comprehensive list, since the industry \ngave more than $20 million in soft money during the last cycle. But I \npoint out these donations now because they are relevant to this \ndebate--and relevant to the way many Americans view this debate, and so \nmany others like it here on the Senate floor.\n  When wealthy interests are allowed to give an unlimited amount of \nmoney to a political party, it makes the American people question us \nand the work we do. And I can think of few issues where the public \nmight be more disturbed by the potential influence of soft money than \nan issue like this one, where national and international security are \nat stake. Whether or not soft money clouds our own judgment, it clouds \nthe public's judgement of each and every one of us.\n  I want to reiterate my opposition to this legislation. We can and \nshould do more to protect the national security interests of the United \nStates.\n  I will vote against this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it has been 16 years since the United \nStates Congress last enacted re-authorizing legislation governing our \ncontrols on the export of dual-use technology, those items suited for \nboth civilian and military uses. For much of the past 7 years, the \nPresident has been forced to exercise emergency powers to maintain \ndual-use export controls following the expiration of the 1979 Export \nAdministration Act. This temporary exercise of authority has limited \nthe penalties the Federal Government can enforce on export control \nviolators and has opened up existing export controls to a series of \nlegal challenges.\n  It is high time, therefore, that the Senate act on S. 149, a bill to \nre-authorize the Export Administration Act. I look forward to the \npassage of this bill and the creation of a modern system of export \ncontrols.\n  We owe this to U.S. companies, which deserve a rational and \npredictable framework of export controls. We owe this to our friends \nand allies, who look to the U.S. export control system as a model in \ndevising their own systems. And, most importantly, we owe this to our \nnational security, we cannot rely forever on an ad hoc system that \nmetes out insufficient penalties and is based on shaky legal ground.\n  Export controls exist, first and foremost, for reasons of national \nsecurity. The United States must not export items when the item or the \nend-user may contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, strengthen the military capabilities of those who would \noppose us, or otherwise endanger U.S. national security. A \ncomprehensive export control system is just as important to preserving \nAmerica's freedom and security as a strong military.\n  But export controls also exist to facilitate the free trade of goods \nand services, an essential building block of our international economy. \nThe future growth of our economy and a leading global role for U.S. \nindustry require a vital export market.\n  I think all of us can agree that national security considerations \nmust always come first in devising export controls. We can all agree \nthat such controls should not be so arbitrary as to\n\n[[Page S9141]]\n\nstifle legitimate trade. We may differ, however, on where we draw the \nline in balancing these two opposing considerations.\n  Export controls can also serve another purpose. They can help \nreaffirm America's global leadership on human rights. Let me take this \nopportunity to commend Senators Sarbanes and Enzi for accepting an \namendment proposed by Senator Leahy and me in this regard. The \nmanagers' amendment to S. 149 will tighten the controls on the export \nof items expressly designed for torture or especially susceptible to \nuse in torture.\n  We are talking about items such as stun guns and shock batons, leg \ncuffs and restraint chairs. Yes, some of these items can have \nlegitimate law enforcement uses and are in fact employed in a manner \nthat does not abuse human rights. That is why this amendment would \ncontinue to allow their export, but make them subject to the licensing \nprocess and require the specific concurrence of the State Department as \nwell as the approval of the Commerce Department.\n  The items covered by this amendment are devices that governments \naround the world too often use in suppressing political dissidents and \nethnic opposition. This amendment requires the U.S. government to \nlicense each and every export of such items. It will help ensure that \nthe United States does not indirectly contribute to the torture of \nindividuals by engaging in the unlicensed trade of items used for \ntorture. It is my hope that the Commerce and State Departments, working \ntogether, will see to it that licensed exports of these items are \npermitted only to those countries whose governments carry unblemished \nhuman rights records.\n  I once again thank Senators Sarbanes and Enzi for accepting this \namendment, and especially Senator Leahy, who is once again a champion \nof human rights and with whom I am always delighted to work.\n  During this debate, a group of Senators, led by my good friends \nSenator Thompson and Senator Kyl, has led an intense effort against S. \n149. They argue that this bill fundamentally favors commercial equities \nover our national security interests. They are skeptical that the \nCommerce Department, which is responsible for cultivating U.S. business \ninterests around the world, can play an impartial role in weighing \nnational security considerations.\n  Truth be told, I have shared some of their concerns. That's why I am \npleased that the floor managers have reached a compromise with Senators \nThompson and Kyl. This compromise includes amendments to S. 149 to: 1. \nenhance the discretionary authority of the Commerce Department to deny \nexport licenses to another country when it is blocking legitimate post-\nshipment verifications of sensitive exports and 2. tighten the \ndefinition of foreign availability determinations which can exempt \nitems from export controls. These changes to S. 149 approved today \noffer real improvements to this bill.\n  I plan to vote for S. 149. On the whole, this bill takes the right \nsteps to bring our export controls for dual-use technologies into the \n21st century. Is it a perfect bill? No. The House International \nRelations Committee, in marking up this bill last month, approved \ndozens of amendments, on a bipartisan basis. I would hope, therefore, \nto see further improvement of this bill in conference.\n  But now is not the time for delay on S. 149. The Senate has a duty to \npass this legislation and to restore stability and predictability to \nour export control system for sensitive dual-use technologies.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue that is \ncritical to the national security of our Nation: the adequate control \nof the export of sensitive technologies. I have been active in this \ndebate for the past 2 years, together with Senators Helms, Shelby, \nMcCain, Thompson, and Kyl. We have worked with our colleagues on the \nBanking Committee, particularly Senators Gramm, Sarbanes, and Enzi, to \ncraft a bill that protects our Nation's security, while at the same \ntime allowing for appropriate commercial activity.\n  In April, I reluctantly objected to the motion to proceed to S.149, \nthe Export Administration Act. At that time, I thought it was premature \nfor the Senate to consider this bill until we had received detailed \ninformation from the Administration on this issue. I believe the Senate \nis now in a position to act on this important legislation.\n  I have tried for the past 2 years to work in a conscientious way with \nall parties to resolve the differences over this legislation. These \ndifferences have cut to the very essence of how the United States plans \nto protect its national security in an era of rapid globalization and \nproliferation of technology.\n  My goal in this debate has been to strike the proper balance between \nnational security and commercial interests. As we all know, the high \ntech industry in the United States is currently second to none. We must \nensure our domestic industry remains competitive without limiting \naccess to new markets. Considering the rate at which technology becomes \nobsolete, being the first to deliver a product to a market is crucial. \nAnd while we cannot completely abandon national security concerns in \nfavor of industry, we must not unnecessarily hinder the ability of our \nhigh tech companies to compete on the world stage. That is what I \nbelieve we have accomplished with this bill.\n  This is a complicated issue that cuts across the jurisdiction of six \nSenate Committees. Five Committee Chairmen with responsibility for \nnational security matters in the U.S. Senate have continuously worked \nto improve this bill--myself as chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Shelby of the Intelligence Committee, Senator \nThompson of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Helms of the \nForeign Relations Committee, and Senator McCain of the Commerce \nCommittee. In addition, Senator Kyl has been a leading participant in \nour discussions with the Banking Committee, the committee of primary \njurisdiction.\n  The higher penalties and increased enforcement authority, the \nauthority to require enhanced controls on items that need to be \ncontrolled for national security reasons, the requirement for the \nDepartment of Commerce to notify the Department of Defense of all \ncommodity classifications are examples of progress made on the national \nsecurity front.\n  I have great respect for the tireless efforts and dedication of my \ndistinguished Banking committee colleagues, Senator Gramm and Senator \nEnzi, in creating the EAA of 2001. I thank them for meeting with me and \nothers several times throughout the past two years to listen to our \nconcerns with balancing national security matters with economic \ninterests. I hope these concerns will remain a priority for all of us.\n  In this year's version of the EAA, the Banking Committee has included \nadditional national security protections at the urging of the \nadministration. As the debate on these issues has shown, there were \nconcerns about the last administration's record in protecting some of \nour vital technology. A new administration is able to look at old \nproblems with a fresh approach. It is in that context that the \nadministration reviewed this bill at the request of myself, Senators \nMcCain, Shelby, Thompson, Helms and Kyl. The National Security Advisor \nand three cabinet Secretaries were intimately involved in this review. \nAs a result, the administration proposed a series of legislative \nchanges that the Banking Committee has included in the bill that \nis before us.\n\n  Once these changes were made and the administration was actively \nengaged on the issue, the question then became a technical matter of \nhow the administration would implement the statute. When the Senators \nexpressing concerns regarding this bill were briefed on the results of \nthe administration's review, we were informed that an interagency \nagreement had been achieved on how the administration would enhance \nnational security controls during the course of implementing the EAA. \nUnder the administration's proposal, we were informed that some \nnational security protection that we had sought in the past would be \nincluded in the executive order that implements S. 149. Thus began a \ndialogue with the administration to come up with a better understanding \nof how this bill would be implemented.\n  My past concerns with earlier versions of EAA were based on concerns \nexpressed by the Department of\n\n[[Page S9142]]\n\nDefense. Last year, DOD provided the Senate Armed Services Committee \nwith specific legislative changes that were necessary in their \njudgement to fix last year's EAA bill. This included addressing issues \nrelated to a national security carve-out or enhanced controls, \ncommodity classifications, the enhanced proliferation control \ninitiative, and deemed exports.\n  The Bush administration shares the concerns of the previous \nadministration but has chosen to pursue some needed changes \nadministratively. In this regard, I ask unanimous consent that a copy \nof a letter I received from Secretary of Commerce Evans be made a part \nof the legislative record. This letter provides some insight into the \nadministration's interpretation of the bill language and commits the \nadministration to implementing, for example, a ``disciplined and \ntransparent process for escalating and deciding disputes'' on commodity \nclassifications.\n  I am satisfied with the response that the administration has given me \nthat they can work within the confines of this statute to protect \nnational security. I trust that this administration will be able to do \nso. The Congress will, however, need to provide diligent oversight to \nensure that this administration will conform to the high national \nsecurity standards that they have set for themselves. When the EAA \ncomes up for renewal in three years time, we may have to be more \nstringent in putting explicit national security protections in statute \nrather than leaving it to the discretion of the administration.\n  I want to thank my colleagues on the Intelligence, Foreign Relations, \nCommerce and Governmental Affairs Committees. These Members have worked \nover the last two years to improve this bill and ensure that our \nnational security interests are protected. I know the job isn't \nfinished yet. It has just begun and I will stand with my colleagues to \nensure that our export control process is designed and operated to \nensure that weapons of mass destruction do not get into the wrong \nhands.\n  It is time for the Congress to act on this bill. There is a need to \nreauthorize the EAA. The national security protections such as the \nnational security carve out, increased penalties for export control \nviolations, and greater visibility for the DOD over commodity \nclassifications are positive steps. We need to lock in these \nimprovements and work to ensure that nonproliferation concerns are \nprotected and strengthened and that vital technology is protected. And \nwe need to allow our domestic industry to compete in the world market \nwithout unnecessary and outmoded restrictions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Secretary of Commerce,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 2001.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: In light of our mutual interest in the \n     Export Administration Act of 2001 (S. 149), I would like to \n     address several issues related to S. 149 that I understand \n     were raised by your staff in a recent discussion with \n     Administration officials.\n       As you know, the Administration carefully reviewed S. 149. \n     As a result of that review, the Administration recommended a \n     number of amendments to the Senate Committee on Banking, \n     Housing and Urban Affairs which were incorporated into the \n     bill. Accordingly, the Administration strongly supports S. \n     149. We believe that the bill provides the proper framework \n     for regulating the export of sensitive items consistent with \n     our national security, foreign policy, and economic \n     interests. For your convenience, I have enclosed an analysis \n     that addresses in detail the issues raised by your staff.\n       I also understand that your staff asked about the \n     Department's response to a recent report by the General \n     Accounting Office (GAO) regarding controls on exports to \n     Canada of items that could contribute to missile \n     proliferation. The Department will shortly issue a proposed \n     rule amending the licensing requirements applicable to \n     exports to Canada. This new rule will address the issue \n     raised by the GAO.\n       I appreciate your continued interest in the Export \n     Administration Act of 2001. I look forward to working on the \n     passage of this bill to ensure that the protection of \n     national security is given the highest priority in the dual-\n     use export control system process.\n       If you have any further questions, please call me or Brenda \n     Becker, Assistant Secretary for Legislative and \n     Intergovernmental Affairs, at (202) 482-3663.\n           Warm regards,\n                                                  Donald L. Evans.\n       Enclosure.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Administration View on National Security Aspects of S. 149\n\n       The Administration supports S. 149 because it sustains the \n     President's broad authority to protect national security. S. \n     149 actually provides greater authority for the President to \n     control dual-use exports than current law, the Export \n     Administration Act of 1979 (EAA). S. 149 significantly raises \n     the penalties for export control violations and contains \n     other provisions that enhance the U.S. government's ability \n     to enforce the law effectively. Higher penalties and \n     increased enforcement authority will deter those who might \n     otherwise endanger U.S. national security through illicit \n     exports.\n\n\n       foreign availability/mass market and parts and components\n\n       The bill does give exporters the right to ask the \n     government to determine whether items are foreign or mass \n     market available. However, the bill also gives the President \n     several ways to continue controls on such items, if \n     necessary, for national security reasons. In addition, S. 149 \n     provides more authority than the existing law to require \n     enhanced controls on such parts and components as needed to \n     protect national security.\n\n\n          role of department of defense and other departments\n\n       The bill provides a significant role for the Department of \n     Defense in the licensing process, including:\n       --giving the Secretary of Defense concurrence authority in \n     identifying items to be controlled for national security \n     reasons. This is a greater role than Defense has under \n     existing law because the scope of the national security \n     control list under the bill is significantly greater than \n     under current law.\n       --requiring the Secretary of Commerce to refer all license \n     applications to the Secretaries of Defense and State for \n     their review and recommendations. The bill also authorizes \n     all reviewing departments, for the first time in statute, to \n     escalate a proposed licensing decision to the President.\n       --requiring the Department of Commerce, for the first time \n     in statute, to notify the Department of Defense of all \n     commodity classification requests.\n       --requiring the Department of Commerce, for the first time \n     in statute, to fully consider any intelligence information \n     relevant to a proposed export when considering a license \n     application.\n       --enabling the President to continue the longstanding \n     procedure whereby the Office of Management and Budget ensures \n     the concurrence of the Departments of State and Defense, and \n     other agencies as appropriate, on regulations issued by \n     Commerce pursuant to the act. This procedure allows the \n     Departments of State and Defense to concur on regulations \n     affecting their interests without requiring concurrence on \n     regulations those departments may not wish to review.\n       --continuing the President's authority to require a license \n     for transfers of controlled items to foreign nationals within \n     the United States and requiring State and Defense's \n     concurrence on such licenses.\n       Regarding restrictions on the President's delegation of \n     authority, such restrictions are limited and apply only to \n     those areas not appropriately delegated to any one agency. \n     Restricting decisionmaking authority to the President, in \n     these very limited circumstances, ensures that all \n     interests--including national security--will be fully \n     considered.\n       As officials from the Departments of State and Defense \n     testified at the House International Relations Committee on \n     July 11, the provisions of S. 149 protect the President's \n     authority to safeguard U.S. national security.\n\n\n                        proposed executive order\n\n       Interagency review of export license applications is \n     conducted under Executive Order 12981, as amended. Under this \n     executive order, the Departments of Defense, State and Energy \n     have the right to review all license applications submitted \n     to the Department of Commerce. The only applications that \n     these departments do not review are those they choose not to, \n     such as applications to export crude oil.\n       S. 149 partially codifies Executive Order 12981 and \n     provides the Administration the flexibility to structure an \n     appeals process that will preserve the existing authorities \n     of both the Departments of Defense and State. For example, \n     the current executive order establishes an assistant \n     secretary-level interagency working group to hear appeals of \n     decisions made at lower levels. This group already is an \n     integral part of the licensing process and the Administration \n     plans to keep it so. Any new executive order promulgated \n     after the passage of a new EAA would not alter Defense's \n     current ability to review and object to license applications.\n       S. 149 also requires Commerce, for the first time in \n     statute, to notify Defense of all commodity classification \n     requests Commerce receives. The Administration has committed \n     to implement by executive order a process by which all these \n     commodity classification requests will be reviewed by \n     Defense, with a disciplined and transparent process for \n     escalating and deciding disputes. The Administration will \n     brief Congress about all of the processes provided for in S. \n     149 as they are implemented.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today in order to reiterate my \nconcerns over the Export Administration Act of 2001.\n  There is little doubt that this bill will pass. The writing is on the \nwall.\n\n[[Page S9143]]\n\n However, with all due respect to the administration and to my \ncolleagues on the Banking Committee, I have and will continue to oppose \nS. 149.\n  Neither I nor Senators Thompson, Kyl, Helms or McCain desire to \nimpede American business entities in their pursuit of new markets. I \nfor one tend to agree with President Calvin Coolidge, who said that, \n``The chief business of the American people is business.'' Every \nSenator here today is an advocate for enhanced trade and for helping \nU.S. industry to export its goods and services. Exports bring \nprosperity to this Nation's companies and work to its citizens. If my \nadvocacy for the U.S. technology industry were the sole basis upon \nwhich my decision on this legislation was to be based, I could easily \nchange my past position and support passage of the Export \nAdministration Act, or EAA as it is known. However, the other basis \nupon which the EAA should be measured is its effect upon the national \nsecurity of the United States.\n  Earlier this summer, I was inspired when I listened as one of my \ncolleagues, who had not previously supported my position on the EAA, \npublicly and emphatically stated, and I paraphrase, that when it comes \nto the difficult question of promoting trade or preserving national \nsecurity, we must err on the side of national security.\n  That balance is the crux of this week's debate. We should not support \na measure that could, as written, result in harm to Americans by \ntechnology developed and sold by Americans.\n  The pending bill addresses the control of ``dual use'' technology, \nthat is, technology that has both commercial and military applications. \nMost commonly, our current export controls entail a licensing process \nfor the export of most dual use technologies. Rather than prohibit \nexports outright, we generally ensure that we can determine which \ncountries are receiving technology and keep track of anomalies in \nexporting so that we can measure whether technology is being put to \nmilitary use. The EAA also regulates which countries will be permitted \nto import U.S. dual-use technologies. Generally, U.S. companies are not \npermitted to export dual use products to countries like Iran and Iraq.\n  This bill is an attempt to rewrite our export control laws to make \nthem more rational. I too believe that this nation needs new export \nlaws to meet today's trade realities. However, this effort must not \nopen the floodgates for our dual use technology to be exported, without \nthe ability for the U.S. Government to follow where that technology \ngoes and its ultimate application.\n  For an export control regime to function properly, it must provide \nfor a balancing of the commercial benefits involved--which are \ngenerally obvious, easily-quantified, concentrated, and immediate--with \nthe national security concerns, which are typically shrouded in \nsecrecy, difficult to quantify, diffuse, and long-term in nature. In \nthis equation, national security can easily get the short end of the \nstick.\n  Not everything is shrouded in secrecy. In accordance with Section 721 \nof the 1997 Intelligence Authorization Act, twice a year the Director \nof Central Intelligence submits a report on trends in the proliferation \nof weapons technologies. Part of the report is unclassified. The report \nidentifies key suppliers of dual use missile, nuclear, and conventional \narms technologies, as well as dual-use biotechnology and chemical \ntechnology. Nations such as China and Russia are identified as key \nsuppliers. They export their technology to the likes of Iraq, Iran, \nLibya, Syria, Sudan, Pakistan and India. The report received last \nwinter detailed a continuing and significant problem.\n  Regarding Iran, the report states, and I quote:\n\n       Tehran expanded its efforts to seek considerable dual use \n     biotechnical materials, equipment, and expertise from \n     abroad--primarily from entities in Russia and Western \n     Europe--ostensibly for civilian uses. We judge that this \n     equipment and know-how could be applied to Iran's biological \n     warfare program. Outside assistance is both important and \n     difficult to prevent, given the dual-use nature of the \n     materials, the equipment being sought, and the many \n     legitimate end uses for these items.\n\n  Regarding Iraq, the report indicates that Saddam Hussein is utilizing \nall means to acquire dual-use technology. The report states:\n\n       Iraq has attempted to purchase numerous dual-use items for, \n     or under the guise of, legitimate civilian use. This \n     equipment, in principle subject to UN scrutiny, also could be \n     diverted for weapons of mass destruction purposes. In \n     addition, Iraq appears to be installing or repairing dual-use \n     equipment at chemical weapons related facilities.\n\n  With respect to India, ``India continues to rely on foreign \nassistance for key missile and dual-use technologies where it still \nlacks engineering or production expertise in ballistic missile \ndevelopment.'' The report goes on to cite Russia and Western Europe as \nthe primary conduits of India's missile related technology.\n  As stated in the Report, Pakistan received significant assistance \nfrom Communist China for its ballistic missile program in the early \npart of last year. As recently as this past weekend, the administration \nwas forced to impose sanctions on the China Metallurgical Equipment \nCorporation for selling missile technology to Pakistan. The corporate \nentity in Pakistan which received the technology was also sanctioned. I \nknow this has been and continues to be an issue of great concern to \nSenator Thompson. I commend him for his efforts to publicize Communist \nChina's blatant disregard for its pledge not to support foreign nuclear \nmissile programs.\n  The report did contain one note of optimism, which I believe is also \ndirectly applicable to today's debate. Nations such as Libya and Iran \ncontinued to attempt to acquire needed materials for weapons of mass \ndestruction in Western Europe. They had some success in the first half \nof 2000, but the CIA report states that, ``Increasingly rigorous and \neffective export controls and cooperation among supplier countries have \nled the other foreign WMD programs to look elsewhere for many \ncontrolled dual-use goods.'' The point is, that while we cannot stop \nall proliferation, a rigorous export control regime can be effective in \ndiffusing the spread of potentially threatening dual-use technology.\n  Mr. President, the problem is real. I believe it is a significant \nstatement when the Chairmen and now Ranking Members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, the Intelligence \nCommittee, the Committee on Governmental Affairs and the Subcommittee \non Technology, Terrorism and Government Information, have serious \nissues with the protections this legislation provides our national \nsecurity. I am deeply disappointed that the new administration was not \nable to support reasonable amendments which would address the national \nsecurity equities which we have highlighted. I am concerned that the \ninterests of the high tech business community have replaced reasonable \nconsideration of our dual use export control regime.\n  Technologies which are exported today can and will have to be dealt \nwith by this Nation's national security apparatus. Consequently, I urge \nmy colleagues to support the amendments of Senators Thompson, Kyl, \nHelms, and others, which will strengthen S. 149 with respect to \nnational security. They are only a handful of the changes which should \nbe made to this bill but they will serve to give the Defense Department \nand the State Department a more level playing field in the export \ncontrol process from which to protect national security.\n  There is a proper balance between promoting business and preserving \nthe national security. This bill does not strike that balance. As a \nconferee, I am hopeful that in conference, I can work with the members \nof the House, especially Chairman Hyde and continue these efforts to \ntilt the balance in favor of national security.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record \nentitled ``Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating \nto Weapons\nof Mass Destruction and Advanced\nConventional Munitions, 1 January through 30 June 2000.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology \n   Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional \n               Munitions, 1 January Through 30 June 2000\n\n       The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) hereby submits \n     this report in response to a Congressionally directed action \n     in Section\n\n[[Page S9144]]\n\n     721 of the FY 97 Intelligence Authorization Act, which \n     requires:\n       ``(a) Not later than 6 months after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, and every 6 months thereafter, the \n     Director of Central Intelligence shall submit to Congress a \n     report on\n       (1) the acquisition by foreign countries during the \n     preceding 6 months of dual-use and other technology useful \n     for the development or production of weapons of mass \n     destruction (including nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, and \n     biological weapons) and advanced conventional munitions; and\n       (2) trends in the acquisition of such technology by such \n     countries.''\n       At the DCI's request, the DCI Nonproliferation Center (NPC) \n     drafted this report and coordinated it throughout the \n     Intelligence Community. As directed by Section 721, \n     subsection (b) of the Act, it is unclassified. As such, the \n     report does not present the details of the Intelligence \n     Community's assessments of weapons of mass destruction and \n     advanced conventional munitions programs that are available \n     in other classified reports and briefings for the Congress.\n\n\n                         Acquisition by Country\n\n       As required by Section 721 of the FY 97 Intelligence \n     Authorization Act, the following are summaries by country of \n     acquisition activities (solicitations, negotiations, \n     contracts, and deliveries) related to weapons of mass \n     destruction (WMD) and advanced conventional weapons (ACW) \n     that occurred from 1 January through 30 June 2000. We \n     excluded countries that already have substantial WMD \n     programs, such as China and Russia, as well as countries that \n     demonstrated little WMD acquisition activity of concern.\n     Iran\n       Iran remains one of the most active countries seeking to \n     acquire WMD and ACW technology from abroad. In doing so, \n     Tehran is attempting to develop an indigenous capability to \n     produce various types of weapons--chemical, biological, and \n     nuclear--and their delivery systems. During the reporting \n     period, the evidence indicates reflections of determined \n     Iranian efforts to acquire WMD-and ACW-related equipment, \n     materials, and technology focused primarily on entities in \n     Russia, China, North Korea, and Western Europe.\n       Iran, a Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) party, already \n     has manufactured and stockpiled several thousand tons of \n     chemical weapons, including blister, blood, and choking \n     agents, and the bombs and artillery shells for delivering \n     them. During the first half of 2000, Tehran continued to seek \n     production technology, training, expertise, equipment, and \n     chemicals that could be used as precursor agents in its \n     chemical warfare (CW) program from entities in Russia and \n     China.\n       Tehran expanded its efforts to seek considerable dual-use \n     biotechnical materials, equipment, and expertise from \n     abroad--primarily from entities in Russia and Western \n     Europe--ostensibly for civilian uses. We judge that this \n     equipment and know-how could be applied to Iran's biological \n     warfare (BW) program. Iran probably began its offensive BW \n     program during the Iran-Iraq war, and it may have some \n     limited capability for BW deployment. Outside assistance is \n     both important and difficult to prevent, given the dual-use \n     nature of the materials, the equipment being sought, and the \n     many legitimate end uses for these items.\n       Iran sought nuclear-related equipment, material, and \n     technical expertise from a variety of sources, especially in \n     Russia. Work continues on the construction of a 1,000-\n     megawatt nuclear power reactor at Bushehr that will be \n     subject to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \n     safeguards. In addition, Russian entities continued to \n     interact with Iranian research centers on various activities. \n     These projects will help Iran augment its nuclear technology \n     infrastructure, which in turn would be useful in supporting \n     nuclear weapons research and development. The expertise and \n     technology gained, along with the commercial channels and \n     contacts established--even from cooperation that appears \n     strictly civilian in nature--could be used to advance \n     Iran's nuclear weapons research and development program.\n       Beginning in January 1998, the Russian Government took a \n     number of steps to increase its oversight of entities \n     involved in dealings with Iran and other states of \n     proliferation concern. In 1999, it pushed a new export \n     control law through the Duma. Russian firms, however, faced \n     economic pressures to circumvent these controls and did so in \n     some cases. The Russian Government, moreover, failed to \n     enforce its export controls in some cases regarding Iran.\n       China pledged in October 1997 not to engage in any new \n     nuclear cooperation with Iran but said it would complete \n     cooperation on two nuclear projects: a small research reactor \n     and a zirconium production facility at Esfahan that Iran will \n     use to produce cladding for reactor fuel. As a party to the \n     Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), Iran is required to \n     apply IAEA safeguards to nuclear fuel, but safeguards are not \n     required for the zirconium plant or its products.\n       Iran claims that it is attempting to establish fuel-cycle \n     capabilities to support its civilian energy program. In that \n     guise, it seeks to obtain turnkey facilities, such as a \n     uranium conversion facility that, in fact, could be used in \n     any number of ways to support fissile material production \n     needed for a nuclear weapon. We suspect that Tehran most \n     likely is interested in acquiring foreign fissile material \n     and technology for weapons development as part of its overall \n     nuclear weapons program.\n       During the first half of 2000, entities in Russia, North \n     Korea, and China continued to supply the largest amount of \n     ballistic missile--related goods, technology, and expertise \n     to Iran. Tehran is using this assistance to support current \n     production programs and to achieve its goal of becoming self-\n     sufficient in the production of ballistic missiles. Iran \n     already is producing Scud short-range ballistic missiles \n     (SRBMs) and has built and publicly displayed prototypes for \n     the Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM). In \n     addition, Iran's Defense Minister in 1999 publicly \n     acknowledged the development of a Shahab-4, originally \n     calling it a more capable ballistic missile than the Shahab-3 \n     but later categorizing it as solely a space launch vehicle \n     with no military applications. Iran's Defense Minister also \n     has publicly mentioned a ``Shahab 5,'' although he said that \n     development had not yet begun. Such statements, made against \n     the backdrop of sustained cooperation with Russian, North \n     Korean, and Chinese entities, strongly suggest that Tehran \n     intends to develop a longer range ballistic missile \n     capability.\n       Iran continues to acquire conventional weapons and \n     production technologies from Russia and China. During the \n     first half of 2000, Iran received five Mi-171 utility \n     helicopters from Russia under a 1999 contract, and it began \n     licensed production of Russian Konkurs (AT-5) antitank guided \n     missiles. Iran also claims to be producing a new manportable \n     surface-to-air missile knows as Misagh-1, which resembles \n     China's QW-1 MANPAD system. Tehran also has been able to \n     keep operational at least part of its existing fleet of \n     Western-origin aircraft and helicopters supplied before \n     the 1979 Iranian Revolution and continues to develop \n     limited capabilities to produce armor, artillery, tactical \n     missiles, munitions, and aircraft with foreign assistance.\n     Iraq\n       Since Operation Desert Fox in December 1998, Baghdad has \n     refused to allow United Nations' inspectors into Iraq as \n     required by Security Council Resolution 687. In spite of \n     ongoing UN efforts to establish a follow-on inspection regime \n     comprising the UN Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection \n     Commission (UNMOVIC) and the IAEA's Iraq Action Team, no UN \n     inspections occurred during this reporting period. Moreover, \n     the automated video monitoring system installed by the UN at \n     known and suspect WMD facilities in Iraq is no longer \n     operating. Having lost this on-the-ground access, it is more \n     difficult for the UN or the US to accurately assess the \n     current state of Iraq's WMD programs.\n       We do not have any direct evidence that Iraq has used the \n     period since Desert Fox to reconstitute its WMD programs, \n     although given its past behavior, this type of activity must \n     be regarded as likely. We assess that since the suspension of \n     UN inspections in December of 1998, Baghdad has had the \n     capability to reinitiate both its CW and BW programs within a \n     few weeks to months. Without an inspection monitoring \n     program, however, it is more difficult to determine if Iraq \n     has done so.\n       Since the Gulf war, Iraq has rebuilt key portions of its \n     chemical production infrastructure for industrial and \n     commercial use, as well as its missile production facilities. \n     It has attempted to purchase numerous dual-use items for, or \n     under the guise of, legitimate civilian use. This equipment--\n     in principle subject to UN scrutiny--also could be diverted \n     for WMD purposes. Since the suspension of UN inspections in \n     December 1998, the risk of diversion has increased. Following \n     Desert Fox, Baghdad again instituted a reconstruction effort \n     on those facilities destroyed by the US bombing, including \n     several critical missile production complexes and former \n     dual-use CW production facilities. In addition, Iraq appears \n     to be installing or repairing dual-use equipment at CW-\n     related facilities. Some of these facilities could be \n     converted fairly quickly for production of CW agents.\n       UNSCOM reported to the Security Council in December 1998 \n     that Iraq also continued to withhold information related to \n     its CW program. For example, Baghdad seized from UNSCOM \n     inspectors an Air Force document discovered by UNSCOM that \n     indicated that Iraq had not consumed as many CW munitions \n     during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s as had been declared by \n     Baghdad. This discrepancy indicates that Iraq may have hidden \n     an additional 6,000 CW munitions.\n       In 1995, Iraq admitted to having an offensive BW program \n     and submitted the first in a series of Full, Final, and \n     Complete Disclosures (FFCDs) that were supposed to reveal the \n     full scope of its BW program. According to UNSCOM, these \n     disclosures are incomplete and filled with inaccuracies. \n     Since the full scope and nature of Iraq's BW program was not \n     verified, UNSCOM assessed that Iraq continues to maintain a \n     knowledge base and industrial infrastructure that could be \n     used to produce quickly a large amount of BW agents at any \n     time, if needed.\n       Iraq has continued working on its L-29 unmanned aerial \n     vehicle (UAV) program, which involves concerting L-29 jet \n     trainer aircraft originally acquired from Eastern Europe. It \n     is believed that Iraq may have been conducting flights of the \n     L-29, possibly to test system improvements or to train new \n     pilots. These refurbished trainer aircraft are believed to \n     have been modified for delivery of chemical or, more likely, \n     biological warfare agents.\n\n[[Page S9145]]\n\n       We believe that Iraq has probably continued low-level \n     theoretical R associated with its nuclear program. A \n     sufficient source of fissile material remains Iraq's most \n     significant obstacle to being able to produce a nuclear \n     weapon.\n       Iraq continues to pursue development of SRBM systems that \n     are not prohibited by the United Nations and may be expanding \n     to longer range systems. Authorized pursuit of UN-permitted \n     missiles continues to allow Baghdad to develop technological \n     improvements and infrastructure that could be applied to a \n     longer-range missile program. We believe that development of \n     the liquid propellant Al-Samoud SRBM probably is maturing and \n     that a low-level operational capability could be achieved in \n     the near team. The solid-propellant missile development \n     program may now be receiving a higher priority, and \n     development of the Ababil-100 SRBM and possibly longer range \n     systems may be moving ahead rapidly. If economic sanctions \n     against Iraq were lifted, Baghdad probably would increase its \n     attempts to acquire missile-related items from foreign \n     sources, regardless of any future UN monitoring and \n     continuing restrictions on long-range ballistic missile \n     programs. Iraq probably retains a small, covert force of \n     Scud-type missiles.\n     North Korea\n       P'yongyang continues to acquire raw materials from out-of-\n     country entitles needed for its WMD and ballistic missile \n     programs. During this time fame, North Korea continued \n     procurement of raw materials and components for its ballistic \n     missile programs from various foreign sources, especially \n     through firms in China. We assess the North Korea is capable \n     of producing and delivering via munitions a wide variety of \n     chemical and biological agents.\n       During the first half of 2000, P'yongyang sought to procure \n     technology worldwide that could have applications in its \n     nuclear program, but we do not know of any procurement \n     directly linked to the nuclear weapons program. We assess \n     that North Korea has produced enough plutonium for at \n     least one, and possibly two, nuclear weapons. The United \n     States and North Korea are nearing completion on the joint \n     project of canning spent fuel from the Yongbyon complex \n     for long-term storage and ultimate shipment out of the \n     North in accordance with the 1994 Agreed Framework. That \n     reacher fuel contains enough plutonium for several more \n     weapons.\n       North Korea continues to seek conventional arms. It signed \n     a contract with Russia during this reporting period.\n     Libya\n       Libya has continued its efforts to obtain ballistic \n     missile-related equipment, materials, technology, and \n     expertise from foreign sources. Outside assistance is \n     critical to its ballistic missile development programs, and \n     the suspension of UN sanctions last year has allowed Tripoli \n     to expand its procurement effort. Libya's current capability \n     remains limited to its aging Scud B missiles, but with \n     continued foreign assistance it may achieve an MRBM \n     capability--a long-desired goal.\n       Libya remains heavily dependent on foreign suppliers for \n     precursor chemicals and other key CW-related equipment. \n     Following the suspension of UN sanctions in April 1999, \n     Tripoli reestablished contacts with sources of expertise, \n     parts, and precursor chemicals abroad, primarily with Western \n     Europe. Libya still appears to have a goal of establishing an \n     offensive CW capability and an indigenous production \n     capability for weapons. Evidence suggests Libya also is \n     seeking to acquire the capability to develop and produce BW \n     agents.\n       Libya continues to develop its nascent nuclear research and \n     development program but still requires significant foreign \n     assistance to advance to a nuclear weapons option. The \n     suspension of sanctions has accelerated the pace of \n     procurement efforts in Libya's drive to rejuvenate its \n     ostensibly civilian nuclear program. In early 2000, for \n     example, Tripoli and Moscow renewed talks on cooperation at \n     the Tajura Nuclear Research Center and discussed a potential \n     power reactor deal. Should such civil-sector work come to \n     fruition, Libya could gain opportunities to conduct weapons-\n     related R\n       Following the suspension of UN sanctions, Libya has \n     negotiated deals--reported to be worth up to $100 million, \n     according to Russian press--with Russian firms for \n     conventional weapons, munitions, and upgrades and \n     refurbishment for its existing inventory of Soviet-era \n     weapons.\n     Syria\n       Syria sought CW-related precursors and expertise from \n     foreign sources during the reporting period. Damascus already \n     has a stockpile of the nerve agent sarin, and it would appear \n     that Syria is trying to develop more toxic and persistent \n     nerve agents. Syria remains dependent on foreign sources for \n     key elements of its CW program, including precursor chemicals \n     and key production equipment. It is highly probable that \n     Syria also is developing an offensive BW capability.\n       We will continue to monitor the potential for Syria's \n     embryonic nuclear research and development program to expand.\n       During the first half of 2000, Damascus continued work on \n     establishing a solid-propellant rocket motor development and \n     production capability with help from outside countries. \n     Foreign equipment and assistance to its liquid-propellant \n     missile program, primarily from North Korean entities, but \n     also from firms in Russia, have been and will continue to be \n     essential for Syria's effort. Damascus also continued its \n     efforts to assemble--probably with considerable North Korean \n     assistance--liquid fueled Scud C missiles.\n       Syria continues to acquire ACW--mainly from Russia and \n     other FSU suppliers--although at a reduced level from the \n     early 1990s. During the past few years, Syria has received \n     Kornet-E (AT-14), Metis-M (AT-13), Konkurs (AT-5), and \n     Bastion-M (AT-10B) antitank guided missiles, RPG-29 rocket \n     launchers, and small arms, according to Russian press \n     reports. Damascus has expressed interest in acquiring Russian \n     Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters and air defense systems, but its \n     outstanding debt to Moscow and inability to fund large \n     purchases have hampered negotiations, according to press \n     reports.\n     Sudan\n       During the reporting period, Sudan sought to acquire a \n     variety of military equipment from various sources. Khartoum \n     is seeking older, less expensive weapons that nonetheless are \n     advanced compared with the capabilities of the weapons \n     possessed by its opponents and their supporters in \n     neighboring countries in the long-running civil war.\n       In the WMD arena, Sudan has been developing the capability \n     to produce chemical weapons for many years. In this pursuit, \n     it has obtained help from entities in other countries, \n     principally Iraq. Given its history in developing chemical \n     weapons and its close relationship with Iraq, Sudan may be \n     interested in a BW program as well.\n     India\n       India continues its nuclear weapons development program, \n     for which its underground nuclear tests in May 1998 were a \n     significant milestone. The acquisition of foreign equipment \n     could benefit New Delhi in its efforts to develop and \n     produce more sophisticated nuclear weapons. India obtained \n     some foreign assistance for its civilian nuclear power \n     program during the first half of 2000, primarily from \n     Russia.\n       India continues to rely on foreign assistance for key \n     missile and dual-use technologies, where it still lacks \n     engineering or production expertise in ballistic missile \n     development. Entities in Russia and Western Europe remained \n     the primary conduits of missile-related technology transfers \n     during the first half of 2000. New Delhi Flight-tested three \n     short-range ballistic missiles between January and June \n     2000--the Prithvi-II in February and June, and the Dhanush in \n     April.\n       India continues an across-the-board modernization of its \n     armed forces through ACW, mostly from Russia, although many \n     of its key programs have been plagued by delays. During the \n     reporting period, New Delhi continued negotiations with \n     Moscow for 310 T-90S main battle tanks Su-30 fighter aircraft \n     production, A-50 Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) \n     aircraft, Tu-22M Backfire maritime strike bombers, and an \n     aircraft carrier, according to press reports. India also \n     continues to explore options for leasing or purchasing \n     several AWACS systems from other entities. India has also \n     received its first delivery of Russian Krasnopol laser-guided \n     artillery rounds to be used in its Swedish-build FH-77 155-mm \n     howitzers, negotiated the purchase of unmanned aerial \n     vehicles form Israel, and considered offers for jet trainer \n     aircraft from France and the United Kingdom.\n     Pakistan\n       Chinese entities continued to provide significant \n     assistance to Pakistan's ballistic missile program during the \n     first half of 2000. With Chinese assistance, Pakistan is \n     rapidly moving toward serial production of solid-propellant \n     SRBMs. Pakistan's development of the two-state Shaheen-II \n     MRBM also requires continued Chinese assistance. The impact \n     of North Korea's assistance throughout the reporting period \n     is less clear.\n       Pakistan continued to acquire nuclear-related and dual-use \n     equipment and materials from various sources--principally in \n     Western Europe. Islamabad has a well-developed nuclear \n     weapons program, as evidence by its first nuclear weapons \n     tests in late May 1998. Acquisition of nuclear-related goods \n     form foreign sources will remain important if Pakistan \n     chooses to develop more advanced nuclear weapons. China, \n     which has provided extensive support in the past to \n     Islamabad's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, \n     in May 1996 pledged that it would not provide assistance to \n     unsafeguarded nuclear facilities in any state, including \n     Pakistan. We cannot rule out, however, some continued \n     contacts between Chinese entities and entities involved in \n     Pakistan's nuclear weapons development.\n       Pakistan continues to rely on China and France for its ACW \n     requirements. Pakistan received eight upgraded Mirage III/V \n     fighters from France and continued negotiations to purchase \n     an additional 50 F-7 fighters from China.\n     Egypt\n       Egypt continues its effort to develop and produce ballistic \n     missiles with the assistance of North Korea. This activity is \n     part of a long-running program of ballistic missile \n     cooperation between these two countries.\n\n\n                             Key Suppliers\n\n     Russia\n       Despite overall improvements in Russia's economy, the \n     state-run defense and nuclear industries remain strapped for \n     funds, even as\n\n[[Page S9146]]\n\n     Moscow looks to them for badly needed foreign exchange \n     through exports. We remain very concerned about the \n     nonproliferation implications of such sales in several areas. \n     Monitoring Russian proliferation behavior, therefore, will \n     remain a very high priority.\n       Russian entities during the reporting period continued to \n     supply a variety of ballistic missile-related goods and \n     technical know-how to countries such as Iran, India, China, \n     and Libya. Iran's earlier success in gaining technology and \n     materials from Russian entities accelerated Iranian \n     development of the Shahab-3 MRBM, which was first flight-\n     tested in July 1998. Russian entities during the first six \n     months of 2000 have provided substantial missile-related \n     technology, training, and expertise to Iran that almost \n     certainly will continue to accelerate Iranian efforts to \n     develop new ballistic missile systems.\n       Russia also remained a key supplier for civilian nuclear \n     programs in Iran, primarily focused on the Bushehr Nuclear \n     Power Plant project. With respect to Iran's nuclear \n     infrastructure, Russian assistance enhances Iran's ability to \n     support a nuclear weapons development effort. By its very \n     nature, even the transfer of civilian technology may be of \n     use in Iran's nuclear weapons program. We remain concerned \n     that Tehran is seeking more than a buildup of its civilian \n     infrastructure, and the Intelligence Community will be \n     closely monitoring the relationship with Moscow for any \n     direct assistance in support of a military program.\n       In January, Russia's cabinet approved a draft cooperative \n     program with Syria that included civil use of nuclear power. \n     Broader access to Russian scientists could provide \n     opportunities to solicit fissile material production \n     expertise if Syria decided to pursue a nuclear weapons \n     option. In addition, Russia supplied India with material for \n     its civilian nuclear program during this reporting period. \n     President Putin in May amended the presidential decree on \n     nuclear exports to allow the export in exceptional cases \n     of nuclear materials, technology, and equipment to \n     countries that do not have full-scope IAEA safeguards, \n     according to press reports. The move could clear the way \n     for expanding nuclear exports to certain countries that do \n     not have full-scope safeguards, such as India.\n       During the first half of 2000, Russian entities remained a \n     significant source of dual-use biotechnology, chemicals, \n     production technology, and equipment for Iran. Russia's \n     biological and chemical expertise make it an attractive \n     target for Iranians seeking technical information and \n     training on BW- and CW-agent production processes.\n       Russia continues to be a major supplier of conventional \n     arms. It is the primary source of ACW for China and India, it \n     continues to supply ACW to Iran and Syria, and it has \n     negotiated new contracts with Libya and North Korea, \n     according to press reports.\n       The Russian Government's commitment, willingness, and \n     ability to curb proliferation-related transfers remain \n     uncertain. The export control bureaucracy was reorganized \n     again as part of President Putin's broader government \n     reorganization in May. The Federal Service for Currency and \n     Export Controls (VEK) was abolished and its functions assumed \n     by a new department in the Ministry of Economic Development \n     and Trade. VEK had been tasked with drafting the implementing \n     decrees for Russia's July 1999 export control law; the status \n     of these decrees is not known. Export enforcement continues \n     to need improvement. In February 2000, Sergey Ivanov, \n     Secretary of Russia's Security Council, said that during \n     1998-99 the government had obtained convictions for \n     unauthorized technology transfers in only three cases. The \n     Russian press has reported on cases where advanced equipment \n     is simply described as something else in the export \n     documentation and is exported. Enterprises sometimes falsely \n     declare goods just to avoid government taxes.\n     North Korea\n       Throughout the first half of 2000, North Korea continued to \n     export significant ballistic missile--related equipment and \n     missile components, materials, and technical expertise to \n     countries in the Middle East, South Asia, and North Africa. \n     P'yongyang attaches a high priority to the development and \n     sale of ballistic missiles, equipment, and related \n     technology. Exports of ballistic missiles and related \n     technology are one of the North's major sources of hard \n     currency, which fuel continued missile development and \n     production.\n     China\n       During this reporting period, the Chinese have continued to \n     take a very narrow interpretation of their bilateral \n     nonproliferation commitments with the United States. In the \n     case of missile-related transfers, Beijing has repeatedly \n     pledged not to sell Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) \n     Category I systems but has not recognized the regime's key \n     technology annex. China is not a member of the MTCR.\n       Chinese missile-related technical assistance to Pakistan \n     continued to be substantial during this reporting period. \n     With Chinese assistance, Pakistan is rapidly moving toward \n     serial production of solid-propellant SRBMs. Pakistan's \n     development of the two-stage Shaheen-II MRBM also requires \n     continued Chinese assistance. In addition, firms in China \n     provided missile-related items, raw materials, and/or \n     assistance to several other countries of proliferation \n     concern--such as Iran, North Korea, and Libya.\n       Chinese entities have provided extensive support in the \n     past to Pakistan's safeguarded and unsafeguarded nuclear \n     programs. In May 1996, Beijing pledged that it would not \n     provide assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities. We \n     cannot rule out some continued contacts between Chinese \n     entities and entities associated with Pakistan's nuclear \n     weapons program. China's involvement with Pakistan will \n     continue to be monitored closely.\n       With regard to Iran, China confirmed that work associated \n     with two remaining nuclear projects--a small research reactor \n     and a zirconium production facility--would continue until the \n     projects were completed. The intelligence Community will \n     continue to monitor carefully Chinese nuclear cooperation \n     with Iran.\n       Prior to the reporting period, Chinese firms had supplied \n     CW-related production equipment and technology to Iran. The \n     US sanctions imposed in May 1997 on seven Chinese entities \n     for knowingly and materially contributing to Iran's CW \n     program remain in effect. Evidence during the current \n     reporting period shows Iran continues to seek such assistance \n     from Chinese entities, but it is unclear to what extent these \n     efforts have succeeded. In June 1998, China announced that it \n     had expanded its CWC-based chemical export controls to \n     include 10 of the 20 Australia Group chemicals not listed on \n     the CWC schedules.\n     Western Countries\n       As was the case in 1998 and 1999, entities in Western \n     countries in 2000 were not as important as sources for WMD-\n     related goods and materials as in past years. However, Iran \n     and Libya continue to recruit entities in Western Europe to \n     provide needed acquisitions for their WMD programs. \n     Increasingly rigorous and effective export controls and \n     cooperation among supplier countries have led the other \n     foreign WMD programs to look elsewhere for many controlled \n     dual-use goods. Machine tools, spare parts for dual-use \n     equipment, and widely available materials, scientific \n     equipment, and specialty metals were the most common items \n     sought. In addition, several Western countries announced \n     their willingness to negotiate ACW sales to Libya.\n\n\n                                 Trends\n\n       As in previous reports, countries determined to maintain \n     WMD and missile programs over the long term have been placing \n     significant emphasis on insulating their programs against \n     interdiction and disruption, as well as trying to reduce \n     their dependence on imports by developing indigenous \n     production capabilities. Although these capabilities may not \n     always be a good substitute for foreign imports--particularly \n     for more advanced technologies--in many cases they may prove \n     to be adequate. In addition, as their domestic capabilities \n     grow, traditional recipients of WMD and missile technology \n     could emerge as new suppliers of technology and expertise. \n     Many of these countries--such as India, Iran and Pakistan--do \n     not adhere to the export restraints embodied in such supplier \n     groups as the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Missile \n     Technology Control Regime.\n       Some countries of proliferation concern are continuing \n     efforts to develop indigenous designs for advanced \n     conventional weapons and expand production capabilities, \n     although most of these programs usually rely heavily on \n     foreign technical assistance. Many of these countries--unable \n     to obtain newer or more advanced arms--are pursuing upgrade \n     programs for existing inventories.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before my colleague from Texas leaves \nthe Chamber, I want to congratulate him on what I consider to be \nanother major achievement of his career. He can add this legislation to \nthe long list of legislation he has either been primarily responsible \nfor or substantially responsible for. While we have disagreements on \nthe legislation, this is something I have seen him work tirelessly on \nfor at least a couple of years now, and certainly Senator Enzi carried \na large share of the work, as Senator Gramm said.\n  This is another one of those instances where Senator Gramm took an \nissue like a dog taking to a bone and did not turn it loose until he \ngot it done. I must say it is another impressive performance, and I \nwant to congratulate my good friend for adding another important \nlegislative victory to his long legacy.\n  I want to discuss the legislation for a minute in response to my good \nfriend.\n\n[[Page S9147]]\n\n We talked of two goals. This bill has been put to bed now, as it were. \nWe are going to be voting on it shortly. We have made some modest \nimprovement to it. The Senators opposite are correct in saying we have \nbeen talking about this a long time.\n  I do not know whether we can take credit for 59 changes or not. They \nsay 59 changes have been made, but I guess we can take credit for some \nchanges that have been made along the way to improve the bill.\n  We still have problems with the basic concept, and right before we go \noff into this good night, we need to lodge at least one summary \nstatement with regard to the nature of our concern and where we \nhopefully will go from here.\n  The nature of our concern simply is this: It is a more dangerous \nworld out there than ever before, and we have to be more careful than \never we do not export dangerous items to dangerous people that will \nturn around and hurt this country. The risk of that is greater than \never before.\n\n  We do not have two equal goals of trade and commerce on the one hand \nand national security on the other. The interest of national security \ndwarfs the interest of trade and commerce, although they are discussed \nin this Chamber somehow in equipoise. That is not the case. It should \nnot be the case. It is not even set out that way in the bill if one \nlooks to the purposes of the bill. The purposes of the bill are to \nprotect this country. That is why we have an export law, not to \nfacilitate business.\n  A great majority of the time I am with my business friends, but when \nit comes to national security I must depart with those who would weigh \ntoo heavily the interests of trade. I suggest those who are interested \nin trade get about giving the President fast track, giving the \nPresident trade promotion authority. That will do more for trade and \nindustry and to help the economy of this Nation than exporting dual-use \nhigh tech items to China and Russia that may find their way to Iran and \nIraq. So that is what we ought to be doing if we are concerned about \ntrade in this country. So those two goals are not equal.\n  We need to understand what we are doing once again on these issues. \nCall it a balance, if you will. No matter how you weigh the factors \ninvolved, we are giving the Secretary of Commerce and those within the \ndepartment responsibility for national security. The Secretary, who I \nhave the greatest confidence in--and I think he is a great man doing a \ngreat job--should not have the responsibility for national security. \nThat is not supposed to be his job.\n  We are once again giving the Commerce Department, which we greatly \ncriticized during the Clinton administration for some of their laxness, \nthe life or death decisionmaking power in terms of these regulations or \npolicies, in many important instances--not all instances, not always \nunilaterally, but many of them in some very important areas. We are \nderegulating entire categories of exports.\n  Foreign availability has always been something we considered in terms \nof whether or not we would export something or grant a license for \nsomething, and I think properly so. We do not want to foolishly try to \ncontrol things not controllable. So foreign availability ought to be a \nconsideration. We are moving light-years away from that, letting \nsomeone over at the Department of Commerce categorize entire areas of \nforeign availability that takes it totally out of the licensing \nprocess, so you do not have a license, and our Government cannot keep \nup with what is being exported to China or Russia. That is a major \nmove. It is not a good move.\n\n  With regard to the enhanced penalties, what sanction is there to be \nimposed upon an exporter when he is not even required to have a \nlicense? It is saying: We will raise the penalty for your conduct, but \nwe will make your conduct legal. That is not very effective in terms of \nexport control, to say the least.\n  Finally, when I hear the proponents of this legislation say 99.6 \npercent of these exports are approved anyway, they are arguing against \nthemselves. They use it to make the point this is kind of a foolish \nprocess anyway. So if the great majority of them are going to be \napproved, why even have the process? I assume that is the logical \nconclusion of their position.\n  My question is: What about the .4 percent that don't make it? Do we \nnot have to look at the body of exports taking place in order to \ndetermine what that .4 is? Or if we didn't have a process, would that \n.4 be more like 3.4 if people knew there wasn't such a process? The .4 \nis the important thing to look at. Besides, if all the exports are \nbeing approved anyway, why is it so onerous to go through a process \nthat will take a few days and get a clean bill of health so there is no \nquestion?\n  Therein lies the basis of our concern. It is a fundamental \ndisagreement as to how far we should be going in this dangerous time. \nAs the world is becoming more dangerous, as technology proliferates, as \nwe see those we are sending technology to using that technology for \ntheir military purposes, then passing it on to rogue nations, and we \nsee our agencies and our committees--like the Cox committee--saying our \nlax export laws are causing some of this, and we are in the process of \nloosening export laws, I think that is unwise. I hope I am wrong.\n  As I said yesterday, I can afford to be wrong. If I am wrong, a few \ncompanies have been held up a few days. If the proponents of this \nlegislation are wrong, it could cause problems for the country. I hope \nI am proven to be wrong and that I am strong enough to be able to stand \nup and say it when and if that time comes. I hope it does come to that. \nBut we will not know for a while.\n  In the meantime, hopefully, through changes as we go along, through \ncontinuing to work with the administration in heightening their \nawareness of some of the problems and details we have seen in our \ncommittee work over the years, if we see we are going down the wrong \ntrack, we will be able to respond and adjust in midstream. I know my \ncolleagues on the other side will join in that hope and desire, and I \nam sure we will be able to work together toward that end.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/06/senate-section/article/S9147-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9147-S9148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  U.N. WORLD CONFERENCE AGAINST RACISM\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the U.N. World Conference Against \nRacism recently proceeding in Durban, South Africa, had the enormous \npotential to make a contribution in the historic fight against race and \nintolerance. Indeed, holding the conference itself in South Africa was \na tribute to the people of that country and their long struggle against \nracism and apartheid. It could have been a seminal moment in the \nevolution, in our long fight for individual liberty.\n  While much progress has been made, we can all attest that racism and \ndiscrimination continue to affect hundreds of millions of people around \nthe globe.\n  This conference had such potential. It could have addressed issues \nsuch as the rising intolerance toward refugees, intolerance towards \nasylum seekers, the unjustified denial of citizenship because of race, \nreligion, or origin. The conference had the potential for the United \nStates to demonstrate the great progress we have made in this country \non issues of tolerance, of the fight against racism. In showcasing the \nAmerican experience, nothing could have more vividly demonstrated the \nchanges in the United States than the presence of Colin Powell, an \nAmerican Secretary of State, not only of African ancestry but of \nancestry beyond our own shores.\n  Instead of realizing this potential, the conference has collapsed in \na storm of recrimination and venomous rhetoric. The United States and \nIsrael have walked out of the conference. It appears that others will \nsoon follow.\n  The conference, which was intended to be forward looking and to come \nup with a plan of action for fighting racism around the globe has \ninstead destroyed itself because of old hatreds and the resurrection of \ndiscredited agendas. The insistence of Israel's enemies on using this \nconference to launch vile attacks on Israel, to attempt to equate \nZionism with racism, has fully and completely justified the Bush \nadministration's decision to withdraw from the conference.\n  I take the floor today because on a bipartisan basis I believe it \nshould be clear this Senate supports the Bush administration's decision \nto leave the\n\n[[Page S9148]]\n\nconference, to attack its agenda, and to make clear we will have no \npart of it.\n  For many years, Arab regimes have used the United States to advance \ntheir anti-Israel agenda. What is happening in Durban today is not new. \nThe tragedy is the lesson has not been learned. In 1975, with the \nsupport of the so-called nonaligned nations, these regimes succeeded in \npassing the infamous ``Zionism equals racism'' resolution. After much \nwork, the United States, to our considerable credit, had that odious \nresolution rescinded in 1991.\n  The U.N. Secretary General, Kofi Annan, has referred to that \nresolution as the ``low point in the history of the United Nations.'' \nTo his credit, Annan has acknowledged the historical U.N. bias against \nIsrael and called for the normalization of Israel's status within the \nU.N. Indeed, normalization has been acquired.\n  For 40 years, Arab and Muslim nations prevented Israel from becoming \na member of any regional group. By that denial of regional status, \nIsrael and Israel alone is prohibited from becoming an eligible member \nof the Security Council. This tremendous injustice was finally \nrectified only last year when Israel was able to join the Western \nEuropean and Others Group.\n  Despite the Secretary General's leadership in trying to improve U.N. \nresolutions regarding Israel, we are now forced to fight these old \nbattles again, those seeking to defend not only anti-Israel but indeed \nanti-Semitism for their own political purposes. While the anti-Semitic \nrhetoric being shouted by demonstrators in the streets of Durban is \nalarming enough, it is more appalling to see the rhetoric being placed \nin official negotiated documents of a U.N. conference itself. This \ndemonstrates that not only have we not made progress, but indeed this \nis as bad as any action taken in the unfortunate history of the U.N. on \nthis subject.\n\n  The declaration being produced by the conference and the program of \naction which flows from it are intended to help countries strengthen \nnational mechanisms to promote the human rights of the very victims of \nracism. But including anti-Semitic language in these documents cannot \npossibly have a positive effect for the conference agenda. If the anti-\nIsrael language is allowed to stand in the conference declaration, it \nwill have real and lasting effects. The language proposed in this \nconference will only serve to encourage virulent anti-Semitic language \npouring forth from the Palestinian media and media of those of Israel's \nneighbors. The language of intolerance and hatred is a key factor in \ninciting the brutal acts of terrorism now being perpetrated against \nIsrael's civilians.\n  So an organization created and dedicated to peace is now promoting \nlanguage, in an official conference, during a time of violence in the \nMiddle East, that can only result in the loss of life and further \nhatred. American withdrawal from this conference sends an emphatic \nmessage to the Arab world that the United States commitment to Israel \nhas not wavered and our concept of the United Nations as an \norganization dedicated to peace and resolving these very disputes has \nnot changed.\n  The administration's decision to abandon the racism conference once \nit was clear that Israel would continue to be singled out was not a \npartisan action; it was a principled action. I fully endorse it.\n  I hope the United States will defend any nation, not just Israel, \nwhich is unfairly singled out for criticism.\n  While I support this decision, I believe there are larger problems \ninvolved that deserve our attention. The forces that compelled us to \nwithdraw from the conference--anti-westernism, anti-Americanism--have \ncome together in the U.N. before and may represent a growing challenge \nto our country. So the decision to withdraw because of anti-Semitism \nwas proper. But it may not be the only justifiable reason. There are \nothers.\n  Only a few months ago, in May of this year, we had another debacle \ninvolving the United Nations when the United States was voted out of \nthe U.N. Human Rights Commission. What an unbelievable outrage. I do \nnot stand in the well of the Senate believing that the United States \nhas not committed historic acts worthy of criticism; clearly we have. I \ndo not argue that the United States is beyond criticism for actions in \nour generation; clearly such acts have occurred. I am willing to have \nour Nation measured against the highest standard. But for the United \nStates of America to be removed from the Human Rights Commission upon \nthe votes of an organization which includes Iraq, Libya, and Cuba is an \noutrage.\n  So while I take the floor today in light of the current acts designed \nagainst Israel, I do so in the context of the actions of the United \nNations on a continuing basis with regard to many countries, including \nour own.\n  The United States has had a seat on the Human Rights Commission \ncontinuously since 1947. We have been a clear leader on the Commission, \nenforcing investigations of human rights abuses around the world. \nIndeed, U.N. High Commissioner Mary Robinson has said that the United \nStates has made a ``historic contribution'' to the Commission. Indeed, \nI see no need to justify the actions of the United States with regard \nto human rights. Indeed, it is not because we don't defend human rights \nthat we were removed from the Commission; it is because we do defend \nhuman rights that we were removed from the Commission. Had we not taken \nactions against Cuba, had we not spoken up against atrocities in North \nKorea and China, had we been silent about actions in Africa and Latin \nAmerica, there is no doubt the United States would have remained on the \nCommission. We are victims because of what we have done right, not \nbecause of what we have done wrong.\n\n  I have no doubt that our standing up against anti-Semitism and in \ndefense of Israel will now strengthen the case against the United \nStates as an advocate of human rights. So be it. Let the nations of the \nworld balance the actions of the United Nations and their own regimes \nagainst the historic role of the United States, considering our \nhistoric difficulties, and let history be the judge. Which institution, \nthe U.S. Government or the United Nations itself, has been the more \nconsistent and dependable defender of the weak and the vulnerable, with \na principled stand for human rights? I will accept that judgment of \nhistory, and there is no need to wait for the result; it is clear. The \nU.S. Government has had no peer in defending the rights of peoples \naround the globe.\n  I take the floor as a partisan Democrat involved throughout my career \nin the fight for human rights and an active involvement in foreign \npolicy to salute this administration. Secretary Powell did not go to \nDurban. He made the right decision. When the administration withdrew \nfrom the Durban conference, President Bush made the right decision. \nDurban is not our place. If we must fight the fight against racism, the \nfight against anti-Semitism, alone, without the United Nations, from \nthe perch of Washington rather than the perch of the U.N. conferences \nin New York or regional conferences in Durban or Switzerland or \nanywhere else, we may fight alone but we fight in good company.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the U.S.-Canadian \ndispute on softwood lumber.\n  Although it might have escaped the attention of many in Washington, \nthe Bush administration announced a critical trade policy decision over \nthe August recess.\n  After considering truck loads of evidence provided by a legion of \nlawyers, the Department of Commerce once again decided that Canadian \nprovinces giving away timber at a fraction of its value was a subsidy \nto Canadian lumber production.\n  Specifically, the Commerce Department issued a preliminary finding \nthat these subsidies amounted to 19.3 percent of the value of Canadian \nlumber. Further, the Commerce Department\n\n[[Page S9149]]\n\ntook the unusual step of declaring critical circumstances, which back \ndates the duties by 90 days. It did this because it determined Canadian \nproducers were flooding the U.S. market--in an attempt to take \nadvantage of the expiration of the previous U.S.-Canada agreement on \nthis topic.\n  The Commerce Department is due to issue another preliminary finding \nunder another U.S. fair trade law, antidumping law, in the middle of \nOctober. I agree with most observers that this will likely result in a \nsubstantial increase in the current duty.\n  But I do not rise today to discuss the intricacies of U.S. trade \nlaws.\n  Nor, Mr. President, do I plan to discuss the details of Canadian \nlumber programs.\n  I have never understood how giving away timber at a fraction of its \nmarket value and allowing government-set prices instead of market \nprices could be anything but a market distortion. But that is a debate \nthat we have had for 20 years and I myself have discussed on the Senate \nfloor at least a dozen times.\n  I see little point in repeating facts that the Commerce Department \nand independent observers on both sides of the border have long \nacknowledged. I ask unanimous consent that the forward and executive \nsummary of an excellent analysis of Canadian subsidy programs in \nBritish Columbia, prepared by a coalition of Canadian environmental \ngroup--``Cutting Subsides, or Subsidized Cutting?'' be printed in the \nRecord after my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Instead I want to look to the future. I rise today to \noffer a true and lasting solution to what has become the world's \nlargest bilateral trade dispute and, by far, the largest fly in the \nointment in the U.S.-Canada relationship. Given some political changes \non both sides of the border, I believe it is now possible to negotiate \na lasting and real agreement on the U.S.-Canada softwood lumber \ndispute.\n  In 1986, at a similar juncture in a trade case, the U.S. and Canada \nagreed to resolve the dispute by allowing Canada to collect an export \nduty--a duty the United States would have otherwise collected. At the \nsame time, Canadian provincial officials agreed to a set of forestry \nprogram reforms to eliminate the underlying subsidies.\n  This arrangement broke down when Canada unilaterally--and without \nexplanation--withdrew from the arrangement. But with some adjustments, \na similar approach could be pursued to a real solution.\n  The basic concept is simple. Once the final preliminary duty is \nknown, Canada would agree to collect this on its exports and thus gain \nthe revenue that would otherwise go to the U.S. treasury.\n  The antidumping element complicates this understanding, but it could \nbe addressed through a minimum export price or a duty adjustment to \naccount for the dumping.\n  Once the basic export duty rate was set, both sides would agree that \nthe duty would be lowered as Canadian provinces eliminated subsidies. \nFor example, if Canada--or particular provinces--stopped artificially \nlowering the price of stumpage, the portion of the export duty aimed at \noffseting stumpage subsidies would be dropped.\n  Unfortunately, evaluating the impact of proposed reforms in Canada's \nforestry subsidies is a complex task and, sadly, these complexities \nhave been used to hide subsidies and replace old subsidies with new \nones.\n  In order to assist the trade negotiators from both countries in \nevaluating proposals for reform, I propose an ad hoc commission--made \nup of representatives of the forest industry from both countries, \nrepresentatives of organized labor from both countries, and \nrepresentatives of the environmental community form both countries.\n  This panel would evaluate proposals for forestry reform in Canada and \nprovide a non-binding evaluation of the proposed changes to relevant \nU.S. and Canadian government officials.\n  I feel particularly strong that representatives from the \nenvironmental community be included in this group because they are the \nclosest thing to truly independent observers of Canadian forestry \npractices.\n  In addition to providing a fair and thorough evaluation of proposals \nfor change, this group could be a watchdog against backsliding. And it \ncould provide a forum to discuss cross-border cooperation on \nsustainable forestry practices, joint positions for international \nnegotiations on trade and forestry issues, and joint approaches to \nproblems, such as protection of endangered species.\n  I believe such non-binding oversight could ensure real progress \ntoward a final and lasting solution to this difficult trade problem.\n  I have read in the Canadian press some statements that Canadian \nofficials--or perhaps the U.S. lawyers that represent them--that Canada \nshould pursue no such deal until after the issue is fully litigated \nbefore the World Trade Organization and perhaps the NAFTA.\n  But the central fallacy of this position is that the U.S. would \nnegotiate after it has turned back challenges. And there is no reason \nto believe that Canada would succeed in such litigation. Despite the \nrhetoric of some, Canada's record in past complaints is mixed, and U.S. \nlaw and practice has been refined to avoid past problems. If \nchallenged, I believe the U.S. actions on softwood lumber will survive \ninternational scrutiny.\n  Obviously, Canadian officials will choose whatever strategy they see \nfit, but such a litigate-at-all-costs strategy would result in the duty \nbeing in place for most of a year--at minimum.\n  The bottom line is this: Out-of-court settlements are struck when \nneither party is certain of the outcome of litigation; no one settles \nafter they have won the final appeal.\n  If the U.S. duties survive Canadian challenges, I would then oppose \nany effort to settle the dispute along the lines I have laid out. If \nthe U.S. is forced to litigate and succeeds, there will be no domestic \nsupport for a settlement, no export duty, and no compromise. A \ncompromise is possible now, not later.\n  Again, I congratulate the Commerce Department--and particularly the \nhard work of Secretary Don Evans, Undersecretary Grant Aldonas, and \nAssistant Secretary Faryar Shirzad--for decisive action in this case.\n  Lumber mills and their workers in Montana and across the country have \nsuffered because of Canadian lumber subsidies. I plan to work with the \nCommerce Department to ensure that the suffering is over so that \nefficient, environmentally sound U.S. mills can compete on a level \nplaying field--one way or another.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               Cutting Subsidies, or Subsidized Cutting?\n\nReport Commissioned by BC Coalition for Sustainable Forestry Solutions, \n                             July 12, 2001.\n\n Prepared by: Tom L. Green, M.A., Ecological Economist; Lisa Matthaus, \n               MSc, Resource Economist, Sierra Club of BC\n\n\n                                Foreward\n\n                       (By Dr. Michael M'Gonigle)\n\n       Textiles, dairy products, newsmagazines, steel, airplanes, \n     fish plants, forest products--throughout the world, subsidies \n     exist for every industry imaginable. Talk of reducing these \n     subsidies dominates for daily news with seemingly endless \n     rounds of bilateral and multilateral trade talks. But despite \n     the hype, and the rhetoric, the topic is rarely treated in \n     the thoughtful manner it deserves.\n       There are, of course, many good reasons for government \n     subsidies. In today's increasingly homogenized mass-market \n     world, it makes sense to protect a nation's ballet and local \n     newspapers. So too it is important to keep the rural base \n     vital by maintaining support for family farms,and even \n     encouraging new organic producers. Indeed, subsidies are most \n     useful in helping fledging industries make inroads against \n     the predatory behaviour of much larger, and often \n     inefficient, older industries.\n       But subsidies are all too frequently destructive and \n     unsustainable. Such subsidies can be the most difficult to \n     undo because they are deeply embedded, hidden from view, and \n     reward the most powerful interests in society.\n       As Tom Green and Lisa Matthaus demonstrate in this paper, \n     such is the case with the BC forest industry. Here is an \n     industry that from its inception to the present day is \n     supported by a raft of subsidies. Once designed as a way to \n     develop the province, many of these subsidies are today \n     almost completely invisible, propping up an industry against \n     all economic and social logic, and determining the potential \n     for good public policy. This paper only addresses this \n     situation in British Columbia, but many of their arguments \n     apply to the industry worldwide.\n       The phrase ``perverse subsidies'' captures the situation \n     admirably, perverse because\n\n[[Page S9150]]\n\n     government is spending money, or not collecting rents in a \n     fashion that undermines economic as well as social (and \n     environmental) interests. Take, for example, the hundreds of \n     millions of dollars that have gone to prop up outdated mills \n     in northern BC. These subsidies seemingly respond to the \n     social need of keeping remote communities afloat. In fact, \n     this money undercuts other, more efficient communities by \n     artificially depressing their markets, while it robs even the \n     host communities of the opportunity to direct that money, and \n     the local industry, into creating new value-added industries \n     that would foster more stable, longer-term, employment.\n       Many subsidies are not so high profile, however. \n     Undoubtedly, the most pernicious subsidy exists in the lax \n     environmental standards that have long existed in BC. This \n     situation permits the industry as a whole to shift a vast \n     array of costs out of its own production processes, and \n     impose them instead on logged out salmon streams, disrupted \n     caribou habitat, and clearcut coastal watersheds. In such \n     cases, the fishing industry, First Nations, and tourism \n     operators pay the costs of this industry.\n       The authors are self-described ``ecological economists.'' \n     To many readers, this will be an unfamiliar phrase. But it \n     signifies a new type of economic analysis, a critically \n     important analysis if society is to weed out our landscape of \n     perverse subsidies. As our common sense tells us, the human \n     economic system is a subset of our natural ecological system. \n     Creating a sustainable future means re-embedding our over-\n     extended economy in the natural world.\n       That challenge is, as the authors makes clear, structural. \n     The forest industry is underpinned by a land tenure system \n     that blankets the province. These long-term tenures \n     artificially depress prices (through lack of market \n     competition) while they discriminate against innovative new \n     entrants (through exclusion from access to timber). Indeed, \n     this is the very sort of state-chartered, state-protected, \n     and bloated industry that, 200 years ago, Adam Smith railed \n     against in his classic text, The Wealth of Nations. Only by \n     taking away their privileged position, Smith argued, could \n     the natural abilities of the citizenry to innovate, and \n     prosper, be set loose.\n       Smith's radical argument applies equally in British \n     Columbia today. Indeed, in a thoughtful addition to the \n     discussion of structural subsidies, the authors turn our \n     attention to the failure to pay due regard to aboriginal \n     entitlements to the resource base. As any economist will \n     explain, market values reflect the existing distribution of \n     wealth between sellers and buyers. In British Columbia today, \n     a whole group of buyers (the forest industry) secures its \n     products well below its potential costs because the seller \n     (the provincial government) excludes another legitimate \n     interest (First Nations) from the bargain. This situation \n     dramatically skews the whole forest products market, \n     drastically reducing the obligations of the corporate sector.\n       The authors have bravely raised the flag on a critical \n     topic for the new Liberal government in British Columbia. \n     This paper is only a beginning, however. Much work remains to \n     be done to ferret out the true costs of an industry that has \n     for too long gotten by without public scrutiny. Despite its \n     avowed commitment to the ``magic of the marketplace'', the \n     new government will quickly find that it is easier to \n     continue with the status quo than to challenge it fully and \n     transparently.\n       Forestry is a powerful industry in BC, its power coming \n     from exactly those subsidies that must now be uncovered, re-\n     examined and withdrawn. Remove the subsidies, and you \n     transform the industry.\n       This is no small task. But the future health of the BC \n     economy, and the sustainability of its endangered ecosystems, \n     depends upon our doing it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                          1. executive summary\n\n       Following his recent election victory, Premier Campbell has \n     repeatedly asked British Colombians to hold him accountable \n     to the Liberal Party election promises. For a party generally \n     perceived as pro-business, one of the boldest promises was to \n     eliminate corporate subsidies. The Liberals also committed to \n     developing a ``leading edge forest industry that is globally \n     recognized for its productivity and environmental \n     stewardship.'' Together, these two commitments provide an \n     opportunity for structural reform of the forest industry that \n     could have far-reaching consequences for the future of \n     British Columbia's environment and economy.\n       However, to fulfill its commitments, the new government \n     must phase out the subsidies that have inhibited the logging \n     industry from developing into an innovative, diverse and \n     sustainable industry. The elimination of subsidies is \n     necessary to create that ``leading edge forest industry'', \n     because existing subsidies encourage economic inefficiency \n     and the depletion of resources. Existing subsidies inhibit \n     change, innovation and investment. They also hinder the \n     development of value-added industry.\n       This report focuses on subsidies to the BC forest industry. \n     Subsidies occur when public resources are available to \n     private interests at less than their true cost. Resource \n     industries are frequently heavily subsidized, often receiving \n     ``perverse subsidies''--subsidies that hurt both the economy \n     and the environment. As a result, subsidies to the logging \n     industry deserve special attention in the BC government's \n     drive to eliminate business subsidies.\n       The report examines five main categories of subsidies:\n       Stumpage: The fee charged by government to companies for \n     harvesting trees from public land is called stumpage. This \n     report concludes that flaws in the calculation methodology \n     result in the BC government charging companies stumpage rates \n     below market stumpage. The failure to ensure that the rules \n     for calculating stumpage are equitably implemented and \n     enforced provided a potential subsidy of about $350 million \n     over a two and a half year period. Comparing BC's stumpage to \n     competitively driven stumpage rates in similar timber regions \n     in the US demonstrated total subsidies to the BC forest \n     industry resulting from undervaluing of public timber at $2.8 \n     billion for one year.\n       Bailouts and Handouts: Direct payment of cash to forest \n     companies is the most readily understandable of forest \n     industry subsidies. Although sometimes public investment may \n     be justifiable to meet broader societal objectives, the $329 \n     million bailout of the antiquated Skeena Cellulose mill is a \n     textbook example of a perverse subsidy. Handouts are endemic \n     in BC. The report documents ongoing efforts of the Job \n     Protection Commissioner to find ways to reduce company costs \n     through the use of public monies and through regulatory \n     waivers.\n       Waiver of Environmental Protection. When government allows \n     industry to operate without full compliance with \n     environmental legislation, industry is able to transfer the \n     cost of bad environmental practices onto the public, \n     resulting in a substantial subsidy. In BC, neither provincial \n     nor federal environmental rules related to forestry are being \n     fully implemented or enforced, allowing companies to \n     financially benefit from lack of regulatory compliance. It is \n     estimated that this amounts to a subsidy of $950 million \n     annually.\n       Non-recognition and Infringement of Aboriginal Title. First \n     Nations traditional territories include virtually all of BC's \n     commercial forests. Although Aboriginal Title is \n     constitutionally protected right, logging activities--that \n     would amount to infringements of Aboriginal Title--routinely \n     occur in BC without consent of or meaningful consultation \n     with affected First Nations. Compensation will ultimately be \n     required for both the extraction of First Nations' resources \n     and for restoration of traditional territories damaged by \n     logging. This burden will fall on taxpayers, not the \n     companies who have profited, resulting in a subsidy. In 1999 \n     this subsidy is estimated at between $233 million and $1.163 \n     billion.\n       Tenure, BC logging companies operate predominantly on \n     public land and under government licenses, or tenures. \n     Because of BC government consistently undervalues the \n     stumpage rate, tenures have acquired a market value related \n     to the ongoing stumpage subsidy. Furthermore, the BC \n     government has allowed corporate interests to shut down mills \n     in violation of obligations in tenure agreement yet retain \n     secure supplies of timber, thus providing further corporate \n     benefits.\n       While the BC Liberal Party has made the general promise to \n     eliminate business subsidies, it has also other more specific \n     promises that directly bear on the subsidies outlined above. \n     These promises include:\n       Create a market-based stumpage system that reflects global \n     market realities and local harvesting costs;\n       Cut the forestry regulatory burden by one third within \n     three years;\n       Introduce a legislative framework for legally respecting \n     Aboriginal Rights and Title and work to expedite interim \n     measures agreement with First Nations;\n       Develop a working forest land base on public land and fully \n     protect private property rights and resource tenure rights.\n       Depending on how these promises are implemented, they could \n     help reduce subsidies, but they could also dramatically \n     increase the subsidies to the BC forest industry.\n       The Liberals also made other specific election promises \n     that speak to other potential subsidies to the forest \n     industry, including:\n       Apply 1% of all direct forest revenues, not including \n     ``super stumpage'' to global marketing of BC's forest \n     practices and products;\n       Increase the Allowable Annual Cut over time through \n     incentives to promote enhanced silviculture.\n       A high level of vigilance will therefore be required to \n     ensure that subsidies to the BC forest industry do not \n     persist or even increase under the Liberal watch.\n       The elimination of subsidies in any sector causes economic \n     change and human displacement. As one researcher commented,\n       Obstacles to removing subsidies tend to be highly \n     political. Opposition of vested interests, local businesses \n     and segments of the workforce can be very powerful. Once \n     payments are in place then a type of addiction follows, and \n     there may be uncertainty and fear over the consequences of \n     subsidy removal.\n       This report therefore recommends that subsidies to the BC \n     logging industry be phased out gradually and carefully.\n       Taken as a whole, the federal and provincial government \n     subsidies of the BC forest industry are considerable and \n     counter-productive. The amount of subsidies coming from the \n     provincial government alone (including those proposed by the \n     Liberals) is between $3 billion and $6 billion each year. \n     These subsidies represent a significant cost\n\n[[Page S9151]]\n\n     to the taxpayers of British Columbia, while encouraging over-\n     exploitation of forest and hindering the development of a \n     modern, competitive forest industry.

Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 643, which \nimplements the agreement between the United States and Jordan \nestablishing a Free Trade Area. The legislation passed the Finance \nCommittee and is now on the Senate calendar.\n  Jordan has been one of the few Arab states to actively work with the \nUnited States to establish a real and lasting peace in the Middle East. \nThe U.S.-Jordan FTA represents a solid trade agreement as well as a \nstrong signal of support to a valued ally. Although Jordan is not \ncurrently a major trading partner of the United States, this agreement \nshould open the door for increased trade and commerce between the U.S. \nand Jordan. More importantly, it is my sincere hope it will help to \nbring peace to the region through economic stability.\n  The principal feature of the U.S.-Jordan FTA is the mutual \nelimination of tariffs within 10 years. Modeled after the U.S.-Israel \nFTA, it also limits other non-tariff trade barriers and establishes a \nmechanism for the settlement of disputes. The agreement is also unique. \nMost notably, it specifically states that each country shall strive to \nmaintain and enforce its respective labor and environmental laws.\n  I recognize that these particular provisions have sparked some \ndebate. However, I see them as historic progress on a vexing issue. Not \nonly have they established a reasonable standard that we should expect \nfrom any of our trading partners, they also have catapulted this \nCongress and this administration into a real dialogue toward defining a \nnew international trade consensus. The Jordan agreement aside, I find \nit completely reasonable that we should expect our trading partners to \nmaintain their labor and environmental standards. That's simply good \nbusiness. To weaken such standards solely to gain a trade advantage \nwould undermine a country's credibility--not to mention destabilize the \nvery trade relationship the FTA was intended to benefit.\n  The U.S.-Jordan FTA has been negotiated and signed. The Bush \nAdministration supports it and has no intention or renegotiating a new \nagreement. The Jordanian Parliament ratified the Agreement last May. \nOur colleagues in the House have already approved the implementing \nlegislation for the agreement. Jordan's King Abdullah II visits the \nU.S. next week to urge passage of the agreement.\n  I hope his visit will encourage potential detractors to recognize the \nimportance for swift action and agree not to stand in the way of \nimmediate consideration of this vital legislation.\n  Simply put, this is a good trade agreement. The time is right for the \nSenate to take up and pass it without amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/06/senate-section/article/S9151-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MONTANA WILDFIRES\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the loss of life battling catastrophic \nwildlife is a tremendous tragedy that lends us perspective. With the \nloss of four fighters in less than one week in my home State, the fire \nseason in Montana again reminds us that we must be deeply grateful for \nthe hard and dangerous work these firefighters do, work that takes them \naway from their homes and their families to protect the people of \nMontana and the West.\n  Let me honor the four firefighters who lost their lives battling \nfires in Montana.\n  On August 31, 2001, three men died in a helicopter crash near the \nFridley Fire just south of Livingston, MT. The pilot was Rich \nHernandez, 37, originally from Florida. His copilot, Santi Arovitx, \nonly 28, was originally from Spain and had been living in Hillsboro, \nOR. Their crew chief was Kip Krigbaum, 45, of Emmett, ID.\n  On September 3, David Ray Rendek, just 24 years old, was killed when \nstruck by a falling snag while working on a small fire in Bitterroot \nNational Forest, near Hamilton, MT.\n  David graduated from high school in Victor, MT, and attended classes \nat the University of Montana, in Missoula with his sister. I have been \ntold he was a passionate advocate about the outdoors and was a \ndedicated firefighter. I am very sorry his family and Montana have lost \nsuch a promising young man.\n  My deepest sympathies and condolences go out to the family and \nfriends of these four men. We in Congress honor their memory and the \nultimate sacrifice they made for the people of Montana. We are very \nsorry for their loss.\n  Unfortunately, the fires in Montana continue. Dedicated fire crews \ncontinue to battle hostile weather conditions and high winds.\n  Montana fires have consumed over 90,000 acres. The largest fires are \nthe Fridley Fire near Livingston and the Moose Fire burning in and \naround Glacier National Park.\n  The Fridley Fire has burned over 26,800 acres, and it is approaching \nthe Gallatin Divide, increasing the threat to the Bozeman water supply. \nOver 1,000 people are fighting this fire.\n  As of September 5, the Moose fire has burned more than 58,000 acres. \nThere are 35 20-person crews currently battling the Moose Fire.\n  Fourteen are Montana crews and several crews come from Montana's \nIndiana Country--the Rosebud Sioux, Ronan, Blackfeet Nation and \nNorthern Cheyenne. Air Support includes 9 helicopters and 3 air \ntankers. Other Montana crews include: Glacier Park, Bitterroot Hot Shot \nCrew, Trapper Creek Job Corps, Kootenai National Forest and Flathead \nNational Forest.\n  The force of the Moose Fire is tremendous, as it burns on Forest \nService, private, and Glacier National Park lands. People have reported \nto me they can smell the smoke as far away as Chester, another even \nsuggested as far away as Minot.\n  For those listening who may not know those distances, Minot is in \nNorth Dakota, 700, 800 miles away.\n  All of our fire crews are working long days and long hours battling \nthese blazes, and I just can't praise them enough. They have contained \nseveral fires and they are winning the struggle with the dangerous \nFridley and Moose fires.\n  Also, our Indian country firefighters are again great heroes on our \nfire lines in northwest Montana. Although wildfires are devastating, \nour tribal neighbors continually step up to the plate and meet this \nchallenge full on. I intend to work closely with the tribes to better \nincorporate them in the National Fire Policy planning process.\n  I also intend to continue to work hard for funding for fire \nrehabilitation efforts. Many people tend to forget that the devastating \neffects of wildfire remain long after the last flame has been put out.\n  The terrible mudslides that occurred after heavy rains in the \nBitterroot National Forest in Montana in June are a sober reminder of \nthat fact. These mudslides destroy property, soil cover, and can \ndevastate watersheds. We must make sure that the appropriate Federal \nagencies have the resources they need to restore burned areas and to \ndeal with the long-term effects of fire on the ground.\n  Again, I express my deepest gratitude to all of the men and women who \nput themselves in harm's way on the fire lines in Montana, and my \ndeepest sorrow and regret that they lost four of their comrades in the \nline of duty.\n  I will continue to do everything I can to make sure our crews have \nthe manpower and equipment they need on the ground. The quicker our \nfirefighters can contain these fires, the sooner we can take their \nlives out of danger.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate your attention. I yield the floor and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/06/senate-section/article/S9151-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9151-S9153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEXICAN PROGRESS IN THE DRUG WAR\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have come to this Chamber because I \nwant to make a few comments of welcome to President Vicente Fox. I had \nthe pleasure of speaking with him at Secretary Powell's lunch yesterday \nand listening to him in the House of Representatives in the joint \nsession this morning.\n\n[[Page S9152]]\n\n  Because I have been critical of Mexico's efforts to stop drug \ntrafficking, their unwillingness to arrest cartel leaders, to \nvigorously prevent the laundering of drug money, their refusal to \nextradite a single Mexican national on drugs charges, and because of \nthe widespread corruption within the ranks of Mexican law enforcement, \nI thought I should come to the Chamber today while President Fox is in \nour country to say recent reports I have had indicate there has been \ntruly a dramatic change in Mexico.\n  I believe he is to be commended for that. It looks as if he is \nresponsible for an entirely new attitude on the part of his country in \nthe fight against drugs. I wish to take a few moments to commend him \nand to say how important this is to the United States and to the people \nof this country.\n  We all recognize that we have a demand problem in this country. In \nfact, there is even a growing demand problem in Mexico today as well. \nBut, nevertheless, the flood of narcotics across the border represents \na major problem for both our nations. It brings with it also collateral \nproblems in the United States and in Mexico: violence, corruption, and \neven, as we have seen, the brutal torture and murder of \nliterally hundreds of public officials, judges, prosecutors, \njournalists, and any who dare either to cross the cartels or stand in \ntheir way.\n\n  It is fair to say that these major consequences of the drug trade \nrequire that we solve the problem together. Simply put, the Fox \nadministration has made more progress in the war against drugs over the \nlast 6 months than the Government of Mexico made over the previous 9 \nyears.\n  I would like to share some examples, some specifics, if you will, of \nthe progress made by Mexico through the leadership of this brave new \nPresident.\n  Prior to the Fox administration, not one major Mexican national drug \ncartel member had ever been extradited to the United States on drug \ncharges--not one, ever--despite a whole list of pending requests.\n  Since President Fox took office, however, this has changed \ndramatically. In fact, I had the privilege, at the Davos World Economic \nSummit, in January, to meet briefly with President Fox. At that time I \nhanded to him directly a list of requested extraditions, prepared by \nour Drug Enforcement Administration. He said he would take action. I \ndid not really believe him at the time, but he has.\n  After years of court battles, earlier this year the Mexican Supreme \nCourt ruled that Mexican nationals could, indeed, be extradited to the \nUnited States.\n  Since January, 14 fugitives have been extradited to our country from \nMexico. Four of these were Mexican nationals, and three of the four, \nfor the first time, were Mexican nationals extradited on major drug \ncharges. That may not sound like much, but I can assure you it is a big \ndeal, because many of us who have worked in this area for years believe \nextradition is a major deterrent to the cartel leadership.\n  The defendant in the Supreme Court case, Everardo Arturo Paez \nMartinez, is a key member of the Arellano Felix cartel. The United \nStates has been requesting his extradition for years. He was extradited \nto the United States to stand trial. He is here today.\n  Miguel Angel Martinez-Martinez, an accused drug trafficker, was \nextradited and is awaiting trial in San Diego. Martinez is a principal \nfigure in the Joaquin ``Chapo'' Guzman Organization. This Sinaloa-based \ncartel is believed responsible for smuggling tons of cocaine and other \nillicit narcotics into the United States over many years, and for \ntrying to build a 1,400-foot tunnel from Tijuana to Otay Mesa in \nCalifornia.\n  Rafael Camarena Marcias has also been extradited to the United \nStates. He was responsible for successfully building a tunnel between \nAgua Prieta, Senora, and Douglas, AZ, through which up to 2 tons of \ncocaine flowed every day.\n  Extradition has always been the most visible and effective sign of \nhow seriously the Mexican Government is taking the fight against drug \ncartels. I am very proud to say thank you to President Fox and to the \nGovernment of Mexico for their cooperation in this regard.\n  It is not easy for Mexico to target these individuals and send them \nto the United States for trial. It is politically difficult, for many \nin Mexico do not believe that Mexican citizens should face trial in the \nUnited States, and it is difficult for personal safety reasons as well.\n  Let me give an example. The lawyer who represented Everardo Arturo \nPaez in opposing extradition for 3 years and who failed to prevent his \nextradition was found murdered. That is the reward for not succeeding \nwith a cartel. I am told that others may well be in personal jeopardy \nas well.\n  President Fox's leadership has given the entire country new courage \nto stand against the cartels, their killers, and their traffickers.\n  In addition to extraditing those already under arrest, the Mexican \nGovernment has also made new arrests of certain leaders of Mexican \ncartels. Adan Amezcua, one of the three Amezcua brothers, was arrested \nin 1997, but he was freed by a corrupt judge who has since been fired \nfrom the bench. Amezcua was rearrested by Mexican officials this past \nMay.\n  Why are they important? The Amezcua brothers are major \nmethamphetamine traffickers. They are responsible single-handedly for \nthe introduction of methamphetamine throughout this country. Indeed, \nthe cartel and its nationals still run meth labs throughout the United \nStates.\n  In cooperation, the Governor of Quintana Roo, Mario Villaneuva, who \nwas arrested while he was still Governor, asked to serve out his term \nof Governor of Quintana Roo, and then he disappeared the day after he \nleft office and has been gone. Well, he was arrested in May for major \ndrug crimes in Cancun, and today he is in a maximum security prison in \nMexico.\n  In February, the Government dismantled an entire cell of the Arellano \nFelix cartel, perhaps the most vicious cartel operating right out of \nTijuana. They arrested 7 of its leaders. They seized 8 houses, 18 \nvehicles, 19 firearms, and communication devices.\n  Seizures of illegal drugs have been on the rise. Some of them are at \nan all-time high. In February, the Mexican Government seized 14 tons of \nmarijuana in cookie boxes; in April, another 131 tons. In February, \nthey seized 8.8 tons of cocaine aboard the fishing vessel Forever My \nFriend, and the 10 crew members have been transported to San Diego; in \nMay, another 12 tons of cocaine aboard a vessel flying a Belize flag. \nOverall, this past year, 24 tons of cocaine have been seized from \nfishing vessels as a result of cooperation between Mexico and the \nUnited States.\n  The Mexican Government has also addressed the serious issue of \ninternal corruption. The captain of the Mexican Army, Luis Rey Abundis \nMurga, was sentenced to 17 years in prison for assisting the Carillo \nFuentes cartel. Retired general, Jorge Mariano Maldanado Vega was \nsentenced to 26 years for aiding the same organization. And Mario Silva \nCalderon, former agent of Mexico's national police, was sentenced to 36 \nyears in prison for similar activity.\n  As Donnie Marshall, former head of the DEA, testified before the drug \ncaucus earlier this year, no one country can possibly combat the wealth \nand sophistication of these major drug trafficking organizations. Only \nby cooperating and sharing locally gathered intelligence and assets can \nwe hope to succeed.\n  That is why I am so encouraged by the progress being made by the Fox \nadministration.\n  In the past I know that American law enforcement and even Mexican law \nenforcement felt that the other side could not be trusted. Now finally \nthat is changing. A new 117-member Mexican organized crime unit, which \nworks hand in hand with our DEA, has fostered new relationships and \ntrust between the law enforcement agencies of our two nations. It is \nonly with this type of cooperation that we can hope to defeat the drug \ncartels and stem the flow of illegal drugs onto the streets.\n  Before I yield the floor, I would like to address one request \nPresident Fox made earlier today regarding passage of S. 219, the Dodd \ncertification legislation.\n  Let me be clear: I continue to support the certification process. We \nhave nothing to replace it. I happen to believe it has some salutary \nvalue. Because President Fox has asked, I would\n\n[[Page S9153]]\n\nbe prepared to support a suspension of the certification process with \nregard to Mexico for the 3 years as requested by President Fox. I would \ndo so because he asks and in the new spirit of cooperation between our \ntwo nations. I would be very pleased to work with my colleagues to pass \nsuch legislation immediately.\n  I am not, however, prepared to abandon the process entirely with \nrespect to all countries, as S. 219 would do. There are many places in \nthe world where progress has not been made. Syria, Iran, Burma, and \nAfghanistan are just a few examples of continuing major problem \ncountries. Only a robust certification process gives Congress and the \nPresident the tools we need to encourage change in these nations.\n  I hope the Senator from Connecticut would work with me on a \ncompromise that would address only Mexico so we can move forward on \nthis issue.\n  In closing, I again welcome President Fox to the United States. We \nlook forward to working with him in our continuing mutual fight against \nthe drug cartels. I personally, deeply, say thank you and salute this \nbrave and courageous new President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nher fine words. It was a superb speech President Fox gave today in \njoint session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/06/senate-section/article/S9153-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9153-S9154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MAGDALENA MEDIO\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, sometimes one speaks in the Senate \nChamber and is not sure what exactly the effect of it all is--maybe \nmore than sometimes.\n  I am speaking today on behalf of a lot of the human rights workers \nand social service workers and community development workers, civil \nsociety people in Colombia. I am hoping--I will be very straightforward \nabout it; I don't think this is illusion--that the words of a Senator \non the floor of the Senate about a priest and about a very important \norganization, of which two members have been brutally murdered in the \nlast 35, 40 days, communicates a message that our Government cares \ndeeply about human rights in Colombia and about the importance of the \nGovernment and the military defending civil society individuals.\n  I rise today to speak out on behalf of many defenseless human rights \nworkers, social service providers and community economic development \nworkers, in our neighbor Colombia, who are besieged by the growing \nparamilitary violence in their county. These individuals, some of whom \nI have come to know personally, all of whom I greatly respect, are \nheros for their contributions to democracy and peace in Colombia. They \ndeserve to be heard and to be aided by the United States government.\n  I have traveled twice to the city of Barrancabermeja, sometimes \ncalled ``the Sarajevo of Colombia.'' During those visits, I have come \nto know the extraordinary and courageous work of a Colombian non-profit \nprogram based in a largely rural region of oil refineries, rivers, and \nmountains. In many hamlets and towns it provides the only hope amidst \nso much despair.\n  The Program of Development and Peace of the Magdalena Medio, located \nin Barranca, is lead by the Jesuit Father Francisco De Roux. The \nProgram's name gives away their mission--sustainable, locally based \nsocial and economic development in the context of an inclusive \ncommunity at peace. They stand for democracy, civil rights, and human \nrights. They are against the war, and have no enemies in the conflict.\n  They strive for an inclusive community where disputes are settled by \ncivil authorities and not by armed gangs. They want to provide \nopportunity for all in their community to work and raise they families \nin peace and dignity. But paramilitaries are taking over their region \nand extrajudicial killings are a daily threat.\n  Recently, they have been beset by tragedy. Two defenseless staff \nmembers have been killed and multilated. Ms. Alma Rosa Jaramillo was a \nvolunteer attorney, a dedicated mother and courageous member of her \ncommunity. Her dismembered body was found in the community of Morales \non July first of this year. On July 17, another brutal assassination \ntook the life of Eduardo Estrada. He was murdered right in front of his \nfamily, after a family reunion. He was a respected leader in the \ncommunity of San Pablo, working as the coordinator of the Program of \nDevelopment and Peace.\n  Why are these innocent people, who are doing such good work, being \ntargeted? Lamentably, these are just two more examples of paramilitary \nimpunity in Colombia.\n  As the Plan Colombia debate has unfolded in the U.S. Senate, we have \ncome to know the terrible reality of the last few decades for the \npeople of Columbia--kidnaappings, assassinations, disappearances and \nterror by the guerrilla and the paramilitary organizations. I am no \ndefender of the guerrilla organizations. They are vicious in their \ntreatment of the civilian population and publicly renounce universally \naccepted human rights standards.\n  But the paramilitary organizations, because of their open association \nwith the Colombian military, also must be held to the highest standards \nof human rights. They cannot be allowed to justify their human rights \nabuses by equating the laudable civic involvement of those they \npersecute, with sympathy for the guerrillas. The paramilitary \norganizations have penetrated ever deeper into Colombian civil society, \nbringing their terror to communities all across Colombia. In many \ncases, they do so with the acquiescense of the Colombian military and \ngovernment, at the local and even national level.\n  The Colombian government must find a way to respond to the \nparamilitary threat. It is a threat to the rights of free speech, free \nassembly, and moreover, the rule of law in Colombia. We must send a \nmessage to all violent actors in Colombia, especially parammilitary \ngroups: ``The targeting of the civilian population with murder, \nextortion, kidnapping, torture and multilation is unacceptable!''\n  The United States has an obligation to nurture and defennd civil \nsociety efforts in Columbia. The Program of Development and Peace of \nthe Magdalena Medio is doing critically important work, helping \nColombians find a way out of the labyrinth of war and terror. They need \nand deserve our thanks and our encouragement; for they represent the \nfuture of hope and peace for Colombia.\n  In my view, a peaceful, prosperous Colombia is a better neightor and \npartner of the United States. We must defend these courageous people \nwho daily risk their lives for human rights, democracy and peace. Given \nour deep involvement in Colombia, we have an opportunity, and a duty, \nto defend Colombian civil society against the abuses of guerrillas and \nparamilitaries alike.\n  Mr. President, I traveled twice to the city of Barrancabermeja, \nsometimes called the ``Sarajevo of Colombia.'' During the visits, I \nhave come to know a very courageous priest who is in charge of an \norganization, a nonprofit organization, that does the economic and \nsocial development work in a largely rural region of oil refineries, \nrivers, and mountains. For many hamlets and towns, this organization is \nthe only hope for people.\n  The name of the organization is the Program of Development and Peace \nof the Magdalena Medio located in Barranca, led by a Jesuit priest \nnamed Francisco de Roux, also called Father Poncho. The program's name \ngives away its mission. The occupant of the Chair would love it as a \nbusinessperson and a Senator from New Jersey. They do the most credible \nlocal sustainable economic development work. They stand for democracy, \ncivil rights, and human rights. They are against the war. They are not \naligned with the FARC, ELN, or any of the left groups--the \nparamilitary--and they should have no enemies in this conflict.\n  This organization has been beset by tragedy. Two defenseless staff \nmembers have been killed and mutilated. Ms. Alma Rosa Jaramillo was a \nvolunteer attorney, a dedicated mother and a courageous member of her \ncommunity. Her dismembered body was found in the community of Morales \non July 1 of this year. On July 17, another brutal murder took place. \nThis assassination took the life of Eduardo Estrada. He was murdered \nright in front of his family after a family reunion. He was a respected \nleader of the community in\n\n[[Page S9154]]\n\nSan Pablo, working as the coordinator of the Program of Development and \nPeace headed up by Father Francisco de Roux.\n  Why are these innocent people, doing this economic development work--\nwho have done such good work--why are they being targeted? Lamentably, \nthese are just two more examples of paramilitary impunity in Colombia.\n  I intend for this statement not only to be made on the floor of the \nSenate, but I hope it is sent out throughout Colombia. As the Plan \nColombia debate has unfolded in the Senate, we have come to know the \nterrible reality of the last few decades for the people of Colombia--\nkidnappings, assassinations, disappearances, and terror by the \nguerrilla and paramilitary organizations.\n  I am no defender of the guerrilla organizations. The FARC and ELN are \ninvolved in narcotrafficking up to their eyeballs. They have been \nvicious in their treatment of the civilian population. They publicly \nrenounce universally accepted human rights standards. But the \nparamilitary organizations, the AUC, because of their open association, \nbecause of their extrajudicial killings and open association, \nespecially at the brigade level with the Colombia military, must be \nheld to the highest standard of human rights. They cannot be allowed to \njustify their human rights abuses by equating the laudable civic \ninvolvement of those they persecute with the sympathy for the \nguerrillas. The paramilitary organizations penetrated ever deeper into \nColombian civil society and brought terror to many of the communities--\nin many cases, with the acquiescence of the military.\n  I rise as a U.S. Senator on the floor of the Senate to communicate a \nmessage to the Colombian Government that the paramilitary should not be \nallowed to murder civil society people, defenders of human rights, \npeople doing good work, as the men and women in Father Francisco de \nRoux's organization do, with impunity. We must send a message to all \nthe violent actors in Colombia, especially the paramilitary groups: The \ntargeting of the civilian population with murder, extortion, \nkidnapping, torture, and mutilation is unacceptable. Our Government has \nan obligation to nurture and defend civil society efforts in Colombia. \nThe Program of Development and Peace of the Magdalena Medio is doing \ncritically important work. They need and deserve our thanks and \nencouragement. They represent hope and peace for Colombia.\n\n  Before you came to the chair, Mr. President, I was saying this \norganization is doing the best, by all accounts, social and economic \ndevelopment work. This priest is beloved and highly respected. Two \nmembers of his organization have been brutally murdered in the last 40 \ndays. Their plea, and the plea from many civil society people in \nColombia, is: Please, U.S. Government, please U.S. Senate, call on the \nGovernment and the military and the police to defend us. That is what I \nam doing. That is supposed to be part of Plan Colombia.\n  We have a deep involvement in Colombia. Therefore, we have an \nopportunity and a duty to defend Colombian civil society against the \nabuses of the guerrillas and the paramilitaries alike. The message \nneeds to be communicated to the military in Colombia that with the \nBlackhawk helicopters and the military assistance come human rights \nconditions you have to live up to. Otherwise, we are going to continue \nto see the murder of innocent people with impunity.\n  I want this statement to certainly be sent out to Colombia because I \nwant the paramilitary forces and others to know we are paying attention \nto Father Francisco de Roux and his organization, the Program for \nDevelopment and Peace, and their work, and that we mean to defend civil \nsociety people.\n  Again, I want to point out that the Colombian Government has an \nobligation to defend civil society people from the violence both from \nthe guerrilla left and the paramilitary right. Up to date, they have \nnot defended people from violence in Barranca, which I have visited \ntwice now. The paramilitary cut the telephone wires, isolated the \npeople. They have no phone service. They took away their cell phones \nand moved into their homes. They control the city. With the exception \nof the bishop and the priest and his organization, and a few others, \nhardly anybody can speak up any longer without the real risk that they \nwill be murdered.\n  Francisco de Roux's organization, widely credited for this great \neconomic development work, has had two members--a woman and a man--\ndismembered, brutally murdered. It is time for our Government to make \nclear to the Colombian Government and police and military that they \nhave to defend these civil society people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/06/senate-section/article/S9154-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9154-S9155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     UNIONS UNDER SIEGE IN COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to also address the \ndisturbing level of violence perpetrated against Colombia's union \nleaders.\n  As another Labor Day passes, I could not in good conscience neglect \nto mention the plight of our brothers and sisters in the Colombian \nlabor movement. There has been a dramatic escalation in violations \nagainst them and the response by the Colombian authorities in the face \nof this crisis has been negligible.\n  For the past 15 years, Colombia has been in the midst of an \nundeclared war on union leaders. Colombia has long been the most \ndangerous country in the world for union members, with nearly 4,000 \nmurdered in that period. Today, three out of every five trade unionists \nkilled in the world are Colombian.\n  Union members and activists are among the main targets of human \nrights violations--including murders, disappearances and threats--in \nthe escalating conflict in Colombia. Paramilitary groups, who are \nlinked with Colombian security forces, are responsible for most of \nthese attacks, although guerrilla groups have also targeted activists.\n  The right-wing AUC has been especially brutal, killing hundreds \nsimply because they view union organizers as subversives. One of the \nmost recent killings occurred on June 21, when the leader of \nSinaltrainal, the union that represents Colombian Coca-Cola workers, \nOscar Dario Soto was gunned down. His murder brings to seven the number \nof unionists who worked for Coca-Cola and were targeted and killed by \nparamilitaries. Earlier this summer, the International Labor Rights \nFund and the United Steelworkers of America brought a suit against the \nCoca-Cola company alleging that the Colombian managers had colluded \nwith paramilitary security forces to murder, torture and silence trade \nunion leaders.\n  According to a recent New York Times report by Juan Forero, the \nnumber of union workers at Coke plants in Colombia has dropped to 450 \nfrom 1,300 in 1993. Total Sinaltrainal membership has dropped to 2,400 \nfrom 5,800 five years ago.\n  Regardless of the outcome of this particular legal case, U.S. \ncompanies with subsidiaries in Colombia have an obligation to address \nthe upsetting trend of violence against workers, particularly union \nrepresentatives. It is clear that some companies regularly hire out \nparamilitary gunmen to intimidate and kill in order to break labor \nunions. Last year alone, at least 130 Colombian labor leaders were \nassassinated. Four times as many union workers have been killed this \nyear as during the same time last year. That's more than 80 unionists \nkilled since the beginning of this year.\n  Colombia, like the United States, guarantees workers a legal right to \norganize.

Mr. President, while the Senate was in recess for the \nmonth of August, the Congressional Budget Office released its \nprojections as to the size of the Nation's surplus. As we expected, the \nnumbers were not good.\n  For fiscal year 2001, the CBO indicates the Federal Government will \nnot only not have an on-budget surplus for the first time since 1999 \nbut that Washington will actually dip into the Social Security surplus \nto the tune of $9 billion in order to cover spending.\n  The Office of Management and Budget says we will have a $1 billion \nsurplus, but, in my view, that is effectively no surplus. So our \nfinancial situation this year is basically somewhere between a \nnegligible surplus at best and a $9 billion deficit.\n  Some of my colleagues might look at the CBO midterm budget review and \nsee the problem of on-budget deficits as a short-term phenomena since \nCBO projects a return to consistent on-budget surpluses after 2004.\n  This belief is misplaced. I remind my colleagues that CBO's forecast \nis based on the dubious assumption that spending in the outyears will \nincrease only at the rate of inflation, which is roughly 2\\1/2\\ \npercent. To say that level of spending is unrealistic is an \nunderstatement, and anyone in this Chamber who honestly thinks Congress \ncan keep spending at the level of inflation just does not live in the \nreal world.\n  I remind my colleagues, around this time last year, Congress \nincreased nondefense discretionary spending 14.3 percent and overall \nspending was increased by more than 8 percent over fiscal year 2000. \nHad we not spent money like drunken sailors in the fiscal year 2001 \nbudget, even with the economic turndown and the needed tax cut for the \nAmerican people, Congress would not have invaded the Social Security \nthis year. The problem is we just spend too much money. If we had \nincreased overall spending in fiscal year 2001 by only 6 percent, we \nwould have saved tens of billions of dollars and we would not be \ndipping into the Social Security surplus and we would not have a \nproblem in the 2001 budget.\n  The concern now is, what will happen in fiscal year 2002? As it is, \nwe are on track to increase 2002 discretionary spending by at least 6 \npercent over last year. The President originally talked about 4 \npercent, and we came out of the Senate with roughly a 5-percent \nincrease. Based on the current demand for money in Washington and based \non our past performance, spending in fiscal year 2002 will likely grow \nfaster than that anticipated by CBO. That means next year we will not \nhave an on-budget surplus and we are going to spend Social Security \nsurplus funds to cover the growth in spending. That is where we are.\n  Alarm bells should be going off all over Capitol Hill because we are \ngetting ready to do something Senators and Representatives from both \nparties have vowed not to do, and that is spend the Social Security \nsurplus. I often say ``there is always some good that blows in an ill \nwind.'' In this case, the ``ill wind'' is Congress's potential use of \nthe Social Security surplus. The ``good'' is the hope that it will \nforce Congress to control spending, prioritize, and make hard choices--\nwhat the Presiding Officer and I had to do when we were Governors of \nour respective States. We had to prioritize, we had to make those tough \nchoices and live within a budget limit.\n  We didn't do that in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 here in Washington. \nWe had a combined on-budget surplus of $88 billion and Congress and the \nprevious administration did not believe they had to make hard choices.\n  Well, things are different today, and now we must make the hard \nchoices. The first thing we have to do is avoid spending the Social \nSecurity surplus. The second thing we have to do is not increase taxes. \nAccording to a national poll released by CBS news just yesterday, more \nthan 70 percent of Americans opposed using the Social Security surplus \nto fund general government spending; 66 percent of Americans oppose \nusing the Social Security surplus even in the event of a recession. Our \nconstituents are making it pretty clear where they stand. They stand \nagainst spending the Social Security surplus.\n  Some of my colleagues and the media say we should spend the Social \nSecurity surplus to stimulate the economy. I say to that, ``hogwash,'' \nand so do the American people. For me, spending the Social Security \nsurplus is black and white. It is simply wrong. The fact of the matter \nis there is a difference between income taxes and payroll taxes. Just \nask the people who count, the hard-working men and women who pay those \npayroll taxes, if there is a difference. More people pay higher payroll \ntaxes in this country today than they do income taxes. They expect that \nmoney will be used for their Social Security benefits and not for \ngeneral government spending.\n  As my colleagues know, there are only two things we should \nlegitimately spend the Social Security surplus on: Social \nSecurity benefits or paying down the debt. It is that simple. If we are \nnot spending it on Social Security, we have a moral responsibility to \nuse it to pay down the national debt.\n\n  One of the primary reasons I wanted to serve as a U.S. Senator was to \nhave an opportunity to bring fiscal responsibility to our Nation and \nhelp eliminate the terrific debt we have accumulated. As my colleagues \nknow, for years successive Congresses and Presidents have spent money \non things that, while important, they were unwilling to pay for; or in \nthe alternative, do without. In the process, Washington ran up a \nstaggering debt and mortgaged this country's future, my children's \nfuture, and my grandchildren's future.\n  We have been reaping all the benefits and putting the future of our \nchildren and grandchildren in jeopardy. In other words, ``we buy now, \nyou pay later.''\n  I cannot convey how wrong I think it is to saddle them with such an \nexcessive financial burden, something this Congress should correct. \nUsing the Social Security surplus to repay the publicly held national \ndebt will make it easier for the Government to meet its obligation to \npay Social Security benefits in the future. At this point, the vast \nmajority of projected debt reductions--some 75 percent over the next 10 \nyears--will be out of that Social Security surplus.\n  In testimony before the Senate Budget Committee last year, Dan \nCrippen, the CBO Director, stated ``most economists agree saving the \nsurpluses and paying down the debt held by the public is probably the \nbest thing we can do relative to the economy.''\n  It was true then and it is true today. If the Government has little \nor no publicly held debt when the baby boomers begin to retire, it will \nbe more manageable for the Government to borrow money, the money that \nit will need to meet its obligations if Congress has not reformed \nSocial Security by that time.\n  The baby boomers will retire. We will either take care of their \nsituation by raising payroll taxes or raising income taxes or having to \nborrow the money. We ought to at least anticipate that.\n  Everyone knows that the lockbox we are talking about is nothing more \nthan a slew of IOUs that must be repaid when the baby boomers start to \nretire. As I mentioned, either higher payroll taxes or higher income \ntaxes or borrowing the money, those bills will be paid, one way or \nanother.\n  Moreover, by reserving the Social Security surplus to help repay that \n$3.1 trillion publicly held debt, money currently invested in U.S. \nTreasury bonds will be released to be invested more productively in the \nprivate sector. More private investment means more capital formation \nand a more robust economy now and in the future, which is precisely \nwhat we need most to meet the demands of our retiring baby boomers. We \nhave to have a growing economy. That is the most important thing we \nhave.\n  Reserving the Social Security surplus to reduce the publicly held \ndebt has the effect of reducing interest rates by reducing the overall \ndemand for savings. In short, reserving the Social Security surplus to \nlower the debt sends a positive signal to Wall Street and Main Street \nthat encourages more investment, which in turn fuels productivity and \neconomic growth. It also lessens\n\n[[Page S9156]]\n\nour cost of servicing interest on the Federal debt.\n  Currently, we pay 11 cents out of every dollar--I don't think a lot \nof people realize this--11 cents out of every dollar is used to pay the \ninterest on our debt. Lower the debt and you lower the interest \nburdens, and that frees more money for other priorities.\n  It was not until 1999 that we got to a point where the Social \nSecurity surplus was no longer used to offset spending--being used for \ndebt reduction instead--and members of each party in both the Senate \nand House swore they would not go back to using the Social Security \nsurplus for spending. In addition, many of us who supported the \nPresident's tax reduction package did so because the President promised \nhe would limit spending and he would use all of the Social Security \nsurplus to pay down debt.\n  I refer to that as a three-legged stool: No. 1, it allows meaningful \ntax reductions; No. 2, it restrains the growth of spending; and No. 3, \nit reduces debt.\n  That was the promise and I expect the President to keep his promise. \nI know many of us who supported the tax reduction will keep our promise \nto limit spending, and we are not going to spend the Social Security \nsurplus.\n  So far in the appropriations process we look like we are on track to \nmaintain a semblance of fiscal discipline because we are basically \nsticking with the budget resolution. Those appearances are deceiving \nbecause we are holding off the toughest bills for last, instead of \ntackling them first. We all know the way things are going, we are \nlikely to increase spending for defense and education far beyond the \nlevels anticipated when the budget resolution was passed. Like my \ncolleagues, I support a strong national defense and funding for true \neducational responsibilities. However, I think we must offset increases \nin these programs by making reductions in other areas, understanding \nthe President is not going to get everything he wants and Members of \nthis body are not going to get everything they want.\n\n  Unfortunately, that is not what we are doing. I agree with President \nBush that the responsible course of action for the Congress is to \nimmediately move up the two biggest appropriations bills, Defense and \nLabor-HHS: Consider them first. We need to get everything on the table \nand reallocate resources in order to stay within the budget limits, \njust as I did when I was Mayor of Cleveland and Governor of the State \nof Ohio.\n  If we were in this kind of situation in a county, or in a city or at \nthe State level, we would get everything on the table, we would look at \nall the things that need to be done, and say we have to reallocate \nthese resources. But not in the U.S. Senate. Not in the U.S. Congress. \nWe do these appropriations bills, No. 1 with blinders on, No. 2 with \nblinders on, No. 3 with blinders on--we go all the way to the end and \njust keep ratcheting it up a little bit until we get to the biggest \nones at the end, and then we say: Holy smoke, we don't have the money; \nand then Katie bar the door. That is what has happened in the last 2 \nyears I have been here.\n  I urge the President and urge the Senate leadership, let's get real. \nLet's look at what we are doing and understand we cannot do everything \nfor everyone, and try to figure out how we can live within the limits \nwe have set. We can do that. I think it would be the finest thing we \ncould do for this country. It hasn't been done around here--I don't \nremember if it has ever been done since I have been watching \ngovernment, and I have been watching it as a mayor and as a Governor \nfor 20 years. I would like to see that happen.\n  The other thing I am going to try to do to guarantee we do not end up \nspending the Social Security surplus is offer two amendments in the \nnear future, with colleagues from both sides of the aisle, that will \nforce the Senate and House to make the necessary hard choices that will \nbring fiscal discipline to the Government and keep the Social Security \nsurplus from being used.\n  My first amendment I will introduce will address Congress's perpetual \nirresponsible spending and budget gimmicks, gimmicks that Congress used \nin 1999 to avoid the appearance of using Social Security. There are a \nlot of them out there. We have to make sure we are honest with the \npublic about what we are doing and not try to pull the wool over their \neyes.\n  The second amendment I will be offering is an amendment to guarantee \nSocial Security funds will not be spent and instead will be used to \nreduce debt. It is my hope, as we proceed through the appropriations \nprocess, these amendments will be given favorable consideration by my \ncolleagues and not turned aside on a procedural vote. We ought to have \nan up-or-down vote on some of these issues that are really going to \nclarify the process and make what we do in the Senate more transparent. \nWe owe the American people nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will take this opportunity to speak \nfor a few minutes on the work that is currently underway in the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee on which the Presiding Officer serves \nwith great distinction. We are making an effort in that committee to \ndevelop a comprehensive and balanced energy policy. I want to inform my \ncolleagues about the likely steps we will be following in the near \nfuture.\n  As I see it, Congress has a real opportunity this fall to set an \nenergy policy that will sustain our economic prosperity as we move into \nthis new 21st century. The Senate has a key role to play in seeing this \nopportunity does not slip through our grasp.\n  A great deal has changed since 1992, which is the last time Congress \nenacted major energy legislation. We have seen energy markets become \nmore competitive and more dynamic. But we have also seen some \nsignificant bumps along the way.\n  First of all, consumers are more vulnerable to the vagaries of the \nenergy markets than they ever were before. I think the evidence we have \nof what happened in California with electricity prices is one example.\n  Second, gasoline supplies are increasingly subject to local crises \nand price spikes due to the proliferation of inflexible local fuel \nspecifications.\n  Third, we rely more heavily each year on natural gas--natural gas to \nheat our homes and to produce electricity. But our system for producing \nand transporting that natural gas is showing signs that it is reaching \nits limits.\n  Fourth, the need to address the fundamental connection between energy \nand global warming is something that is becoming a major concern of \nmany of us, and I think rightly so.\n  So I am pleased most of my colleagues in the Senate recognize these \nchallenges. I believe there is a bipartisan consensus in favor of a \nsensible energy policy that will smooth out the bumps in the market by \nincreasing energy efficiency, by boosting our energy supplies, by \nmodernizing our energy infrastructure.\n  Technology and policy innovations will be key to achieving this \nbalanced outcome so Americans can have reliable and affordable energy \nchoices that are sustainable over the long term. Our energy problems \ncannot be effectively addressed by packaging up a collection of tired \nold wish lists and passing that through the Senate floor in a day or \ntwo. Energy consumers and producers, and several committees here in the \nSenate, will need to focus on new energy approaches if we are to \nprotect our national economic prosperity and do so through smarter ways \nto produce and use energy.\n  For this reason, as the Senate takes up and considers energy \nlegislation this fall, we will be talking about the need for proactive \npolicies, about the need for technology-driven approaches to our energy \nproblems. We have made a good start already in the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources. We began our markup in July, before the August \nrecess--a markup of comprehensive energy legislation.\n  The first part of the bill that we have substantially completed at \nthis point is a comprehensive revitalization of the\n\n[[Page S9157]]\n\nnational capabilities for energy research and development. Putting \nresearch and development first reflects a broad consensus that new \nscience and new technology are at the core of any solution to our \nnational energy challenges. Despite the importance of energy R, our \nrecent commitment to it leaves a great deal to be desired. The level of \neffort we are making today in Federal energy technology research and \ndevelopment is equivalent in constant dollars to what we were making in \n1966. Yet our economy is three times larger today than it was in 1966. \nIt is very hard to see how we can build a 21st century energy system on \na 1960s level of effort in the research and development budgets.\n\n  The committee will begin its deliberations beginning this next week \nand its effort to mark up a bill this next week. Major topic areas \nbefore the committee as we move forward in this markup will include \npolicy proposals to improve energy efficiency, to improve our ability \nto produce energy from a great diversity of sources, and to tackle the \ntough issues related to electricity restructuring.\n  Today I am releasing a detailed description of the proposed \nchairman's mark in these various areas. I am also releasing the text of \nthe major portions of the bill we will be working on in committee--the \nnext major portion of the bill. This part of the bill will deal with \nelectricity, and it will provide a framework to integrate new \ntechnologies into electricity markets to provide high-quality, \nefficient electricity generation in every community and to give \nconsumers new ways to manage and control energy use and energy costs.\n  I would like to take an opportunity to describe some of the key \nproposals in the mark that we will be considering in a little more \ndetail. With respect to energy efficiency, the chairman's mark that we \nwill be considering for the energy policy bill will contain provisions \nthat will improve energy efficiency in household appliances--also \nprovisions that will improve energy efficiency in Federal and other \nfacilities and industry itself.\n  Let me state my belief, though, that increasing vehicle fuel \nefficiency is one of the highest legislative priorities that the Senate \nshould have in energy legislation. In addition to our growing \ndependence on foreign imported oil, we have reached the limits of our \ncurrent infrastructure to refine and distribute fuels. A policy of \nsimply continuing to increase the demand for gasoline is not \nsustainable. Fortunately, advanced technology in a variety of areas to \nimprove automotive fuel efficiency offers a better answer, and we need \nto move in that direction.\n  The National Academy of Sciences has given us some very useful ways \nof thinking how to reformulate the CAFE program. Clearly, consumers \nwant the option to choose the type of vehicle that suits their needs \nand preferences. They also want to be able to count on reliable and \naffordable fuel supplies.\n  While CAFE standards are not in the Energy Committee's jurisdiction, \na number of other mechanisms to encourage greater fuel efficiency in \ncars and trucks are in our jurisdiction. The mark will contain purchase \nrequirements for Federal fleets that will provide greater incentive to \nautomobile and truck manufacturers to produce more highly efficient \nvehicles.\n  A topic closely allied to vehicle fuel efficiency is the question of \nthe fuels that we will need in the future to power cars and trucks. \nHere, the Congress has a clear duty to address the growing multiplicity \nof fuel specifications around the country. Part of the solution to this \nproblem will be provided by a bill in the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, sponsored by Senators Smith and Reid. I hope that these \nprovisions find their way into our overall energy bill in the Senate.\n  The Chairman's mark will include a number of energy efficiency \nprovisions relating to appliances. Perhaps the most visible proposal in \nthis regard will be one that enacts a 13 Seasonal Energy Efficiency \nRating for central air-conditioning units. Such a standard was \nfinalized earlier this year, but since then the Bush Administration has \nattempted to withdraw it and substitute a lesser standard. The \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources held hearings on this topic \nand the record before the committee has persuaded me that the \nadministration based its decision on economic information that was \noutdated and inaccurate.\n  A 13 SEER rating for central air-conditioning units can do a lot to \nhelp avoid summer blackouts and brownouts when high temperatures send \nelectricity demand soaring. During the intense heat wave we had in \nearly August, which was felt nationwide, peak demand from air-\nconditioning did, in fact, lead to problems in electricity availability \nin some parts of the country, while others were uncomfortably close to \nthe margin. We need to build more efficiency into this part of our \nsystem over the long term, and a higher standard for these large air-\nconditioning units will help.\n  The Chairman's mark will also require the Federal government to \npurchase Energy Star or other efficient products designated by the \nFederal Energy Management Program. This is a requirement that, again, \nmakes eminent sense. Taxpayers save money, and the cost of energy-\nefficient appliances to consumers comes down, when the Federal \ngovernment takes a leadership role in purchasing highly energy \nefficient computers, office machines, and other appliances.\n  The mark also authorizes a grant program to help build energy-\nefficient schools. School districts can ill afford to waste taxpayer \nfunds on excessive energy bills because of the inefficiency of school \nbuildings.\n  With respect to new energy sources, it is important that the Senate \nlook to policies that will truly improve our supplies of domestic \nenergy security, including measures to improve our supply of natural \ngas and to diversify our energy mix to include a greater reliance on \ndomestic renewable resources. These are the types of provisions that I \nwill include in the Chairman's mark.\n  I will not be including in the mark any provisions relating to \ndrilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The debate \nover oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--a long-\nstanding bone of contention in energy policy--is in many ways a \ndistraction from more important opportunities to bolster our domestic \nenergy security. Oil produced from the arctic refuge is not likely to \ninfluence the world price of oil, or the prices that U.S. consumers pay \nfor gasoline. I plan to focus attention in the Energy Committee mark-up \non a number of issues that will have a greater impact on our domestic \nproduction of oil and gas and a larger near-term impact than drilling \nin the Arctic.\n  The first such issue is another Arctic resource that could be brought \nto U.S. markets--natural gas. The exploration for oil in the Prudhoe \nBay region of Alaska has resulted in the discovery of abundant supplies \nof natural gas, but there is now no way to bring that gas to markets in \nthe lower 48 States that could benefit from it. The projection of \ngrowing demand for natural gas has re-awakened interest in building a \npipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Alberta, Canada, where it would join with \nexisting gas pipelines that serve the United States. That pipeline \nwould be an enormous construction project on the part of the private \nsector, requiring perhaps 2,000 miles of steel pipe and costing $20 \nbillion. A lot of spurious job numbers have been floated about drilling \nin the Arctic Refuge. The gas pipeline would be the real thing as far \nas job creation is concerned.\n  If we do not act while there is substantial private-sector interest \nin building the Arctic gas pipeline, we will lose an important \nopportunity to bolster our national energy security in natural gas. If \nwe do not bring the Alaska gas to market, then our growing demand for \ngas will be met by large-scale import of liquefied natural gas. At $3 \nor less per million BTU, imported LNG will be cheaper than Alaska gas. \nBut it would be foolhardy to look at the issue solely through the prism \nof short-term economics. We are already more than 50 percent dependent \non foreign oil. If we do nothing about the Arctic gas, we could wind up \nbeing similarly dependent on foreign natural gas, from many of the same \nOPEC countries from which we import oil. That is an economic and \nnational security issue.\n  We face a clear moment of decision. The Chairman's mark that I will \nbring before the Committee will contain authorizing provisions to \nstreamline the\n\n[[Page S9158]]\n\nregulatory approval process to move forward with the pipeline. We may \nfind a mechanism to ensure that the domestic option for a pipeline \nroute is chosen. I hope to be able to work with my colleague from \nAlaska during the mark-up to help make that happen.\n  The second key initiative for domestic production is to undertake a \ntop-to-bottom review of both federal and State royalty and tax policy \non domestic oil and gas production. Our current policies were put in \nplace when the U.S. had abundant and easily accessible reserves. We \nhave fewer such reserves now, and while technology for finding oil has \ncontinued to improve, we should consider whether the financial \nstructure we have in place should change to one that enhances the \neconomics of exploring for oil and gas in more challenging geological \nformations. It should also take into account the boom-and-bust nature \nof the industry, and provide incentives to maintain domestic production \nwhen prices are low.\n  The third proposal is to provide adequate funding for the federal \nprograms that actually make new leases for oil and gas available to \ndomestic producers. For all the rhetoric from the administration about \nthe need to boost production, it has not asked for enough money in \norder to bring this about. The result is likely to be further delays \nand frustration on the part of U.S. oil and gas producers. In the mark \nthat I will present to the committee, we will authorize a higher level \nof funding for the necessary personnel to make the decisions and to \nprocess applications for domestic production.\n\n  The area of electricity, as I mentioned earlier in these remarks, is \nthe next major topic that we will take up in the markup. We do need to \nprovide for reliable and diverse electric power generation and \ndistribution sources in the country. Electricity is a central part of \nmodern life. Yet our electric system largely operates on a design that \nis nearly a century old. There are many problems in our electricity \nmarkets that need to be addressed. The problems faced by California and \nthe West earlier this year should be a wakeup call to all of us.\n  What the electricity crisis in California showed is that the \ninstitutions that developed in the last century have not evolved enough \nto ensure reliable and affordable supplies of electricity. We face a \ncrucial turning point. During the next few years, billions of dollars \nof investment will be planned and committed to electric generation and \ntransmission. Those investments will have a 30- to 50-year lifespan. \nWill we put in place a structure to maximize the chances that \ninvestments will go to new technologies that will give consumers real \nchoices over their energy use or will Congress, by its inaction, \nperpetuate obsolete frameworks for managing electricity markets, with \nthe result that we wind up with little improvement in the status quo?\n  I believe that we in Congress and the President have a great \nopportunity to be visionary about the future of electricity. A \ntransmission grid that is open to a wide variety of generation options, \nincluding distributed generation, will ensure the power quality and \nefficiency that our 21st century society will need in order to sustain \nour economic prosperity.\n  That opportunity creates a great duty on the part of Congress and the \nPresident to focus on electricity as a major part of comprehensive \nenergy legislation. Our task must be to build a regulatory structure \nthat has adequate authority to resolve market defects, without \ninterfering unduly in those markets.\n  I believe we need to move forward now with a legislative solution to \nthese problems. To leave electricity legislation for another day would \nbe to perpetuate an obsolete system that will not provide the \nreliability, quality, affordability, and choice that consumers will \nwant and need.\n  The changes that I believe are needed, and that we are going to be \ntrying to address in the chairman's mark, include the following:\n  First, we will try to clarify who has jurisdiction over regulating \nelectricity transmission in interstate commerce. That is a key part of \nwhat the legislation will do. That role is assigned to the Federal \nenergy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. FERC will be given authority to \nensure that all electric transmitting organizations in interstate \ncommerce play by a consistent set of fair rules.\n\n  Second, the chairman's mark will give FERC the responsibility for \ntaking the current voluntary system for promoting reliability in \nelectric transmission and making adherence to reliability rules \nmandatory.\n  Third, the chairman's mark will give the FERC the tools to ensure \nthat competitive markets work well to provide customers with affordable \nelectricity.\n  Fourth, the chairman's mark will address the tough issue of siting \nnew transmission facilities. This is something the President has \nindicated his support for. A national transmission grid is a necessity, \nbut cannot occur without a new approach to transmission planning, \nexpansion, and siting. Federal eminent domain, by itself, is not likely \nto lead to an effective approach to meeting this need. What is needed \nis to use federal eminent domain as a backstop to a more cooperative, \nregionally based approach to transmission and siting issues. Thus, the \nchairman's mark will rely on regional transmission organizations to do \nthe bulk of transmission planning, expansion and siting. Only if those \nregional entities are stymied will a federal eminent domain authority \nbe invoked, and that authority will be used only to implement the \ndecisions taken regionally.\n  The chairman's mark will include a repeal of the 1935 Public Utility \nHolding Company Act, or PUHCA, but the protections in that act will be \nreplaced by giving FERC jurisdiction over mergers of holding companies \nthat own utilities and over acquisitions of generation assets.\n  Finally, the chairman's mark will ensure that there is transparent \ninformation on market transactions.\n  As part of a balanced and comprehensive legislative solution, the \nchairman's mark also includes numerous benefits and protections for \nconsumers, so that we don't repeat the mistakes of telecommunications \nderegulation. These include an emphasis on ensuring future access by \nrural, remote, and Indian communities to electricity; protection of \nconsumers from unfair trade practices; and a Public Benefits Fund to \nensure that there is a way to fund electricity programs in the public \ninterest.\n  The chairman's mark also includes a series of provisions to ensure \nthat we have a greater role in our electricity generating system of the \nfuture for renewables and distributed generation, while maintaining the \ncontribution made by existing sources of baseload generation, such as \nhydropower and nuclear. Among the important tools for making sure we \nhave diversity in our sources of electricity is a renewable portfolio \nstandard, uniform interconnection standards to the electric grid, \ngreater flexibility and predictability to the process of relicensing \nhydroelectric dams, and a reauthorization of parts of the Price-\nAnderson Act.\n  Finally, a common thread among may of the provisions that I have \nmentioned in this chamber today and that we will be considering in the \nbill is perhaps the most important public policy challenges of the 21st \ncentury, and that is climate change. Climate change policy and energy \npolicy are inseparably linked, because energy production and the use of \nenergy are leading sources of greenhouse gases that affect the \natmosphere. The Senate must ensure that the energy legislation it \npasses makes a meaningful, positive contribution to dealing with this \nissue. Many of the provisions that I have already discussed--energy \nefficiency, the focus on more renewables--make a contribution to this \ngoal. The mark that we will be considering in committee will contain \nsome additional provisions to promote better information and policy on \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  Energy policy is a difficult and complex topic. Getting to a solution \nthat gives America a vibrant energy infrastructure and the right \npolicies for the 21st century will require careful work on complicated \nissues. Our Nation's future economic prosperity, and the jobs of \nmillions of Americans, are at stake. I hope that the approach taken in \nthe Senate combines a thoughtful analysis of our current energy \nchallenges with a willingness to take some bold policy steps to address \nthose challenges. That certainly is the spirit in which I will be \nmaking proposals before the committee.\n\n[[Page S9159]]\n\n  I look forward to working with all my colleagues in the Senate to \nproduce constructive legislation for the future of our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards).

Mr. President, earlier today we welcomed to the historic \nHouse Chamber President Vicente Fox, the President of Mexico. At this \nmoment, President Bush and President Fox are in my home State of Ohio. \nThey traveled to Toledo, OH, making several visits there. So we welcome \nboth Presidents to our home State.\n  As an opposition candidate, President Fox's election and inauguration \nlast year overturned 71 years of one-party rule in Mexico, one-party \nrule domination of the executive branch by the Institutional \nRevolutionary Party, PRI. That election made history. And today, with \nhis Presidency, and with President Bush in office, we are continuing to \nmake history, as our nations have the unprecedented opportunity to \nimplement positive changes and to create lasting progress for our \nentire hemisphere.\n  I say to my colleagues, it is important that we not squander this \nopportunity, that we not squander this chance. Because of Mexico's \ncritical importance to our Nation and our hemisphere, it was not at all \nsurprising that President Bush chose to travel to Mexico for his first \nofficial foreign trip as President.\n  This week we welcome President Fox to our country. These historic \nmeetings demonstrate the vital nature of our relationship with Mexico \nand the importance of bilateral cooperation.\n  I commend both leaders on their ongoing commitment to hemispheric \npartnership, and look forward to even greater cooperation stemming from \nthis week's meetings.\n  No one can deny the importance of our involvement with Mexico--our \nneighbor--a nation with which we share an over 2,000-mile common \nborder.\n  Additionally, over 21 million Americans living in this country are of \nMexican heritage; that is 67 percent, two-thirds of our total U.S.-\nHispanic population. Indeed, many people and many issues bind our \nnations together. It is in the interest of both Mexico and the United \nStates that we make that bond even stronger.\n  That is why we want to see President Fox succeed. He is off to a good \nstart.\n  President Fox's election was received as a positive step in Mexico's \nmaturing economy and has fueled new investment in the country, raising \nexpectations for better economic opportunities for the Mexican people. \nAt the same time, Mr. Fox also has raised expectations here in \nWashington for better opportunities to improve U.S.-Mexico bilateral \ncooperation on a wide range of issues.\n  As an advocate of free trade in the Americas, Mr. Fox recognizes that \na strong, steady economy in Mexico can be the foundation to help solve \nmany of our shared challenges and advance our mutual interests.\n  I am confident that President Fox's visit to the United States will \nadvance our growing and strengthening partnership and that both leaders \nwill engage in constructive dialog to promote cooperation, enhance the \nsecurity and prosperity of both nations, and enable each country to \nestablish mutually agreed-upon goals in at least four areas: First, \neconomic development and trade; two, the environment; three, \nimmigration; and four, law enforcement and counterdrug policy.\n  In each of these four areas, both countries should seek to implement \nrealistic and practical steps that will build confidence in our \npartnership and help set the stage for continued discussions and \nfurther progress.\n  A good demonstration of our relationship's success is the economic \ncooperation spearheaded by the North American Free Trade Agreement, \nNAFTA.\n  Thanks to this partnership, trade between the United States and \nMexico now amounts to over $250 billion annually, making our neighbor \nto the south now our second largest trading partner behind Canada.\n  In the last decade, U.S. exports to Mexico have increased over 200 \npercent, and today 85 percent of Mexico's entire exports go to the \nUnited States. However, progress in our partnership cannot occur absent \ncontinued progress in Mexico's economy.\n  Although Mexico is in its fifth consecutive year of recovery \nfollowing the 1994-1995 peso crisis, improved living standards and \neconomic opportunities have not been felt nationwide in Mexico. In \nfact, as could be expected, the slowdown in the U.S. economy has also \nhad an impact on Mexico. Lack of jobs and depressed wages are \nparticularly acute in the interior of the country, once you get away \nfrom the U.S.-Mexican border in the north. That is even true in \nPresident Fox's home state of Guanajuato.\n  As long as enormous disparities in wages and living conditions exist \nbetween Mexico and the United States, our Nation will simply not fully \nrealize the potential of Mexico as an export market, nor will we be \nable to deal adequately with the resulting problems that come about \nbecause of that poor economy, because of that great disparity in wealth \nthat brings about illegal immigration, border crime, drug trafficking, \nand other problems.\n  In keeping with the market-oriented approach that we started with \nNAFTA, the United States can take a number of constructive steps to \ncontinue economic progress in Mexico and secure its support for a free \ntrade agreement with the Americas, which is something that clearly this \nadministration and this Congress must push.\n\n  First, we can bring to Mexico the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation, a loan program that also assists U.S. small business \ninvestments in many other countries.\n  Second, we can encourage entrepreneurship in Mexico through increased \nU.S. funding of microcredit and microenterprise programs, which will \nencourage small business development.\n  Third, we should expand the mandate of the North American Development \nBank beyond the current situation where it only extends to the U.S.-\nMexico border.\n  This bank has been a successful source of private-public financing of \ninfrastructure projects along our borders. Extending its authority \ninland not only would bring good jobs into the interior of Mexico but \nalso would help to develop and further nationalize a transportation and \neconomic infrastructure.\n  Continued investments in the NADBank also would facilitate greater \nenvironmental cooperation between the United States and Mexico through \nprojects geared toward advancing the environmental goals and objectives \nset forth in NAFTA and also would enhance the overall protection of \nU.S. and Mexican natural resources.\n  Both nations need to pursue a joint immigration policy that takes \ninto account the realities of the economic conditions of our countries. \nAt a minimum, President Bush should continue to evaluate the temporary \nvisa program for unskilled workers, which has proven burdensome for \nU.S. farmers and small business men and women. Any liberalization of \nthis program should be linked to concrete programs to reduce illegal \nimmigration into the United States. This is not going to be an easy \nissue. We have heard discussion from President Fox and President Bush \nover the last several days about this. Many Members of Congress have \nvery strong opinions about it. I believe it is important for us to deal \nwith this issue in a practical and rational way.\n  Additionally, in a quick and simple fix, the administration should \neliminate the annual cap on the number of visas issued to Mexican \nbusiness executives who enter the United States. Currently, the cap \nstands at 5,500. And under current law, it will be phased out in the \nyear 2004. The United States does not have such a cap for Canada. \nRepealing the cap now would send a very positive signal to President \nFox and to the Mexican people about their nation's value to us as an \neconomic partner.\n  Further, it is important for the United States to be seen as a \npartner and resource, as President Fox undertakes his pledge to reform \nMexico's entire judicial system.\n  I have had the opportunity, as I know many Members of the Senate \nhave, to travel to Mexico and see the problems,\n\n[[Page S9160]]\n\nthe inherent problems, historic problems, problems of long standing in \nregard to the police and the judicial system. It was very insightful \nand important that today, when President Fox spoke to the Congress, he \ntalked about the need for judicial reform. This is an area where, \nfrankly, for all the problems of this country, we do it very well.\n  We have the ability to help Mexico. We have the ability to help them \nin this area. We should continue to do so.\n  With the law enforcement system in Mexico plagued with inherent \ncorruption and institutional and financial deterioration, President Fox \nwill face numerous challenges.\n  It is in our interest to help Mr. Fox in his quest, if needed, \nwhether it be through financial or technical assistance. It is in our \nown interest in the United States that Mexico succeed in this reform \nbecause our country cannot reverse effectively the flow of drugs across \nour common border without the full cooperation and support of our \nMexican law enforcement friends. The relationship between our law \nenforcement--our DEA, FBI, Border Patrol, and their counterparts in \nMexico--is so very important. I have watched this over the years, and \nthat relationship has been problematic. But I will say this: I believe \nit is improving. I believe clearly President Vicente Fox has made this \na top priority of his administration. It will not be easy, but we can \nhelp.\n  The issues that impact the United States and Mexico are numerous. It \nis not going to be easy to resolve these problems. All are important, \nand each is, in a sense, interrelated with the other. Together they \npresent an enormous task for the Presidents of both countries. Perhaps \nmost important, they are evidence of the enormous importance of Mexico \nto the future prosperity and security of our country, as well as our \nentire hemisphere.\n  I commend President Bush and President Fox for the many advancements \nthey have achieved so far. I encourage them to continue this \ncooperation and this effort. Together, our nations can, in this \nhistoric time, redefine the United States-Mexican relationship and \nprotect and promote prosperity throughout our shared hemisphere.\n  In conclusion, President Fox mentioned a topic which has been debated \non this floor many times and which we have taken up and looked at, and \nwe have thought a lot about it; that is, the drug certification process \nthat we go through as a country every year, where we basically say how \nwell other countries are doing in their antidrug effort and whether \nthey are cooperating with the United States. I think the time is here \nfor us to re-evaluate our law. I think the time is here for us to put a \ntemporary moratorium on this certification process. I think it will \nhelp our relationship with Mexico. I think it would help our \nrelationship with other countries. I think the time is appropriate to \ndo this.\n  Mexico has a new President. Mexico has a President who has stated \nthat one of his main objectives is the reform of the judicial system, \nto do away with the corruption in the judiciary, to do away with the \nproblems they have had in the law enforcement realm. So I think the \ntime is right. If we are ever going to do this, the time is right to do \nit. I don't think we have a great deal to lose. The current system has \nnot worked very well. It has not accomplished a great deal. So I think \nthe time is ripe now for us to put a temporary moratorium on the \ncertification process.\n  President Fox, throughout his speech, talked about trust. I think \nthat is the right word. We have to have trust between our two \ncountries. That does not mean we are not going to have disputes. It \ndoesn't mean we are not going to have problems. It doesn't mean these \nproblems are going to be easy to resolve. We know they are not--the \nimmigration problem and the drug problem, just to name a few. We know \nthey are not easy.\n  I think the right tone was set in today's speech by President Fox.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are entering the period where we make a \nfew last minute comments before the 4 o'clock vote regarding the Export \nAdministration Act, a process we have been working on for 3 years, a \nlaw that expired in 1994, and we have had 12 attempts at change since \nthat time. The last time the law was revised, people were wearing bell \nbottoms and polyester suits and Jimmy Carter was in office.\n  It has been time for a change and recognition of that. I ask \nunanimous consent a letter from the National Association of \nManufacturers endorsing the bill and recognizing the need for this be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                Manufacturers,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 2001.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I am writing on behalf of the 14,000 \n     member companies of the National Association of Manufacturers \n     (NAM) to seek your active support for the passage of S. 149, \n     the Export Administration Act of 2001, without inappropriate \n     amendments that would upset the careful balance in the \n     legislation.\n       NAM member companies are some of the leading exporters of \n     high-technology products, including computers, \n     telecommunications equipment semiconductors, chemicals and \n     aerospace equipment. The Export Administration Act, which \n     establishes broad-ranging exports controls on dual-use \n     products and technologies, will have a direct impact on their \n     business activities in countries around the world.\n       Our companies take seriously their obligation to protect \n     national security. They devote substantial resources to \n     maintaining internal compliance programs and keeping up to \n     date on the latest export control regulations. In an \n     increasingly competitive global economy, however, Congress \n     should not require excessively burdensome controls that hurt \n     U.S. industry but do little, if anything to enhance national \n     security.\n       The NAM supports S. 149, as reported by the Banking \n     Committee, because it provides a good balance between U.S. \n     national security and global trade interests. The bill has \n     strong bipartisan support, having been approved by the \n     Banking Committee on a vote of 19 to 1. President Bush has \n     endorsed S. 149, as reported, and his national security \n     advisor has indicated repeatedly that the Administration \n     opposes amendments which would upset the careful balance \n     achieved in the Banking Committee bill.\n       I strongly urge you to play a leadership role in supporting \n     passage of S. 149 and opposing inappropriate amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jerry Jasmowski,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent a letter received from many of the \ncomputer folks, including Dell Computer, IBM Corporation, Intel, \nHewlett-Packard, NCR, Motorola, and Unisys, pointing out the need for \nthis legislation, and the fact they are happy with it, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                September 5, 2001.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As the Senate begins debate on S. 149, the \n     Export Administration Act of 2001, we strongly urge you to \n     support the bill as it was reported out 19-1 by the Senate \n     Banking Committee and to oppose all restrictive amendments \n     during its floor consideration. Passage of S. 149 will \n     represent an important step forward in the development of an \n     export control system that more effectively accounts for \n     modern developments in technology and international market \n     conditions, while protecting national security.\n       S. 149 enjoys broad, bipartisan support in Congress, as \n     well as the endorsement of President Bush and his national \n     security team, which opposes amendments that would upset the \n     careful balance achieved in the Banking Committee bill.\n       Among S. 149's many provisions is one of critical \n     importance to the U.S. computer industry. Section 702(k) \n     would eliminate those provisions in the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for 1998 that lock the President into using \n     a specific metric, known as MTOPS (millions of theoretical \n     operations per second), to establish export control \n     thresholds for computers. Section 702(k) would not eliminate \n     current restrictions on computer exports, but would give the \n     President the authority and flexibility needed to review the \n     MTOPS control system and develop a more modern, effective \n     framework\n\n[[Page S9161]]\n\n     for computer exports. The need for Presidential flexibility \n     in this area is especially clear in light of recent reports \n     by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the \n     Department of Defense, the Henry Stimson Center, the General \n     Accounting Office, and the Defense Science Board, which have \n     all concluded that the MTOPS-based approach is obsolete and \n     fails to advance U.S. national security.\n       The U.S. computer industry needs new export control \n     policies that take into account the global, technological and \n     economic realities of the 21st century. As a result, we urge \n     you to support S. 149, as reported, and oppose any amendments \n     that would delay the implementation of the important reforms \n     contained in the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n         Michael S. Dell, Dell Computer; Louis V. Gerstner, Jr., \n           IBM Corporation; Andy Grove, Intel Corporation; \n           Carleton Florina, Hewlett-Packard; Michael Capellas, \n           Compaq Computer; Christopher B. Galvin, Motorola; Lars \n           Nyberg, NCR Corporation; Lawrence Weinbach, Unisys \n           Corporation.\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

We were \n     disappointed that you were only able to agree to at most four \n     of the eighteen issues we identified, and were unable to \n     agree to some issues on which we believed we had previously \n     reached agreement in principle. Accordingly, we cannot agree \n     at this time to return the bill to the Senate floor under the \n     terms of the unanimous consent agreement field on March 8.\n       ``There are important issues remaining to be resolved, and \n     we feel that negotiations should continue in order to for \n     there being hope for achieving an Export Administration Act \n     that successfully balances the needs of industry and national \n     security.''\n       Week of March 27-31: Gramm/Enzi staff do not hear from \n     other senators' staff.\n       Week of April 3: Gramm/Enzi staff do not hear from other \n     senators' staff.\n       Tuesday, April 4: Senator McCain holds hearing on S. 1712, \n     at which he expresses concern that the bill does not \n     adequately protect national security; Senators Thompson and \n     Enzi testify.\n       Tuesday, April 11: Gramm staff call the staff of other \n     senators to alert them that Senator Lott planned to make a \n     pro forma effort to bring up S. 1712 by UC on Wednesday, at \n     which point Senator Gramm would object pursuant to the \n     gentleman's agreement made with the other senators on March \n     8; and that Senators Lott and Gramm then would file cloture \n     on a motion to proceed to S. 1712.\n       Wednesday, April 12: At Senator Lott's requests, Senators \n     Gramm and Enzi give Senator Lott two cloture petitions (one \n     on a motion to proceed to S. 1712, and one on S. 1712); both \n     were signed by 16 Republicans representing a broad diversity \n     of states and of Senate Committees (including SASC, SFRC, \n     SGAC, and SCST).\n       Wednesday, April 12: Senator Thompson holds SGAC hearing on \n     multilateral export controls.\n       April, May: Gramm/Enzi staff do not hear from other \n     senators' staff.\n       Thursday, May 25: Senators Thompson and Torricelli hold a \n     press conference on S. 2645. According to press reports, \n     Senator Thompson said that in his opinion, legislation to \n     reauthorize the Export Administration Act is probably dead as \n     a stand-alone measure in 2000; when asked whether he was \n     partly responsible, he replied ``Let's just say that truth \n     and justice were served''.\n       Friday, May 26: Senator Thompson holds SGAC hearing on mass \n     market/foreign availability; no Administration witnesses are \n     invited.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I will make a few remarks after the vote particularly to \nthank Senator Sarbanes for his understanding of the bill.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Sarbanes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute for the proponent and 4 minutes for \nthe opponent.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I will take the 1 minute at this point. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation. It has been hard work. We think \nit is good, balanced legislation. I join with Senator Enzi in thanking \nthe staff: Steve Harris, Marty Gruenberg, and Laurie Better of my \nstaff; Katherine McGuire has done a wonderful job; and Joel Oswald and \nKara Calvert of Senator Enzi's staff; Naomi Camper and Paul Nash of \nSenator Johnson's staff; and Wayne Abernathy and Amy Dunathan from \nSenator Gramm's staff. I thank Senator Gramm. We worked very closely on \nthis bill. I pay tribute to Senator Enzi and Senator Johnson who worked \ntogether so assiduously, so skillfully, in helping to develop and \nevolve this legislation.\n  I would be less than fair if I did not take a moment to say to \nSenator Enzi I think his dedication in working this legislation through \nand his very strong commitment and willingness to talk to everyone at \ngreat length, over and over and over again, contributed significantly \nto shaping legislation that we are finally going to be able to move \nthrough the Senate, with a very sizable consensus.\n  I say to the opponents, I think we engaged this in a proper Senate \nfashion in terms of our debate and our efforts to respond to some \nconcerns. We consulted with everyone--the administration, of course, \nperhaps first and foremost. My own view is we have brought together a \ngood package. I urge my colleagues to support it when we go to the vote \nat 4 o'clock.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes unless any of \nmy colleagues appear and want part of that.\n  I, too, think congratulations are in order. Senator Enzi has worked \nso hard on this bill, Senator Gramm and Senator Sarbanes have taken the \nmatter of leadership in this area, and Senator Johnson did an excellent \njob in shepherding it through over a long period of time. It has taken \na long time primarily because some Members have seen to it that it took \na longer period of time than it otherwise would have.\n  I still must respectfully oppose this bill. This bill is going to \npass by a large margin. I understand that. The business community is \nstrongly behind it. The administration supports it. The majority of \nboth sides of the aisle support it. I believe they are in error. I \nbelieve it is a mistake. I think we should recognize exactly what we \nare doing. I will say it one more time; that is, in an era of increased \ntechnological proliferation, with the world becoming a more dangerous \nplace, where rogue nations are developing technology that will enable \nthem to endanger this country and a world where these rogue nations are \ngetting their technology from countries such as China and Russia, for \nwhich this bill will liberalize export trade, in this environment, in \nthis era, we are loosening our export controls.\n  At a time when we know that some of those to whom we will be sending \nmore high-tech sensitive exports have in times past used them for \nmilitary purposes, and that committees such as the Cox committee have \nreported to us that part of their increased capabilities have come \nabout due to our lax export laws, this is the environment in which we \npass a bill that gives the Department of Commerce substantial powers to \nmake decisions concerning national security. The Department of Commerce \nis rightfully engaged in the considerations of trade and commerce. They \nshould not be given the responsibility of national security.\n\n[[Page S9163]]\n\n  We are going to pass a bill that will have broad categories of \nsubjects that are deemed to be mass marketed or have foreign \navailability status. If someone over in the bowels of the Department of \nCommerce decides these items belong in those categories, then they are \ntaken out of the regulatory process altogether, and you don't even have \nto have a license.\n  I do not think it is too much to ask for a few days of a license \nprocess with officials of the U.S. Government who are concerned about \nmatters of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and matters of \nnational security, it is not too much to ask that they be given a few \ndays to make sure, as in times past, that we are not exporting \nsomething we should not be exporting. We give the President some \noverride authority, but it is almost as if to say, ``Catch me if you \ncan.'' We are greatly liberalizing things on this end and giving the \nPresident some power--which cannot be delegated, incidentally--giving \nthe President some power to catch something here and there and stop it \nif he deems it necessary.\n  At a time that we are trying to persuade the world we need a missile \ndefense system, which I believe we need because of the dangers posed by \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, we are liberalizing \nexport rules which I fear will contribute toward the ability of the \ncountries with which we are trading, and in turn these rogue nations \nwith which they are trading, to increase their weapons of mass \ndestruction capabilities.\n  It is not that we want to hamper trade. It is not that we want to be \nobstructionist--because our friends on the other side of this issue are \nvery well-meaning and make very good points. It is not those factors at \nall that motivate the few of us who remain on this side. It is that we \ncan afford to be wrong. If our concerns are too great, it will mean \nthat a few companies are held up a few extra days before they can \nexport goods. But if our friends on the other side of this issue are \nwrong, I fear it could cause serious harm.\n  We are doing this in an environment where, even though the law has \nrequired us in times past to do a national security assessment of the \ndecontrol of these laws, we have never done so. That is the basis of \nour concern. That is why, although we have had a wonderful, \nresponsible, senatorial debate and discussion and vote, both on the \nfloor and off, and think it has produced a better bill than we had \noriginally, I must respectfully oppose it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the bill pass?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Johnson). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 85, nays 14, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 275 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--85\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--14\n\n     Byrd\n     Cochran\n     DeWine\n     Feingold\n     Helms\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     McCain\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Specter\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Murkowski\n       \n  The bill (S. 149) was passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 149\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, what I would like to do is take some time, \nbecause I did not have an opportunity just before the vote, to thank \nall the people who worked on and participated in this bill that we have \njust completed, and that includes the people who are both for the bill \nand against the bill. Everybody made a contribution on this one.\n  As I mentioned before, all 100 Senators are interested in national \nsecurity--deeply interested, deathly interested in national security. \nThat has been demonstrated by the work that has been put in on this \nbill. They are also extremely interested that the economy of the \ncountry advance. We just passed a bill that will allow both of those \nthings to happen, and happen safely.\n  We have been without the kind of a bill that we have needed for a \nlong period of time. We just passed one that is considerably better \nthan what we had in place, and is even better than the 1979 act when it \nwas extended. So we are in a position now where we can go, with some \nreal credibility, to the House side to ask them to move the bill \nforward and to join with the White House in getting this passed \nquickly, as the White House asked. And, of course, we will be asking \nfor all the people who have an interest in this bill to also help work \non the House side. We know they will take quick action and that we will \nget this huge problem to the United States solved.\n  I would like to particularly thank those people who have worked \nclosely on the bill. I will start with Senator Gramm, who allowed me to \nbe the subcommittee chairman and get this assignment.\n  I have to tell you, when I first got the assignment, I thought, this \nhas failed about 12 times so I assume this is one of those tasks that \nfreshman Senators get. I didn't expect much to happen on it, but we \nbegan the process of learning about it, and the Cox commission report \ncame out. Of course, it was just a secret report at first, but it still \ngot publicity that brought to the attention of the American people the \nproblem of secrets being stolen from the United States.\n  That raised the level of this bill so that I and Senator Johnson of \nSouth Dakota could work through our subcommittee to really find out \nwhat was happening with it, to see how those things in the Cox \ncommission and other reports, as they came out, fit into this bill. We \nput them into that bill, worked together to find solutions, met--\n``interminably'' might not be the right word, but it feels like the \nright word sometimes--with a number of groups and anybody who was \ninterested in the bill and worked hard to heighten the interest of \nthose people in the bill.\n  Fortunately, Senator Johnson and I got to work under the direction of \nSenator Gramm and Senator Sarbanes, two vastly different personalities \nwith different ways of working. I have to say that working under those \ntwo people on any piece of legislation is an education. They are very \nconsiderate in everything they do. They both study it to a very deep \nknowledge. They ask penetrating questions, and they have that ability \nand sense of when to move forward and when to hold back. Particularly \nwhen you have the combination of Senator Sarbanes and Senator Gramm, \nyou have these two personalities that cover all aspects of the spectrum \nof dealing with people.\n  Of course, with both of them, you have vast years of knowledge of \ndoing this kind of work, which is different than any other job I think \nanybody can have.\n  They recognize the ways to work with people and the mechanisms to do \nit and have just been tremendous in guidance as we have gone through \nthis.\n  I would be real remiss if I did not place some special thanks on all \nof the staff people who worked on this. Again, staff do a lot of the \npreparation, a lot of the study. They do meetings among themselves and \nthen bring the results of those meetings to us for resolution. There \nwere some real experts involved in this, people who really know how to \nnetwork. And I would be surprised if there has been any other bill that \nhad the kind of trust between staff and between Senators that this bill \nhas had.\n  We worked on it for a long time. Of course, that built up the trust \nas we slowly got to the point where we had a draft to put through.\n  During that time, we did find out that it was an issue that affected \neverybody in the country. So then, of course, it affects both sides of \nthe aisle. This is one of those examples of bipartisan effort. It \nresults in a bipartisan vote and gives us some real strength as we \ncontinue this process.\n  Again, I thank my fellow Senator, Mr. Johnson, for his efforts on \nthis bill and all of the different presentations we had to give over \nthe course of time to different groups as we got them to buy in. \nEverybody had to come to the middle on this one because previous \nefforts had gone too far in one direction or the other. As a result, it \npicked up a majority in opposition.\n  One thing about passing a bill is that to pass it, you have to get it \nthrough all of the different steps. A ``no'' vote at any one of those \nsteps kind of stops it dead in its tracks and sends you back to ground \nzero.\n\n  We are at the halfway point on this one now. We have gotten it \nthrough several votes successfully. It is much easier sometimes to \ncreate confusion and pick up the votes on the other side. I appreciate \nthe Senators who helped to promote and to clarify this. Again, the \nclarification came from both sides.\n  Senator Thompson and Senator Kyl particularly are to be congratulated \nfor their tenacity at bringing up different points. You will find on \nthe list of meetings that we put in that a lot of those meetings were \nwith those two individuals. And as I mentioned numerous times, we put \nin 59 changes. One of the biggest changes, of course, is the override \nthat the President has. We gave a trump to the President on everything \nin the bill.\n  We put in some new sections, and we said that the President has the \nright to set those aside in specific instances. It makes a huge \ndifference in how this bill will work. It really will allow the limited \nresources that we have--and we are increasing those resources, but they \nare still limited--to concentrate on the worst situations and to make \nthem better. That is what we are trying to achieve with the bill.\n  I would also like to thank the Majority Leader, Senator Daschle, for \nhis strong support and willingness to bring the bill to the floor for \ndebate. Senator Reid was also instrumental in negotiating the bill to \nthe floor for debate. His support and guidance was very much \nappreciated.\n  Again, I thank everybody who worked on the bill. I particularly \nappreciate all of the hours Senator Sarbanes has spent on the floor \nthis week, not only in debate, in clarifying things, which showed his \nvast depth of knowledge of the bill, but particularly with the \nadministrative work he did as he helped to get people together who \nneeded to talk about different parts of this bill. His steady hand \ncertainly played a big role in the kind of vote we received.\n  I again thank everybody who worked on the bill and congratulate \neverybody who worked on the bill. That is both those who were for and \nthose who were against. We will see everybody on the House side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield for that purpose.\n\n[[Page S9182]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator \nfrom California, Mrs. Feinstein, are going to seek recognition. I ask \nunanimous consent that I be recognized in morning business for 15 \nminutes following their presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCONNELL and Mrs. FEINSTEIN pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1409 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a brief statement?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Daschle, there will be \nno more votes tonight. The majority leader indicated in the morning he \nis going to move forward on some legislation. It is not for sure what \nit is. We are hopeful we will move to an appropriations bill. Senator \nDaschle has an important meeting tonight to see if that can be done. \nSenator Daschle asked I advise everyone there is a possibility of votes \nin the morning. Everyone should be prepared in that regard. There will \nbe no more votes tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with respect to the announcement by my \ncolleague from Nevada, I am a bit confused what is happening in the \nSenate. We have the month of September to finish our appropriations \nbills. We have had no conferences on any appropriations bill at this \npoint. We have 13 of them to do. We have a very short period of time in \nwhich to finish the work of the appropriations committees in the House \nand the Senate.\n  It is inexplicable to me that we are at this moment at 5 o'clock in \nthe afternoon unable to go to another appropriations bill. They are \nready to come to the floor. We are being blocked. There are objections \nto the motion to proceed to an appropriations bill. It makes no sense \nto me. This Senate must do its work and pass the appropriations bills. \nIt will have to be sooner or later. It is much better if it is sooner. \nThis is the work of the American people passing appropriations bills \nthat contain the money for essentially the operation of Government. We \nhave so much work to do and so little time in which to get it done.\n  The appropriations bills and the question of whether this fiscal \npolicy adds up is very important for everyone. This town and, in ways, \nthe country are asking a lot of questions these days about a softening \neconomy, a surplus that used to exist that has now largely vanished, \nand a fiscal policy that was put in place when it was expected there \nwould be nothing but surpluses as far as the eye could see that now \ndoes not add up at all.\n  I want to show a quote on a chart from Mr. Mitch Daniels, the head of \nthe Office of Management and Budget in a statement he made on Sunday on \n``Meet the Press'' because it is central to this question about fiscal \npolicy. What are the resources? How many resources do we have? How do \nwe use those resources? Mr. Daniels says we have the second largest \nsurplus in the history of the country. We are ``awash in cash,'' he \nsays. But, of course, what he is talking about is the Social Security \ntrust fund and the money in the trust fund.\n\n  There used to be $125 billion expected above that, which indeed is a \nsurplus, but that is now gone. That has evaporated. What is left \nbelongs to the Social Security trust fund. When he says we are ``awash \nin cash,'' he is talking about Social Security trust fund moneys. Mr. \nRussert, the moderator of ``Meet the Press,'' said:\n\n       The surplus is money that you got through payroll taxes, \n     which are designated towards Social Security. And to tap into \n     that is a violation of what George Bush pledged during the \n     campaign.\n\n  To which Mr. Daniels replied:\n\n       Well, it's not designated for Social Security, Tim.\n\n  It is not designated for Social Security. That is from the head of \nthe Office of Management and Budget from this administration who says \nthat the trust funds are not in the trust fund. The taxes that come out \nof all the workers' paychecks in this country, called Social Security \ntaxes, that are put into a dedicated trust fund, we are told now by the \nhead of the Office of Management and Budget that this money is not \ndesignated for Social Security.\n  He could not be more wrong or more unsuited for that job if he really \nbelieves that. It is possible this is a mistake. It is not a mistake in \ntranscription. That is what he said, but it is possible he misspoke. If \nhe did, let's hear that. If he did not misspeak, if this is what he \nbelieves, he is sadly mistaken.\n  This is a big, big issue. This is a $162 billion issue in this year \nalone. It is a half-a-trillion-dollar issue in the next 5 years. It is \nessential to the construct of a fiscal policy that works to understand \nthat this money does not belong to them; it does not belong to the \nGovernment; it belongs to the American workers. They paid it. It is \ntheir taxes, and they were told it was going to go into a trust fund.\n  The message ought to be: Keep your hands off those trust funds.\n  All of us face difficulty as a result of a softening economy. I am \nnot here pointing fingers at who is to blame and who is not to blame. \nThe fact is, we have had an economy that always has had a business \ncycle: an expansion side and a contraction side. Nobody has ever \nchanged that.\n  We suffered a contraction. We went through a period when everybody \nthought the stock market would always go up and never go down. That is \nnot the case. We went through a period when everybody thought there was \none way the economy moves: upward, steadily, relentlessly.\n  Now they are experiencing what we learned in economics. I actually \ntaught economics for a while, and I have overcome that, as I often say. \nWe taught the business cycle. The business cycle is inevitable. There \nis an expansion and a contraction. It all has to do with people's \nconfidence in the future. Sometimes there is more confidence and \nsometimes less confidence.\n  The point is, we all now inherit this economy that has softened. It \nis incumbent on us all to get together and work together; that the \nPresident and the Congress understand the plan that existed before, \nanticipating surpluses forever, is a plan that now does not add up. It \nis desperately short of the resources to do that which the President \nwants to do. It would make good sense, in my judgment, for the \nPresident to join us in an economic summit of sorts to work through a \nnew plan that represents an understanding that there is a new reality \nto this economy and the numbers in the current plan do not add up.\n\n  Let's create a plan together that makes sense for the American \npeople, one that invests in the American people's future and one that \ntries to provide the stimulus and incentive to help promote confidence \nand start this economy, once again, on an upward trend. That is what we \nhave a responsibility to do.\n  Fingers that are pointed mean very little at this point. We are all \nin this ship of state together. It is not as if there is an engine room \nwith dials, knobs, gauges, and levers so that if we can just get Alan \nGreenspan, or someone in charge of fiscal policies, to move these \ngauges and levers just right so the ship of state will move. That is \nnot the way the economic engine behaves.\n  This ship of state moves forward and the economy grows when people \nhave confidence in the future. The American people, the bond markets, \nand stock markets do not have confidence in a fiscal plan they know \ndoes not add up. That is why it is important for the President to \nrecognize that reality and work with us to construct a new plan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/06/senate-section/article/S9182-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9182-S9184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INTERNATIONAL TRADE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to speak about a \ndifferent subject, international trade. I will do it briefly because I \nunderstand my colleague, Senator Byrd, wishes to address the Senate. I \ncertainly do not want to disadvantage him. If my colleague, Senator \nByrd, will indulge me for a few more minutes, I want to make a comment \nabout international trade.\n  Mr. BYRD. Please.\n\n[[Page S9183]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague, as always, is gracious, and \nI deeply appreciate that.\n  Congress Daily today says:\n\n       Vote on trade negotiating authority suffers another delay.\n\n  This is a story about the House of Representatives deciding to delay \na vote on what we normally call fast track. They have delayed it \nbecause the Speaker of the House says they need time to get all their \n``ducks in a row.''\n  I simply point out to those who are working to get their ``ducks in a \nrow'' in the House of Representatives to pass fast track trade \nauthority, that when it comes to the Senate, there are not going to be \nducks in a row to pass fast track trade authority for our President.\n  I would not support it for President Clinton and I will not support \nit for this President, and I want to explain why. I believe a band of \nSenators who feel as passionately as I do about our trade policy \nbelieve it is not only undemocratic to cede to someone else the ability \nto go to negotiated trade agreements with the promise that no Senator \nhas the opportunity to offer a change to that agreement when it comes \nto the floor of the Senate. But I also want to explain why I think \nthose who have negotiated our trade agreements are not entitled to be \ngiven a blank check for trade negotiation authority by this Congress.\n  Let me give a couple of examples to describe why. Here is what has \nhappened to our merchandise trade deficit. It has ballooned from $132 \nbillion in 1993 to $449 billion last year. It is exploding. We are \nexporting manufacturing jobs at a rapid pace, and this is a trade debt \nthat we must repay in the future with a lower standard of living in the \nUnited States. This is serious. It is trouble and we must get it under \ncontrol.\n  We have had a trade deficit with Mexico. Let us look at what has \nhappened with Mexico. In 1993, we passed the North American Free Trade \nAgreement. Before the agreement, we had small deficits with Mexico, $5 \nbillion, and then $2 billion or $3 billion. Then, a few years before \nthe agreement, we had a surplus with Mexico.\n  What has happened since NAFTA was passed? We are drowning in red ink \nwith the country of Mexico.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, of course, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. What are those figures representing our drowning?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Their the current accounts deficit. With Mexico alone, it \nis over $30 billion a year. In fact, our aggregate merchandise trade \ndeficit is over a billion and a quarter a day, every single day. It is \nmany trade partners including Japan, China, Canada, Mexico and Europe. \nIt's a huge growing dangerous debt.\n  How does all of this happen? Let me give a few examples. Vehicles in \nKorea. In 2000, Korea shipped 570,000 vehicles to the United States of \nAmerica. How many vehicles did we produce and ship to Korea? Only \n1,700.\n  Is it because we do not make automobiles? No, that is not the reason. \nIt is because if Ford makes a car and ships it to Korea, by the time it \ngets through all of their taxes, tariffs and other obstructions, it \ncosts thousands more than it ought to cost. Therefore the Koreans do \nnot buy it.\n  First of all, one has trouble getting it, but if they get it in the \ncountry they do not buy it because it is thousands more than it should \nbe. So the result is our automobile trade with Korea is extremely \nunbalanced. They send us 570,000 vehicles a year and we send them \n1,700. That is vehicles to Korea.\n  How about T-bone steak to Tokyo, beef to Japan? Do my colleagues know \nthat every single pound of American beef we send to Japan has a 38.5 \npercent tariff on it, every single pound? To buy a T-bone steak in \nTokyo is very expensive. Do you know why? Because they restrict the \namount of beef coming in. We reached a beef agreement with Japan and \nour negotiators celebrated it. Twelve years later we still have a 38.5 \npercent tariff on every single pound of beef going to Japan. T-bones to \nTokyo, that is unfair trade; cars from Korea. How about high-fructose \ncorn syrup to Mexico? Here they levy the equivalent of a 43 percent to \n73 percent tariff on corn syrup, despite being in violation of NAFTA. \nOr how about durum wheat to this country from Canada? Fundamentally \nunfair trade. There are millions of bushels coming across in 18-wheel \ntrucks. The Canadians have a monopoly that would be illegal in this \ncountry called the Canadian Wheat Board. They ship wheat to this \ncountry at secret prices. When we say to them, ``open up your \nrecords,'' they simply thumb their nose at us and say, ``We do not \nintend to shed one bit of light on this. We do not intend to share any \ndata with you at all.'' That is the way trade is.\n\n  So I say to those in the House who are getting their ducks in a row \nto pass fast track trade authority, ``Well, go ahead and get your ducks \nin a row. But you should understand that ducks are not going to be in a \nrow when that gets to the U.S. Senate.''\n  I did not believe President Clinton ought to have this authority, and \nhe did not get it. I do not believe this President ought to have this \nauthority, and, in my judgment, he is not going to get it.\n  The first step, and I have said this to the Commerce Secretary: ``Do \nyou want to talk about fast track? I will tell you what you ought to \nfast track. Why don't you put on the fast track a few trade \nsolutions.'' I say to the trade negotiator and others, ``Get some good \nnegotiators. Fit them with jerseys, just like we do with the Olympics. \nMake sure the jerseys have a big ``USA'' on the front so that \noccasionally our negotiators can look down at their chests and see who \nthey are representing and for whom they are negotiating.'' Send them \nover to the negotiating table and say, ``Stand up for this country's \ninterests.''\n  Do not build walls and keep things out of here. But our negotiators \nneed to say, ``We expect fair trade.'' We expect them to stand up for \nthis country's interests. Stand up for the American worker. Stand up \nfor American business. Stand up for American products. We are sick and \ntired of unfair trade bargains that put us in a sea of red ink and put \nour employees and businesses at a disadvantage.\n  That is true with Japan. It is true with China. I have not spoken \nabout China. I should, but out of respect for my colleague who is \nwaiting to speak, I will do that at a later time.\n  Japan, China, Korea, Canada, Mexico, Europe. This country is drowning \nin a sea of red ink, in international trade deficits, and it ought to \nstop. I will not be a part of a Senate that is going to try to give \nfast track authority to a President.\n  There will be a group of Senators who believe, as I do, that it is \nworth the passion, energy, and time to see that the priority in this \ncountry, and the priority in trade policy, is not to grant fast track \nauthority to the Administration so they can go off and negotiate new \ntrade agreements. Rather, we need to get some people who know how to \nnegotiate solutions to the problems in the old trade agreements.\n  Let us fix the problems they have already created instead of running \noff and trying to create new trade agreements. This is especially true \nwhen we have this trade deficit that is becoming an albatross around \nthe neck of our children. A trade deficit that will and must be repaid. \nOne that must be repaid with a lower standard of living in this \ncountry. That is why it is important now to solve this problem. It will \nnot be solved by more trade if it is unfair.\n  I am for expanded trade. I am for more trade. I am for all the things \nthat people want to do to engage around the world in commerce, but I \ndemand on behalf of this country, and on behalf of American workers and \nbusinesses, that trade agreements be fair to America for a change.\n\n  Trade agreements with Japan, China, and others have been negotiated \nin an incompetent way. You can put a blindfold on. It does not matter \nwhether it is Republicans or Democrats in office.\n  Will Rogers once said the United States of America has never lost a \nwar and never won a conference. He certainly must have been thinking \nabout our trade negotiators. We can do a whole lot better than that.\n  My point very simply is, on fast track, get your ducks in the row in \nthe House, but understand when it gets to the Senate it is not going \nany further. There are plenty of us who are going to see that fast \ntrack is not passed in the U.S. Senate.\n\n[[Page S9184]]\n\n  Yes, we are for trade, but we are for fair trade. It is time to \ninsist on fair trade and get rid of these ballooning trade deficits.\n  Let me thank my colleague, Senator Byrd, from West Virginia. He is, \nas is always the case, most gracious to allow me to continue beyond the \ntime allotted.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield briefly?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Sign me up. Sign me up as one of those who will stand with \nthe Senator to defeat fast track. We have seen too many American jobs \ntake a fast track out of this country. We have seen what happened to \npottery in my State. We have seen what happened to glass, what happened \nto leather goods, what has happened to textiles, what is happening to \nsteel, what is happening to chemicals.\n  I will be with my colleague. I am opposed to fast track. I am for \nfree trade but fair trade.\n  Next year will be my 50th year in Congress, and I see one \nadministration after another, Republican and Democrat, go down this \nsame fast track, and I am tired of it. I have been against it. I do not \nstand here today and propose we ought to deliberate on putting a duty \non every toothbrush or every fiddle or fiddle string or every paint \nbrush that comes into this country, but there are a few major questions \nthat we should be allowed to debate and offer amendments on when that \nmeasure comes before the Senate. What's wrong with that? I wouldn't \nmind, half a dozen, six, three, but why should we go along with our \neyes closed and continue to join in this fast track of American jobs \nand American industries across the seas?\n\n  Getting our ducks in a row, we have become sitting ducks. These are \nthe ducks that our forefathers gave us to put in a row. Section 8, \narticle I, the U.S. Constitution:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power to regulate Commerce with \n     foreign Nations, and among the several States * * *\n\n  It doesn't say anything about getting our ducks in a row. It doesn't \nsay anything about fast track. It doesn't say anything about binding \nand gagging ourselves when it comes to trade legislation. It says the \nCongress shall have power to regulate commerce.\n  Let's exercise that power. Let's exercise our rights as Members of \nthe Senate, elected by a free people. Count me, register me, make me a \nfirst lieutenant in the ranks. I am ready. I volunteer.\n  I thank the Senator for his contributions. I thank him very much for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  Is the Senate in a period for morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Are there any limitations?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each Senator is restricted to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent to speak for not to exceed 45 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/06/senate-section/article/S9184-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9184-S9187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        U.S. IMMIGRATION POLICY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the inscription on the base of the Statue \nof Liberty that has welcomed immigrants for generations can be found in \nthe poem, ``The New Colossus,'' by Emma Lazarus:\n\n     Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,\n     With conquering limbs astride from land to land;\n     Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand\n     A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame\n     Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name\n     Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand\n     Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command\n     The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.\n     ``Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!'' cries she\n     With silent lips. ``Give me your tired, your poor,\n     Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n     The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\n     Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,\n     I lift my lamp beside the golden door!''\n\n  The United States has a proud history of welcoming immigrants fleeing \nreligious persecution, political oppression, and economic hardship. My \nown forebear on my father's side came to these shores in 1657, settled \non the banks of the Rappahannock River where all--with the exception of \npossibly one in this Chamber--are children, grandchildren, great-\ngrandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren of immigrants. The \nmagnanimous promise of a better life that is inscribed in the base of \nthe Statue of Liberty has deep roots in both the American mind and \nAmerican law. George Washington captured that promise in his dictum two \ncenturies ago that the United States should be ``a country which may \nafford an asylum, if we are wise enough to pursue the paths which lead \nto virtue and happiness, to the oppressed and needy of the Earth.''\n\n  I understand the American dream that has lured immigrants here for \nmore than 200 years. I have a son-in-law who is an immigrant from Iran. \nHe is a physicist. I have a grandson who is married to an immigrant \nfrom Korea. My own State of West Virginia has benefitted from the many \ncontributions made by our foreign-born citizens. West Virginia's coal \nminer population in the early part of the 20th Century reads like a \nUnited Nations roster: British--English, Welch, Scottish--Irish, \nItalian, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Swedish, Austrian, Russian, Greek, \nSyrian, Romanian, German, Polish, Slavic, and on and on.\n  In recent months, this administration has been working with its \nMexican counterparts to craft a new immigration policy that would, \namong other things, legalize three to four million undocumented Mexican \nimmigrants now working in the United States.\n  According to the latest numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau, \nimmigrants now comprise about 11 percent of the total U.S. population. \nThat is about 30 million immigrants living in the United States--13 \nmillion to 14 million of whom arrived just in the last 10 years.\n  These numbers are quite extraordinary because they suggest that at \nleast 1.3 million immigrants are settling in the United States each \nyear. That is more than arrived during the last great wave of \nimmigration between 1900 and 1910, when about 850,000 people entered \nthe country each year.\n  In addition to their arrival in the United States, during the 1990's, \nimmigrant women gave birth to an estimated 6.9 million children. If we \nadd together the number of births to immigrants and the number of new \narrivals, immigration during the 1990's led to the addition of 20 \nmillion--or two-thirds of the nearly 30 million people who populated \nthe United States over the last 10 years.\n  If current trends continue, according to the Census Bureau's middle-\nrange projections, the U.S. population will grow from 280 million to \n404 million people by 2050, with immigration accounting for about 63 \npercent of that growth. That means the number of new immigrants \nentering this country over the next 50 years, about 78 million \nimmigrants, will be roughly equal to 43 times the current population of \nWest Virginia.\n  As I have said, many of these immigrants will contribute to the \neconomic, cultural, and political development of the United States. \nBut, let us not forget, let us not be unmindful of the fact that there \nwill also be real costs associated with this population increase. Many \nof these new citizens will come in search of access to quality health \ncare services. Yet too many of our Nation's 5,000 emergency rooms are \nalready operating at critical capacity.\n  Go over to Fairfax Hospital. I just had my wife of 64 years over to \nthat hospital twice within the last 6 weeks. And I took her both \ntimes--once through a call to 911. You will be amazed at what you see. \nThe hospitals are overcrowded.\n  According to the LA Times, at many of the nation's hospitals, \n``ambulances are being turned away and patients are stacked in the \nhallways.'' If we are to accept these new citizens, it is clear that we \nwill have to spend billions of taxpayer dollars to expand our health \ncare infrastructure.\n  This Nation also has the responsibility to provide a quality public \neducation to its citizens. Yet, the Department of Education recently \nreported that the number of children in public schools has grown by \nnearly 8 million in the last two decades. This growth has strained the \nresources of many\n\n[[Page S9185]]\n\nschool districts, resulting in overcrowded classrooms and overgrown \nschools where discipline is difficult if not almost impossible, and \nindividual attention is nearly impossible.\n  These are questions we ought to think about. We need to think about \nthese things.\n  In 2000, there were about 8 million school-age children--ages 5 to \n17--of immigrants who had arrived since 1970, according to the Center \nfor Immigration Studies. This is roughly equal to the total growth in \nelementary and secondary school enrollment over the last 20 years. If \nwe invite more immigrants into our public school system, we must \nconsider the absorption capacity of American public education. This \nmeans that we will have to spend billions of taxpayer dollars to expand \nour public education infrastructure. The current infrastructure is \nbeing strained to the hilt.\n  We also have a responsibility to ensure that these new citizens, at \nthe very least, have access to the resources to become proficient in \nthe English language. The Census Bureau recently reported that nearly \none in five Americans does not speak English at home. Among Spanish \nspeakers, only half the adults described themselves as speaking English \nwell, and only two-thirds of the school-age children in Spanish-\nspeaking homes described themselves as speaking English very well. If \nwe accept these potential citizens, we have an obligation to help \nensure that they can assimilate themselves into our society.\n\n  Population growth will also continue to cause more and more land to \nbe developed. Both past experience and common sense strongly suggest \nthat population growth of this kind has important implications for the \npreservation of farm land, open space, and the overall quality of life \nthroughout our country. A nation simply cannot add nearly 120 million \npeople to its population without having to develop a great deal of \nundeveloped land.\n  There are also environmental concerns that must be considered. A \ngrowing nation requires increasing amounts of energy and greater \nrecovery of natural resources, which results in larger output of \npollution in our streams and greater accumulations of solid waste in \nour landfills.\n  Our resources, as never before, are limited. For all the talk we have \nheard in recent months from the administration about liberalizing our \nimmigration laws, the President has not made any suggestions--I haven't \nheard them if he has made any--about how to pay for the additional \ninfrastructure investments that will be required.\n  Just look around you. The infrastructure is being asked to bear far \nmore than the traffic will bear. Look at our schools. Look at our \nhospitals. Look at our welfare programs.\n  Does the Administration want to increase taxes to support these \nnewcomers? We have been cutting taxes. How much of our limited \nresources is the administration willing to sacrifice? At what price are \nwe willing to accept all of these new immigrants?\n  These are the questions that our immigration policy needs to address \nif we are to offer a higher standard of living and a better life to the \nimmigrants that our nation accepts. Instead, the American public is \nwitnessing an immigration debate unfold that threatens to move this \nnation's immigration laws in exactly the wrong direction.\n  Today the President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, in addressing a joint \nsession of Congress, spoke about the need to regularize the flow of \nmigrant workers between the United States and Mexico. The Bush \nAdministration contends that we can regularize this migrant flow \nthrough a new ``temporary worker'' program.\n  I assure you, that there is nothing new about ``temporary worker'' \nprograms and the amnesties that usually accompany them. In fact, these \nkinds of proposals have become a frightenly familiar routine in recent \nyears that have contradicted our immigration laws and sent exactly the \nwrong message abroad.\n  In 1986, Congress granted an amnesty to 2.7 million illegal \nimmigrants, based on the promise that it would stem the tide of illegal \nimmigration when combined with a ban on the hiring of illegal \nimmigrants by employers. I supported that proposal, although it later \nproved to be a false promise. Illegal immigration increased \ndramatically.\n  More recently, there have been efforts by Congress to pass the so-\ncalled 245(i) status adjustment, which would allow illegals--for a \n$1,000 fee--to waive the requirement that would force them to leave the \ncountry and effectively bars them from reentering the United States for \nup to 10 years.\n  This kind of legislation, in particular, flies right in the face--\nright in the face of the Congress' recent efforts to stop the flow of \nillegal immigrants. The section 245(i) provision nullifies those \nmeasures passed by the Congress that would punish immigrants who enter \nthis country illegally.\n\n  Not only is this legislation unfair to every immigrant--both present \nand past--who waited to legally enter this country, but it sends the \nmessage abroad that as long as you can gather together enough money, \nyou can circumvent our laws whenever they prove to be inconvenient.\n  State and local governments have not done much better at discouraging \nillegal immigration. Many States are making it easier for undocumented \nimmigrants to apply for a driver's license, government health care \nbenefits, and lower state college tuition. None of these initiatives \nwill act as a deterrent to illegal immigration.\n  Let us continue to have legal immigration. Let us not offer \nattractions to illegal immigration.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimates that there are \nabout 6 million illegal aliens living in the United States, a number \nwhich increases by more than 200,000 per year. And these numbers are \nbased on 1997 population statistics. Once the Census 2000 population \nstatistics are available, immigration experts expect this number to \nincrease to somewhere between 8.5 million illegals and 13 million \nillegals. That's double the estimated number of illegals in 1986.\n  The number of amnesties that have been proposed in recent years, and \nthe corresponding rise in illegal immigrants, suggests that something \nis seriously wrong with this country's immigration laws. It suggests \nthat the basic framework either doesn't work or that we are not serious \nabout enforcing it.\n  I am amazed at the political support for these amnesty proposals. As \nI say, I voted for them. I was misled.\n  Both political parties--Republican and Democrat--support broader \nimmigration rules.\n  But no one is talking about the additional costs to the American \ntaxpayers. Not one is talking about the strain on our natural and \nfinancial resources.\n  Building a political base is no reason to encourage illegal \nimmigration, nor is building up union membership, nor is importing \ncheaper labor to replace U.S. workers. We must not glibly rush forward \non immigration policy without adequate thought about unintended \nconsequences, tangential ramifications or adequate public education and \ndebate. Whether this rush to loosen our enforcement of immigration laws \nis due to jockeying for political advantage as cynics might contend, or \nsimply an outgrowth of commendable altruistic urges on the part of our \nnation's political system, we need to step back, slow down and take a \nserious look at our immigration policies.\n  I well understand that there are segments of the American economy \nwhich profit greatly by the labors of illegal immigrants. I well \nunderstand the human sorrows endured by immigrant families who cannot \nearn an adequate living in their native land, and so must send a wage \nearner across the border to work and establish a foot hold for future \ngenerations. My experience growing up in the coal fields during the \nyears of the Great Depression was not too far afield from the immigrant \nexperience of today. I know extreme poverty. I know what it is to start \nout life with the bottom rungs of life's ladder missing. I remember \nbeing at the mercy of the coal company employer in the coalfields. I \nunderstand the stigma of being undereducated, poor, and without the \nbottom rungs in the ladder. I understand that. That is why I am so \nconcerned about the direction of our immigration policy of today.\n  I believe that not enough thought has been given and not enough \nquestions have been asked. I question the sincerity of our rush to \nappease. Are we really acting in the best interests of the Mexican \nimmigrants or of our own citizens?\n\n[[Page S9186]]\n\n  I have lived 84 years and one lesson that I have learned in my years \nof observation and service is that the most precious commodity in \npublic policy is that of honesty--intellectual honesty.\n  I hope that this rush to further relax our immigration laws is not \njust a competition for political advantage, but I fear that that is in \nfact the driving force. If I am right, and ``votes ripe for plucking'' \nis driving the altruistic claims of both parties, I urge that we draw \nback and face the ugly possibility of unintended exploitation of \nforeign workers as the outcome of political jockeying for the Hispanic \nvote.\n  In the first place there is no easily identifiable ``Hispanic vote.'' \nCuban peoples, Mexican peoples, and other Latin peoples who may have \nimmigrated to the United States have radically different political \nviews and decidedly different priorities. In the second place hispanic \npeoples who have resided in the United States for some years often \ndeplore the laxer rules which allow new immigrants easier access to \nU.S. shores, and resent the unfortunate image which newer immigrants \nmay project. The Hispanic votes is not a monolith and it is an \ninsulting, shallow proposition to portray all people's of Latin descent \nas such.\n  Then there is the question of honesty again. Are we not skating \ndangerously close to falsehood when we politicians pretend that we can \nhandle these vast numbers of future immigrants in any sort of decent \nand humane way? Anyone even vaguely familiar with the health care \nsystem in this nation knows that it is inadequate to service our \npresent population and becoming more inadequate each day. Go visit the \nhospitals in the area. How can we pretend that we can address even the \nmost mundane health care needs of these new immigrants?\n  We read about those needs in the newspapers--in the Washington Post \nand the Washington Times. The stories are frequent in those newspapers \nabout the health needs, about the poverty, and about education \nshortcomings. We are so stretched now that we cannot handle the present \nload. Our infrastructure just simply can't handle it.\n  How can we pretend that our overcrowded, underachieving school system \ncan possibly deal with thousands of new immigrant children and come \neven close to preparing them to cope with the competitive job market in \nAmerica today.\n  We are not being intellectually honest. We are not being honest with \nthe legal immigrants who are already in this country. We are not being \nhonest with these people.\n  We are not being honest with ourselves.\n  We can't assure these children an adequate education, and that is the \ntruth. Are we consigning these children to a sort of permanent \nunderclass when we fail to give them basic tools with which they can \nachieve? The truth is, our American infrastructure--both physical and \nhuman resource related--is 20 years behind, and falling further behind \nwith each passing year.\n  From everything to inadequate roads and transportation, to a health \ncare system that assists fewer and fewer people, to an education system \nthat fails to impart either discipline or knowledge, we need to face \nthe fact that our resources are limited. It is a sad yet very true fact \nthat we must all face. And we ought to think about it. I think these \nare proper questions to ask. We are no longer a land of unlimited \npossibilities because we no longer provide the basics which allow the \npeople to flourish. We have disinvested in our own Nation. We have \ndisinvested in our own people. The cupboard is not bare, but its \ncontents are decidedly skimpy, and it is a grave disservice to invite \nthe neighbors to a sumptuous feast at our house when we know that there \nis nothing left in the cupboard, nothing to serve but poke greens and \nsalads that are cut from the hillside.\n\n  We risk turning a blind eye to the needs of our own Nation in future \nyears when we try to absorb huge, huge numbers of underskilled, \nuninsured, undereducated immigrants without a cogent plan for handling \ntheir needs and fostering their eventual assimilation into our own \nsociety.\n  We must not rush to appease the demands of our friends to the south \nof our border without stopping to contemplate the consequences. \nPresident Fox of Mexico has the responsibility of delivering on his \npromise to the Mexican people of more jobs and a stronger economy. He \ncannot look solely to the United States to solve his economic and \npolitical problems.\n  We must also proceed with caution when we advocate policies that \ncircumvent the intent of our own immigration laws. Those laws are \npassed by the Congress of the United States and signed by a President \nof the United States. Those laws are intended to allow for the orderly \nabsorption of immigrant populations, and to prepare that population to \nbecome productive, participating English literate, United States \ncitizens.\n  I can tell you Madam President, as the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee in the Senate and as a member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee--as is the distinguished Presiding Officer at this moment--we \ndo not have the infrastructure in place to absorb the number of \nimmigrants to whom this administration is seeking to open our borders.\n  It would be nice, it would be good, if we were able to solve the \neconomic problems of other countries and provide a higher standard of \nliving for people around the world--but, we cannot. This is no longer \nthe late 19th century or the mid 18th century. Our resources are more \nlimited today than they were a hundred years ago.\n  The Congress already faces enormous challenges in stretching our ever \nshrinking financial resources--and they are ever shrinking. The \nCongress will have to appropriate the 13 annual appropriations bills \nthis year with less than adequate resources to finance our \ninfrastructure needs. I am opposed to the further erosion and draining \nof the limited resources that are available.\n  I did not vote for the tax cut. I vigorously opposed it. And my wife \nand I are returning our check. And as resources shrink, we run the risk \nof resentment, increasing resentment between those who are coming and \nthose who are here, and those are forces that we do not want to \nunleash.\n  We cannot be so generous that we strain our own resources to the \nbreaking point. And if we allow illegal Mexicans to come here, and to \nstay, what about illegal immigrants from elsewhere? How can we be fair \nto them if we do not treat them all alike? We cannot be so generous \nthat we strain our own resources to the breaking point.\n  It is time for us to think of the people of America, and their \nchildren and their grandchildren. We need a national debate. We do not \nneed something that can be rushed through on the consent calendar. We \nneed a national debate on our immigration policies. The people out \nthere must seriously ask the politicians, what are the answers to these \nquestions that are being asked? They are legitimate questions. What are \nthe answers?\n  We must seriously ask ourselves just how many more people our country \nwill be able to accommodate. This is not something, Madam President, \nthat should be rushed through Congress in 4 months or in 4 years, \nwithout adequate debate. These are questions that should be thoroughly \naired.\n  Whatever proposal the President sends to Congress, it should be \ndebated at length in the Senate. The American people must know what \ncosts they are being asked to absorb. They must know what sacrifices \nthey are being asked to make. And legal immigrants should be asking the \nsame questions. What are the sacrifices they are supposed to make on \nbehalf of illegal immigrants? Those immigrants who have waited \npatiently, knocking at the door, how do they feel about it? America is \na nation of immigrants. Our golden door should always be open to those \nwho seek refuge from oppression--``those huddled masses yearning to \nbreathe free.'' But we must not turn America's promise into a hollow \nshell. It is well to remember that illegal immigrants don't just break \nthe law when they come here. They undermine the earning power of \nAmerica's workforce by reducing wages for the U.S. workforce who do not \nhave high school diplomas.\n\n  Madam President, in 1939, John Steinbeck's epic novel, the ``Grapes \nof Wrath,'' was published. Its protagonists, the Joad family, traveled \nfrom the Midwest to California, not to make their fortunes but merely \nto survive as migrant workers. Through labor camps, hobo jungles, and \nruined farms westward to California, they faced a\n\n[[Page S9187]]\n\npeculiar kind of torment--the torment and isolation of hardship and \npoverty amid plenty. Let us proceed with caution--I say this to my \npolitical colleagues in this body, in the other body, and in the \nexecutive branch, and in the State legislatures, in the counties, in \nthe towns and communities, cities across this Nation--let us proceed \nwith caution, lest we turn America's sweet promise of a cornucopia to \nbitter grapes of wrath for us all, including our legal immigrants.\n\n  I yield the floor.

Some have suggested that the administration, for example, is \ngoing to abandon the ABM Treaty or is developing plans and asking for \nfunding in this year's appropriations bills to conduct tests and do \ndevelopment projects for missile defense which would violate the \nprovisions of the ABM Treaty.\n  It is clear from everything the President himself has said that he \nwould like to replace the ABM Treaty, after full discussions with \nRussian officials, allies, and friends around the world, with a new \nstrategic framework that more closely reflects the facts as they exist \nnow in the relationship we have with Russia.\n  The ABM Treaty was written, as we know, in 1972. It was written in an \natmosphere where the prevailing doctrine of national security was \nmutual assured destruction where we would actually have, as a matter of \nnational policy, a plan to annihilate or destroy cities with innocent \ncivilians in retaliation against a nuclear missile strike against the \nUnited States from the Soviet Union. And the mutual assured destruction \ndoctrine was very troubling in and of itself, but it was the only thing \nwe had. Deterrence was a way of life--and also a promise of a way of \ndeath in case someone decided to authorize a strike against the other. \nThis was an agreement that was entered into at a time when each side \nseemed to be intent on building new and more sophisticated and more \nlethal weapons systems targeted to military targets in the other's \nnation state.\n\n  But times have changed. The Soviet Union no longer exists. Even \nthough the Clinton administration attempted to negotiate a succession \nagreement, it has never been submitted to the Senate for ratification. \nThe succession agreement lists Russia, Belarus, and another nation \nstate as the successor states to the Soviet Union. Think about that. I \nam sure the Senate would discuss that very carefully and probably at \ngreat length, and whether or not the Senate would advise and consent \nand permit the ratification of that treaty, to permit it to go into \neffect and have the force and effect of law, is problematical.\n  But that is just one indication of how times have changed. The \nClinton administration continued to respect the ABM Treaty to the \nextent that it would not undertake testing of even theater missile \ndefense systems if the Russians objected. And in the discussions with \nour representatives in Geneva and elsewhere, talking on these subjects, \nit became clear that this country was going to be inhibited in its \ntesting programs of theater missile defense systems because of \nprovisions of the ABM Treaty.\n  By now, it ought to be very clear that there are threats to our \nsoldiers and sailors who are deployed around the world from these very \ntheater missile offensive systems that we saw Iraq use in the desert \nwar--in the war that we helped organize and wage against them to \nliberate Kuwait. Twenty-eight or twenty-nine members of a National \nGuard unit lost their lives in Dhahran as a result of a Scud missile \nattack.\n  We cannot tolerate being inhibited and subject to the approval of \nanother country to test and develop and deploy a system that would \nprotect soldiers in that circumstance in the future. We have already, \nas a matter of fact, developed follow-on systems to the Patriot system, \nwhich was the only thing we used to try to counter the Scud missile \nattacks. And we continue to upgrade and make progress in developing \nsystems that will offer the kind of protection against those missile \nattacks in the future. The PAC-3 program, for example, has had a \nsuccession of successful tests, using the hit-to-kill technology of a \ndefensive system.\n  There are other examples of theater missile programs. The Army's High \nAltitude Air Defense Systems--the acronym is THAAD. It sounds like my \nname is a system that offers protection against missile attack. But to \nhear some Senators and look at the authorization committee's mark right \nnow, you would think these theater systems were the same as the \nnational missile defense system. We saw reports in the paper that the \nchairman had presented the Armed Services Committee with a committee \nprint of a military authorization bill for the next fiscal year, and it \ncuts $1.3 billion out of missile defense. This is being described in \nthe newspapers, and by Senators, too, as a reduction in the amount of \nmoney that would be authorized for national missile defense.\n  When you look at the exact dollar amounts in the bill--and it is not \nnational missile defense--approximately $347 million is cut from the \nNavy theater-wide program in the chairman's mark, along with $210 \nmillion for the THAAD program and $80 million from the airborne laser \nprogram. These are not long-range missile programs. These are not \nmissile programs designed to counter intercontinental ballistic missile \nthreats to our country; these are designed to protect men and women in \nthe military service of the United States who are deployed all over the \nworld right now. And they are now under threats from the same kind of \nmissile weapons systems that were used by Iraq. Now they have been \nmodernized, we hear from our intelligence sources, and are more \naccurate and more reliable and more lethal than they were in the desert \nwar.\n\n  These programs should not be cut in the name of trying to restrict \nthe President from using funds that the Congress appropriates for \nnational missile defense. These are intermediate-range defensive \nsystems, the testing and deployment of which were not intended to be \ncovered by the ABM Treaty. And even though the Clinton administration \nwas negotiating with the Russians our rights to test in developing \nthese programs--to some degree at least--it is not the subject of the \nABM Treaty. The ABM Treaty wasn't designed to deal with these threats \nat all.\n  So what I am suggesting is that the Senate ought to be on early \nwarning that we are seeing an effort being developed here--at least in \nthe Armed Services Committee--to lay groundwork for restrictions on \nfunding, for restrictive language, which I understand is also included \nin the chairman's mark, which would more closely restrict the President \nand the Department of Defense in their effort to fully explore the use \nof technologies that would help defend our service men and women when \nthey are in harm's way around the world today.\n  There are some other programs that are cut in this bill that I \nunderstand are in the chairman's mark. One is the space-based infrared \nsystem, which will provide satellites to track missiles after launch--\n$97 billion is cut from that program.\n  So there is a pattern here of undermining the entire effort to \ndevelop our\n\n[[Page S9188]]\n\ndefenses to the capability they need to be to fully assure the security \ninterests of the United States. It doesn't have anything to do with the \nABM Treaty, in my view, but that is being used as an excuse to hold \nback these programs. The chairman's mark cuts $350 million from a \nprogram previously known as national missile defense, though in reality \nthe number is far higher, as the administration has sought to remove \nthe artificial barriers between the labels ``national'' and ``theater'' \nmissile defense.\n  The President is talking about missile defenses. We need to have an \naggressive, robust testing program so that we can fully understand how \nthese technologies can be harnessed to fully defend our country's \ninterests and protect the security of our Nation.\n  The chairman's mark even cuts funds that would be used for \ncooperative missile defense modeling and simulation with Russia. We are \nhearing a lot about trying to interact more in a positive way with \nRussia. Here is an example of a program that would give us an \nopportunity to do that more successfully, and that is proposed for \ncutbacks in the Armed Services Committee.\n  There are various legislative restrictions, one of which will provide \nthe Defense Department's missile activities can proceed only in \naccordance with the ABM Treaty.\n  That is redundant, isn't it? Or it suggests that the President is \nplanning to undertake something that is inconsistent with the treaty. \nHe has said he is not going to do that. He recognizes the treaty is an \nagreement that is legally binding. The President has said that.\n  He is hoping to replace the treaty after negotiations with the \nRussians with a new strategic framework, but everybody is pronouncing \nthat around here as dead on arrival. Give the President a chance at \nleast to discuss it fully with the Russians rather than rushing over \nand getting some Russian official to make some derogatory statement \nabout the process and then quoting it as if it is national policy in \nRussia.\n  We should give the negotiators a chance. That is what I am \nsuggesting. So writing a bill here that presumes the President is going \nto violate the ABM Treaty is not getting us off to a good start, \nparticularly if this sends a signal to the Russians: You do not have to \nworry about negotiating with the President of the United States in good \nfaith because the Senate is going to take over, the Senate is going to \nmake it impossible for the President to negotiate an agreement.\n  We should not undermine the President's capacity to negotiate a \nbetter agreement that will serve our national security interests in a \nmore effective way and replace an outdated, outmoded treaty, a cold war \nrelic, when we could, if we are successful under the President's \nleadership, negotiate a better agreement that more fully protects our \ncountry's national security interests. This kind of provision is \nneedless piling on, making it more and more difficult for our \nPresident. I hope the Armed Services Committee will look very carefully \nat these provisions.\n  There are a lot of other concerns that I have. I know there may be \nothers who want to discuss issues on other subjects of great national \nconcern, but they are talking about now in one other line of articles \nthat I have seen--and this was discussed in our Defense appropriations \nhearing yesterday by some Senators--the fact there was a quote in the \npaper from an administration official saying: We were not bothered by \nChina's buildup, the modernization of their nuclear weapons capability \nand whether they were going to do that or not would not have any effect \non our decisions with respect to missile defense programs.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld made it very clear at the hearing, responding to \none Senator's question, that neither he nor Secretary Powell nor Dr. \nCondoleezza Rice had made any statement of that kind, and they knew of \nno one in the Department of Defense or the Department of State or at \nthe White House who had said anything like that.\n  There is no quote attributed to any particular individual, but yet \nnot only the press have taken that and made stories out of it and \nrepeated them, but now Senators are repeating them as if it was a fact. \nThe fact is, China has been modernizing its military for years. They \ndid not just start a new generation of nuclear weapons or \nintercontinental ballistic missile technologies and systems after we \nbegan improving our missile defense capabilities. China is going to \nmake the decisions they make based on their own considerations of what \nis in their interests.\n  I am hopeful, of course, as everyone in this administration and in \nthis Congress, we will be able to have a stable and friendly \nrelationship based on mutual respect with China. Efforts are being made \nin discussions by the Secretary of State and many others with Chinese \nleaders in order to develop an understanding, trying to resolve \nproblems as they develop, and we know what they are.\n\n  The incident with the surveillance plane in the area presented its \nown special set of problems, but we worked our way through that with \ncalm and thoughtful leadership and decisionmaking by the President and \nhis Cabinet officials.\n  The whole point of this is, we can be a party to inciting the \npassions of those who worry about the capacity of our country's \nleadership to function to protect our security interests, and we can do \nmore harm than good by the things we say and the way we discuss these \nissues and the way we handle bills that come through this Senate.\n  We should take very seriously the provisions that are in the \nchairman's print of this authorization bill before the Armed Services \nCommittee, and all Senators ought to notice what is beginning as an \nofficial part of our legislative responsibility: an effort that is \nclear to undermine the President's leadership capacity in developing \nmissile defense systems that will protect our soldiers and sailors and \nthe security interests of our country.\n  Those who say he is going to abandon the ABM Treaty need to look at \nwhat the President said. He is trying to replace it with a new \nframework, a new agreement. I have suggested to some that we ought to \nconsider having a peace treaty as a replacement to the ABM Treaty. We \nare not at war with Russia any longer. They do not profess to be at war \nwith us. The cold war is over. When wars end, peace treaties are \nsigned. Let's sign a peace treaty with Russia. That would supplant the \nABM Treaty.\n  The ABM Treaty locks into law the doctrine of mutual assured \ndestruction. We do not want to destroy Russia. They should not want to \ndestroy us. So why perpetuate that doctrine with that treaty? Let's \nwork to develop a new framework that more clearly defines the real \nrelationship we have with Russia now.\n  That is what the President wants to do. Why can't the Senate join \nwith the President, applaud that initiative, support that effort, pass \nlegislation to fund the efforts to strengthen our military forces so we \ncan do the job of protecting the security of this country?\n  I am not going to suggest these are political games that are being \nplayed because I know there are serious differences of opinion on this \nand other issues that come before the Senate.\n  I am not questioning anybody's motives. I am just saying I hope \nSenators will take a careful look at the facts. As we proceed through \nthis process of authorization and appropriation for our defense needs, \nlet's try to work in harmony and unity as much as possible so we will \nnot create any misunderstandings in Russia, in China, or among \npotential adversaries out there, the so-called rogue states, that \ncontinue to acquire technology, that continue to acquire systems, \nmissiles, other means of developing intercontinental ballistic missile \ncapability.\n  It is a dangerous place out there, and we need to be sure we are \ndoing what we can do and ought to do to protect our security interests \nin this environment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/06/senate-section/article/S9188-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9188-S9189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DISPOSAL OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to share some news with my Senate \ncolleagues. And even though my subject involves radioactive waste, I'm \nmost pleased to report that this is all good news.\n  As a Nation, we haven't made great progress on disposal of \nradioactive wastes, Yucca Mountain was supposed\n\n[[Page S9189]]\n\nto open in 1998--now it might open in 2010 if it progresses at the most \noptimistic rate.\n  But in New Mexico, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in the city of \nCarlsbad opened for disposal operations in March of 1999. WIPP is the \nnation's first repository for the permanent disposal of defense-\ngenerated radioactive waste left from the research and production of \nnuclear weapons.\n  WIPP represents the single most dramatic advance this Nation has made \nin disposal of radioactive waste. In fact, WIPP is a showcase facility \nfor the entire world for demonstrating that mankind can safely remove \ncomplex wastes from any impact on our environment.\n  WIPP accepts a particular kind of waste, transuranic or TRU waste, \nthat is contaminated with certain elements, especially plutonium. This \ntype of waste must be handled with great care to ensure safety of the \npublic and workers. WIPP represents a cornerstone of DOE's national \ncleanup effort dealing with the nation's nuclear weapons complex. \nToday, I want to announce that WIPP has filled their first underground \nroom to full capacity.\n  This is no small achievement. That room now holds over 10,000 drums \nof TRU waste. The waste arrived in 352 shipments from five DOE sites--\nLos Alamos, Rocky Flats, Idaho, Hanford, and Savannah River. That \nrequired lots of transportation, in fact about one-third of a million \nmiles. And even with so many miles, equivalent to 13 trips around the \nearth, there were no accidents or even serious incidents. For those who \ndoubt that radioactive cargoes can be shipped safely, WIPP is proof \nthat a well-engineered transportation system can be operated to the \nhighest standards.\n  The team at WIPP isn't stopping to celebrate this milestone. As I \nspeak, they're busily accepting more waste. Earlierr this week, the \nshipment number was up to 373 and more then 11,000 drums had moved into \nthe facility.\n  In closing, I personally commend the Department of Energy, especially \nthe Carlsbad Field Office, for their careful attention to safe \noperations. The community of Carlsbad deserves tremendous praise for \ntheir consistent support of WIPP and its critical national mission. And \nboth the Environmental Protection Agency and the New Mexico Environment \nDepartment deserve compliments for their roles in oversight of this \nfacility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/06/senate-section/article/S9189-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

SHELTON 14TH CHAIRMAN OF JOINT CHIEFS AND A GREAT \n                            NORTH CAROLINIAN\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, North Carolina, down through history has \nbeen blessed with countless remarkable sons and daughters, and in my \njudgment, one of the truly great has been General Hugh H. Shelton, the \n14th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was confirmed by the \nSenate on October 1, 1997, and reconfirmed by the Senate for a second \n2-year term in 1999.\n  In this capacity, this great son of Eastern North Carolina served as \nthe principal military advisor to the President of the United States, \nthe Secretary of Defense, and the National Security Council.\n  Prior to becoming Chairman, General Shelton served as Commander in \nChief of the U.S. Special Operations Command.\n  The General was born in Tarboro, NC, in January 1942. He earned a \nbachelor of science degree from North Carolina State University and a \nmaster of science from Auburn University. His military education \nincludes attendance at the Air Command and Staff College in Montgomery, \nAL, and at the National War College at Fort McNair, Washington, DC.\n  He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the infantry in 1963 \nthrough the Reserve Officer Training Corps, and spent the next 24 years \nin a variety of command and staff positions in the continental United \nStates, Hawaii, and Vietnam. He served two tours in Vietnam--the first \nwith the 5th Special Forces Group, the second with the 173rd Airborne \nBrigade. He also commanded the 3rd Battalion, 60th Infantry in the 9th \nInfantry Division at Fort Lewis, WA; he served as the 9th Infantry \nDivision's assistant chief of staff for operation.\n  He then returned to North Carolina where he commanded the 1st Brigade \nof the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg; and then served as the \nChief of Staff of the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, NY.\n  Following his selection as brigadier general in 1987, General Shelton \nserved 2 years in the Operations Directorate of the Joint Staff. In \n1989, he began a 2-year assignment as Assistant Division Commander for \nOperations of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), a tour that \nincluded the Division's 7-month deployment to Saudi Arabia for \nOperations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.\n  Upon returning from the Gulf War, General Shelton was promoted to \nmajor general and again assigned to Fort Bragg where this time he \ncommanded the 82nd Airborne Division. In 1993, he was again promoted--\nto lieutenant general--and assumed command of the XVIII Airborne Corps.\n  In 1994, while serving as corps commander, General Shelton commanded \nthe Joint Task Force that conducted Operation Uphold Democracy in \nHaiti. In March 1996, he was promoted to general and became Commander \nin Chief of the U.S. Special Operations Command.\n\n  In his 4 years as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \nShelton worked tirelessly to improve the quality of life for military \nmembers and their families. He championed numerous initiatives \nincluding the largest across-the-board pay raise for the military in 18 \nyears--helping to narrow the civilian-military ``pay gaps.''\n  His push for pay table reform targeted greater increases for mid-\ngrade noncommissioned officers, and his retirement reform package \nreinstated benefits for those entering service after 1986, and, thanks \nto his dedication and support, an enhanced housing allowance was \nimplemented gradually to eliminate out of pocket expenses for service \nmembers living off post.\n  Chairman Shelton was a strong advocate of the effort to reform \nmedical health care, to make medical care more responsive--to include \nmilitary retirees over 65. He made great strides to improve the \nreadiness of the U.S. military by articulating a regiment for increased \ndefense spending. As a result, the Department of Defense realized a \n$112 billion increase in defense spending over the 5-year defense plan \nto arrest declining readiness rates. He additionally implemented new \nprocesses to carefully manage high demand/low density resources in \nsupport of the National Security Strategy.\n  Chairman Shelton and his staff published Joint Vision 2020 to \nestablish goals and the metrics for the future joint force; he \nestablished the U.S. Joint Forces Command as the proponent for Joint \nExperimentation and Joint Force readiness. He established Joint Task \nForce-Civil Support to increase the military's ability to respond to \ncrises in the U.S. homeland and established Joint Task Force-Computer \nNetwork Operations to enhance protection of U.S. information networks.\n  The General directed numerous initiative designed to improve the \ninteroperability of the four Services including a Joint Airfighting \nLogistics Initiative, development of a Global Information Grid, \nrevision of all Joint Professional Military Education programs and an \nenhancement on the joint warfighting focus of the Joint Requirements \nOversight Council.\n\n[[Page S9190]]\n\n  General Shelton's awards and decorations include the Defense \nDistinguished Service Medal (with two oak leaf clusters), Distinguished \nService Medal, Legion of Merit (with oak leaf cluster), Bronze Star \nMedal with V device (with three oak leaf clusters), and the Purple \nHeart.\n  He has also been awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge, Joint Chiefs \nof Staff Identification Badge, Master Parachutist Badge, Pathfinder \nBadge, Air Assault Badge, Military Freefall Badge, and Special Forces \nand Ranger Tabs and numerous foreign awards and badges.\n  Mrs. Shelton is the former Carolyn L. Johnson of Speed, NC, who was \nyoung Hugh Shelton's high school sweetheart. As Mrs. Hugh H. Shelton, \nshe has been actively involved with service issues and support to \nmilitary families throughout General Shelton's career. The General and \nMrs. Shelton have three sons: Jonathan, a special agent in the U.S. \nSecret Service; Jeffrey, a U.S. Army Special Operations soldier, and \nMark, their youngest son.\n  Mr. President, Dot Helms and I are proud to have General Shelton and \nCarolyn as our very special friends--and to be theirs. The General has \nrepresented the U.S. military with great distinction for the past four \nyears as its senior military officer.\n  This splendid North Carolinian has participated in policy-making at \nthe highest levels of Government but he never lost the common tough \nwith our men and women in uniform. He will be remembered as a soldier's \nsoldier and a quiet professional, along with his lovely wife and three \nsons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/06/senate-section/article/S9190-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF GENERAL MICHAEL E. RYAN\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor General Michael \nE. Ryan, the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force. General \nRyan is a great American and, more important, and I'm sure no surprise \nto my colleagues, he is a fellow Texan. General Ryan has long been a \ntribute to Texas, the Nation, and especially to the Air Force.\n  General Ryan graduated from the Air Force Academy in 1965, and during \nhis 36 years of service he commanded at the squadron, wing, numbered \nair force and major command levels, and accumulated more than 4,100 \nflying hours in seven different aircraft with 153 combat missions. He \nflew combat in Southeast Asia, including 100 missions over North \nVietnam, and he served in key staff assignments at the major command \nlevel, at Headquarters U.S. Air Force and the Joint Staff. As commander \nof 16th Air Force and Allied Air Forces Southern Europe in Italy, he \ndirected the NATO air combat operations in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We owe \nhim a huge debt of thanks for just this duty alone as his leadership \ndirectly contributed to the Dayton Peace Accords.\n  General Ryan is, fortunately, not an unsung hero as he has received \nmany decorations and medals including: the Defense Distinguished \nService Medal with oak leaf cluster, the Distinguished Service Medal, \nthe Legion of Merit with two oak leaf clusters, the Distinguished \nFlying Cross, the Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, \nthe Air Medal with 11 oak leaf clusters, the Air Force Commendation \nMedal with two oak leaf clusters and the Vietnam Service Medal with \nthree service stars.\n  After serving as the commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe and \ncommander, Allied Air Forces Central Europe, General Ryan ``took the \nstick'' of the Air Force as its 16th Chief of Staff. During his tenure, \nhe has exemplified the quiet dignity and honor of that office through \nhis leadership, integrity and foresight. A true leader who understood \nthat his role was to set the course for our 21st Century Air Force and \nthen clear the path to allow his commanders to truly lead their units, \nGeneral Ryan personifies once said: ``I don't think leadership should \nbe personalized. Good ideas are best when they don't have a single \nidentity. Leadership is a team effort.''\n  This is a lesson those of us here in Congress would be wise to learn!\n  Meanwhile, General Ryan's accomplishments are critical and easily \nquantifiable. He and his leadership team successfully arrested the Air \nForce's readiness decline of the last decade, and built stability into \nthe expeditionary operations our nation demands by reorganizing the \nservice. At the same time though, General Ryan ensured that despite the \nAir Force being an all-volunteer force competing in a strong job \nmarket, its retention and recruiting efforts never sacrificed quality \nfor quantity. He also led the effort to provide lifetime health care to \nour men and women who willingly put their lives at risk, as well as a \nretirement system that properly compensates their service to country.\n  In a period of leadership challenges and chaos, General Ryan led our \nAir Force, balancing reductions in forces with dramatically increased \noperational tasking. Without question, the U.S. Air Force is the \nworld's premier force and our country owes a debt of gratitude to Mike \nRyan.\n  At the same time, we owe a debt of gratitude to the person General \nRyan owes much of his success--his wife, Jane Ryan. With dignity and \ngrace she selflessly gave her time and attention to the men and women \nof the Air Force family. Her sacrifice and devotion have served as an \nexample and inspiration for others. The Air Force will lose not one, \nbut two very exceptional people.\n  In fact, General Ryan's departure from active duty will signal an \nhistoric occurrence for the first time in 63 years, there will no \nlonger be a Ryan in the ranks of the United States Air Force. While \nGeneral Ryan distinguished himself as an airmen, leader, and trusted \nadvisor to both the President and the U.S. Congress, his father, \nGeneral John Ryan, also served as the senior uniformed Air Force \nofficer.\n  The Air Force is a better institution today than it was four years \nago.

Mr. President, I am so pleased tonight we were able to \npass a measure that honors our heritage as a nation of immigrants, and \nprovides American and immigrant families some relief from our outdated \nimmigration laws.\n  Today, immigrants who don't have the proper documentation to stay in \nthe United States, but do have the legal right to become permanent \nresidents because they are the spouses of US citizens can be stuck in a \nhorrible catch-22 situation. If they return to their home country to \nget the immigrant visa to which they are entitled, they can be barred \nfrom re-entering the United States for up to 10 years.\n  Take the example of a woman named Norma. Norma entered the U.S. from \nMexico, and settled in North Carolina. She then married a U.S. citizen. \nThey have been married over two years, have a child, are expecting \nanother this fall, and recently bought a new home for their growing \nfamily. Norma and her husband are torn on what to do about her \nimmigration status. As the wife of a citizen, she qualifies for an \nimmigrant visa. However, if she returns to Mexico to obtain her visa, \nshe would be barred from re-entering the U.S. for 10 years. Norma \ndoesn't want to leave her husband, her children, or her home for 10 \nyears--and she shouldn't have to.\n  This action allows Norma's family--and hundreds of thousands of other \nfamilies--to stay together. S. 778, introduced by Senators Hagel and \nKennedy, extends the period of time for eligible people to file their \npetitions for relief with the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nand the Department of Labor for one year.\n  By doing that, S. 778 would provide real and immediate relief for \nhundreds of thousands of eligible immigrants.\n  With 30 Republican and Democratic cosponsors, this bill enjoyed broad \nbipartisan support:\n  It passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee mark up by a \nunanimous voice vote.\n  To satisfy critics, Senators Hagel and Kennedy compromised by \naccepting language that immigrants applying under the new 245(i) \nextension must show that their family or employment relationship \nexisted prior to the enactment of the bill.\n  I have talked to the President about this issue on more than one \noccasion, and I raised it again with him this week at the White House. \nHe assured me he shares my concern that we need to take action on this \nimportant priority.\n  Since April 30th of this year, when Section 245(i) last expired, \nimmigrants have been waiting in limbo.\n  INS statistics show that approximately seventy-five percent of the \nimmigrants who apply for 245(i) relief are the spouses and children of \nU.S. citizens and permanent residents.\n  Eight out of 10 legal immigrants come to the United States to join a \nfamily member. What message are we sending if our policies pry families \napart?\n  President Vicente Fox's historic visit has helped to focus attention \non the need to re-craft our immigration policies in ways that better \nreflect our core values of family unity, fundamental fairness and \neconomic opportunity.\n  Passing the Section 245(i) Extension Act of 2001 sends a clear \nmessage that we are truly committed to providing real immigration \nreform.\n  The Senate has taken the first step. I hope the House will soon \nfollow. Let's put this bill on President Bush's desk, and let's do it \nthis week. Norma's family, and thousands of families just like hers, \nare looking to us. Let's not let them down.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last year's Legal Immigration Family \nEquity Act extended the deadline under section 245(i) of the \nimmigration laws to April 30, 2001--a window of just 4 months--to \nenable persons who are eligible for green cards to adjust their status \nin the United States, rather than have to return to their country of \norigin to do so. Clearly this new deadline has proved to be inadequate. \nThe short extension created an overwhelming demand for information and \nservices, and many qualified persons did not have enough time to file \ntheir petitions.\n  To address this urgent problem, Senator Hagel and I introduced new \nlegislation on April 26, a few days before the April 30 deadline. \nCongress should have acted long before now to extend the deadline, but \nall of us who support an extension are pleased that the Senate is \nfinally acting on this bill. I know many of my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle share my desire to move this bill quickly because it \naffects so many people. It is a humanitarian measure that has strong \nbipartisan support. It also has the support of the President.\n  This bill will provide real and immediate relief to hundreds of \nthousands of immigrants. INS data show that approximately 75 percent of \nthe immigrants who apply for this relief are the spouses and children \nof U.S. citizens and permanent residents. These are families who have \nmade lasting contributions to our communities and contributed to the \neconomic vitality of our nation. This bill does not propose substantial \nnew relief, but only a continuation of the prior relief. Last year's \ntemporary extension to April 30, 2001 was designed to benefit \nimmigrants who were in the country by December 21, 2000. This bill will \nextend the deadline to provide this group of immigrants with more time \nto file their petitions.\n  I know that some of my colleagues support the extension, but had \nconcerns with our bill. We worked with them to develop an acceptable \ncompromise. Our bill, with an amendment offered by Senator Kyl reflects \nour compromise. This compromise requires immigrants benefitting from \nthe extension to show that their family or employment relationship \nexisted on or before August 15, 2001. They will have until April 30, \n2002 or 4 months from the issuance of regulations to file their \napplications with the INS.\n  Some critics are concerned about fraudulent marriages. But the INS, \nand not Congress, is in the best position to determine whether a case \nis fraudulent. The INS closely scrutinizes applications based on recent \nmarriages. Under the current law, the INS conducts extensive interviews \nbefore deciding these cases, often separately questioning the couples. \nAnyone who has been married less than 2 years when their application is \napproved is required to attend a second INS interview 2 years later, in \nwhich INS again reviews the case to determine whether there is a bona \nfide marriage. Only after the second interview will a recently married \nimmigrant receive a permanent green card.\n\n[[Page S9192]]\n\n  In INS determines that an individual has committed marriage fraud, \nthat person is permanently barred from receiving a green card and can \nbe criminally prosecuted. Many of us feel that this new restriction is \nunnecessary, and will lead to needless confusion, delay and hardship. \nBut in the spirit of compromise, we accepted this amendment.\n  I am pleased that we are moving this bill forward, as this \nlegislation will keep immigrant families together. We cannot continue \nto delay; otherwise, the purpose of this legislation--to prevent the \nseparation of immigrant families--will be defeated. This measure is of \ncritical importance to Mexican President Vicente Fox, who is in \nWashington for an historic visit. Our two countries are negotiating \nimportant immigration policies which will profoundly affect and benefit \nour peoples and our economies. Extension of section 245(i) is an \nimmediate and important first step in these negotiations.\n  Finally, if we are truly to live up to our history and heritage as a \nnation of immigrants, we must also address the pressing needs of \nuniting other families separated by our current immigration laws, and \nmeeting the needs of our labor market. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to meet these great challenges, and am pleased that the \nSenate has approved this bill as a downpayment on the reforms that are \nso long overdue.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this legislation accomplishes a goal \nsupported by President Bush and a bipartisan coalition of Senators--\nmaking it easier for people who are eligible to become legal permanent \nresidents to apply for their green cards without leaving the United \nStates. There could not be a more opportune time to pass this bill than \nduring the visit of President Vicente Fox to our nation, and I applaud \nthe Majority Leader for making passage today possible. I hope that the \napproval of this bill serves as a signal of the Congress' willingness \nto work with the Mexican Government to achieve our common goals, and to \nmaintain fair immigration policies.\n  I was pleased to schedule this bill for a markup as soon as I became \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee. Although I would have preferred \nthat the Committee report the bill as it was introduced, I am glad that \na compromise was reached that allowed the bill to receive the \nCommittee's support and make it to the floor of the Senate.\n  This bill extends section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct, which expired on April 30, 2001. Section 245(i) allows foreign-\nborn people who are present in the United States and eligible for legal \npermanent residency to apply for that status from within the country \ninstead of having to return to their nation of origin to apply. We \nreauthorized section 245(i) last year, but only for a four-month \nperiod. Many eligible immigrants were unable to find attorneys and \nsubmit applications during that brief period.\n  There are at least three good reasons to extend 245(i). First, it \nallows families to stay together in the United States instead of \nforcing family members to return to their native countries to apply for \ntheir green cards. Second, because immigrants can also qualify to \nbecome legal permanent residents based on an employment relationship, \nextending 245(i) will allow businesses to retain vital employees. \nThird, because immigrants have to pay a $1000 fee to apply under \n245(i), this program raises millions of dollars for the Federal \ntreasury.\n  Senators Kennedy and Hagel deserve great credit for their sponsorship \nof and support for this bill. I am pleased that the Senate has approved \nthis bipartisan bill to keep families together, and I urge the House to \nfollow the Senate's lead.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me briefly say that this is extremely \nimportant. With President Fox in the country, this sends a message to \nhim that we really are trying to work toward making things easier in \nrelations between the United States and Mexico. But this has wide \napplication to places other than Mexico. It is important legislation. \nIt is something we worked on very hard. We almost got it done toward \nthe end of last year. It is now completed.\n  We hope the House will expeditiously move forward on this matter. The \nchairman of the House Judiciary Committee has been involved in this, \nRepresentative Sensenbrenner. We are grateful for everyone's \ncooperation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/06/senate-section/article/S9192-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2500\n\n  Mr. REID.

Although Al-Anon, and its group for younger \nmembers, Alateen, have their roots in the United States, there are now \nover 26,000 Al-Anon and Alateen groups around the world in 115 \ncountries.\n  The theme for the September 2001 National Alcohol and Drug Addiction \nRecovery Month is ``We Recover Together: Family, Friends and \nCommunity,'' with its clear message that we need to work together to \npromote treatment for alcohol and drug addiction throughout our \ncountry. The Al-Anon Family Groups is an outstanding example of how a \ncommunity can support the families, friends and communities of those \nwho are in recovery from addiction.\n  Scientific research has shown us the devastation that alcohol \naddiction can have on the brain and the biological systems of the body. \nBut addiction can also damage souls, relationships, families and \ncommunities. Effective treatments can help those with addiction \nillnesses, but it is through the support of groups like Al-Anon that \ncommunities and families can join together to make recovery work well \nfor everyone who is affected.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing Al-Anon Family Groups \nfor the work they have done to help the countless numbers of those \nwhose lives have been affected by addiction. With treatment and \nsupport, people can recover from alcohol addiction, and make positive \ncontributions to their families, workplaces, communities, state and \nnation. Through the support offered by Al-Anon and Alateen, families \nand friends of those with addiction illnesses can find the support they \nneed in their lives as well.\n  With gratitude and respect for the work they do, I offer my \ncongratulations to Al-Anon Family Groups on their 50th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/06/senate-section/article/S9193-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO OVARIAN CANCER NATIONAL ALLIANCE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance of Washington, D.C. \nduring Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month of September. The Alliance has \nbeen instrumental in implementing a three phase public education \nprogram targeting key constituencies to deliver crucial information \nabout ovarian cancer.\n  The information provided to the public about ovarian cancer has \nallowed the Alliance to successfully develop the tools, strategies and \nrelationships necessary to educate women about the symptoms, risks and \ntreatment of ovarian cancer.\n  The main thrust of the education program was the development of a \npilot awareness program in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. \nWorking closely with the Ovarian Cancer Coalition of Greater \nWashington, the Alliance trained more than 30 volunteers to go into the \ncommunity to give educational presentations and partnered with area \ngynecologic and oncology physicians and nurses to do similar \npresentations in the medical community.\n  The combined aspects of the program have reached several hundred \nhealthcare professionals and tens of thousand of women. The pilot \nprogram has made a marked impact in raising ovarian cancer awareness in \nthe Washington, D.C. area.\n  The Alliance has begun to identify other communities around the \ncountry in which it will conduct similar educational campaigns to \nheighten awareness of ovarian cancer.\n  I commend the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance for its selfless \ndedication to the education of women concerning ovarian cancer and \napplaud the efforts to reach thousands of women in our country with \nlife saving information. It is truly an honor and a privilege to \nrepresent you in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/06/senate-section/article/S9193-4", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9193-S9194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            COMMENDING THE SERVICE OF GENERAL THOMAS P. KANE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to bring to \nthe Senate's attention the exemplary career and service of General \nThomas Kane,\n\n[[Page S9194]]\n\nCommander of the 60th Air Mobility Wing at Travis Air Force Base in \nCalifornia.\n  General Kane is leaving Travis to accept an assignment with NATO on \nSeptember 12, 2001. When he arrived in Solano County almost 2 years \nago, he brought with him a sense of honor, purpose and teamwork that \nnot only resonated on the base itself but throughout the surrounding \ncommunity. I am not the only one who will miss his spirit, good nature \nand strength of character.\n  General Kane is a career Air Force officer. He graduated from the Air \nForce Academy in 1974 and has earned numerous advanced degrees since. A \npilot and highly decorated officer, he has served in many capacities \nand in many locations over the course of his time in the Armed Forces \nincluding Portugal and Korea. Advancing steadily, he was promoted to \nBrigadier General on September 1, 2000.\n  I had the pleasure of meeting General Kane in person once at my \noffice in Washington, DC. To me, the most striking thing about him is \nhow much he cares about the men and women in his command. This \nimpressed me very much. In my opinion, this attitude is more than an \napproach to leadership; it is the very essence of leadership.\n  General Kane often likes to mention that if he ever leaves the Air \nForce he would like to be a baseball coach. I am not sure if America \nneeds more baseball coaches, but I do know that we very much need \ndedicated people leading our military. General Kane is just such an \nofficer. He is a credit to his uniform and his country. I wish him, his \nwife Renee and their family the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/06/senate-section/article/S9194-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALICE WATERS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an \nextraordinary American and Californian, Alice Waters, who has \nrevolutionized our approach to food and the way we eat.\n  I congratulate her and her flagship restaurant, Chez Panisse, for \nreaching the milestone of being in business for 30 years. While \nsustaining a successful restaurant for all of these years is \nsignificant, Alice's broader contribution to our culture in the past \ndecades is unparalleled.\n  While I have known and admired Alice for many years, I am astonished \nwhen I consider the effect she has had on our country. Alice has \ncultivated programs and integrated food and gardening into imaginative \nprojects as ways of fostering love, growth, responsibility and respect \nof life and work.\n  Alice's disciples and her philosophy of fresh, local and natural, \nhave spread throughout our land. A remarkable number of protegees have \nopened their own path-breaking restaurants and have become culinary \nartists themselves. But her influence goes far beyond the kitchen. Due \nto the leadership of Alice and her restaurant, Chez Panisse, the \nNational Restaurant Association reports that over 60 percent of the top \nAmerican restaurants now mention organic ingredients on their menus. \nAlice worked to pass the Federal organic food law and has helped define \nnew U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines for school lunches.\n  Alice has written and co-authored many cookbooks, which provide more \nthan recipes. They have helped to spread her philosophy of food into \nAmerican home kitchens. She has founded gardening projects at the San \nFrancisco jail and the Edible Schoolyard at Berkeley's Martin Luther \nKing Jr. Middle School, where she established a curriculum that brings \norganic gardening into classes and where the results of the children's \ngardening are used in the school's lunch program. The students who \nparticipate not only learn valuable skills but also cooperation and \nresponsibility.\n  Alice believes that as Americans change their thinking about food, \nAmerica will change for the better. Alice has said about our children \nthat ``Most families in this country don't even eat one meal a day with \neach other. So how are we going to pass on our values to them if we \ndon't eat with them?''\n  While Chez Panisse has been graced with many talented people over the \nyears, the one constant has been Alice. She has poured her life into \nChez Panisse and into what it represents, and we are all the richer for \nit.\n  I am proud to know Alice and I wish her, her good works for our \ncommunity and nation, and Chez Panisse another 30 years of continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/06/senate-section/article/S9194-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING JIM WOSTER FOR HIS SERVICE TO SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a friend \nand an extraordinary South Dakotan who is about to be inducted into the \nSouth Dakota Hall of Fame on Saturday, September 8th. I am very pleased \nthat Mr. Jim Woster, of Sioux Falls, SD has been selected for this very \nprestigious honor. I am sure this is also a great honor for Jim's wife, \nPenny, their three children, Jim, Sara, and Michelle, and their new \ngranddaughter, Tessa. Jim's contributions to our State have been many, \nbut he has, in particular, been an absolute champion for the interests \nof agriculture and South Dakota's rural communities.\n  After growing up on a ranch near Reliance, SD, Mr. Woster graduated \nfrom South Dakota State University with a degree in animal science. As \na young man, Jim began to compile an incredibly impressive list of \naccomplishments in all aspects of South Dakota agriculture. Jim's \nexperiences range from working in the cattle alley at the Sioux Falls \nStockyards to conducting important ruminant nutrition research. Jim has \nbeen involved in consignment sales of livestock at sale barns \nthroughout the State, and became a highly respected and beloved media \npersonality in our State through his market reports on radio and \ntelevision. Nobody knows rural America, and nobody knows South Dakota \nagriculture better than Jim Woster.\n  Jim has always exhibited a strong commitment to public service. \nThroughout his career, he has devoted an enormous amount of time and \nenergy to worthy causes such as the American Cancer Society, the \nArthritis Foundation, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation. All this while \nserving our Nation for eight years as a member of the South Dakota \nNational Guard.\n  The great honor to be bestowed on Mr. Woster is exceptionally well \ndeserved, as he has contributed so much to our State while at the same \ntime serving as a model for other talented South Dakotans to emulate. I \njoin my fellow South Dakotans on extending congratulations and a ``job \nwell done'' to Jim Woster.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/06/senate-section/article/S9194-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:29 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1866.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to standardize \nthe income threshold for copayment for outpatient medications with the \nincome threshold for inability to defray necessary expense of care, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today \nlegislation that would exempt certain veterans from copayments for \nneeded prescription drugs.\n  Currently, veterans with incomes of less than $24,000 a year are \nexempt from copayments for most VA health care services. However, when \nit comes to prescription drugs, the income threshold for exemption is \njust $9,000 a\n\n[[Page S9199]]\n\nyear. Veterans earning over $9,000, well below the poverty threshold \nestablished by the Census Bureau, are required to make copayments. \nThese copayments place an undue burden on our poorest veterans. To \ncompound the problem, the Department of Veterans Affairs recently \nproposed increasing the copayment for prescription drugs from $2 to $7 \nper 30-day prescription.\n  I have serious concerns about what this copayment increase will mean \nfor veterans. Indeed, I have already heard from a number of veterans \nwhose incomes hover just above the $9,000 threshold, who must make the \nrequired copayments for their pharmaceuticals. Many of them are on \nseveral different medications for multiple medical conditions, each \nrequiring their own copay. There are many veterans like Steven Smith, \nformerly of Greenwood, WV, who has no health insurance except Medicare \nand depends upon the VA for his medications. With the lack of a \nMedicare drug benefit, he, and many veterans like him, are faced with a \n350 percent increase in what they must pay for life-sustaining \nmedications.\n  I am not alone in my concerns about the impact the copayment increase \nwill have on veterans. In commenting on the proposed regulations, the \nVFW recently cited an example of a veteran who has an annual income of \n$10,500, just above the current exemption limit set by VA. The increase \nin the prescription copayment rate would force that veteran to allocate \nover 8 percent of his annual income just to prescription drugs. There \nis a grave danger that, faced with this situation, many veterans will \nstop seeking necessary medical care because they are priced out of the \nsystem.\n  At a glance, the increase to $7 per prescription may seem reasonable \nenough and in keeping with industry standards. However, consider a \nveteran with an income of about $9,000 a year who currently pays $2 per \nprescription for 10 medications a month. He presently incurs out-of-\npocket costs of $240 a year. Under the new regulations, his costs would \ngo up to $840 per year, an increase of $600. For someone living barely \nover the $9,000 annual income threshold, this is a substantial sum.\n  I am also concerned about disparities in how VA defines who is \n``poor'' for the purpose of exemption from health care copayments. For \nprescription drugs, veterans with more than $9,000 annual income must \nmake copayments, but for outpatient care, hospitalization, and extended \ncare, the income threshold for copayments is $24,000 per year. My \nproposed legislation would raise the exemption level for prescription \ncopays to make them the same as all other VA health care copays. It \nwill be less confusing to veterans, easier to administer, and quite \nsimply, it's the right thing to do.\n  My legislation, the Veterans' Copayment Adjustment Act, would also \nrequire VA to delay implementing the increase in prescription \ncopayments until we see an adjustment to copayments for other health \ncare services. On July 24, I held a hearing on prescription drug issues \nin VA. At that hearing, we heard testimony from VA Secretary Anthony \nPrincipi who also believes that new drug copayments shouldn't be put \ninto effect until we see a reduction in other health care copayments.\n  As part of the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act, \nCongress gave VA authority to adjust the different health care \ncopayments. This was intended to make VA's copayments more rational. \nCurrently, veterans must make a copayment of over $50 for outpatient \ncare services. There is no doubt that $50 for a routine outpatient \nvisit is unreasonable at best, and at worst, discourages veterans from \ngetting the primary care they need. By delaying the increase in the \nmedication copayment until VA implements its adjusted outpatient \ncopayment, we will reduce the negative financial impact on our Nation's \nveterans. I am confident that VA will study this issue closely and will \nexpeditiously set the outpatient copayment to be more in line with \nmanaged care plans.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in seeking to provide \naffordable health care for our sick and disabled veterans. They have \nsacrificed for all of us, and deserve every effort we can make to keep \nthem from having to choose between buying needed prescription drugs and \nputting food on the table.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1408\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to impose sanctions against the PLO or the \nPalestinian Authority if the President determines that those entities \nhave failed to substantially comply with commitments made to the State \nof Israel; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                MIDDLE EAST PEACE COMPLIANCE ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am today joining with my good friend, \nSenator Feinstein from California, who is in the Chamber as well, in \noffering the Middle East Peace Compliance Act of 2001. We do that with \nthe support also of our colleagues, Senators Daschle, Schumer, \nMikulski, Crapo, Clinton, Carnahan, Boxer, Torricelli, Edwards, \nCleland, Ensign, and Shelby.\n  We also do so with full appreciation of the dire and untenable \nsituation in the Middle East.\n  Given the ongoing and relentless bloodshed in the Middle East, the \ntime has come for finger pointing. Palestinian Liberation Organization \n(PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat--and the terrorists he allows free reign \nin the West Bank and Gaza--are guilty of waging a guerrilla war against \nAmerica's most important and reliable ally in that region. Scores of \ninnocent Israeli men, women and children have been killed by bombs, \nbullets, knives, and stones. In acts of cowardice, Palestinian suicide \nbombers have caused death and destruction in discos, pizza parlors, \ncafes, and on the streets of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.\n  There appears no end to this madness. On Monday of this week, four \nbombs exploded in the Jerusalem neighborhood of French Hill. On \nTuesday, a Palestinian suicide bomber disguised as an orthodox Jew \nkilled himself and injured others on a Jerusalem street close to two \ninternational schools. One wonders how much more of this terror the \npeople of Israel can--or should--endure.\n  Mr. Arafat and his minions are enlisting Palestinians of all ages to \ntheir misguided cause of mutually assured destruction. One Palestinian \nchildren's television show reportedly broadcast a song: ``When I wander \ninto Jerusalem, I will become a suicide bomber.'' Mr. President, Israel \nis well aware of the people in Mr. Arafat's Neighborhood, and they are \nnot ones they, or any\n\n[[Page S9200]]\n\npeaceful loving people, would choose to associate with.\n  The legislation we are introducing will make clear the intentions of \nMr. Arafat and the PLO. In a report to Congress, the Administration is \nrequired to determine whether or not the PLO has lived up to its 1993 \ncommitments under the Oslo Accords to renounce violence against Israel, \nand what steps have been taken by the PLO and the Palestinian Authority \nto investigate and prosecute those responsible for killing American and \nIsraeli citizens. Should the Administration determine that the PLO's \nactions run contrary to their word, the President is required to \nimmediately suspend all assistance to the West Bank and Gaza, except \nhumanitarian aid. He is also required to initiate additional sanctions \nagainst the PLO, which may include denying visas to senior officials \nand downgrading their representative office in the United States.\n  I intend to offer this legislation, along with Senator Feinstein, as \nan amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, which may \nbe considered by the full Senate in the near future.\n  While I will have much more to say on the situation in the Middle \nEast at a later date, let me close by asking a question of my \ncolleagues: If the daily terrorists attacks taking place against \nIsraelis were occurring on American soil against U.S. citizens, what \nwould our response be? A democracy in a region of dictatorships and \nkingdoms, Israel has the right and responsibility to protect and defend \nits citizens against terrorism. The United States should be clear in \nits support of Israel exercising this right, in whatever manner the \npeople of Israel, through their elected leaders, deem appropriate. To \ndate, Israel has shown remarkable restraint.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. With great thanks to my colleague from California in \ncollaborating with me on this effort, and looking forward to further \nefforts on behalf of this proposal, I now yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \nhis leadership. We have consulted together on this bill, and I am very \nproud to join him as the lead Democratic cosponsor.\n  I ask unanimous consent to put the following Members from this side \nof the aisle on the bill: Senators Daschle, Schumer, Mikulski, Clinton, \nCarnahan, Boxer, Torricelli, Edwards, and Cleland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky and I joined \ntogether in this legislation because we believe that if the violence \nbetween the Palestinians and Israel is to end and the peace process is \nto gain any momentum, the Palestinian leadership must show it can \nmuster the political will that is necessary to meet the commitments \nthey made at Oslo.\n  Most people, I think, don't know what the Oslo accords were. In fact, \nthe Oslo accords were letters that were sent between the Palestinian \nand Israeli leadership in 1993. Those letters became the Oslo accords.\n  I want to indicate what the Palestinians, over the signature of their \nchairman, Mr. Arafat, said they would do on September 9, 1993:\n\n       The PLO recognizes the right of the State of Israel to \n     exist in peace and security.\n       The PLO accepts United Nations Security Council Resolutions \n     242 and 338.\n       The PLO commits itself to the Middle East peace process, \n     and to a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the two \n     sides and declares that all outstanding issues relating to \n     permanent status will be resolved through negotiations.\n\n  These are not my words, these are the words of Chairman Arafat.\n  It goes on:\n\n       The PLO considers that the signing of the Declaration of \n     Principles constitutes a historic event, inaugurating a new \n     epoch of peaceful coexistence, free from violence and all \n     other acts which endanger peace and stability. Accordingly, \n     the PLO renounces the use of terrorism and other acts of \n     violence and will assume responsibility over all PLO elements \n     and personnel in order to assure their compliance, prevent \n     violence, and discipline violators.\n       In view of the promise of a new era and the signing of the \n     Declaration of Principles, and based on Palestinian \n     acceptance of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the \n     PLO affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant \n     which deny Israel's right to exist, and the provisions of the \n     Covenant which are inconsistent [with the commitments of this \n     letter] are invalid.\n\n  For its part, Israel, under Prime Minister Rabin, in a letter to \nChairman Arafat, stated:\n\n       I wish to confirm to you that in light of the PLO \n     commitments included in your letter, the Government of Israel \n     has decided to recognize the PLO as the representative of the \n     Palestinian people and commence negotiations with the PLO \n     within the Middle East peace process.\n\n  Mr. President, that was what formed the beginning of Oslo--not the \nend, but the beginning of the Oslo peace process. They were the \nnecessary minimum threshold to begin that process--a recognition that \nIsrael has the right to exist in peace and security and that the \nPalestinian people have a right to be represented in peace negotiations \nby representatives of their own choosing.\n  Unfortunately, since Camp David last year, the Palestinians have \ncarried out more than 6,700 armed attacks against Israelis in a \nfundamental violation of their peace process commitments. This \nPalestinian campaign of terror has killed 155 Israelis, 114 of them \ncivilians, and it has wounded another 1,500 Israelis.\n  As the Senator from Kentucky pointed out, whether it is a bomb that \ngoes off in a pizza parlor, a discotheque, a school bus, or a shopping \nmall, this is the way that kind of violence has happened.\n  Now, Israel has responded. Some have criticized Israel for that \nresponse. Yet if Israel is not going to practice that kind of response, \nthe violence--such as the incident that just happened in Jerusalem, I \nthink, yesterday, when somebody dressed as an Orthodox Jew walking down \nthe street with a bomb in his backpack, detonated the bomb when an \nIsraeli officer came up to him--must stop. A group of schoolchildren \nwere nearby, but luckily they were not injured. Many others were.\n  The subject here is terror, and no Israeli and no Palestinian should \nhave to live with terror every day, when a child gets on that school \nbus, when a son goes to work, when a wife goes shopping, when friends \nmeet at a cafe or pizzeria or go to a night club.\n  The bombings, the terror, and the violence must stop. The Palestinian \nuse of this kind of terror over the past 10 months runs contrary to \nwhat is expected of a peace partner. Mr. Arafat must understand that \nallowing an atmosphere of violence and terror to continue will not and \ncannot lead to peace.\n  The bill we are proposing today, the Middle East Peace Compliance \nAct, sends that signal clearly and simply and says either the PLO live \nup to these commitments or we return to a pre-Oslo posture.\n  So it is a very simple and very straightforward bill based on these \ncommitments. It calls for the President to issue a report addressing \nwhether the PLO and the Palestinian Authority are in compliance with \nthe fundamental commitments they have repeatedly made to renounce \nterrorism.\n  If the President is unable to find that the PLO or the Palestinian \nAuthority is adhering to its commitments, it requires him to restrict \nnonhumanitarian assistance to the West Bank and Gaza and to impose one \nof two additional sanctions: Denial of visas to Palestinian Authority \nofficials, or closing the Palestinian office in the United States.\n  I think this legislation is necessary to send a message that we \ncannot continue this kind of violence. We cannot see that letter \nabrogated in chapter and verse--the letter that became the foundation \nof PLO recognition, and the letter that became the foundation of the \nOslo peace process.\n  Let me be clear. It is also my expectation that the Government of \nIsrael, for its part, must continue to meet the commitments it has made \nto peace and continue to exercise restraint in reaction to these \nPalestinian terrorist acts.\n  Mr. President, we submit this legislation. Again, I am very delighted \nto work with the distinguished Senator from Kentucky. We have a bill \nand, as the Senator said, we will also offer this as an amendment to \nthe foreign operations appropriations bill. I thank the Chair and the \nSenator. It has been a great pleasure to work with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9201]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Accordingly, \n     the PLO renounces the use of terrorism and other acts of \n     violence and will assume responsibility over all PLO elements \n     and personnel in order to assure their compliance, prevent \n     violence and discipline violators.''.\n       (E) ``In view of the promise of a new era and the signing \n     of the Declaration of Principles and based on Palestinian \n     acceptance of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the \n     PLO affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant \n     which deny Israel's right to exist, and the provisions of the \n     Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this \n     letter are now inoperative and no longer valid.''.\n       (2) The Palestinian Authority, the governing body of \n     autonomous Palestinian territories, was created as a result \n     of the agreements between the PLO and the State of Israel \n     that are a direct outgrowth of the September 9, 1993, \n     commitments.\n       (3) The United States Congress has provided authorities to \n     the President to suspend certain statutory restrictions \n     relating to the PLO, subject to Presidential certification \n     that the PLO has continued to abide by commitments made.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The President shall, at the times \n     specified in subsection (b), transmit to Congress a report--\n       (1) detailing and assessing the steps that the PLO or the \n     Palestinian Authority, as appropriate, has taken to \n     substantially comply with its 1993 commitments, as specified \n     in section 2(1) of this Act;\n       (2) a description of the steps taken by the PLO or the \n     Palestinian Authority, as appropriate, to investigate and \n     prosecute those responsible for violence against American and \n     Israeli citizens;\n       (3) making a determination as to whether the PLO or the \n     Palestinian Authority, as appropriate, has substantially \n     complied with such commitments during the period since the \n     submission of the preceding report, or, in the case of the \n     initial report, during the preceding 6-month period; and\n       (4) detailing progress made in determining the designation \n     of the PLO, or one or more of its constituent groups \n     (including Fatah and Tanzim) or groups operating as arms of \n     the Palestinian Authority (including Force 17) as a foreign \n     terrorist organization, in accordance with section 219(a) of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       (b) Transmission.--The initial report required under \n     subsection (a) shall be transmitted not later than 30 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act. Each subsequent \n     report shall be submitted on the date on which the President \n     is next required to submit a report under the PLO Commitments \n     Compliance Act of 1989 (title VIII of Public Law 101-246) and \n     may be combined with such report.\n\n     SEC. 4. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--If, in any report transmitted pursuant to \n     section 3, the President determines that the PLO or \n     Palestinian Authority, as appropriate, has not substantially \n     complied with the commitments specified in section 2(1), the \n     following sanctions shall apply:\n       (1) Suspension of assistance.--The President shall suspend \n     all United States assistance to the West Bank and Gaza except \n     for humanitarian assistance.\n       (2) Additional sanction or sanctions.--The President shall \n     impose one or more of the following sanctions:\n       (A) Denial of visas to plo and palestinian authority \n     figures.--The President shall prohibit the Secretary of State \n     from issuance of any visa for any member of the PLO or any \n     official of the Palestinian Authority.\n       (B) Downgrade in status of plo office in the united \n     states.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     President shall withdraw or terminate any waiver by the \n     President of the requirements of section 1003 of the Foreign \n     Relations Authorization Act of 1988 and 1989 (22 U.S.C. 5202) \n     (prohibiting the establishment or maintenance of a \n     Palestinian information office in the United States), and \n     such section shall apply so as to prohibit the operation of a \n     PLO or Palestinian Authority office in the United States from \n     carrying out any function other than those functions carried \n     out by the Palestinian information office in existence prior \n     to the Oslo Accord.\n       (b) Duration of Sanctions.--The period of time referred to \n     in subsection (a) is the period of time commencing on the \n     date that the report pursuant to section 3 was transmitted \n     and ending on the later of--\n       (1) the date that is 6 months after such date;\n       (2) the date that the next report under section 3 is \n     required to be transmitted; or\n       (3) the date, if any, on which the President determines and \n     informs Congress that the conditions that were the basis for \n     imposing the sanctions are no longer valid.\n       (c) Waiver Authority.--The President may waive any or all \n     of the sanctions imposed under this Act if the President \n     determines that such a waiver is in the national security \n     interest of the United States, and reports such a \n     determination to the appropriate committees of Congress.\n\n     SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE; TERMINATION DATE.\n\n       (a) Effective Date.--This Act shall take effect on the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Termination Date.--This Act shall cease to be effective \n     5 years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 1411. A bill to authorize the transfer of the Denver Department of \nVeterans Affairs Medical Center, Colorado, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nfacilitate the move of the Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center, \nDVAMC, from its present site in Denver to the former Fitzsimons Army \nMedical Center in Aurora, CO. I am happy to be joined in this effort by \nmy friend and colleague Senator Allard as an original co-sponsor. The \nbill would authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to accomplish \nthe transfer in a timely manner. It would also require the Secretary to \nsubmit a report to the Veterans Affairs Committee and the \nAppropriations Committee of both the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives. This report would detail the costs of the transfer and \nwould be submitted 60 days prior to awarding a contract for the move.\n  The relocation of the DVAMC to the former Fitzsimons site offers a \nunique opportunity to provide the highest quality medical care for our \nveterans. The University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, UCHSC, is \nmoving its facilities from its overcrowded location near downtown \nDenver to the Fitzsimons site, a decomissioned Army base. The UCHSC and \nthe DVAMC have long operated on adjacent campuses and have shared \nfaculty, medical residents, and access to equipment. A DVAMC move to \nthe new location would allow such cost-effective cooperation to \ncontinue, for the benefits of our veterans and all taxpayers.\n  The need to move is pressing. A recent VA study concludes that the \nColorado State veterans' population will experience one of the highest \npercent increases nationally in veterans 65 and over between 1990 and \n2020. The present VA hospital was built in the 1950's. While still able \nto provide service, the core facilities are approaching the end of \ntheir useful lives and many of the patient care units have fallen \nhorribly out of date. Studies indicate that co-location with the \nUniversity on a state-of-the-art medical campus would be a cost \neffective way to give veterans in the region the highest quality of \ncare. The move would also provide a tremendous opportunity to showcase \na nationwide model of cooperation between the University and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, VA. These cooperative initiatives have \nproven time and again their effectiveness.\n  Timing is also very important. The VA needs to move quickly to \nrealize the financial advantages of this unique opportunity. In order \nto make the move fiscally effective, the VA needs to make a decision \nnot later than 2004. Additionally, our veterans are aging and their \nneeds are increasing. Assisting our veterans with their medical needs \nis a promise we, as a country, made long ago.\n  The savings we can realize by approving the timely transfer of our \nveterans' medical treatment facilities in the Denver region compels me \nto urge my\n\n[[Page S9202]]\n\ncolleagues to act quickly on this bill. We must not miss out on this \nopportunity to serve America's veterans and their families by ensuring \nthat they receive the excellent medical care they deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n       There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
