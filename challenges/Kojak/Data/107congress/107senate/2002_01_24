Madam President, we are all back, hopefully after a good \nrecess and a good opportunity to visit with the folks at home and can \nnow evaluate some of the things that have been done over the last year \nand, maybe more important, talk a bit about those things that are yet \nto come. There are many, and they are things that we must do.\n\n[[Page S52]]\n\n  Certainly the stimulus package is one. I am delighted we are going to \ntake that up and take a look at it. In some ways I think it would be \nwell if we could hold our fire until after we hear the President's \nnotions next Tuesday. I am sure he will talk a great deal about the \nstimulus package as well as the other domestic and terrorism needs.\n  But, as we do that--as I guess in everything--I hope we take a real \nlook, the best we can, as to what our expectations are on a stimulus \npackage. It is easy to talk about it. It sounds good. On the other \nhand, in the Finance Committee, where last year we held a number of \nhearings and talked to quite a number of professional economists--the \nbest in the country, as a matter of fact--as the Presiding Officer will \nrecall, there was no real consensus as to what is best done to have the \nimmediate impact that we would like to have on the economy.\n  So I hope we give some thought, individually and collectively, to \nwhat it is that our goals are with respect to a stimulus package. It \nwould be easy to begin to use that as a means for funding other kinds \nof things that may very well be justified as issues but not justified \nin this economic stimulus package.\n  Further, I am pleased to hear, at least from some, that the prospects \nfor the economy seem to be better even than they were when we left here \nback in November or December. I hope that is the case. Again, no one \nknows exactly what that will be.\n  But I hope we do give this some thought and seek to move in a way \nthat creates a better economy and creates jobs. There are people out \nthere who need help, for various reasons. That is going to be part of \nit. But the real purpose is to create a better economy so there are \njobs for people. It is not always easy. It is hard to get a feel for \nit.\n  I was interested, a while back, to hear that in 1996, which was one \nof the good times for the economy, unemployment was 5.7 percent.\n  We are never going to get rid of unemployment because obviously there \nis always some.\n  I hope we do that.\n  Second, of course, I am hopeful we can move on to agriculture, and to \nour farm bill. The current farm bill expires this year. Of course, we \nwill have a new farm bill. I think all the work we have done on it over \nthe last several months can now be picked up again and we can go \nforward.\n  Again, I hope we can sort of give an image as to what we want \nagriculture to be over time so that we don't just deal with short-term \nissues. What do we want the image to be for agriculture? Do we want it \nto be market oriented so production is generally related to the \npotential of selling those goods? That is the economic system for most \neverything. At the same time, of course, because agriculture is unique \nand has unique problems, I think there needs to be a safeguard \nsomewhere underneath. It is going to be difficult to do that. We don't \nwant to doing something that is going to increase production for a \nproduct so that it then doesn't have market demand. At the same time, \nwe want to protect farmers and ranchers from some of the things over \nwhich they certainly have no control.\n  There has been quite a bit of discussion about AMTA payments that \nwere made to the farmers over the last 6 years in the farm program. I \nthink at least that is the perception. I think it is true the big \npayments have gone to relatively few. Even though we always talk about \nfamily farmers, it is also true that family farmers are getting large \npayments. But many are corporate farmers who get large amounts of \nmoney. We need to look at what we can do about that issue.\n  There are a number of things I think are very important. I come from \nWyoming where livestock is our largest agricultural issue, and we have \nlots of public land. The country of origin labeling is in our bill. It \nis very important. I think it is important for consumers to be able to \nlook at a package of meat and see that it came from the United States, \nor, if it didn't, from where it came. That is fine. Let them have a \nchoice.\n  I just can't imagine why that is not labeled. Almost everything we \nbuy has the country of origin on the label.\n  I hope we also deal with this question of concentration of packaging. \nAs I understand it, we have about three packers that control 80 percent \nof the kill.\n  Under the marketing system, the producer goes to the auction market \nand gets what the livestock is worth that day. We also have an \namendment on ownership of livestock. It has already been on the floor. \nI think that is very important.\n  In this bill, there are provisions on conservation of land. I think \nthat is excellent.\n  As we talked about this bill last year, I traveled all over our State \ntalking to people about what they wanted and what they believed the \nneed was for their counties, their cities, and their families. One of \nthe things they want is open space. We want to continue to have open \nspace and some planning for those lands. CPP has been one thing, but \nnow we are talking about something a little different--whether it is \ntimber or grasslands--some protection for open space for family farmers \nand ranchers who can't really afford to set aside.\n  Technical assistance to farmers and ranchers on waterfall is \nimportant, so they are able to continue to use water, and to protect \nwater quality is important. That is in the bill as well, and it is \nincreased substantially. I think that is a very good thing.\n  There are some things in the bill about which we will differ on the \nfloor. It will be difficult to come together on them. But I think we \nhave an obligation to do that.\n\n  One of the difficult issues is the drought issue. In the West, we are \nfaced with many places in the third year of drought. In the West, \nagain, where there is relatively low rainfall, one of the important \nissues is to have snow pack in the mountains so when it thaws out in \nthe spring it runs into reservoirs and then it is used for irrigation. \nThe reservoirs have been at unusually low levels--not only because of \nthe drought this year but because of droughts in previous years.\n  Those are some of the things with which we need to grapple. I look \nforward to the opportunity to do that.\n  Another bill that will be coming up soon is the energy bill. We have \nheard a great deal about that. It is interesting that 6 months ago or \nso we had $2.50-a-gallon gasoline. We had problems. Now gas prices are \ndown. California has apparently managed to overcome its difficulties to \nsome extent. There has been some polling that shows many people \nunderstand that an energy policy over time is very important.\n  I hear the accusations that all the administration wants to do is \ndrill and produce. That is true. We worked with the bill. We have seen \nthe drafts of policy that we put together with the administration. It \nhas in it a number of items--production being one of them, of course, \nand another is alternative fuels. Another is research for alternative \nfuels, and another is transportation, such as electricity and \ntransmission lines. There have to be generators to move it.\n  I think there are some real opportunities for us to evaluate where we \nneed to be. Clearly, the upheaval in the Middle East has something to \ndo with our imports. We find ourselves being 60-percent dependent on \nimports of energy, which is more than we are comfortable with.\n  We have some real challenges, and some real opportunities. I am \nhopeful. Certainly the reason we are here is because we have different \nviews on some things. We have different views on needs, depending on \nwhere we are from and what our philosophies are. That is part of being \nhere. There is nothing wrong with that. But we need to put those \ndifferences out there and come to some conclusions supported by the \nmajority.\n  I think it is going to be an exciting time. Hopefully, we can look \nback at the end of this year and say: Yes, we have been able to deal \nwith the crisis of terrorism. We need to look back and be very proud of \nwhat this Congress has done in that regard.\n  I think we need to be very proud of the American people. I have never \nseen such a reaction of commitment to do something about terrorism in \nmy State, and I am sure in other places. I am very proud of America for \nthat dedication. I certainly hope we can continue it because it is not \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S53]]\n\nbe a short-term proposition. Also, because of that requirement, I think \nwe will have to be more careful with how we spend money in the domestic \narea where there is additional emergency spending such as this. You \ncan't necessarily keep spending without some consideration for \nemergencies.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards).

The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2698\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity that we now \nhave to revisit the question of economic stimulus. This was a \ncontentious debate before we ended the First Session of the 107th \nCongress last December. Over the course of the last several weeks, of \ncourse, we have made an effort to try to find what I call ``common \nground'' in an effort to expedite the consideration of economic \nstimulus and to move this process forward.\n  I don't have a calendar in the Chamber at this point, but I remind my \ncolleagues that we have very little time between now and the Founders' \nDay recess to do all of the work that Republicans and Democrats have \nindicated is important to both our agendas. Both caucuses have \nindicated a strong desire to deal with economic stimulus, a strong \ndesire to deal with election reform, a strong desire to finish the farm \nbill, and, certainly, a strong desire to deal with energy. My hope is \nwe could deal with all of those pieces of legislation prior to the \nFounders' Day recess. In order to do that, we have to maximize the use \nof every day.\n  We have 2 days this week. We have only 2 days next week because of \nthe Republican retreat. Then we have 2 weeks following that to complete \nour work on all of the bills I have just mentioned.\n  In an effort to move the process along, I will propound a unanimous \nconsent request within the hour to see if we might find an agreement on \nprocedure on the economic stimulus bill. I would propose, as I \nsuggested to Senator Lott yesterday, four amendments on a side. I am \nnot wedded to that. If people have a desire to offer more amendments \nthan that, we could do that. But we have to get this ball started.\n  I am concerned, frankly, about reports I have received overnight that \nthere are some on the Republican side who want to slow walk this bill, \nwho don't want to bring it to closure, who, for whatever reason, have \ndecided now that we are on this bill that they don't want to have a \nvote on final passage until perhaps 2 weeks from now. Keep in mind, we \nare not in session next Wednesday. Some have suggested that we should \nnot have a vote on this bill until after the State of the Union \nMessage--that is Tuesday night--which means we then wouldn't be able to \ncomplete our work until the following week.\n  I know of all the cries and anger and the anguish expressed by some \nfor the fact that we were not able to complete our work on the economic \nstimulus bill last December. How ironic it would be that some of those \nwho have criticized the inability to come to some conclusion would now \nbe responsible for delaying it even further.\n  I hope that is not the case. I hope we can get an agreement that will \nallow us to reach some procedural conclusion so we can complete the \nsubstantive work on this bill prior to the end of the week.\n  Let me briefly lay out exactly what it is we are suggesting. Two \ncircles on this chart depict virtually all of the proposals that have \nbeen made by either Republican or Democratic Senators, and oftentimes \nMembers of the House, with regard to economic stimulus. Democrats have \nproposed increasing unemployment benefits, adding unemployment \ncompensation coverage for part-time workers and recent hires, and \nproviding affordable group health coverage for the unemployed. The job \ncreation tax credit for businesses was also something that we felt \nwould go a long way to addressing the need to stimulate the economy \nfrom the business side.\n  We also supported extending the unemployment benefits for 13 weeks, \ntax rebates for those who didn't get them the last time, the bonus \ndepreciation that would accelerate the depreciation on investments in \nbusiness, and then the fiscal relief for States.\n  States are very concerned that bonus depreciation, in particular, is \ngoing to cost them about $5 billion. They are also concerned that the \nMedicaid costs are going up dramatically. So the fiscal relief for \nStates is something that has been the subject of a number of very \nurgent letters to us from Republican and Democratic Governors alike.\n  Our Republican colleagues suggested accelerating rate reductions, the \nrepeal of the corporate AMT--the alternative, and health coverage for \nunemployed workers through individual insurance markets. They also \nsuggested extending unemployment benefits. They suggested the tax \nrebates. They proposed bonus depreciation and fiscal relief for States.\n  Several weeks ago we began considering, well, how can we move this \nbill forward? The suggestion was, let's just take the common elements \nin the two circles, the overlap you see here on this chart, and \nconsider that as sort of the base proposal that might be used as a way \nto move the bill forward, while not denying Senators the right, of \ncourse, to offer other ideas, other suggestions, if the requisite 60 \nvotes on points of order can be acquired.\n  So that is really what is before the Senate right now. We have taken \na House vehicle, the adoption tax credit, and we are amending the \nadoption tax credit procedurally with this proposal as a way in which \nto allow Senators to begin the debate on economic recovery.\n  The CBO has provided a real service to us over the last couple of \nweeks, and I don't know if all of our colleagues had the opportunity to \nsee it. If they have not, I urge them to take a look at it. But the CBO \nmade an evaluation of the stimulative impact of all of the proposals I \nhave just listed here in these circles. The stimulative impact, \nobviously, is a very significant factor, I believe, on what it is we \ndecide we want to offer for economic stimulus. The payroll tax holiday \noffered by Senator Domenici is one of the provisions that had the \nbiggest bang for the buck, according to the CBO. Of course, we \nsuggested that that might be a component, but because there isn't \nagreement on it, unfortunately, it certainly doesn't fit into this \ncommon ground proposal at this point. I would have supported it. I \nstill do. But that has a large bang for the buck. Additional tax \nrebates have a medium bang for the buck according to the CBO.\n  We are proposing in this common ground proposal the tax rebate for \nthose who didn't get any help the first time. Temporary investment \nincentives, such as the bonus depreciation --again, that is a medium \nbang for the buck--better than some, not as good as others. That is \nalso in the common ground proposal. So you have two of the items in the \ncommon ground proposal, according to the CBO, that have a medium bang \nfor the buck, medium stimulative value.\n  Look at what the CBO said about accelerated rate cuts. They said it \nhad a small bang for the buck, and a corporate AMT repeal falls into \nthe small category, very little stimulative value.\n  Now, this isn't a Democrat position, this isn't an analysis made by \none of my staff; this is the Congressional Budget Office which has \nprovided the analysis. So, again, if we want to do what we say we are \ndoing here--provide\n\n[[Page S54]]\n\nsome common ground on stimulative proposals that have the most effect--\naccording to the CBO, some of the proposals in here, such as tax \nrebates, bonus depreciation, go a long way.\n  Let me address the unemployment benefits as well because that, too, \nis something I think we ought to say something about. The CBO didn't \naddress that question, but the CRS did. The Congressional Research \nService said:\n\n       Extending unemployment compensation is, in fact, likely to \n     be a more successful policy for stimulating aggregate demand \n     than many other tax/transfer changes. Individuals who are \n     unemployed and who are not or will not be receiving \n     unemployment benefits are much more likely to spend \n     additional incomes than, say, higher income individuals who \n     receive tax cuts.\n\n  That is in a memo provided by CRS to Senator Baucus last fall.\n  Mr. President, I simply say again, if we are serious about moving \nthis forward, let's take those proposals that analysts and economists \nhave said have stimulative value. If we are serious about finding \ncompromise, what could possibly be wrong with taking the proposals that \nboth sides had in their initial proposal as a way with which to at \nleast get to conference? This is a ticket to conference. Then we can \nhave another debate about what ought to be in the bill. That is what we \nare doing here. I just hope our colleagues will recognize that and will \nrecognize how limited a timeframe we have to address this issue and \nmove this legislation forward.\n  So I am asking my colleagues on the other side, let's come to some \nagreement on amendments procedurally, let's come to some agreement on \namendments substantively, but let's come together. Time is wasting. I \ndon't want to see this bill slow-walked, or see this legislation \nlanguish on the floor for days, when we can do this and move on to \nother things that need to be done sometime very soon.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, our status is, am I right, that we are \non the Finance Committee bill, the tax bill before us?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Daschle amendment No. 2698 is pending.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think my colleague from South Dakota, \nthe distinguished Democrat leader, has made it very clear where we are \ncompared to where we were before Christmas. Let me repeat that we had \nbeen working on an economic stimulus package in various ways for \nseveral weeks, most of it not here on the floor of the Senate but in \nsmall groups, and different groups, and bipartisan groups, and partisan \ngroups, to come together to see what we could get to get through the \nSenate--a stimulus package--and the need for it was directly related to \nthe downturn in the economy that came mostly as a result of September \n11 terrorist attacks. And then what finally happened was just before we \nadjourned. A White House-centrist package that was put together by \nmostly Republican and Democrat centrists, working with the White House, \nwas a bill that passed the House of Representatives before the bill \ncame here to the Senate. Then in the closing days of the Senate, prior \nto adjournment for the holidays, the bill did not come up on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  So we are back here now, afterwards, to a point where we are dealing \nwith something that is still very important to help dislocated workers \nand to help bring the economy back from the recession caused by \nSeptember 11, the war on terrorism, and the attacks against America.\n  I emphasize again that where we ended up before Christmas was the \nHouse of Representatives passing a bill that had been worked out by, I \nthink for the most part--and I hope I am not unfair to the House of \nRepresentatives on this--by a group of centrists in the Senate, made up \nof both Republicans and Democrats, who came up with a plan that had \nWhite House support. The President said he would sign it. You never \nknow for sure until you take a vote, but it looked as if this White \nHouse-centrist package would have had in the low fifties--but a \nmajority of the Senate--to pass the Senate, if it had been able to be \nbrought up.\n  We were not allowed to bring it up and discuss it. That is a \ndecision, under our Constitution, that the majority leader can make. I \nmay find fault with the decision; I do not find fault with his right to \ndo that.\n  Now on the second day we are back in session in the new year, this \nbill has been brought up. The sad commentary is we are 1 more month \ninto the recession, 1 more month of 800,000 people unemployed because \nof the September 11 terrorist attacks, and a lot of people who used to \nhave health insurance do not have health insurance and dislocated \nworkers are not being given the help the bipartisan White House-\ncentrist stimulus plan would have given them. Also, we do not have \nthose tax incentives that will stimulate the economy.\n  As the distinguished majority leader just said, there are certain tax \nrebate plans the CBO said would be of help in stimulating the economy. \nThere are certain accelerated depreciations that were in the bipartisan \npackage that would help the economy. So, effectively, we have lost 30 \ndays, and people who needed help are not getting the help.\n  I am glad to be back here, though, and I am glad the majority leader \nhas taken the initiative of bringing this issue up. Hopefully we can \nget an agreement to pass a bill and get it to the President.\n  I need to reiterate that we had a bill worked out by a group of \nDemocrats and Republicans in the middle of the political spectrum in \nthe Senate. That is why we call them centrists. They worked out a bill \nwith the White House. The White House said the President would sign the \nbill. The bill received a favorable vote in the House of \nRepresentatives, and here we are.\n  I would like to get back to where we left off before the holidays, so \nI am going to spend my time this morning before other speakers come to \nthe Chamber to speak on this very important issue of why the bipartisan \nWhite House-centrist stimulus package ought to still be the package \nbefore the Senate, even more so than the amendment about which the \ndistinguished majority leader just spoke and why it should pass the \nSenate, although I sensed in the majority leader's statements that he \nis willing to look at things beyond his proposal--at least I hope I \ninterpreted that right--so that we can get something to the President.\n  I hope somehow our debate can persuade him to come back to what we \nhave: a bipartisan White House-centrist stimulus plan that was before \nthe Senate because we know that it has passed the House, and all it has \nto do is pass the Senate and the President will sign it and these \n800,000 unemployed workers who do not have health insurance, if they \nhave exhausted their first 26 weeks of unemployment, will still have \nunemployment compensation.\n  I am going to start with some discussion of the tremendous commitment \nto displaced workers that the White House-centrist stimulus plan has in \nit. The plan's unemployment insurance proposal represents what I \nconsider a very unprecedented commitment to dislocated American workers \nand, in the end, probably may be something, if one looks at long-term \nsolutions to the problems of uninsured, to help uninsured people as \nwell.\n  I start with the fact that it provides an additional 13 weeks of \nunemployment benefits to eligible workers. Remember that about 10 \npercent of the unemployed people use up to 26 weeks. Maybe that is even \nhigher than 10 percent now because of the recession. There is always a \nneed for some more unemployment compensation for some people. We do not \nalways respond to that with an additional 13 weeks. We are doing it \nbecause there was a calamity on September 11 which has speeded up the \nunemployment index as a result by 800,000.\n\n  We have an estimated 3 million unemployed workers who would qualify \nfor benefits averaging $230 a week. These benefits would be 100-percent \nfederally funded.\n  The bipartisan White House-centrist plan would also transfer an \nadditional $9 billion to State unemployment trust funds. This transfer \nwould provide the States with the flexibility to pay administrative \ncosts, provide additional benefits, and avoid raising unemployment \ntaxes during the current recession.\n  Consider the bipartisan White House-centrist commitment to providing\n\n[[Page S55]]\n\nhealth care for dislocated workers. This commitment goes further and \nwider than any other proposal, and it gets more help to more people \nmore quickly than any other proposal.\n  It commits over $19 billion, out of the total package of about $100 \nbillion, to health insurance assistance. This is over six times as much \nmoney for temporary health insurance assistance as provided under the \noriginal stimulus proposals.\n  The bipartisan White House-centrist plan takes a three-pronged \napproach to get health insurance to people in need.\n  First, the plan provides a refundable, advanceable tax credit to all \ndisplaced workers eligible for unemployment insurance, not just those \neligible for COBRA. The value of the credit is 60 percent of the \npremium. The credit has no cap and is available to individuals for a \ntotal of 12 months for the next 2 years, including 2001 to 2003.\n  The individuals can stay in their employer COBRA coverage, or they \ncan choose policies in the individual market that may better fit their \nfamily's needs. This only makes sense because we should not lock people \ninto one straitjacket of health insurance which under some proposals \nwould be just the COBRA approach because sometimes these policies are \ntoo expensive for people to keep. I say that even with the 60-percent \nsubsidy that we would provide.\n  The bipartisan White House-centrist proposal also includes a major \nnew insurance reform to protect people who have had employer-sponsored \ncoverage and go out into the private market for the first time after \nbeing laid off. The bipartisan White House-centrist proposal makes \nCOBRA protection available to people who have only had 12 months of \nemployer-sponsored coverage rather than 18 months under current law. By \ndoing this, we greatly expand the group of displaced workers who cannot \nbe turned down for coverage or excluded because of a preexisting \ncondition.\n  The new 12-month standard is especially important to people with \nchronic conditions who have difficulty getting affordable insurance.\n  The second prong of the White House-centrist bipartisan proposal is \n$4 billion in enhanced national emergency grants for States which can \nbe used to help all workers--not just those eligible for a tax credit--\npay for health insurance because they have become unemployed.\n  The third prong of the proposal includes $4.3 billion for a one-time \ntemporary State health care assistance payment to States to help \nbolster those States' Medicaid Programs. We are seeing almost all 50 \nStates in trouble with their Medicaid Program because of the recession. \nAs we know, the Medicaid Program is an important safety net program for \nlow-income workers and families of disabled workers.\n  I yield the floor now to other colleagues, but I suggest that we have \na lot in this bipartisan White House-centrist proposal that can \nimmediately, when the President signs the bill, help the 800,000 \nworkers who are unemployed because of the September 11 terrorist \nattacks on America.\n  We ought to get the show on the road. It should have been done before \nChristmas. It is not too late to do it right now. I hope people would \nstudy this proposal that has been developed by a group of people in the \ncenter of the Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, and move this \nbill along. We have 50 votes for it, and if people will study, I think \nwe will even get a much higher percentage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in politics, like everything else, common \nsense dictates what is sensible and reasonable and really what people \nshould do, and common sense in this debate indicates the two sides, \nDemocrats and Republicans, should separate what they do not agree on \nand move forward on what they agree.\n  Senator Daschle has offered a very reasonable approach to stimulating \nthe economy. He has said the Democrats have certain things they want \nthat the Republicans will not support. The Republicans have legislation \nthey want to initiate that we will not support. There are things we \nboth agree on, Democrats and Republicans. There has never been any \nquestion about the fact there are certain things we agree on.\n  Senator Daschle outlined four things we agree on. As an example, \nextending unemployment benefits. Everyone agrees we should do something \nto help the unemployed. If we want to stimulate an economy, give money \nto people who have no money and they will go out and spend it on \nthings, and that is stimulative.\n  Now we are in a situation where we are being told: Of course, we \nagree on those things, but we do not want to go forward with it. And I \nsay, why?\n  With all due respect to the Republican leadership and the people on \nthe Republican side, maybe there is a game being played called a \n``blame game.'' In yesterday's Daily Monitor, which comes out actually \nin the evening, the publication reports they had a conversation with \nSenator Lott.\n  A paragraph out of the Daily Monitor reads:\n\n       Lott predicted many amendments would be offered. Asked \n     whether that would mean debate would likely last through \n     next Tuesday, the day of President Bush's State of the \n     Union Address, Lott said it might, paused, then winked.\n\n  Those people were saying there was a lot of laughter after his wink.\n\n       Bush is expected to propose his own stimulus plan in the \n     speech.\n\n  That is what this is all about. This is what it has been about for a \nlong time. We are trying to come forward with a stimulus package that \nhelps the American people.\n  Some of their proposals have merit, some of our proposals have merit, \nbut not enough to get 60 votes. So why do we not do those things we \nagree on? The answer is not blowing in the wind. The answer is the \nminority does not want a stimulus package to pass prior to the State of \nthe Union Message next Tuesday. It is as simple as that.\n  So no matter how much good faith Senator Daschle might show, no \nmatter how much common sense Senator Daschle may pronounce, the fact is \nit appears they are not going to let us do anything until after next \nTuesday, which is too bad.\n  I attended a meeting at the White House yesterday with the President, \nSenator Daschle, and the Republican leadership. Statements were made, \nand there was a lot of feel-good stuff about ``we need to work \ntogether,'' and we do. But winks and nods are not the way to pass \nlegislation. The way to pass legislation is to agree on things we agree \non and move forward with that.\n  As far as the things we do not agree on, Senator Daschle has \nsuggested yesterday and on several occasions, let us come with the \npackage he has suggested and have each side offer amendments, two \namendments, three amendments, four amendments. We could complete those \nby week's end. Certainly we can do it by the State of the Union date.\n  I assume we could go one step further. It was even suggested we put \ntime limits on each of those amendments, an hour or 2 hours on each \namendment. But, no, we waited. The Republicans held a conference \nyesterday evening starting at 5:30 and it went for a couple of hours to \ndetermine whether they should proceed on the suggestion of Senator \nDaschle that we go forward with what both parties agree on.\n  Now maybe there should be more stimulus to this economy than that, \nbut at least it would be something to start with. Think of the \nunemployed as an example. Think also of the small businesspeople who \ncould really use a depreciation allowance that was bigger and broader \nthan the one now. That is one of the things everyone agrees on, but yet \nthey are waiting in the wings.\n  What about States who are desperate for Medicare help, why are we not \ndoing something there? Everybody says we should do it. Well, I am sorry \nto say it is because of the wink. We are going to stall things until \nTuesday night, and then the President can come and speak on national \ntelevision and say, why can Congress not get together and give us a \nstimulus package?\n  I say to the American people, I say to the people in my State of \nNevada, we could have a stimulus package in the next day or two if we \ngo forward on this proposal to agree on what is agreed upon by \neveryone. There is no dispute. No one is coming and saying we do not \nagree on those four things that Senator Daschle wants. Everybody agrees \non those. What they are unwilling to do is to take away the fact\n\n[[Page S56]]\n\nthat President Bush has already written his speech and he has a \nparagraph or two long paragraphs, about the country being in an \neconomic strait and we need a stimulus package, and why will Congress \nnot work with him to get a stimulus package.\n\n  I could help write that speech because that is what it is going to be \nabout. I do not think I need to help write the speech because it has \nalready been written and they do not want to change any words of that \nspeech. They want to proceed and try to come up with a political \nadvantage in saying the Democrats, led by Senator Daschle, will not \nallow them to go forward on a stimulus package. I am saying that is \nuntrue. It is unfair. It is unrealistic.\n  Common sense dictates we should go forward with a program that \neveryone agrees we should go forward with, costing about $70 billion. \nIt would be $70 billion worth of stimulus that would be reciprocated \nnumerous times and help the economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to explain what I \nthink is really going on. There is an old saying that if you let me \ndefine the terms of the debate, I will win the debate every time. That, \nI think, is what the majority leader and the assistant majority leader \nare trying to do today. They are suggesting, with a straight face, that \nthe proposal is agreed to by both sides, so why should we not proceed \nwith it and who would want to amend it?\n  Well, it is not agreed to by both sides. Let us get back to the \ndefinition. Something that is called an agreement, that both sides have \nagreed to the provisions of, would seemingly be something that could \npass very quickly, and that would not be amended.\n  So why are those of us on this side of the aisle saying, ``Wait a \nminute, you are trying to hijack the President's stimulus package, redo \nit the way you want it, and still characterize it as something that we \nagree with?'' We do not agree with it.\n  What happened is after September 11, whether the economy was \nbeginning to improve by then or not, it was clear the events of \nSeptember 11 were driving our economy down, especially in the travel \nand tourism area but all throughout the economy. Large and small \nbusinesses both were beginning to suffer. People stopped traveling. \nThey did not invest as much. Businesses were not investing as much. The \nPresident very quickly called for a proposal that would stimulate the \neconomy and protect and create new jobs.\n  That was the essence of his proposal, to protect jobs and to create \nnew jobs. In fact, he was able to put together a program and propose it \non October 4 and 5, about 3 weeks after the September 11 event, and he \ncalled upon Congress to join him in this effort.\n  Some of us on this side of the aisle were urging the President to \npropose certain things we thought would be very effective in \nstimulating the economy, and the President said no. He said that while \nhe agreed with us that cutting the capital gains tax and making the tax \ncuts permanent and doing things of that sort would really help to \nstimulate the economy and protect jobs, he was not going to propose \nthat in his package because now that we are in a time of war, he \nbelieved that he had to act in a bipartisan way to promote unity among \nour leaders in Washington, and to get both Democrats and Republicans to \nquickly agree on a package we can pass in Congress and he could sign \ninto law. That is what is needed for the American people. He said, I am \ngoing to propose a package that includes a few of the things that \nRepublicans think are good ideas to stimulate the economy and a few of \nthe things our friends on the Democratic side believe should be in such \na package, and I will present that in a bipartisan way.\n\n  He did that on October 4 and 5. There were ideas that represented the \nmain themes of both political parties. Republicans had primarily asked \nfor a repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, acceleration of \nall marginal income tax reductions, and accelerated enhanced \ndepreciation. Those were the kinds of things that Alan Greenspan and \nothers who came before our Finance Committee said would help stimulate \nthe economy and get over what he defined as an ``investment \nrecession.'' In other words, businesses were not doing enough to make \ncapital expenditures. These kinds of provisions would help provide the \nincentive for those capital expenditures.\n  Democrats had called for other things: Payments to nontaxpayers who \nwere not part of the rebate program from the original tax cuts of 2001, \nan extension of unemployment insurance, and grants to States for health \nbenefits for displaced workers.\n  The President said: I will take those three components that our \nDemocratic friends supported, I will take the three components that \nsome Democrats and Republicans support, and I will put them together in \na bipartisan bill in the hope we can quickly, in a unified, bipartisan \nway, enact this package for the benefit of all Americans.\n  By the way, the House quickly passed a version of what the President \nproposed, but not exactly what he proposed. The majority leader in the \nSenate said no.\n  Let me fast forward, before going through the rest of the history, \nwhat the majority leader and the assistant majority leader have talked \nabout this morning, something they call a lowest common denominator \npackage, something to which both sides agree. They have defined it that \nway. What they have done is take the things from the President's \noriginal proposal that they wanted and said: We agree to those, so that \nis our package. By the way, we will take one of the things the \nPresident wanted and stick it in there. That means we have a \nbipartisan, lowest common denominator package. Why can't we just pass \nthis little bill? At least we both agree on it.\n  As the assistant majority leader said: Maybe there should be more \nstimulus in the bill. Indeed, there should be more stimulus in the \nbill. There is only one item in the bill that provides any kind of \nstimulus to the economy, only one item, the accelerated depreciation--\nwhich we still don't know the details of--that provides investment \nincentive to protect and create new jobs. It is clearly not a stimulus \npackage.\n  However, by defining what we have agreed upon as what you have agreed \nupon, they have tried to hijack the President's proposal and \nrecharacterize it as something it is not. It is not something we have \nagreed upon. The President would never have proposed just the items in \nthis bill and said, that is good enough for me, it is a balanced \npackage.\n  It is designed to provide benefits to people who are unemployed. That \ndoes not stimulate the economy. But the President believed that was \nimportant to do. At the same time, it included limits that would \nactually provide more incentive for investment--that critical element \nof capital that is needed to spur the economy and protect and create \njobs.\n\n  The Democratic leader has said: Fine, I will take one part--the part \nI like--say we have not agreed on the rest, and define that as a bill \nupon which we have all agreed. It reminds me of the old saying: What is \nmine is mine, and what is yours is up for grabs.\n  They basically pocketed what the President was proposing as a \ncompromise, a bipartisan proposal, taken the part they liked, rejected \nwhat they did not like, and then said: Why not bring that to the floor \nand have a vote on it? After all, it was part of what the President \nproposed. Exactly. It was ``part'' of what the President proposed, but \nnot, importantly, the part that would stimulate the economy.\n  I am all for helping those who are unemployed. The President made a \nbig point of wanting to help those who are unemployed and therefore to \nextend the unemployment benefits. However, I think we all agree, people \nwould rather have a paycheck than an unemployment check. This bill does \nvirtually nothing to stimulate the economy, to protect jobs, and to \ncreate new jobs. It would be a sham.\n  When the minority leader yesterday said, you bet it will take beyond \nnext Tuesday to get this right, all he was doing was stating a fact \nthat, without amendments to this bill which provide real stimulus, of \ncourse we could not, with a straight face, vote on this bill and call \nit a stimulus package. Of course, the President is right next Tuesday \nto urge us to do what he asked us to do in early October, throughout \nthe month of October, throughout the\n\n[[Page S57]]\n\nmonth of November, and then December, until we finally went home on \nDecember 22 without having acted on a stimulus package.\n  The economy is still not doing very well. People are still out of \nwork. What the President is going to be asking is to please get on with \nthe job of enacting a bill and to not redefine this by simply taking \nwhat you like out of his proposal and recharacterizing that as a lowest \ncommon denominator agreement upon which we both agreed.\n  I see the distinguished majority leader is here. Before I conclude my \nremarks, let me make this statement. I think the proposal he has made \nhere treats the President in a very unfair way. I know the President \nwas trying to reach out to the other side, to include things the other \nside wanted, and that he wanted, in an effort to be bipartisan, in an \neffort to try to get this done quickly, so we wouldn't be into next \nyear, the year 2002, when we finally passed a stimulus package. I do \nknow for a fact, he left things out I would have liked to have seen in \nthere. I don't think the distinguished majority leader probably would \nhave liked them very much. The President knew that. He didn't want to \nhave a highly partisan bill. He didn't want to have a particularly \ncontroversial bill. That is why he proposed a balanced package.\n  I think it takes unfair advantage of the President, in his offer to \nbe bipartisan and to try to get this done quickly, to just take the \npart you like and say, that is the part we agree with, we reject almost \nall the rest of it, but why not pass that?\n  Let me go back a little bit in time to review what happened. After \nthe President made his proposal on October 4 and 5, the House passed a \nbill. The Finance Committee, on which I sit, began to work on the bill. \nBy the way, remember, the Finance Committee enacted a bipartisan tax \ncut proposal earlier in the year, so it is a committee that has in the \npast and even began last year working together in a bipartisan fashion \nto get things done. I thought I could do that with the stimulus \npackage, taking the President's proposal, perhaps modifying it, but \ntrying our best to come up with something that would be passed in a \nbipartisan and quick fashion. It turned out that the Finance Committee \nwas not going to write the bill. It would be written in a partisan \nfashion by just one party, not both. When the package finally came \nbefore the committee, I thought it was interesting, I never could \nfigure out who claimed parentage of it.\n\n  Several leaders on the Democratic side said actually they didn't \nwrite it, and with good reason: It was not something of which to be \nproud. It had $54 billion in new spending; only $21 billion could be \ncharacterized remotely as stimulative measures. Out of a total of $117 \nbillion in the bill, it had $5 billion in extra agricultural spending, \nprovisions added in the dead of night to bring Democrats on board--and \nalso, in my personal view, as a means of getting some of the special \ninterests on board on the bill.\n  For example, the Commodity Purchase Program, and expenditures for \nthings such as soybeans, pumpkins, snap beans, rum, tuna--all kinds of \nthings--special tax credits for Amtrak, almost all of which have \nvirtually nothing to do with getting the economy going again as a \nresult of the September 11 events, but all of which were designed to \nbring more people on to support the bill.\n  Needless to say, that bill could never pass. It was voted out of \ncommittee on a strictly party line vote and obviously did not pass \nbefore the end of the session. The President, in an effort to try to \nmove this thing along, kept encouraging us to develop a bill that could \npass. The House passed another bill which I thought was a much better \nbill than the first bill they passed and much more along the lines that \nsome of our colleagues on the Democratic side were proposing. Still, \nthat bill did not come before the Chamber.\n  Finally, in desperation, in mid-December, a group of Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Senate--the so-called centrist group--got together \nand developed a proposal that they thought would at least be an \napproach to stimulus as well as taking care of unemployed workers and \nbe representative of the compromise that might bring about the \nPresident's agreement, and which they could then propose to the Senate \nand get it passed.\n  They took it down to the White House and met with the President. He \nsaid: OK, you have a deal. It isn't what I originally proposed, but it \nis a great effort at compromise, and I will agree to it, and I will \nagree to sign it; it is passed.\n  The President urged those of us on the Republican side of the aisle \nin the Senate to lay aside the other things we wanted to try to \naccomplish in this bill in an effort to get this finished before we \nwent home for Christmas--to agree to the centrist coalition approach \nthe Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, described, part of which was in \nhis remarks earlier.\n\n  I also confess that I wasn't enamored by some of the provisions of \nthe bill. I thought it did far too little to stimulate the economy. But \nin an effort to reach bipartisan compromise and get this done before \nthe end of the year, as far as I know, virtually all of my colleagues \non the Republican side of the Senate agreed to support that centrist, \nbipartisan approach which the President said he would sign.\n  Still, the majority leader said no. Instead of taking that proposal \nup, we took up the railroad retirement bill, a big agricultural \nspending bill, and some other items before we went home for Christmas \nand the New Year's recess. We didn't do a stimulus package.\n  Now, we come back in January after the recess when a lot of criticism \nhas been heaped upon those who prevented us from getting a stimulus \npackage voted on, passed, and sent to the President. The American \npeople are not happy with the status quo. I think they understand with \nthe President that we should have done something a long time ago but \nthat it still is not too late to try to help our economy. People \ncontinue to be laid off around the country. We have to help them, not \nonly by temporarily extending their unemployment benefits but, as I \nsaid before, to get them a paycheck and not just unemployment checks. \nThat means providing the capital for investment that will create the \njobs that will put them back to work and get the economy moving again.\n  That is what the President proposed today. It is what the second \nHouse proposal did. It is what, at least to some extent, the centrist \ncoalition proposal would do, and it is necessary that we get on with \nthat job.\n  What is before us today is not that kind of proposal. What is before \nus today is not a compromise. What is before us today is not something \nthat has been ``agreed to'' by both sides. It has been characterized by \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle as moving forward on what \nwe agreed on. That is a mischaracterization. As I said before, it is \ntaking some pieces of the bipartisan proposal the President suggested, \npocketing those, and saying: Well, we both agreed on that. We are going \nto reject the rest of what you proposed, Mr. President, but since you \nproposed this as part of your package, we will characterize that as \nwhat we agreed on, and that is what we will vote on here.\n  That is incorrect, and, as I said before, I think it is taking \nadvantage of the President's good faith efforts to try to move \nsomething forward with which both sides could identify and which would \nhave gotten the economy moving back in October of last year.\n  That is why on this side we have said we are happy to now have this \nstimulus bill on the floor. We can finally begin debating what is \nnecessary to get this economy moving again, take care of the people who \nare unemployed today, and make sure we can get them back to work \ntomorrow. That is the key. But in order to do that, we are going to \nhave to put something in this bill that actually provides stimulus and \nwill help to actually put more capital investment into the system so \njobs can be created and people can go back to work.\n  We can't simply accept what has been put on the floor here, which, as \nI said before, has essentially no stimulus effect in it. That is why we \nare not going to agree to a process which would terminate our ability \nto offer amendments which we see as necessary to try to get this bill \nback to a more balanced kind of a bill and to try to provide something \nthat will actually stimulate the economy.\n\n  I will have more to say about this. I see some of my colleagues on \nthe other\n\n[[Page S58]]\n\nside. I am, frankly, curious to see what their approach to this is, \ngiven the fact it should be very clear by now that they can no longer \ncharacterize this as a bill comprised of things we agreed upon, because \nwe don't agree to them.\n  Three of the four items were in the President's package. In one form \nor another, they were in packages we were willing to support as long as \nthey were accompanied by other provisions, but not standing alone. \nStanding alone, there will be virtually nothing to stimulate the \neconomy. And I don't think we can with a straight face, therefore, say \nthis is a job creation, stimulus package. With the amendments we could \npropose, we could get them. If our colleagues on the other side will be \nopen minded about some of those amendments, I think we can get there.\n  As a matter of fact, we have a couple of amendments ready to go. We \nwill, I think, have majority support on the other side of the aisle. I \nregret that probably it is going to take 60 votes to pass any amendment \nbecause of the rules of the Senate. I am not objecting to the rules. I \nunderstand those rules. But because any amendment is probably going to \ntake 60 votes, it will be very hard for any amendment to pass. As a \nresult, we will probably be stuck with the bill that has already been \nlaid down.\n  But I think it will be interesting to see whether a majority of our \ncolleagues will actually agree to certain proposals such as that \noffered by the centrist coalition. That should suggest there is a \nbipartisan way to proceed here.\n  I just hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will agree \nthat in that circumstance, if at least a majority of the Senate is \nwilling to vote on a compromise package that will have a stimulative \neffect, we have an obligation to get this done for the sake of the \nAmerican people sooner rather than later and that maybe we could work \ntogether and accomplish this result without too many more days having \nelapsed.\n  I will have a little more to say about this in the future. I hope \nvery much that we can over the next few days get to a point where we \ncan pass a bill, go to conference with the House of Representatives, \nand quickly present the President with a bill that will get people back \nto work in this country and get our great economic engine moving \nforward full steam ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto follow the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, about an hour ago I noted that we have a \nlot of work to do in a very short period of time. We have talked \njointly--Republicans and Democrats--about the need to do not only \neconomic stimulus but the farm bill, the energy bill, and the election \nreform bill. We have 2 days this week. We have only 2 days next week. \nAnd then we have 2 weeks before the Founders' Day recess.\n  I do not know how we can accommodate all of those unless we can move \nthis legislation forward. We had lengthy debates about the economic \nstimulus bill for weeks in the remaining period prior to the end of the \nlast session.\n  I suggested to Senator Lott yesterday that perhaps one way we could \nexpedite the consideration of this bill, without any time limits, is \nsimply to get a limit on amendments. I have been told there are some on \nthe Republican side who would rather not complete work on this bill \nperhaps not only not this week or next week but until the week after. I \nhope that is not the case.\n  There is much to be done. As I said, I think there is mutual \nadvantage to getting it done. So I indicated about an hour ago that I \nwould propose a unanimous consent request that would simply recognize \nthe facts I have just stated. I am not wedded to the particular \namendment limit I have suggested in this unanimous consent request. I \nam going to be proposing we limit amendments on either side to four \neach. That would accommodate Senators on either side who may wish to \nadd to this common ground package I have suggested. They can offer a \nsubstitute. They can do any one of a number of things. If four does not \nwork, I am happy to entertain an alternative number. But we have to \nstart with something. So that is my intention.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that there be four first-\ndegree amendments in order for each leader or their designees to the \npending matter; that if the Senate passes H.R. 622, as amended, then \nthe Senate immediately turn to the consideration of H.R. 3529, the \nHouse stimulus bill; that all after the enacting clause be stricken and \nthe text of H.R. 622, as passed, be substituted in lieu thereof; the \nbill be read a third time and passed; the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I object and just note that I do so on behalf \nof the minority leader as well as myself. I note there is no intention \nto delay. If we could pass the bipartisan Centrist Coalition amendment \nand not have a point of order raised on that, we could have this done \nby this afternoon. So the object is not to delay. The object is to try \nto make sure we have a good bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield just for a couple \nof minutes?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield. I will follow the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I tell my good friend and colleague, the majority \nleader, his request was to take up the bill he introduced and have a \nfew amendments on it, and objection was heard on that--I think for good \nreason. But I will tell my friend and colleague, if the majority leader \nis willing to take up the House-passed tax bill, I will work with him \nto come up with a limited number of amendments and see if we can't get \nthat passed in the next couple of days.\n  So if he will modify his request, and instead of using the bill he \nintroduced, to make that the House-passed tax bill, I will work with \nhim to come up with an agreement to limit the amendments and try to get \nit passed in a very expedited fashion.\n  I yield the floor. I just wanted to let my colleague know that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If the majority leader wants to respond, I will \nwithhold for the majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n  I will be brief. Let me just say, the whole purpose in this exercise \nis to find common ground. If this isn't the common ground, I am willing \nto entertain any amendment that might be viewed as better common \nground. But we know that whatever common ground proposal we find has to \nattain at least a 60-vote threshold.\n  We know the House-passed bill will not reach a 60-vote threshold. We \nknow the Democratic proposal will not reach a 60-vote threshold. So \nsimply to take up a bill that we know will fail does not get us any \nfurther along.\n  The whole idea, as I said at the beginning, is to seek some \ncompromise that would allow us a 60-vote threshold. So we are still \nwaiting. We are still searching. We are still hoping we can offer \namendments in the effort to accommodate that goal--a 60-vote threshold.\n  So I appreciate the kind offer of the Senator from Oklahoma, but I \nthink he knows, as I do, that isn't going to get us where we need to go \nif we are going to complete our work on this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from South Dakota, the majority leader, \nyield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota controls the time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask if I might inquire of the majority leader.\n\n[[Page S59]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Please.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I just listened to a rather lengthy discussion by the \nSenator from Arizona about where we are and how we got here. He \ncharacterized the position of the majority leader as having been \nunwilling to compromise on virtually anything at any time for any \nperiod of time. That, it seems to me, is at odds with what has happened \nin the last couple months in relation to economic recovery or the \nstimulus package.\n  I wonder if the Senator from South Dakota could respond to those \nrather lengthy comments about his so-called failure to compromise on \nthese provision.\n  My observation, I would say, has been that the majority leader has \nbeen willing to compromise on virtually all of these provisions in \norder to try to reach an agreement. But despite those compromises, \nthere has not been any budging on the other side.\n  Could the Senator from South Dakota, the majority leader, respond to \nthe assertions we have just heard from the Senator from Arizona?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Unfortunately, I was not in the Chamber when the Senator \nfrom Arizona made his remarks, so it would be difficult for me to \ncomment specifically. But if that is the tenor of the comment made by \nthe Senator, let me simply refer him to my opening remarks today which \nI made about an hour ago.\n  I had a chart that showed, in a circle, the proposals made by the \nRepublicans and, in a circle, the proposals made by the Democrats. \nThere is an overlap of those two circles.\n  The list of items in that overlapped part of the two circles is what \nwe have before us. They are not word for word identically proposed. \nThey are different. The concepts are different.\n  I appreciate the senior Senator from Minnesota helping me with my \nvisual aids, handing me this chart. On this chart is shown the common \nmiddle area which comprises several issues that are common to both \nRepublican and Democratic proposals.\n  We both have proposed unemployment benefits. We both have proposed \ntax rebates. We both have proposed bonus depreciation. We both have \nproposed fiscal relief for States.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As I said, they are not identical, but the components \nare found in both bills. If that isn't the definition of \n``compromise,'' I honestly do not know what is.\n  All I am suggesting is, we take that as the base vehicle and use it \nas the subject for whatever amendments Senators wish to offer. So that \nis really the issue.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has been very kind with his time. I \nappreciate him yielding to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I just will build on what I think the \nmajority leader was saying. I will be very honest. I was listening to \nhim propound this unanimous consent request, and I was thinking: We are \ntalking about four provisions. I don't know how any Senator can \ndisagree with any of them: The tax rebates, the business relief--we can \ngo over all of them--the State stimulus which is critically important \nfor Medicaid, and the extension of 13 weeks of unemployment benefits.\n  Then I think the request was saying there would be two--how many \namendments on each side?--four amendments all together.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. No. No. If the Senator will yield, let me make sure \neveryone understands the proposal. The proposal was that either caucus \nhave a minimum of four amendments to offer in addition. So there would \nbe amendments to the package proposed as the common ground vehicle.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. So what I was thinking about was: Look, I can think of \na number of amendments I would want to do alone, which would extend \nunemployment benefits beyond 13 weeks, which would bump up the \nbenefits, which would increase the eligibility. What about health care \nassistance? I am thinking that might not be enough.\n  But then I was thinking: Look, here is what we agree on; and then \nSenators from both sides of the aisle can bring other amendments to the \nfloor. And I am sure the distinguished Senators from Oklahoma or \nWyoming have other ideas. So do several other Senators. And then we \njust move forward. We have amendments. We vote on them.\n  We are all accountable for our votes. But we do the work of democracy \nas opposed to one big, gigantic stall, which is what we are actually \nexperiencing right now. That is what this is about.\n  I simply want to say that, to me--I keep struggling to do this. I \nkeep struggling to connect all this sort of strategy and tactics with \npeople's lives back home. Sometimes it is hard to do it. We get here \nand get so caught up in how we are going to get it done.\n  The majority leader is trying to move this forward now. But I will \ntell you, there are so many people who are flat on their backs through \nno fault of their own. They are running out--if they have not already--\nof unemployment insurance. They do not have any health care coverage.\n  The States are in a world of trouble right now in terms of their own \nbudgets and Medicaid costs. We could pass this. And maybe there will be \nsome amendments that will be introduced on both sides that will improve \nupon this. Political truth is elusive.\n  My guess is the definition of ``improvement'' of several of my \ncolleagues from the other side might not be my definition. I will have \namendments. I will want to make sure that families can afford to \npurchase health insurance for themselves and their loved ones. I will \nwant to make sure that part-time workers and working poor are eligible \nfor unemployment insurance and that they get better benefits. And \ncolleagues from the other side will have other amendments.\n  Let's be very clear about this. This is one big, gigantic stall. The \nwhole idea is, let's just put it off. Let's not move forward. It is \njust one big coordinated political strategy. Maybe it is a great \npolitical strategy. But from the point of view of people back home, it \nis not.\n  I heard my colleague from Arizona--and this is the last thing I will \nsay about the past; then I will look forward from today on--about how \nwe didn't do the work before the break and how the Democrats didn't do \nthis and didn't do that and there was no ``stimulus plan.'' If my \nmemory serves me correctly--again, the Senator from Arizona might not \nagree--indeed, we had an economic recovery plan. There were 53 votes or \nmaybe 54 votes, and it was blocked on a procedural point. Some would \nview it as filibuster. We didn't get 60 votes. We had a plan. There \nwere some Republicans who supported it. It was terribly important, and \nit was blocked.\n  Now my colleagues are just dying to bring over the House measure. I \ncan't remember whether it has the big Enron bailout money in it now or \nnot. Frankly, the House of Representatives tried so hard to reach back \nto the mid-1980s and get as many billion-dollar or half-a-billion-\ndollar breaks to this large company or that large company or this \nfamily with an income over $500,000 or this family with an income of $1 \nmillion, I can't even remember all they were trying to do.\n  With all due respect, ``Robin Hood in reverse'' tax cuts with 50 \npercent plus of the benefits going to the top 1 percent, not even \nscheduled to take effect for a couple of years, much less giving $1 \nbillion here and $1 billion there to a different multinational \ncorporation, Enron at one point in time included--that may be too \nembarrassing to do any longer--I don't think it has a heck of a lot to \ndo with economic recovery.\n  Economic recovery is the here and now. Economic recovery is how you \nhelp people who are flat on their backs. Economic recovery is how you \nhelp people consume. Economic recovery is Keynesian economics. Economic \nrecovery is how you have a stimulus that really jump starts the economy \nnow. Economic recovery is strategic investment in the economy to get \nthe economy going, not ``Robin Hood in reverse'' tax cuts, not $1 \nbillion here or a half a billion there for this big company and that \nbig multinational corporation, not even scheduled to take effect right \nnow, having nothing to do with getting the economy going right now.\n  But I will tell you what it does do. We will see a lot of this over \nthe next couple of weeks. What it does do is assure a huge, ideological \nvictory for Senators who believe that when it comes to the most \npressing issues of people's lives, there is not much the\n\n[[Page S60]]\n\nGovernment can or should do which, by the way, is a great philosophy \nwhen you own your own large corporation. It doesn't work for the vast \nmajority of families and working people in our States.\n\n  If we go forward with what my colleagues are talking about--and I \ncertainly would love for us to go forward; I would like for this \nunanimous consent request to be accepted--we will start with what \nSenator Daschle has offered. I don't think very many Senators are \nopposed to any of these provisions. The Senator from Oklahoma is. In \nwhich case, we will have debate. Then we will have an up-or-down vote. \nThen there will be other amendments. And all of that will work out.\n  But the other part of this is, with all due respect, I think what is \nhappening here right now is, it is about more than economic recovery. \nThat is part of it. This is a big, gigantic stall. My colleagues from \nthe other side of the aisle don't want to move forward on this economic \nrecovery package. We could move forward. We have a minimum of four \namendments on each side. We debate them, and we vote on them. And \npeople back home hold us accountable. In addition, what we can agree \non, we agree on, which will provide at least some help for people and \nmaybe even some help for the economy.\n  I am not sure actually whether or not we have anywhere near enough of \nan economic recovery package here, but I sure would like to start with \nwhat we agree on. I would sure not like to see this stalled out.\n  The other agenda I want to speak on for a minute or two is this \ngigantic stall today in the context of trying to add on to the tax cuts \nwhich are going to bleed this economy. The truth is, all this \ndiscussion, CBO analysis about deficits and where we are going, not \nonly raises questions about the surplus, but you are going to see it in \nthe President's budget plan. You will see a budget plan that basically \nis going to say, forget the commitment to fully funding IDEA, kids with \nspecial needs, and helping out schools and education in our States.\n  That is all I am hearing about back in Minnesota. When I go to the \nschool board meetings, 1,000 people show up at a time. The surpluses \nare gone. Teachers are being eliminated. Class sizes are going up. \nAfterschool programs are being eliminated, huge fees for co-curricular \nactivities, be it music or athletics, on and on. And people are saying \nto me: Paul, thanks. The Senate did a pretty good job on this, a real \ngood job, bipartisan, voted for full funding for kids with special \nneeds. It would have been $2 billion more for our State over the next \n10 years. It would have made a difference. It would have been $45 \nmillion this year.\n  It was blocked by House Republican leaders, blocked by the \nadministration. I do no damage to the truth. That is what happened. Do \nyou think now we are going to get more of a commitment? Are we going to \nget anywhere near full funding? Are we going to get anywhere near the \nresources from the Federal Government back to our school districts, \nincluding what we promised? No.\n  And now my colleagues want to add even more ``Robin Hood in reverse'' \ntax cuts, going to the top 1 percent big multinational companies. That \nmeans we have no resources. That is what it is all about. If you don't \nthink we should be doing much by way of education and you don't think \nwe should live up to our promise of prescription drug benefits for the \nelderly, building on to Medicare, and if you don't think we should do \nanything about the crisis in affordable housing, I argue to the Chair, \nwho does so much work in education, that affordable housing is becoming \nthe second most important educational program in the country. When 8-\nyear-olds are moving two and three times a year because their families \ncan't afford housing, it is real hard for them to do well in school.\n\n  I could go on and on because, frankly, it is going to all go on and \non. You are going to see it when it comes to the commitment to \ntransportation infrastructure. Veterans are going to ask, what happened \nto them; how come people are not saying this to them any longer, above \nand beyond the Fourth of July parades? Across the board, that is what \nwe are going to see.\n  We are heading for a huge debate where the differences make a \ndifference. That is fine with me. It doesn't need to be done. The \nSenator from Oklahoma came by. We shook hands, had a good time. I like \nto mix it up with people. It is my nature to like people. But we will \njust have the differences.\n  The Senator from Texas is out here. He knows what that is about. That \nis fine. It will be an intellectually honest debate about the role of \ngovernment, about pressing issues in people's lives, about priorities, \nabout where we make our investments, about how we raise money, about \nwho we support, about how we invest in the economy, about what we do \nfor our children, about whether or not we protect the environment. All \nof these issues can be debated and should be.\n  What I am little bit skeptical about now is just a big stall. This \nisn't like a big debate. This is a big stall. That is what my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are about right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with interest today to my \ncolleague from Arizona, and now my colleague from Minnesota, on this \nsubject of economic recovery. This is a critically important subject. \nThis is not the normal run-of-the-mill policy that we debate here in \nthe Senate. Our economy is in some trouble, and I am not sure any of us \nquite understand how much trouble. It is a new economy. We don't have \nmodels by which we can judge what happened in the past and therefore \nproject what might happen in the future. This is a new global economy \nthat operates and behaves in ways that are different than perhaps \nrepresent our conventional understanding.\n  I know my friend from Minnesota mentioned that our colleague from \nTexas, who is in the Chamber, came from a background of teaching \neconomics, I believe, in college. I, too, briefly taught economics in \ncollege. I like to say that I have gone on, nonetheless, to overcome \nthat experience and lead a reasonably productive life.\n  The field of economics is not much more than psychology pumped up \nwith a little helium. We have all kinds of economists in this country \nwho will give us their best guess of what has happened and what will \nhappen. But nobody really knows.\n  We have heard suggestions from respected economists in America, Nobel \nPrize winners no less, that we have an economy that is in a recession; \nthat we have rather substantial overcapacity in this economy, and the \nmost effective way to jumpstart this economy is to do the kinds of \nthings that represent a boost in consumption. This morning, one of my \ncolleagues talked about increasing business investments. Perhaps there \nis a need for some of that. But most economist will tell you that \nduring a time of recession, when you have overcapacity, the quickest \nway to jumpstart an economy is to boost consumption.\n\n  What menu of plans has been introduced that would do that? One of my \nconcerns is that there is almost no room to be critical of a plan these \ndays because if you are critical, somehow you are taking on the \nPresident in an unfair way.\n  I gave the response to the President's radio address a couple weeks \nago, and I received a letter from a guy who said he was listening and \nalmost drove off the road when he heard me. It was a shrill, partisan \nletter. Some of us receive those periodically. My response to the radio \naddress--about the first one-third of it was about what a outstanding \njob this President has done prosecuting the war against terrorism. I \ncomplimented him and Secretary Powell and Secretary Rumsfeld and \nothers. I talked at great length about that.\n  Then I said, on the subject of economic recovery, that we have \ndifferences. I talked about those differences. I debated the \ndifferences in policy. Norman Vincent Peale once said: Most people \nwould rather be ruined by praise than saved by criticism.\n  There is nothing, in my judgment, that injures this country by having \na full-scale debate break out on something that represents important \npublic policy.\n  Let me talk a bit about some of the ideas that have been brought \nforward on the subject of economic recovery. In my judgment, the \ngoofiest idea, if I can\n\n[[Page S61]]\n\nuse that term, came from the House Ways and Means Committee. We just \nhad a colleague suggest that we start with that bill here on the floor \nof the Senate. The proposition is that we go back to 1988 and provide \ntax rebates to large corporations for the alternative minimum taxes \nthey paid over the last 14 years. Somehow that is represented to be a \npiece of economic recovery policy.\n  That is not going to promote economic recovery. It doesn't have the \nfoggiest thing to do with economic recovery. It has everything to do \nwith writing a very big check to some of the biggest corporations in \nthis country. They paid tax under what is called a ``minimum tax'' \nbecause in the 1980s we decided we didn't want to have companies making \nbillions of dollars in net profit and paying zero in taxes. We thought \nthere ought to be some minimum at least. That was the proposition.\n  But, of course, the House Ways and Means Committee, on which I used \nto serve, wrote a bill that said, by the way, let's provide rebate \nchecks to all those companies that had to pay minimum taxes dating back \nto 1988, such as IBM. We will give them a $1.4 billion check. Ford \nMotor Company--give them a billion-dollar check.\n  Does anybody think that will promote economic recovery in this \ncountry, when we are in a recession and have overcapacity in the \neconomy. No, that is just a giveaway. I will not apologize to anybody \nfor having passion about public policy and saying, when somebody \nrecommends doing something that will increase the deficit, that augurs \nagainst the interests of the average American citizen and will do \nnothing to help the economic recovery but will enrich those who don't \ndeserve that by giving them rebates for taxes they should have paid--\nminimum taxes, not regular taxes. Nobody deserves an apology from those \nof us who say that makes no sense; that won't help this country.\n  So we have a debate about those kinds of policies. I use that just as \none example. My colleague, the majority leader, said let's take those \nareas of intersection between what the President and others have \nproposed, and where there is common ground, let's offer that, have \namendments to it, and pass it.\n  One area is extended unemployment benefits to those who have lost \ntheir jobs. Two months in a row, we have had news that 400,000 American \npeople have lost their jobs. So 400,000 additional Americans came home \nfrom work one night and had to tell their families that they got a \nnotice that they had lost their jobs.\n  Do you know who most of them are? Most of them are families who know \nabout second shifts, second jobs, secondhand, and second mortgages. \nThese are the families at the bottom of the economic ladder, and they \nknow about these things. They are the first to lose jobs in a \nrecession.\n  Now, we asked 11 of the leading economists in this country what we \ncould do to give this economy a boost, what would really promote \neconomic recovery. Virtually every single one of them said this: If you \nextend unemployment benefits to those who have lost their jobs during \nan economic downturn, that money is immediately spent by those who \nreceive it because they need it. They need a helping hand during tough \ntimes. When they are down and out, they need a hand. They will spend \nthat money immediately. That is exactly the kind of help that \nstimulates the economy. That is what we have done in every economic \ndownturn in the last 25 years.\n  So that is a provision the majority leader brings to the floor today \nthat says: Look, the President says he supports that; we support that. \nLet's take that provision and pass that provision. Three additional \nprovisions represent the same approach--common provisions agreed to by \nvirtually everyone. He says let's move that which we can move, allow \npeople to offer amendments to it, but let's not drag our feet any \nlonger on these issues. Let's have some movement and action to try to \ngive the economy a lift, with policies that we know and which \neconomists tell us will help this economy recover.\n  We talked a great deal in this Chamber about policies in kind of an \nantiseptic way. There is not much about real people and the effect of \npolicies on real people. Just take one of those 400,000 people who, in \nOctober, had to tell their family they had lost their job, or one of \nthose 400,000 people, in November, who had to tell their family: I have \nlost my job, but it wasn't my fault. This economy is in a recession.\n  It was in a recession prior to September 11, and then those two \nairplanes that ran into that World Trade Center and murdered thousands \nof innocent Americans. That act of terror and mass murder cut a hole in \nthis country's belly and created additional victims. They are people \nwho lost their jobs because this economy continued to slow down even \nmore following those terrorist attacks. So those people came home at \nnight to say to their families: I have lost my job, my ability to make \na living.\n  It is said that the unemployment rate is 5.8 percent. For someone who \ngoes home having to tell their family they have lost their ability to \nmake a living, their unemployment statistic is 100 percent. They have \nlost their job. That is pretty tragic for families to have to explain \nto others that they no longer have a paycheck coming in. In most case, \nthese are hard-working Americans. They are at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder, scratching and clawing and trying very hard to move up \nand do well for their families.\n  In a recession, in an economy that turns sour, it almost always \ninjures them first.\n  That is why this provision at the very least ought to be embraced by \neveryone immediately.\n  Mr. President, I will make one additional comment. If politics was \nhot air, there would be enough to lift this building. I understand all \nthat. But, frankly, on both sides of the aisle, we have men and women \nof good faith who really want to do the right thing. Let's try to find \na key today to unlock this and find a way for Democrats and \nRepublicans, conservatives, liberals, and moderates to understand that \nwe all live in the same country. We all live on this same spaceship \nEarth. We are all Americans, and we want what is best for our country.\n  It is not disloyal to break out in open debate about one policy or \nanother, but at the end of the day, we must compromise. We must find a \nway to reach common agreement in ways that will help the American \neconomy. I hope that is the case.\n  Let me finish as I started. I think this President deserves the \npraise of the American people and this Congress for many things in \nrecent months. I think the leaders of this Congress--my colleagues, \nSenator Daschle and Senator Lott--deserve praise in many ways for a lot \nof the things they have done to bring us together to deal with the \nthreat to our country. I want to provide the same kind of praise to all \nof us for coming together--the President, yes, Senator Lott and Senator \nDaschle--to reach agreement now on an economic recovery package.\n  What the majority leader has proposed makes good sense to me. He said \nwe have all kinds of plans out there. Let's take that area where those \nplans intersect and we have reasonably common agreement. Let us move \nthose and then come back and see if we can reach agreement on others, \nor take those areas of common agreement, offer some amendments to them, \nand see where the votes are and then move forward.\n  What the majority leader has proposed makes good sense. I hope others \nwill embrace it today.\n  In the end, I am not interested in what is good for the Republican or \nthe Democratic Party or the President or Congress. There is not a \nRepublican or a Democratic way to go broke. There is not a Republican \nor Democratic way to lose your job. It is not a partisan thing to have \nto tell your family that you lost your job yesterday.\n  This is not about politics. It is about whether we are going to do \nthe right thing for the American people. Yes, for businesses, many of \nwhich are struggling, and especially for families, many of whom have \nreceived the news of a job being lost in an economy that has turned \nsour.\n  What can we do to help this economy? A lot of the problems of this \ncountry we have talked about in recent days will be solved by a growing \neconomy that provides opportunity and hope once again to families, to \nworkers, and to businesses.\n\n[[Page S62]]\n\n  It is interesting, there is one story going around about a \ncorporation that failed in this country. That is a tragedy as well. But \nit is always the case when we see these situations, somehow those at \nthe top end up doing real well and those at the bottom end up losing \ntheir shirts.\n  In many cases, that is what happens in a recession as well. I hope we \ncan understand that as we grapple with the questions of how do we pass \nlegislation that gives this country's economy a chance to survive and \nhow do we give American families and businesses some hope that tomorrow \nwill be a better day, that they understand the American economy will \noffer opportunities for them again in the future.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to begin by talking about the \nhistory of how we came to where we are today. Then I want to talk about \nwhere we go from here.\n  When it became clear that the country was in a recession--in fact, \nbefore many people in Congress recognized that we faced an emergency \nsituation--the President started to talk about a stimulus package. The \nPresident met with Democrats and Republicans.\n  I remember a day I went down to visit with the President as he was \nsoliciting advice as to what should be in a stimulus package. My advice \nwas that there are two things we could do that would dramatically help \nthe economy and that during the recession not only would not cost us \nmoney, but incredibly would probably put money in the Treasury. Those \ntwo proposals--not surprisingly, given that I made them--were to cut \nthe capital gains tax rate and to make the tax cut permanent.\n  From the time of John Kennedy, in each and every case where we have \nreduced the capital gains tax rate, we have encouraged people to more \nefficiently manage assets, we have encouraged investment, and people \nhave actually paid higher taxes--at least in the short run and often in \nthe long run--as a result of those changes.\n  It seemed to me then and it seems to me now that cutting the capital \ngains tax rate would be the cleanest, most efficient, least expensive \nway of stimulating the economy. In fact, for the remainder of this \nrecession that action would almost certainly put money in the Treasury, \nnot take it out.\n  In terms of making the tax cut permanent, what could be more \ndestabilizing than having a Tax Code that is going to expire in 10 \nyears? We tell people about how we are cutting their tax rates, we are \neliminating the marriage penalty, we lowered the 15 percent rate, we \nwill repeal the death tax, and yet everybody who has read the fine \nprint knows in 10 years, because of a budget technicality, the old Tax \nCode comes back and a massive increase in taxes occurs in 1 day.\n\n  In fact, there is the absurdity that if you die today, you face one \nset of taxes on your small business or your family farm that you built \nup; if you die 9 years from now, you face no death taxes; and if you \ndie 10 years from now, the Government takes 55 cents out of every \ndollar you have earned in your lifetime and takes it away from your \nfamily, often forcing people to sell their small business or sell their \nfamily farm.\n  What do you think people think about the prospects that if you die in \n9 years, you pay no death tax, but if you die in 10, the Government \ntakes 55 cents out of every dollar you earn? I, quite frankly, am \nconcerned as to what is going to happen in that ninth year, with the \nkind of perverse incentives we have created.\n  I proposed to the President that we make this tax cut permanent. \nSupposedly, we intended it to be permanent and I thought the stability \nthat would come from having that certainty would help the economy.\n  The President's response was that we had to come up with a package \nthat was going to be bipartisan and that he did not believe those \npolicies would be accepted by our Democratic colleagues and that they \nwould become a lightning rod in the debate. Obviously, I did not agree \nwith that, but the President came up with a proposal where over half \nthe proposal came not from recommendations that Republicans made but \nfrom recommendations that Democrats made.\n  The President, however anybody wants to criticize him, basically sat \ndown thinking that after September 11, something had really changed. I \nremember a colleague of mine sitting in my office saying: After the \n11th, things have changed forever. I suggested that forever is a very \nlong time. By January, the things that had changed in Congress about \ncooperation had pretty much changed back, unfortunately. But the \nPresident--and I say this as a great compliment to him--when he wrote \nhis initial stimulus package, tried to take Democratic ideas and \nRepublican ideas and come up with a bipartisan compromise that he \nthought might be adopted on a bipartisan basis.\n  So the debate started, and the House passed a bill. They passed it on \na partisan basis. We had a debate in the Senate, but nobody could get \nto the 60 votes necessary to pass a bill, and we had an impasse.\n  Then a series of our more moderate Members--I was not a member of \nthis group--got together, Democrats and Republicans, and came up with a \nbipartisan proposal. That bipartisan proposal basically picked and \nchose among various stimulus proposals that had been made. Based on the \nfact we clearly had a majority of Members of the Senate who were for \nthis bipartisan proposal that emanated from the Senate, the House of \nRepresentatives passed that bipartisan proposal in the waning hours of \nthe last session. That proposal then came to the Senate. However, \nSenator Daschle decided to not allow it to be considered, even though \nclearly a majority of Members of the Senate--Democrats and \nRepublicans--were for that bill.\n  That is the way the last session ended. We are now in the new \nsession. Senator Daschle approached our leadership and said: I am \nwilling to bring up a stimulus package. But he was not willing to bring \nup the stimulus package the President proposed. He was not willing to \nbring up the stimulus package the bipartisan coalition proposed. What \nhe wanted to do, in essence, was to take the provisions from the \nPresident's proposal that he agreed with, all of them in one form or \nanother things the majority of Democrats were for, and he wanted to \nbring that up.\n  Now we are perfectly supportive of bringing that bill up. The \nmajority leader ultimately can bring up any bill he wants to bring up, \nbut our basic position is simple and straightforward, and I think \nanybody who is trying to be objective about this will see it makes \nsense. If we bring up the bipartisan bill that was put together by \nmoderate Republicans and moderate Democrats, I think within that \ncontext we could have an agreement limiting the number of amendments we \nwould debate. Senator Daschle and others would have an opportunity to \noffer a substitute or other amendments. Those of us who might want to \nstrengthen the package from an economic stimulus point of view would \nhave an opportunity to offer a couple of amendments, and that would be \nit. That would have been a reasonable and acceptable proposal.\n  The proposal the majority leader made, however, was to bring up a \ntotally new bill, one-quarter of which--giving money to the States--was \nnever in any of these other proposals I have seen. The President did \nnot propose that. The House did not adopt that. Where that came from, I \ndo not know.\n  The point is: We have a bill before the Senate, and my suggestion is \nwe let the Senate work its will; that we have a series of amendments, a \nDemocrat amendment, a Republican amendment; that we debate these \nissues. There clearly will be an amendment to expand the accelerated \ndepreciation part of this bill. We have a bill before us that provides \naccelerated depreciation for about 9 months. We had a proposal \ninitially for 3 years. There will almost certainly be an amendment on \nthat and it ought to be voted on. We have had a lot of debate about \noverturning the tax cut, not letting it go into effect. Clearly, I \nthink we can provide some certainty to investors and to consumers by \nhaving the Senate go on record that we are not going to overturn the \ntax cut.\n  I personally believe we will benefit the economy if we have the \nSenate make the repeal of the death tax permanent. I would like to have \na vote on it. I am sure there will be many amendments, or some \namendments, on the Democrat side, but it seems to me that\n\n[[Page S63]]\n\nif one wants to make up their own proposal--and when they are the \nmajority leader, they have the right to do that--they have to recognize \nother people may not support it and they will want an opportunity to \npresent their ideas. That is how the Senate rules work.\n\n  If we had gone to something that had been agreed to by the majority \nof our Members to begin with, I think we might have limited amendments, \nbut now I think what we need to do is to simply start the process of \noffering amendments. I do not know how long this is going to take. I do \nnot think, quite frankly, it is going to take a terribly long time. I \nthink there are issues that need to be voted on.\n  Finally, let me say we have a deficit. We have a deficit primarily \nbecause we have a recession. The second largest cause of the deficit \nhas been the explosion in spending, most of which occurred in the last \n3 months of the Clinton administration. An increase of over $120 \nbillion in spending above the level we set out in the bipartisan \nbalanced budget agreement occurred in a 3-month period, with a \nRepublican Congress. I am not only pointing at Bill Clinton. A \nRepublican Congress and Bill Clinton had a spending orgy, the likes of \nwhich I have not seen in almost a quarter of a century in the Senate.\n  The third thing is we have adopted a tax cut of $38 billion. \nAltogether, we have had over a $300 billion decline in the surplus. \nSome of our colleagues say the problem is the tax cut. But, that is \nonly about one-tenth the size of the collapse of the surplus.\n  I know there are people on the Democrat side of the aisle who would \nlike to raise taxes and to eliminate that tax cut. We certainly will \nhave an opportunity to vote on that. But the bottom line is, we need a \nstimulus package. We are in a recession, and every penny we use to \nstimulate the economy we are going to have to borrow. That is a dollar \nwe are going to be taking away from somebody who might have used it in \nanother way. So if we are going to have a stimulus package, I think it \nis very important it be a package that stimulates the economy.\n  I find it incredible--some people might find it unbelievable, and in \nsome ways it is both--that if we look at the Daschle proposal that is \nnow before us, if someone paid income taxes last year as an individual, \nthey will get no benefit from this stimulus package. We give big tax \ncuts to people who do not pay taxes. We have massive increases in \nspending, but if someone paid taxes last year; if they are working and \nsaving and investing; if they are anybody who is currently making the \nAmerican economy go and paying taxes in the process, this bill does not \ndeem them worthy of having a stimulus provision that would encourage \nthem to work more or save more or invest more.\n  I do not know how the economy is stimulated without providing \nincentives for people who are engaged in productive activities. I do \nnot understand that. I know the proposal that was in the bipartisan \npackage and that was in the Bush proposal that would accelerate the tax \ncut that is coming for individuals who make more than $28,000 a year--\nthat there was opposition to it. I do not understand, if the objective \nis to get people to work and save and invest, why no incentives are \nprovided for people who are working and saving and investing.\n  So some will remember that when this bill was presented yesterday, \nthese two intersecting circles--the Republican proposal and the \nDemocrat proposal--were presented, and where the union of those two \ncircles was, was supposedly what Senator Daschle was proposing. Well, \nit turns out a quarter of it I have never heard of before; and that is, \nwe have a bigger deficit than all the States combined, but now we are \ngoing to run a bigger deficit to give them money.\n  I don't understand it. What it really looks like to me, looking at \nthis so-called stimulus package, is spending. You look at the words \n``spending'' and ``stimulus,'' and the only similarity is they both \nstart with an ``S.''\n  Here is my point and I will conclude: We can stand and talk about \nprovisions that were in old bills that nobody has debated in months. I \ncould rant and rave about stimulating the bison industry. That was a \nprovision dealt with and laughed out of the of the Democratic version \nof the bill. I could taunt my Democratic colleagues with it forever, \nbut what good would it do in this debate? None. Bringing up retroactive \nprovisions in the original House bill that have never been considered \nby the Senate, that no Republican Senator has endorsed, that are not in \nthe bipartisan consensus bill, I don't think is very productive, \neither.\n  The path we have chosen, quite frankly, I think is the hard path. If \nwe had brought up the bipartisan bill, we might have adopted it; it \nmight have gone to the President and been signed. Instead, we brought \nup a bill nobody has ever seen. It will be amended, probably at great \nlength. Then if it is adopted, it will go to conference, where there \nmight be more mischief and the potential of not getting a bill. If \nthere is an easy way and a hard way, we have decided, it seems to me, \nto do it the hard way.\n  I think it is important to start the amendment process. I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, we have a vehicle before the \nSenate. Whether Members are for or against it, everybody claims--with \nthe exception of two or three Members of the Senate--that they want a \nstimulus bill. We have a proposal before the Senate. If we do not like \nit--and I don't like it --we should offer amendments to it. I believe \nwe will be ready, hopefully this afternoon, to begin that amendment \nprocess. It may be, as we start debating amendments, as we start voting \non them, that we could yet form a consensus and adopt this bill. That \nwould be very beneficial if that were the case. I hope it will be the \ncase.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair for recognizing me for a moment or two. \nI will use a few minutes to talk about where we are on the question of \neconomic stimulus. It is appropriate to say where we are is where we \nhave been. The phrase ``been there, done that'' comes to mind, and I \nthink it is very appropriate. When we left for the holidays, the recess \nthat we enjoyed back home with our families, we left the Senate in a \nsituation where neither side had a sufficient number of votes to move \non something that was significantly important to the American people.\n  It is clear we as a nation are in difficult economic times. I imagine \npeople back home wonder whether Congress is going to do anything about \nit. I wonder whether sometimes we have the capacity to do anything \nabout it because of the situation we find ourselves in.\n  It is interesting and important to point out that neither side has \nthe ability to do whatever they want. We as Democrats do not control \nthe White House. We as Democrats do not control the House of \nRepresentatives. We as Democrats do not have the 60 votes in this body \nin order to accomplish things that we might like to do if the other \nside insists on filibustering that effort.\n  On the other side of the coin, it is also important to note that the \nRepublicans do not have the ability either to do whatever they want in \nthese areas. They, too, do not have 60 votes to push through what they \nthink is an appropriate remedy to the economic conditions we find \nourselves in.\n  It is, therefore, obvious, in order to get anything done we will have \nto reach some type of a middle ground or an agreement that takes the \nbest of both parties and puts them together in a package that might do \nsomething on a positive note for the American people who are suffering \na great deal because of the downturn in the economy.\n  It is true that the two parties have fundamentally different \napproaches on how to assess this. I have tried to compare it to the \nquestion of people who make widgets and people who buy widgets. It \nseems appropriate to point out that the other side tends to say if we \nare going to get this economy going, we will have to help the people \nwho make the widgets. We will have to help the businesses that produce \nthe products because they are not producing at full capacity. We will \nhave to help the companies that make the widgets. We have to help them \nwith bonus depreciation, and we have to help them with net operating \nloss carrybacks. Those are some of the ideas we have talked about. We \nwill help them with alternative minimum tax and remove that burden so \nthat these companies can make more widgets.\n\n[[Page S64]]\n\n  On the other hand, on my side of the aisle, we tend to concentrate on \nthose who buy the widgets and say it doesn't matter how many companies \nmake how many widgets. If you don't have individuals able to buy the \nwidgets, they are not going to be able to sell the widgets. Therefore, \nit is important for economic recovery to do something for those \nactually trying to buy the products who find themselves in an economic \nsituation of not being able to do so.\n  We said, all right, we have a lot of people unemployed and we have to \nhelp them with unemployment insurance, to give them a longer period to \ntry to find a job. We will help those people who are without health \ninsurance because they cannot be productive citizens if they do not \nhave health insurance for their children and families. We want to do \nthat. We also want to help the most unfortunate among us by making sure \nwe give them some benefits because they did not receive those benefits \nduring the last tax cut. We do that by providing $14 billion worth of \nrebates in terms of direct grants to those individuals.\n\n  That is where we were when we left. That was the Democratic position \nand that was the Republican position. Neither side had 60 votes. We \ncome back after the recess and we are right back where we were: Been \nthere, done that. We can continue to do that and face each other off \nand blame the Republicans for failure because they don't agree with us \nand listen to our Republican colleagues blame us for failure because we \ndon't agree with them. They think they are right and we think we are \nright. But outside the beltway and outside Washington I imagine there \nare an awful lot of people who are scratching their heads and saying: \nLook, these are grownups that we send to Washington and the job that we \nsend them to do is to make government work for those who are not in \ngovernment. Unfortunately, what they see is that in too many cases, we \ncannot simply compromise to the point of agreeing and getting something \ndone.\n  Last year, Democrats filibustered the economic stimulus bill. \nRepublicans filibustered the farm bill. Neither side was able to \naccomplish anything in these two important areas. We can continue to do \nthat. We can continue to take the position that we want to help the \npeople that buy the widgets, and we are not going to move. And our \nRepublican colleagues can say, we will continue to try to help the \nwidget manufacturers, and we will not compromise. We can continue to \nmake the arguments and continue to blame each other for failure. But \nthe end result is the people that need the help do not get the help \nthey need.\n  I commend very strongly the majority leader, Senator Daschle, who has \nsaid, I will not continue in that vein. I want to break this logjam. I \nwant to end this gridlock. What I am willing to do is to give up some \nthings that those who want to take care of the widget buyers are really \ninterested in, like health insurance for unemployed people--a very big \nissue and one to which I think there is an answer. I am willing to step \naside and give that up in order to get this process moving. But the \nother side will have to also give a little in order to get a package \nthat can pass this body.\n  Senator Daschle has said: Enough of business as usual. Let's make the \nfirst important step toward getting something done that can, in fact, \nhelp the people we intend to help. He has suggested that we have \nextended unemployment insurance. That is important. We don't know how \nlong people are going to be unemployed. It is obvious Congress will \nhave to address this. He does it in his proposal. And I add, the other \nside has agreed on that. He says we will give some additional help to \npeople who did not get much help the last time, and has proposed $14 \nbillion in rebate checks.\n  The other side has said they could support that. They said that \nbefore we left for the recess. Some people say you are trying to help \npeople who do not pay taxes. Those people may not pay income taxes, but \nthey certainly pay payroll taxes. I am not sure if one tax is less \npainful than the other. If you are paying taxes, you are paying taxes. \nTherefore, we ought to help those people who are paying taxes. The \nrebate proposal is a common idea to which both sides have essentially \nagreed.\n  We said we are going to help States. The Senator from Texas was \npointing out that Texas is in bad shape, as well as some of the other \nStates. But States have different problems and additional problems. We \ncan, in fact, operate at a manageable deficit on the Federal level, \nwhich I do not have problems with. We are in a position to help States. \nThe concept was to say, all right, we are going help States with \nMedicaid by giving them a little bit more of a Federal share to help \npay for the health care of indigent people who need the greatest amount \nof health care of all.\n  I think the proposal says we are going to give a 1.5-percent increase \nin the amount of Federal money paid for the purpose of helping \nMedicare. That would allow States to do a better job in helping people \nwho are sick and poor, and also perhaps give them some additional money \nfrom the Federal share which they could use for other priorities within \nthe State. That is something that has been sort of a common idea that \nboth sides have said in the past they could support.\n  Another thing in the Daschle proposal is something to help the widget \nmanufacturers.\n  I had dinner last night with a group of high-tech chief executive \nofficers, who are some of the best and brightest in the country. Every \none of them said: If you could do something on bonus depreciation to \nhelp us buy new equipment this year to help us expand or grow our \nbusinesses, that would be very important. These are the top people in \ntheir industries. Telecommunications and computer manufacturing are \nAmerican companies. They said that bonus depreciation would be very \nimportant for them.\n  I think the House said they are going to do a bonus depreciation bill \nfor 3 years. The Senate said 1 year. Is there not a number in between 1 \nand 3 on which we could probably agree? Of course, I think that is an \nimportant ingredient.\n  Some of my colleagues on this side said if you add it up--it is like \nthe score for a football game. If you have three things the Democrats \nlike and only one thing the Republicans like, that is not really fair. \nThe bonus depreciation is part of the $69 billion. The 1-year package \nis about $42 billion.\n  One item that Republicans like--I like it, too--was the most \nexpensive by far of the four. It is $42 billion for bonus depreciation \nwith a 40-percent accelerated bonus depreciation for 6 months and 20 \npercent for the second 6 months. It averages out to 30 percent.\n  There is some flexibility. I think the majority leader indicated this \nis something which is a good concept for the widget manufacturers and \nfor business and people who produce products in this country.\n  As has been referred to, we have a centrist plan. I plead guilty to \nbeing a part of that effort and will continue to do so because I think \nit brings together centrists in both parties to try to break the \nlogjams in which we find ourselves far too often.\n  We had a plan that addressed health care needs. It is not in here. I \nwish it were. I think we suggested it in terms of a tax credit for \nunemployed people without health care insurance. It is an incredibly \npositive thing that Democrats should embrace and run with. It is \nsomething that will eventually happen at some point. Some said: Your \nplan only said the Federal Government was going to pay for 60 percent \nof the cost of premiums for unemployed workers' health insurance. That \nmeans the poor worker would have to pay 40 percent of the cost of his \npremium, and they probably can't afford that.\n\n  Let us think of what the current situation is. Right now, unemployed \npeople who lost their jobs can continue their health insurance, but it \nis at their own expense--100 percent. You have to pay 100 percent of \nthe cost of the premium. For the very first time, we were saying the \nGovernment should pay 60 percent of the cost of that premium. That is \n100 percent more than they pay now.\n  I think it is a movement in the right direction. I think it has \nmerit. I think it should apply to people who do not have a job and \ncan't afford health insurance, whether or not they are a so-called \nCOBRA-covered person who had health insurance at their previous job.\n  It is another subject, but I think we ought to have mandatory health \ninsurance in this country. It is the best way\n\n[[Page S65]]\n\nto help solve the problem. That is something about which we as \ncentrists felt very strongly. That is not in here. But am I going to \nsay, because it is not in here, I will not support this package? Of \ncourse, not.\n  Let me move towards concluding my remarks by saying what Senator \nDaschle has done is create a strategy and a process that will allow us \nto get to the next step. We can continue to stop everything we do and \ncontinue to not let anything else come up the rest of the year until we \ncraft a package in the Senate to which 100 percent of the people can \nagree. If we take that approach, we will not get anything done, not \nonly on the stimulus package, but we don't do anything else in the \nyear. We don't do an agriculture bill or anything else important, such \nas an energy bill, or any other high-priority item. It is absolutely \ncritical that leaders are able to say we are going to make some moves \nhere. We want to make this Senate function as it should.\n  I think what Senator Daschle said was, I am going to offer a \nstreamlined package. We give up a lot of things that we would like to \nsee in it. The other side will have to give up a lot of things they \nwould like to have in this bill. But let us at least get this package \nthrough the Senate, take the common ideas and pass it, and do it today, \ntomorrow, but do it, and quickly, in order for us to get to a \nconference with our colleagues in the other body. That will be a very \ndifficult conference because their bill is far different from ours. It \nis far different in emphasis. It is far different in costs. It is far \ndifferent in whom it attempts to help and how it attempts to help them. \nBut we have to get to conference if we have any hope of reaching a \nconference agreement. This strategy allows us to do that.\n  I would say to the conferees that it doesn't do them any good if we \nget to that point and bring it back to the House or the Senate with \nthings in it that are not going to be adopted. I will take half an \napple rather than no apple at all. I think if you can't get everything \nyou want, you get as much as you can in an agreement and then save the \nrest for a later date. But last year we got nothing. The people who \nwere unemployed last year still do not have health insurance. They \nstill have not received any rebate help or assistance from the Federal \nGovernment. They still have not received any health insurance or \nextended unemployment insurance benefits. What they got was an \nargument. As I said before, you can't take an argument to the grocery \nstore and buy food. They do not accept that. You can't walk into a \nstore and say: I need to buy groceries for my family this week, and, by \nthe way, I will pay for it with the promise that Congress will do \nsomething to help me in the future. It doesn't work that way. We \nactually have to get something done. Arguments don't buy food. Blame \ndoes not buy groceries.\n\n  It is incumbent upon us to try to reach an agreement with which we \ncan get to conference and let the conference work its will. I urge all \nof those who say we have to have it just like I like it or we are not \ngoing to have it at all--that approach on both sides of the aisle does \nnot help the people we were elected to help. I think they are sort of \ngetting wise to the ways of Washington. I want to change their \nthinking. I want to give them the encouragement to say Congress can at \ntimes work out difficult problems with positive solutions, with both \nparties reaching out to each other, recognizing that we have to give a \nlittle in order to get a lot.\n  Senator Daschle's proposal in fact does that. It is a good proposal. \nIt is not the final proposal. It is not the final answer to this \ndifficult problem of economic stimulus. But at least let us move one \nstep down the line in order to try to reach an agreement that can \nactually be something everybody can be proud of, and, even more \nimportantly, get the job done for those who need the help.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I see my friend from Oklahoma, the \nminority whip, is in the Chamber. I will try to be no more than maybe 6 \nor 7 minutes. Would that be OK, because a Democrat spoke last?\n  I thank my friend from Oklahoma.\n  Madam President, I would like to address two issues. The first is \nthis stimulus package of the majority leader, Senator Daschle.\n  Let me just say, in a town that is wracked by partisanship, and where \nthe differences often seem insurmountable, only one person has cut \nthrough that to try to come up with a compromise that is not going to \nmake either side or any Senator 100-percent happy but is the basis for \nmoving forward and getting a stimulus package. That person is Majority \nLeader Daschle.\n  I cannot heap enough praise on the majority leader for this effort. \nWe know our economy is squishy. Every one of us goes back to our \ncommunity and we hear of layoffs, of consumer uncertainty. We hear \npeople are afraid the next 6 months will be considerably worse than the \npresent, and they are looking to Washington for leadership, not only \nfor a stimulus package in terms of the number of dollars that it will \nput into the hands of people and businesses, but also for a sign that \nwe can work together to give them a sign of confidence, a sign the \nstewardship of the economy is in good hands and partisan differences \nare outweighed by what is good for the Nation.\n  I have to say, the only effort that has had some traction, the only \neffort that has made some sense in this regard is the effort of the \nmajority leader. I am sort of confounded by the many attacks upon him. \nThis is a man whom we all know well. These editorials and things like \nthat do not comport with the real Tom Daschle who is somebody who \nalways goes out of his way and takes that extra step for a compromise.\n  I do not like every piece of the package he has put forward. I wish \nthere were other pieces that could be in there--I will talk about one \nin a minute--but I certainly think both sides of the aisle should be on \ntheir feet applauding the effort, the effort to break the logjam and \nget us moving.\n  Let anyone who starts saying that Tom Daschle is ``Mr. Partisan'' or \n``Mr. Obstructionist'' look at the actions that have occurred in this \nChamber today and look for the one Senator, of the 100, who has stepped \nforward and said: Here is a basis for compromise. I am not just saying \nit has to be my way. I am not just saying why I don't like what the \nother side or another Senator does, but rather here is a place where we \ncan meet pretty much in the middle of the road.\n  I think I speak on behalf of many of my fellow Senators and many \nmillions of Americans in thanking Majority Leader Daschle for trying to \nbring us together, for trying to create compromise that can move us \nforward, for trying to give us that basic centerpiece we can then use \nas a way to get a stimulus package done and add other pieces that are \nnecessary.\n  I mention to my colleagues one piece that I believe is necessary to \nadd. I know we have been apart for a little more than a month. Every \none of us went back to our State and back to our family. I, for one, \nwas glad to be home every night with my girls. I was glad to be in my \nState seeing everybody and touching base with them. But as you may \nremember when we left--I believe it was December 20--we were very close \nto passing a bipartisan House-Senate compromise to help Lower Manhattan \nwith certain kinds of tax breaks that would encourage businesses to go \ndown there, that would encourage businesses to stay there. It was \nworked on by Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley. It was worked on by \nCongressman Thomas and Congressman Rangel. We were almost there. But at \nthe last minute, because we were doing things in the final moments, \npeople said they needed a little more time to study it.\n\n  First, let me discuss the need. It is urgent. Even though we lost \nclose to 30 million square feet in downtown Manhattan, we have many \nbusinesses that left and are unwilling to come back yet. Businesses--\nlarge and small--were scratching their heads and saying: Does downtown \nManhattan have a future?\n  Our Governor and our new mayor are rapidly putting together plans to \ntry to\n\n[[Page S66]]\n\nfigure out how to rebuild downtown Manhattan. But the question on \neverybody's lips is: Will the kind of very necessary tax breaks to \nbring businesses back to downtown Manhattan--given the fear factor and \ngiven everything else that has occurred--be forthcoming from \nWashington?\n  This is not a partisan issue. We have had support from both sides of \nthe aisle. This is not even a bicameral dispute. The House has passed a \nbill already. I certainly give the White House credit for being \namenable to a compromise.\n  All I can speak to is the necessity. The attack on the Twin Towers on \nSeptember 11, of course, is still with us. It was not an attack on \ndowntown Manhattan or even New York State. It was an attack on all of \nAmerica.\n  It would be an admission of defeat--we have had such success \noverseas--if downtown Manhattan does not rise up, rebuild itself, and \nbe revitalized. What could be a stronger message to the terrorists of \nthe world, to the anti-Americans of the world, to those who hate us for \nour very freedom, than if downtown Manhattan rises anew like a phoenix? \nI can tell my colleagues without these tax breaks it is going to be \nhard to do.\n  I have spoken to Senator Clinton. We will be working very hard to get \nthese breaks passed, hopefully, as part of the stimulus package; and if \nthere is no stimulus package, then in some other way. I hope all of my \ncolleagues will be supportive. We need the help.\n  All of America has admired the bravery of the victims' families, many \nof whom the President graciously invited to the White House yesterday--\nthe firefighters, police officers, and rescue workers, and just average \nNew Yorkers who rose to the occasion. We now need to back up our \nadmiration with real help. The future of downtown and Lower Manhattan \ndepends on what we do in this body in the next month, the House having \nalready acted.\n\n  I urge my colleagues, if they have any questions about the compromise \nproposal that has been put together, if they have any changes they seek \nto make, if they have any objections to any of the small parts of it, \nplease let us know ahead of time. At the end of December 21, when we \nwere very close to passage, many of my colleagues came to me and said: \nLook, I am very sympathetic. I just want a little time to study it.\n  Well, now we are in studying time. But soon it will be time to act.\n  Again, I plead and beg with my colleagues to make sure that we don't \nhold up this package so necessary for downtown Manhattan's survival, so \nnecessary to send a concrete message that we are not going to let the \nterrorists destroy any part of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague from New York. He mentioned his desire to bring up the New \nYork City package. I requested earlier that we take up the House-passed \ntax bill that has a New York package in it. We are having a debate \nright now as to what should be the underlying bill.\n  So people understand, I suggested that we take up the House-passed \nbill. That would be the logical thing to do. If we are going to pass a \nstimulus package, the House has already passed it. I told the majority \nleader I would work with him to come up with a finite list of \namendments, a mutually agreed-upon list of amendments or number of \namendments, and work to pass it. He wasn't agreeable to that yet. Maybe \na little later he will be. Instead, he wanted to come up with a list of \namendments he thought were mutually agreeable.\n  I don't think there is a consensus on a list of amendments. I will \njust go over a couple of them.\n  The underlying bill I wanted to take up had New York in it. I will \ntell my colleague from New York, this amendment does not have New York \nin it. That doesn't mean I agree with everything that is in the House \nbill; I don't. So if we start with that as the package, I will probably \ntry to make some changes and some deletions to the House bill.\n  I look at the package the majority leader wants to bring up, and I \nsay: Wait a minute, where is the beef? Where is the stimulation? There \nis no assistance for New York. I am looking at the bill that was just \nintroduced yesterday. I am almost amazed. I heard one of my colleagues \nsay Republicans are filibustering this bill. We are not filibustering \nthis bill. We didn't object to bringing it up.\n  A bill we have never seen before is now pending on the floor of the \nSenate. We could have asked for it to be read. We could have asked for \na vote on the motion to proceed. We didn't do any of that. We wanted to \ntake up and pass a stimulus package. But we would also like to know \nwhat is in it. And just for elementary purposes, we would like to have \nit stimulate the economy. We would like to have it create jobs.\n\n  I looked at the package the majority leader introduced. It fails in \nthat regard.\n  I will go through the various elements in this package for my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. I don't want to get into any \ndisputation about the underlying package. The Senator was very helpful \nto us in the final moments of the session last time about getting a New \nYork package. I thank him for that and hope we can work together in \nwhatever comes out to get a New York package done early this year.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleague from New York. I will tell him \nI read with interest today an article from the Washington Post that \nsaid that not only did we pass the legislation that my colleague and \nfriend from New York alluded to to provide tax relief for the victims \nof the New York and Virginia disaster but also the Oklahoma City \ndisaster, so they wouldn't have to pay taxes in the year 2001 or in the \nyear 2000 for this recent 9-11 tragedy, but also in Oklahoma it is for \n1994 and 1995.\n  The Washington Post said we also passed the $5 billion package of \nbenefits. That wasn't accurate.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If my colleague will yield, if it were only so.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I understand.\n  Looking at the package that the majority leader has introduced, there \nis only one thing that anybody could remotely say is really \nstimulative. There are four elements to the majority leader's package, \none of which deals with accelerated depreciation. Then there are three \nothers that would fall into spending categories.\n  Some people say it is rebates of tax cuts, $14 billion; people who \ndidn't get anything from the tax cuts. They didn't get anything because \nthey didn't pay taxes. Anybody who paid Federal income taxes got a tax \ncut of $300 for individuals, $600 for a couple. We have already done \nthat. What we didn't do is give tax cuts for people who didn't pay \ntaxes. That is the proposal pending.\n  Some people say everybody has agreed with that. I don't agree with \nit. I don't think it is good policy for us to go out and borrow $14 \nbillion to have to pay over $1 billion a year in interest basically to \nhand out money and call it a tax cut when they didn't pay taxes. I find \nthat objectionable. Maybe I am unique in that way. Maybe the majority \nwill pass it. That may well be. It did pass the House of \nRepresentatives. I don't think it is good policy. I think it does spend \n$14 billion. It does add that much to the deficit, to the amount of \nnational debt.\n  We don't have a surplus anymore. Some people say it made sense last \nyear when we were distributing the surplus. But to me, it doesn't make \nsense today. I don't think that should be in the package. So not \neverybody agrees with everything in the majority leader's package.\n  It has the extension of unemployment compensation. That will increase \nspending and will not stimulate the economy. It also gives the States \n$4 or $5 billion. I am sure they would be very appreciative of that. \nStates are going through some difficult times; so is the Federal \nGovernment. I don't know if this is the right time for us to be \nimplementing a new revenue sharing approach.\n\n  The House has done it. Now it is being proposed by some on this side. \nMaybe the votes are there. We may find out. I am not particularly \nexcited about it. I am not sure it is the right thing to do. Some \npeople would easily say we are taking money out of the Social Security \ntrust fund and giving it\n\n[[Page S67]]\n\nto the States. I am not sure that makes good sense to do that either.\n  If we look at those three proposals, extending unemployment \ncompensation, that costs money, it is a spending program; $14 billion \nin checks to people who didn't get checks last time, but they didn't \npay taxes last time, so basically a spending program for $14 billion to \nlow-income people for last year; and then a new program to give the \nStates some money, maybe calling it Medicaid, maybe calling it revenue \nsharing, basically contributing, I believe, under Senator Daschle's \nproposal, about $5.5 billion. The House passed $4 billion. Those are \nthe three spending proposals, and then the accelerated depreciation.\n  Accelerated depreciation is the only thing that anybody could say \nlegitimately is going to give incentive to create jobs. Looking at this \nproposal, I have heard people say the House-passed bill had 30 percent \ndepreciation for 3 years, 30-percent accelerated depreciation. That \nmeans if you have 100-percent depreciation for the life of the asset, \nand you have to depreciate it over X number of years, let's say 10 \nyears, you can put a greater percentage of that in the first year and \nexpense it. That will encourage investment. The House did that with 30 \npercent for 3 years. So any investment made in the next 3 years could \nqualify.\n  Senator Daschle's proposal says it is 30 percent for 1 year. I just \nlooked at the language and it says: Special allowance for certain \nproperty acquired after September 10, 2001, and before September 11, \n2002.\n  January has already gone. You are talking about, if we enacted this \ntomorrow, maybe 7 months. But by the time people understand it and by \nthe time it passes the conference, by the time it gets out, you are \nlooking at a provision that is probably less than 6 months. In other \nwords, hurry up and purchase your equipment or whatever you are going \nto do in the next few months.\n  That might be good for disposable items, but for anybody who is going \nto purchase something that needs to be manufactured, it is not enough \ntime to do any good.\n  The proposal Senator Daschle has introduced has a worthless \nstimulative impact. It will not create jobs. It fails the test, and I \ndon't think we should pass it. Why don't we take the bill the House \npassed and have some amendments to it?\n  I count votes around here. At one time, that bill had well over 50 \nvotes. It may not have had 60, but it had over 50. It had a lot of \nprovisions that some of us didn't like in there, but it had a majority \nof votes, I believe. Senator Daschle doesn't want to take up that bill. \nAs a matter of fact, he wants to take up a different House bill, strike \nthe language--take out House bill 622; insert his bill in it, amend it \nfor a little while, and then, when we are finished, take up the House-\npassed bill, strike that language, and put this bill in.\n  I suggest, why don't we take up the House-passed stimulus bill and \namend it? We can go through the regular order and have amendments. I \nwill help him get a limitation on amendments. Or we don't have to have \nthat; we can just take it up, debate it, amend it, and pass it. That \nwould be the regular order. I don't want anybody to say the Republicans \nare filibustering. I am ready to amend Senator Daschle's proposal. But \nI think we ought to take up the House-passed bill. Then I will work \nwith him to come up with language. But to say we have a consensus bill \nand call it stimulus--when three or four elements of the bill are \nspending provisions, and the one thing that might be considered \nstimulative--accelerated depreciation--doesn't last long enough.\n  Senator Breaux suggested a compromise of 2 years. That would be a lot \nbetter than the 6 months I have seen for the accelerated depreciation. \n4 or 5 months have already gone by since September 11. There is not \nmuch time left. There is not much stimulus to this bill.\n  The other side wants to act as if they tried to bring up a stimulus \nbill and get it done, but because they could not get a unanimous \nconsent agreement to pass it in 2 days, they will pull it down and say: \nWe tried; it was their fault.\n  There is no stimulative impact to that bill whatsoever. The Democrats \nheld up the package for the last couple of months. President Bush asked \nfor it in early October, but we didn't get it done, even though we \ntried to get it up in November and December. And there was some \ncriticism--I think rightfully--delivered toward the Democrats for not \nletting that happen.\n  I heard Senator Grassley say let's take up the bipartisan bill--\nDemocrats and Republicans supporting the bill--on which the \nadministration worked. That bill is H.R. 3529. Let's take that up, \namend it, and pass it, and see if we can't do some good.\n  Tax legislation happens to be important. Then I look at Senator \nDaschle's accelerated depreciation, and I want to see the good in this \nbill, I want to see something that will create jobs and provide \neconomic relief. I don't think this will create very many jobs. I am \ndisappointed in it. We can do better. We must do better.\n  Some people say let's just pass something and send it over in the \nHouse and maybe we will fix it in conference. I would like to do better \nthan that in the Senate. We should do better. We should be embarrassed \nif we can't do any better than that. We should not call this a stimulus \npackage. You can call it a spending package, aid for States or for \nunemployment extension; you can call it expanded welfare payments for \npeople who didn't pay taxes--we are going to give $14 billion out--or \nif you cram through a purchase in the next 6 months, we might give you \na little better deal. You can't call this a stimulus package.\n  It is political cover for the Democrats to claim they tried to do \nsomething and didn't get it done. It is unfortunate to try to blame the \nother side. I would like to see us take up a package that would, \nhopefully, be agreed to by Democrats and Republicans, work on it, amend \nit, improve it, pass it, send it to conference, and see if we can't get \na bill out of conference in the next couple of weeks to create jobs.\n\n  If we are not going to create jobs, let's not do it. We don't need \nmore excuses to spend money. We are spending a lot of money. The \nPresident is coming up with a budget proposal that has more money for \nnational security, defense, and homeland defense. We spent a lot of \nmoney last year. We don't need excuses to spend more money and use the \nguise of a stimulus bill with the title of a stimulus bill.\n  This bill that Senator Daschle introduced, in my opinion, fails the \ntest. It has the title: ``To provide incentives for economic recovery, \nand for other purposes.'' The other purposes are ``let's spend more \nmoney,'' because it does very little, if anything, toward helping \nstimulate an economic recovery.\n  I really hope we will work together and try to come up with a \npackage. I don't want to stall anything. I am happy to begin \nconsidering amendments if that is Senator Daschle's request. We can \nhave amendments on the floor. I see Senator Grassley is on the floor, \nthe ranking member of the Finance Committee. We can start considering a \nlot of amendments today. I know Senator Wellstone mentioned he has \nsome, and I have some. They probably won't be the same but let's \nconsider them. Let's get to work on a true economic stimulus plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his \ngraciousness.\n  This morning and this afternoon, we have engaged in a discussion with \nrespect to the stimulus package. Senator Daschle, the majority leader, \nhas fought for a sensible position which represents, really, as he says \nso well, the common ground that exists between both parties. \nRecognizing that we need 60 votes to move to passage of a legislative \ninitiative, his approach has the most merit and the most probability of \npassing. So I encourage my colleagues to support the proposal of \nSenator Daschle.\n  In a sense, what he has done is combine the common elements of both \nRepublican and Democrat proposals to find the provisions that will \ngarner the necessary 60 votes to go forward so we can provide real \nrelief in a timely fashion to millions of Americans who are facing \ndifficult economic times.\n  At the core of his proposal is extending unemployment benefits for an \nadditional 13 weeks. Routinely, during previous recessions, we have \ndone so. This is a recognition that there are literally millions of \npeople who have been\n\n[[Page S68]]\n\nthrown out of work because of economic circumstances as well as the \nareas of New York City and around the Pentagon, in some cases, because \nof the attacks of September 11 and the recession that began in March \n2001.\n  The reality is that there are millions of Americans who need \nassistance. The unemployment rate is growing. More important than that, \nperhaps, for our consideration is that the number of people who have \nbeen unemployed for a long period of time is growing. In the robust \neconomy of the nineties, when people lost jobs, they quickly found \nother jobs. Today, they find themselves, if not permanently, then in \nmany respects for a much longer period of time, without access to work. \nThey need these benefits.\n  Extending unemployment compensation also stimulates the economy. \nTypically, someone who is relying upon unemployment benefits will take \nthose checks and immediately pay their bills, go to the store, provide \nfood for their children, pay their rent, immediately infusing those \ndollars into the economy, increasing the consumer spending, the lack of \nwhich is one of the causes of the recession we face. So it is a \nproposal that is commendable on two major points: It helps hard-working \nAmericans and will get our economy moving.\n  Similarly, the Daschle approach talks about tax rebates for those \npeople who did not enjoy the previous tax rebates enacted last spring.\n  These are individuals who may not pay income taxes, but they pay a \ngreat deal of their hard-earned wages in payroll taxes. For those \nindividuals, they deserve the kind of rebate that others received.\n  There has been an insinuation in some of the discussions on the floor \ntoday that these people do not contribute to our economy, that somehow \nthey are not part of the great economic enterprise in our country, I \nmust disagree very strongly with that proposition. These are the men \nand women who get up each day, go to very difficult jobs in hotels, \ndriving trucks, small businesses, running them and sometimes working in \nthem. These people deserve the same kind of benefits others receive.\n  In addition, a rebate for these individuals also achieves a second \nimportant goal. Typically, money received by wage earners will go right \nback into the economy because in a household living on minimum wage or \nnear minimum wage, struggling to raise children, struggling to get by, \nthere is always the opportunity to spend a little bit more on the \nchildren, to spend a little bit more to defray the cost of life.\n  Again, Senator Daschle's proposal has touched upon a topic that is \nvery important to both sides, and that is bonus depreciation for \nbusiness: Give business incentives to make sure they go back into the \ncapital markets, to go ahead and buy capital equipment, to make \ninvestments which we hope will be both productive and also get the \neconomy moving.\n  One of the key differences between the Daschle proposal and other \nproposals is that Senator Daschle recognizes that in order to be \neffective as a stimulus, it has to be timely, it has to be limited to \nthis year, not 2 and 3 years from now when this recession, we hope--\nindeed, we believe--will be something in the past. If we want to be \neffective, if we want to stimulate the economy, then we have to focus \nand target this bonus depreciation for business.\n  The final element in this package is fiscal relief for the States. We \nhave to recognize that the States are under extraordinary pressure \nbecause of this recession. Their tax revenues have fallen, but their \ncommitments to human services and to a host of other programs will not \nabate. They must have the resources to provide for medical assistance \nfor working Americans. They must have the resources for the child \nprotection system, which the States run. They must have the resources \nfor education, which the States primarily run.\n  Those obligations will not be held in abeyance during this recession. \nWe have the opportunity, if we support this initiative, to provide \nresources to the States, and if we do not provide those resources, many \nStates--most States--will be required constitutionally to balance their \nbudget by raising taxes or slashing their social services budgets, \nwhich will only worsen the impact of the recession on some of our most \nvulnerable citizens.\n  One of the ironies of our debate today is that while many of my \ncolleagues are talking about accelerating tax cuts, if we do not \nprovide assistance to States, we may very well see the States raising \ntaxes which will be a further check on our recovery.\n  Senator Daschle's legislation makes eminently good sense on economic \ngrounds, and it is the only proposal which has received the support of \na sufficient number of Senators so that it can be enacted into law, or \nat the very least passed by this body and sent to conference with the \nother Chamber.\n  The resistance to moving forward quickly on this package, is truly \nsomething to behold even in light of Senator Daschle's offer to allow \nfor amendments from both sides of the aisle. But frankly, this is the \ncore of the economic initiatives that we agree upon and which will \nprovide real relief, first, to struggling Americans and, second, \noverall to an economy that is in recession.\n\n  Madam President, I have the responsibility of serving as the vice \nchairperson of the Joint Economic Committee. Our staff has been doing \nan outstanding job trying to pull together the economic analysis that \nshould provide us at least a roadmap, if you will, for any economic \nstimulus legislative. Let me summarize the consensus view of our \ncurrent economic situation.\n  First, despite some encouraging signals about the economy, it remains \nweak. Just ask anyone who reads the newspapers and they can tell you \nthat. When Ford Motor Company lays off thousands of people, when a \nmajor retail chain, Kmart, goes into bankruptcy reorganization--\ninterestingly enough, I was talking to someone who is connected to one \nof our larger toy manufacturers in the United States, who told me there \nare only four major distribution channels for toys in the United \nStates, the four major department store chains, and one of them, 25 \npercent of the retail market, is in bankruptcy reorganization. So we \nhave a very weak economy.\n  There are many conditions in place already for a recovery, and most \nforecasters believe that within 3 to 6 months, there will be an \neconomic recovery. But most also believe this recovery will be rather \nanemic, rather weak; it will not be the kind of robust growth that we \nsaw in the nineties.\n  Indeed, all of these forecasts are based on some significant \nuncertainties. Two significant uncertainties are the condition of \nforeign economies such as the economic meltdown in Argentina. The \nquestion is: Will it be contained to Argentina? Will it spread to other \nparts of South America? Will other countries find themselves in \neconomic distress?\n  Generally speaking, this recession is not unique to the United \nStates. It is a worldwide phenomenon. Those economies will affect \nwhether we come out of this in a robust fashion and when we will come \nout of this recession.\n  There is something else, too, that is an uncertainty: consumer \nspending. Will it bounce back to the levels that have sustained this \neconomy over the last several years, or will people for many reasons, \nbecause of concern about their safety, because of a sense in this \nmoment of national danger? Will those psychological factors and \nsociological factors undermine a robust response by our consumer \nsector? It may be that the patterns of past economic recoveries are not \napplicable today.\n  Even though forecasters are projecting recovery, there is much \nuncertainty. Even when the recovery comes, one of the great tasks will \nstill be undone, and that is to provide support and help for those who \nare out of work today, who deserve the opportunity to support their \nfamilies while they wait for this economy to recover.\n  One of the interesting facts about economic trends is that even when \nthe economy begins to respond, when gross domestic product becomes \npositive again and starts growing, usually unemployment continues to \nincrease for many months after that. In the nineties, when the recovery \ntook hold unemployment continued to increase for about 15 months.\n  For most Americans, the economy is measured by one simple fact: Do I \nhave a job? And, collectively, what is the unemployment rate for this \ncountry?\n\n[[Page S69]]\n\n  We can foresee even with a modest rebound this year or next year the \nsingle factor that confronts most families, their economic index--do I \nhave a job?--is still going to be questionable. So we have to act.\n  Again, Senator Daschle's proposal, at its core, at the heart of it, \nhas a very simple, time-tested provision: extending unemployment \nbenefits. At a minimum, we should be able to agree to do that this \nweek.\n  I mentioned there were some encouraging signals about the economy, \nand it is fair and, I think, appropriate to mention those.\n  First, we have seen an increase in the average weekly hours worked in \nmanufacturing. Up until recently, those hours were declining, signaling \na weakness in our manufacturing sector, which because of the relatively \nhigh pay of that type of work is a pillar of our economy. And we are \nbeginning to see that initial claims for unemployment are not \nincreasing with the same level each and every week.\n  We have seen some increases in new orders for capital equipment, \nparticularly information technology. Again, a great deal of the boom \nover the last decade was fueled by increased investment in information \ntechnology, computers and routers and service and a host of other \nequipment. That appears to be coming back.\n  Once again, it is very fragile. If we listen to the commentators on \nthe business channels, one week Intel will do well because they are \nshipping a lot of chips, and the next week their projections are down \nand their stock goes up and down. So we are certainly not out of the \nwoods, but there is some encouragement.\n  There also seems to be increased optimism among the purchasing \nmanagers in the country. Those business men and women who are in charge \nand want to go ahead and order equipment, seem to be much more \noptimistic. So there is encouraging news.\n  All of this is good news, but as I said before, our economy is still \nweak and a well-tailored, well-timed, and well-targeted stimulus \npackage would still be a boost to our economy.\n  The economy is weak in many different ways. The unemployment rate \nrose to 5.8 percent in December. That is 8.3 million people; not \nstatistics, people, 8.3 million people who were told they did not have \na job, who had to go home in the evening and tell their spouse they did \nnot have a job, who had to look at their children knowing they did not \nhave a job. They deserve our assistance now, not our rhetoric.\n  As I indicated before, within those statistics one of the most \nalarming trends is the increase in long-term unemployment. Nearly 1 in \nevery 7 of those who are unemployed, 1.2 million people, had been \njobless for more than 26 weeks, exhausting their benefits or on the \nverge of exhausting their benefits. So not only do they not have a job, \nthey do not have an unemployment check either, unless we act.\n  We were looking very closely last December at the holiday sales. They \nseemed to be better than expected, but I might point out still much \nweaker than a year earlier.\n  So we are in a position economically where there are mixed signals, \nweakness but some encouraging signs. There are also some structural \nissues that will, I hope, bode well for the future.\n  First, inflation has been relatively stable. That has been a \nsituation that has allowed the Federal Reserve to employ a very \naggressive monetary policy of lowering interest rates to try to \nstimulate this economy. That is a good thing for us and a good thing \nfor our economy.\n  Short-term interest rates are as low now as they have been since the \n1960s. Although long-term rates have not fallen as much as we would \nlike, they are lower than a year ago. Business inventories are low as \nwell, which is a sign that we are beginning to work through the buildup \nin inventory which was hampering further production. There are no \nobvious supply bottlenecks, but the reality is monetary policy alone \nmay not drive us out of this recession quickly enough or robustly \nenough.\n  It is interesting to note the remarks of Chairman Greenspan over the \nlast several weeks have been cautious about the timing and the scale of \nour economic recovery. His recent caution is in marked contrast to his \nand others past comments. So I think we are beginning to recognize our \naction would be very helpful to our economy.\n  I urge, as I have repeatedly, that we act and we act on those \nsensible proposals offered by Senator Daschle.\n\n  As I said, most economists predict a recovery will begin late in the \nspring. Even if that recovery begins, we still need to assist those \nAmericans who are unemployed today and who will continue to be \nunemployed. As I mentioned, in the early 1990s, at the end of the last \nrecession, unemployment increased for 15 months after the recession was \nofficially over. It is also typical that those long-term unemployed are \nthe last to find reemployment. So they are in a very precarious \nposition--without benefits, without the prospect of a job, usually the \nfirst to be fired and the last to be rehired. We can help them. We must \nhelp them. I hope we do help them this week as we consider quickly this \nlegislation before us.\n  By extending unemployment insurance benefits, we can assist them and \nwe can do it in a way which will not be detrimental to our looming \ndeficit problem because unemployment insurance is a countercyclical \nprogram. As the economy recovers, as employment grows, people do not \nreceive unemployment benefits. Today they need them. Hopefully, with a \nrobust economy in 6 months or 9 months or 1 year, those expenses will \nno longer be borne by the Federal Government. These individuals will be \nback in the workforce.\n  I urge, once again, we move very quickly on the proposals that have \nbeen suggested by Senator Daschle. All of them have been vetted by \neconomists from a range of opinions. They have been determined to not \nonly help individual Americans but also to have a positive stimulative \neffect and to help our overall economy by putting money into the \neconomy and by allowing States to forego income or sales tax increases \nat the State level. All of this makes a great deal of sense and it \nshould be done.\n  One other point I will conclude with, and we have all been reflecting \non the drama in Texas and other places of Enron. One of the most \ndisturbing aspects of that situation is that the retirement security of \nthe employees was ignored by the leadership of that company in many \ndifferent ways. All of us, every single Member of this Senate, will \nrightly, I think, very sincerely, criticize what has taken place. But \ntoday, we are already encroaching on the Social Security trust fund. \nThat is what it means when we start saying we have a deficit because we \nare no longer accumulating a surplus. We are now working our way \nthrough Social Security funds, funds that have been pledged for over 60 \nyears to those Americans who have reached retirement age. So when I \nhear discussions about accelerating tax breaks, and when we have people \ncoming out and saying simply, as a matter of faith not economics, we \nhave to lower taxes, I wonder whether a year from now, 2 years from \nnow, 3 years from now, people will look at us as those employees down \nin Houston look at the Enron leadership and say: You took our \nretirement. You spent it. You gave it away on bonuses to executives. \nYou just dissipated it, not to help the economy but to help yourself.\n  So as a cautionary point at this juncture, as we consider a whole \nrange of proposals, I would like to leave at least that thought in the \nminds of my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I gave some opening remarks a little \nearlier on this legislation, but I will reiterate a few points I made \nfrom that first statement. The most important thing to remember, as we \nare trying to reach an agreement on a stimulus package, is there has \nbeen a lot of work put into this over the last several weeks--not since \nthe holidays but before the holidays--and we have had partisan \napproaches by both Republicans and Democrats. We have had bipartisan \napproaches. We have had cooperation between some Members of Congress \nand the White House, and we have a bipartisan White House-centrist \npackage that has passed the House that the President said he would \nsign, and one that had a majority vote, if we had taken a vote in the \nSenate before the holidays, that could have been to the President by \nnow. It would have been to the President, signed into law, and\n\n[[Page S70]]\n\nhelping 800,000 people unemployed since the September 11 terrorist \nattacks on America.\n\n  This White House-centrist bipartisan package is a solid economic \nstimulus plan. Most important, it has a compassionate approach to put \ndisplaced workers first, and even more so than the amendment offered by \nSenator Daschle because he does--as I would agree to do--put in 13 \nweeks of additional unemployment compensation. However, his consensus \npackage does nothing for those unemployed workers now who had health \ninsurance previously. They have to pay the health insurance called \nCOBRA out of their own pocket. The proposal I call the White House-\ncentrist bipartisan package has a 60-percent tax credit for that.\n  It is important to have a bipartisan plan. This White House-centrist \npackage is a plan that can pass the Senate. Most important, this plan, \nif passed, will be signed by the President because he has said so. I \nwas in on that bipartisan meeting the President had with House leaders, \nwith Democrats from the Senate, and with Republican moderates. He said \nhe would sign it.\n  If we pursue the majority leader's plan, workers and businesses will \nface more delays because that plan will have to be conferenced with the \nHouse. That is going to take days probably. It could even take some \nweeks. The further we get along, the more there tends to be a recovery, \nthe less economic good that stimulus package will do. It will be a \ndelayed effort to help those 800,000 people who are unemployed and \nthose people who do not have health insurance. If we use the bipartisan \nWhite House-centrist package, we will be able to get that passed right \naway.\n  How long would it take to get it through conference? Just remember \nhow long it took to agree that we ought to have the quasi-conference \nprocedure that we operated a couple weeks before the holidays. Remember \nhow long it took to reach the substantive agreement we have, the \nbipartisan White House-centrist package. All this history--and we ought \nto learn from history--ought to dictate the time to act is now, not a \nmonth from now.\n  We had Chairman Greenspan advising the President, advising Congress \nin early October, that was a time to pass the stimulus package--not \nonly pass it now as a stimulus, but we need to do it for the workers. \nThat is what we need to do for small business, as well.\n  The bottom line is, if we pass the White House-centrist bipartisan \nbill, unemployment checks can go out to those people who have exhausted \ntheir 26 weeks. Businesses will invest in new plant equipment with a \n30-percent, 2-year accelerated depreciation. Unemployed workers will \nget help for their health insurance so they can continue to have \ncoverage for their families, as they did before they were laid off. \nTaxpayers will get a payroll tax rebate. Taxpayers will get a little \nextra income tax relief to spend. New York City, hurt by September 11 \nterrorist attacks and needing help, will receive aid to rebuild. This \ncould occur tomorrow if we get a chance to vote upon the bill that \npassed the House of Representatives before the holidays, the very same \nbill the President said he would sign.\n  We are talking about moving ahead on a stimulus package. Now, instead \nof talking about the bipartisan White House-centrist package, we are \ntalking about the new, scaled-back stimulus plan offered within the \nlast 24 hours by our distinguished majority leader. This isn't the \nfirst time there has been a stimulus plan offered by the other side. \nThis is the third variation on a stimulus plan offered by the \ndistinguished Senator who is our majority leader.\n  As most Members know, the Democrats initially passed the stimulus \nplan out of the Finance Committee, not in the spirit of how the Finance \nCommittee usually works in a bipartisan fashion, but in a wholly \npartisan mode. It happens that with all the work put into that \ncommittee hearing, that plan was never sent to the floor for a vote. \nThe distinguished majority leader almost immediately radically modified \nthe Senate Finance Committee partisan stimulus proposal--again, acting \nin a partisan way. And nothing gets done in the Senate if it is done by \none party. That is why it is so important to remind people of the White \nHouse-centrist bipartisan stimulus package that the President said he \nwould pass.\n  Surprisingly, that revised proposal that the Senate majority leader \nput on our table immediately after the partisan bill came out of \ncommittee looks a great deal like the White House-centrist bipartisan \nstimulus package I have been referring to that we ought to pass and \nsend to the White House. A substitute back in November, put on the \ntable by Senator Daschle, adopted measures initially promoted by many \nRepublicans. Unfortunately, in December, the majority leader blocked a \nvote on the White House-centrist plan in large part, I believe, out of \nfear it would pass. And it would have.\n  Now comes yet another variation of that theme. The majority leader \nhas delivered yet another economic stimulus package--basically the \nskeletal remains of previous stimulus proposals.\n  I will talk about some of the differences between the White House-\ncentrist bipartisan package and the partisan Democrat skeleton stimulus \nplan. I will explain, then, why I believe the bipartisan White House-\ncentrist package is better for America and, most importantly, for those \ndislocated workers, and particularly for the dislocated workers who do \nnot have health insurance. I will look at what it does for displaced \nworkers.\n  This is the White House-centrist package. Our unemployment insurance \nproposal represents an unprecedented commitment to American workers. We \nprovide up to 13 weeks of additional unemployment benefit to eligible \nworkers who exhaust their regular benefits between March 15, 2001, and \nDecember 31, 2002. We have an estimated 3 million unemployed workers \nqualifying for an average of $230 a week. These benefits would be 100-\npercent federally funded at a cost of about $10 billion. Our proposal \ntransfers an additional $9 billion to State unemployed trust funds.\n  Such a transfer would provide the States with flexibility to pay \nadministrative costs, provide additional benefits, and avoid raising \nunemployment taxes which would be a bad thing for them to be forced to \ndo during the current recession. We never want to raise taxes during a \nrecession.\n  The United States enjoyed a growing economy and declining \nunemployment for much of the previous decade. But the economic slowdown \nthat officially became a recession started in March 2001. We all know \nthat was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks on September 11. That \nmeant more substantial layoffs. I said this recession started in March \n2001. Economists officially labeled it a recession. But remember that a \nlong time before that--almost a year, March 2000--we started a downturn \nin manufacturing. That manufacturing index, going back to the last year \nof the Clinton administration, has still been going down 19 months in a \nrow. Even though the official recession started in March 2001, those in \nmanufacturing had been in recession for a whole year before that.\n  We have seen the unemployment rate for all segments of the economy \nrise from 4 percent in November 2000 to 5.7 in November 2001. By \nhistorical standards, you could say the current unemployment rate is \nstill substantially below the level at which Congress deemed it \nnecessary to enact extended unemployment benefits based upon what \nCongress has done for the few times in the past. Over the past 50 \nyears, the Federal Government provided temporary extended unemployment \nbenefits only six other times. The average unemployment rate during \nthose times was far higher than it is right now at 7.3 percent as an \naverage for those six times.\n  Based upon historical record, the President did not go as far with \nhis suggestion for helping unemployed people as the bipartisan centrist \nstimulus package does. The President originally suggested that extended \nunemployment benefits--meaning the additional 13 weeks--should be \nlimited to those few States that have a disaster declaration in effect \nas a result of September 11 and which have a threshold of the 30-\npercent increase in their unemployment rate.\n  A number of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle insisted we \nprovide immediate assistance, not just to a few States as the President \nsuggested but to every State, regardless of their unemployment rate. We \nhave agreed to do exactly that in our bipartisan centrist stimulus \npackage. The President has agreed to sign it even though it didn't \nstart out at that point.\n\n[[Page S71]]\n\n  We have some, unfortunately, on the other side of the aisle who \ncontinue to insist that what we are doing is not enough. They insist \nthat we should go further by requiring every State to provide specific \nbenefits and establish specific eligibility criteria as a condition of \nreceiving their additional Federal assistance of 13 weeks. In other \nwords, what they are suggesting is that we violate the agreement we had \nbetween the States and Federal Government, for the most part letting \nStates decide who should and under what circumstances they qualify for \nunemployment assistance.\n  We could not agree to the demands on the other side to change this \nlongstanding relationship between the Federal Government and the State \ngovernments on the policy of unemployment compensation. We have always \nleft those decisions about benefit levels and eligibility criteria to \nthe States.\n  The changes sought by those on the other side of the aisle destroy \nthis historic relationship and undermine the flexibility needed by \nStates to respond to their unique circumstances while ignoring a fact \nabout America--that we are geographically vast; our population is very \nheterogeneous. Consequently, you can't pour one mold in Washington, DC, \nthat fits the needs of New Mexico the same as New York City, or Iowa \nthe same as Sacramento, CA. Leave us leave it to the legislatures of \nCalifornia, Iowa, New Mexico, and New York to decide what the policy \nshould be for their States as those people closer to the grassroots see \ntheir needs. To me, that is just a commonsense approach to governing. \nIt might not be a commonsense approach in England where the country is \nsmall, but it is obviously the sort of thing we need to do in our \nfederal form of government.\n\n  I would now like to touch on the White House-centrist bipartisan plan \ncommitment to providing health care for dislocated workers because the \nplan that the distinguished Senator majority leader has put on the \ntable does not deal with this at all.\n  If there is one thing I could point out from his remarks this \nmorning, it is that he tried to make the point that his package has \nonly things in it to which both sides agreed. I think he is misreading \nthe Republican side of the aisle. There is a great deal of commitment \non the part of Republicans--the vast majority of our caucus--to meet \nthe health care needs of people who are dislocated workers because of \nSeptember 11. Quite frankly, it would do this for the first time in the \nhistory of our public policy.\n  They have been saying since October that Republicans don't care about \nhelping workers with health insurance. I quote Senator Daschle himself \nlast December saying that his Republican colleagues ``so far have \nrefused to come to the table and negotiate seriously.''\n  There is nothing further from the truth. Since October, when \nPresident Bush first called on Congress to pass the stimulus package, I \nhave worked closely and seriously with both Democrats and Republicans \nto come up with a meaningful, bipartisan approach to helping people \nimpacted by the events of September 11. Compared to where we started on \nthe issue of health care for the dislocated workers, Republicans have \ncome a very long way to a position with which a majority of our caucus \nagrees. I do the history on this just to prove the point.\n  This debate began, let us say, back in October--too long ago, I am \nsorry to say, and embarrassed to say. We should have passed this bill \nwhen the recession first hit its lowest point. Our proposal at that \ntime relied on a national emergency grant program to deliver health \nbenefits to workers at a cost of just $3 billion. We look back now, and \nwe say that just doesn't do it. Over time, the number grew. I said \npublicly that we could double or even triple that number.\n  I also invited Democrats to modify the grant criteria to make the \nprogram more responsive to the needs of workers without health \ninsurance. I even offered some Democrats the opportunity to write the \ncriteria, if we could agree on doing it through national emergency \ngrant programs. The reason for that is you can deliver the help to \nthose who do not have health insurance within 30 days after the \nPresident would sign the bill. But the Members of the other party \nrefused. And that did not stop us from staying at the negotiating \ntable, regardless of what the distinguished majority leader says about \nour refusal to negotiate.\n\n  (Mr. JOHNSON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Additionally, we proposed giving workers a refundable, \nadvanceable tax credit towards the purchase of health insurance equal \nto 50 percent of the policy's cost. So we moved away from a national \nemergency grant program to one that is probably more dynamic, with more \nflexibility for the workers--a tax credit for those who are unemployed \nto continue the insurance they had where they previously worked and \nwere laid off; and even go beyond that, for people to have health \ninsurance even if they did not have health insurance at their previous \njob before they were laid off.\n  Democrats objected, claiming that the credit was too small and that \nsicker people would have trouble buying policies in the individual \nmarket. So there was one gripe after another, but we tried to satisfy \nthose gripes to reach a consensus agreement which ended up being the \nbipartisan centrist-White House program.\n  Our new proposal then was endorsed by the White House even though the \nPresident had suggested another approach. It was endorsed by the White \nHouse, the House of Representatives, and by the bipartisan centrist \ngroup of this body. That program takes a three-pronged approach to \ngetting health insurance assistance to those dislocated workers who \nused to have health insurance where they first worked. Now they are \nunemployed. Now they do not have health insurance. Now they would have \nhealth insurance under the White House-centrist bipartisan package, but \nthey would not have it under the Daschle amendment before the Senate.\n  Our proposal goes further and wider than any proposal on the table to \ndate and gets more help to more people more quickly than any other \nproposal to date. What is more, it represents a giant leap in spending \non health care. It includes over six times as much money for temporary \nhealth insurance assistance as our original Republican, and admittedly \npartisan, proposal.\n  The House-passed stimulus bill--what the President said he would \nsign, and the centrist group in the Senate backs--would spend \napproximately $19 billion on temporary health insurance in the year \n2002. And it does it the right way, by using existing programs, along \nwith new ones, designed to get people the help they need quickly.\n  Now I take a minute to describe our three-pronged approach.\n  First, the White House-centrist bipartisan proposal provides a \nrefundable, advanceable tax credit to all displaced workers eligible \nfor unemployment insurance, not just those eligible for COBRA. The \nvalue of the credit is 60 percent of the premium, instead of the 50 \npercent in our original proposal. The credit has no cap and is \navailable to individuals for 12 months between the years 2001 and 2003.\n  Individuals can stay in their employer COBRA coverage or they can \nchoose policies in the individual markets that may better fit their \nfamilies' needs. This only makes sense because locking people into \nCOBRA, as the Democratic leadership insisted prior to Christmas--and it \nis not even in their proposal now--forces people to stay with policies \nthat may be too expensive for them to keep, even with a 60-percent \nsubsidy.\n  Our goal was to give dislocated workers access to all health \ninsurance choices available to them in the private marketplace. We have \ndone that in a responsible way that uses the dynamics of the \nmarketplace rather than the straitjacket of a Government program to \ndeliver the help.\n\n  This bipartisan White House-centrist proposal includes major new \ninsurance reforms to protect people who have had employer-sponsored \ncoverage and go out into the private market for the first time after \nbeing laid off. It makes the COBRA protections available to people who \nhave had only 12 months of employer-sponsored coverage, rather than 18 \nmonths as under current law. By doing this, we greatly expand the group \nof displaced workers who cannot be turned down for coverage or excluded \nfrom any insurance because of preexisting conditions.\n  The new 12-month standard is especially important for people with \nchronic conditions who have difficulty obtaining affordable coverage. \nIt is a\n\n[[Page S72]]\n\nmajor step, and I am surprised that the Democratic leadership does not \nwant to take us up on these sweeping new reforms.\n  I turn now to the mechanics of the tax credit proposal. It is much \neasier to implement than the direct subsidy approach that the \nDemocratic leadership has had in some of their proposals. But there is \nnothing on health insurance in the Democratic amendment before us. They \njust forget about the needs of the dislocated workers who used to have \nhealth insurance who do not have it now because they are unemployed.\n  While the Democrat proposal requires employers to shoulder the \nburdens, our proposal relies on existing State unemployment insurance \nsystems. So under this bill, workers will be able to access the credit \nand begin applying it to their health insurance premiums in a timely \nway. Let me explain the workings of it.\n  Newly dislocated workers will receive certificates from their State \nunemployment offices, or ``one stop'' centers, when they apply for \nunemployment insurance. You can take care of both needs at one time--\nunemployment insurance and continue your health insurance from the \nprevious employer. Or if you did not have it there, you can get a \ncertificate to go out and get it for the first time.\n  So you take those certificates and submit them, along with their \ncontribution to the premium, to their employer or insurer, and move on \nwith insurance. Afterwards, insurers then would submit the certificates \nto the Treasury Department for reimbursement.\n  This approach works because it relies on existing systems to deliver \nnew benefits and, as a result, delivers those benefits in a fast and \nreliable way.\n  I ask my colleagues, why would anyone insist on a mechanism that just \nwill not deliver the goods to the people who need them? In other words, \npeople who became unemployed yesterday have lost their health \ninsurance, they cannot afford to keep their COBRA up, or maybe they are \nunemployed from a place that did not even have health insurance and \nthen have to institute some system where they have to wait a long time \nto get the help. I do not understand the wait.\n  The second prong of this proposal is $4 billion in enhanced national \nemergency grants for the States, which can be used to help all \nworkers--not just those eligible for the tax credit--to pay for health \ninsurance. States have flexibility under our approach and can use these \ngrants to enroll their workers in high-risk pools or other State-run \nplans, or even enroll them in Medicaid if the State decides.\n  To address concerns raised by Democratic colleagues, our enhanced \nnational emergency grant program requires all States to spend at least \n30 percent of their grant money on temporary health insurance \nassistance. In addition, we have included protections for the States--a \nminimum grant of at least $5 million for any State that meets the grant \ncriteria.\n  Finally, the third prong of the proposal responds to Democratic \nrequests by including $4.3 billion for a one-time temporary State \nhealth care assistance payment to the States to help bolster their \nMedicaid Programs.\n  Just this Monday, I had a State senator from Davenport, IA, speak to \nme at one of my town meetings about the needs of the States for \nadditional Medicaid funds. I said to her that Governor Vilsack and \nRepublican leaders and Democratic leaders had a conference call with me \non that very subject before Christmas. I said we have this $4.3 billion \nin this White House-centrist bipartisan package that the President will \nsign, that has passed the House of Representatives.\n  What you need to do is get Governor Vilsack, I said to our State \nSenator, who I said I would help, get him to call Senator Daschle and \nask this bill to come up, and you will have Iowa's share of this $4.3 \nbillion.\n  As we know, the Medicaid program is an important safety net for low-\nincome children and families and disabled individuals. Medicaid is a \njoint Federal and State program that accounts for a large part of State \nbudgets. So in this time of budget constraints due to recession, States \nare struggling to make ends meet. Iowa is one of those. In fact, I \nthink I read in the newspapers that there are 40 States that have very \nserious budget problems, and Medicaid is probably the biggest one of \nthose budget problems in almost all of those States.\n  So as a result of the unique and extraordinary economic situation we \nnow face, we need to help those States rather than having those States \nscale back Medicaid services, including my own State of Iowa. I think \nwe are going to be scaled back by $18 million. This provision provides \na one-time emergency cash injection that will help States avoid \nMedicaid cutbacks.\n  This feature was not part of our original plan. I just say that. You \nmight ask: Senator Grassley, why didn't you have it in your original \nplan? Well, the process of legislation is evolution of a bill. There \nare very few bills in Congress that are introduced and passed as they \nare originally introduced. I would not pretend to believe that every \nbill I introduce is a perfect piece of legislation. This process of \nnegotiation on these, listening both on the Republican side and the \nDemocratic side, is one of improving a piece of legislation, and even \nafter that is done, with new ideas in it, you have to recognize that \nmany of our colleagues have concerns about even this provision. In \nfact, I share their reservations, and that is why I am emphasizing that \nthis is not simply a garden variety increase in Medicaid funding; this \nis to meet the temporary emergency payments that result from a downturn \nin the economy because of the terrorist attacks of September 11 that \nhave not only affected the Federal budget situation but most of our \nStates.\n  This Nation is calling for a bipartisan compromise. In that spirit, \nwe have agreed to add this proposal on Medicaid to our bill.\n  We made tremendous steps towards the Democratic position in order to \nfind bipartisan compromise on health care, a compromise on health care \nthat is not even in the Democratic proposal that is before the Senate. \nI said that what we have included in here our Republicans would vote \nfor, I think, maybe except for two Republicans. And then we have enough \nDemocrats that make up a majority to get this bill passed. But those \nsteps have not been reciprocated by the Democratic leadership.\n  Displaced workers then deserve to be treated with respect by this \nbody, and I believe those workers have earned a vote on this bill. In \nother words, the House has passed this bipartisan White House-centrist \npackage. The President has said he would sign it. So if we have a \nmajority vote here, we could pass this, and it would be out of the way. \nWe would be stimulating the economy, and we would be helping dislocated \nworkers.\n  It is necessary for me now to discuss the individual income tax \nreductions in the White House-centrist plan and also compare this to \nthe skeletal plan put forth by our distinguished majority leader.\n  The original House stimulus bill would have accelerated the reduction \nof the 27 percent rate to 25 percent. That otherwise would not be \nscheduled to go into effect until the year 2007. The White House-\ncentrist package has adopted this approach.\n\n  Here is another thing on the charts that the majority leader used in \nhis speech this morning. He referred to ``rates reduction''--plural, \n``rates.'' We have one rate reduction, the 25 percent bracket, or let's \nsay the 27 percent down to 25. We don't change other rates. We do have \nother tax provisions, the tax rebate for low-income people.\n  So we have the White House-centrist bipartisan package helping these \nmiddle class taxpayers. The skeletal Democrat plan doesn't do this. It \ndoes not provide one red cent of tax relief for people who are working \nfor a living, not even one cent of tax relief for working Americans. So \nlet's take a look at who will benefit from our planned rate reduction.\n  I have some charts I will be referring to. The reduction of the 27 \npercent rate will benefit singles with taxable income of at least \n$27,000. I want people to think about this, a single person with income \nas little as $27,000. Somebody is going to be saying before the day is \nout that these people are not overtaxed. I would like to have you ask \npeople making $27,000 if they couldn't use a reduction of their income \ntax from 27 percent down to 25 percent. They would probably laugh at us \nfor suggesting that that is not enough.\n\n[[Page S73]]\n\n  We are talking about heads of households that would have income as \nlittle as $36,250 and married couples with taxable income as low as \n$45,000. These are not wealthy individuals. These are middle class \nworking Americans. I have the chart I referred to that Members can see. \nI want them to see what the median income for a four-person family for \nevery State in the Nation.\n  Median income is the amount of income right in the middle, with half \nthe incomes above and the other half below. Our chart shows that the \naverage median income for a four-person family in the United States, as \nwe can see, is $62,098. A family of four now, that is the average. \nRemember, half are below and half are above. A reduction of the 27 \npercent rate to 25 will benefit married couples with taxable income \nover $45,000. So it will benefit working people who are well below the \nnational median income level.\n  This chart also shows those States that have family median income \nthat is higher than the national average. And so we can look at where \nthese people live: Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Michigan, Rhode \nIsland, California, Washington State. These are the States where a \nfamily of four will benefit the most from our proposed tax cuts.\n  The more surprising figures are shown in the next chart. We can see \nthe States with median income below the national average. So you recall \nthat I said that reducing the 27 percent rate to 25 percent will \nbenefit married couples with taxable incomes over $45,000. Look at the \nmedian income distribution of this chart. You can see from this chart \nthat there is not one State on the list that has a median family income \nof less than $45,000.\n  So you can see that our proposal will benefit everyone, not just the \nelite few, not just from a few selected States. But the distinguished \nmajority leader's Democratic skeletal plan provides no relief for these \nStates. The Treasury Department has estimated that the White House-\ncentrist bipartisan plan's acceleration of the 27 percent rate will \nyield $17.9 billion of tax relief in the year 2002 for over 36 million \ntaxpayers. That is one-third of all income tax payers. Small business \nowners and entrepreneurs account for 10 million or 30 percent of those \nbenefiting from this rate reduction.\n  When you refuse to accelerate the rate cuts, you harm farmers and \nsmall businesspersons the most. That is because most small \nbusinessowners and farmers operate their businesses as sole \nproprietors, sub-S corporations, partnerships. The income in these \ntypes of entities is reported directly in individual tax returns. \nTherefore, a rate reduction for individuals reduces taxes for farmers \nand small businesses. That is why the rate reduction under the \nbipartisan White House-centrist plan is so important. In 2002 alone, it \ninjects $17.9 billion of stimulus into our ailing economy, and it helps \nsmall businesses that create the new jobs.\n  So what would a small business do with these tax savings? Well, \nconsidering that most of the recent job growth has come from small \nbusinesses, I believe they would feel safe hiring more people and \nmaking more business investment. We know that 80 percent of the 11.1 \nmillion new jobs created between 1994 and 1998 were from businesses \nwith less than 20 employees. Eighty percent of American businesses have \nfewer than 20 employees. That is why I refer to this as the 80-80 rule \nfor supporting tax reductions.\n  In addition, lowering taxes now would increase business cashflow \nduring the current economic slowdown. The higher cashflow would \nincrease demand for investment and labor. Don't just take my word for \nit because we have the National Bureau of Economic Research. They \nproduced, in October 2000, a publication called ``Personal Income Taxes \nand the Growth of Small Firms.'' As you know, the National Bureau of \nEconomic Research is a well-regarded, nonpartisan organization. It is \nthe organization that determines when official recessions begin and \nwhen they end. They said this one began in March 2001. If we trust them \nto make that determination, I hope we trust the conclusions reached in \ntheir report.\n  Their report on individual taxes and small business growth reaches \nthe unambiguous conclusion that when a sole proprietor's marginal tax \nrate goes up, the rate of growth of his or her business enterprise goes \ndown. Simply stated, high personal income tax rates discourage the \ngrowth of small business and right now, in a recession, that is the \nlast thing we need.\n  That is why it is important to do rate reductions and do them the \nright way and fully accelerate the 27-percent rate reduction. We are \nsimply accelerating a decision the Senate made last summer. We should \nnot, as has been suggested by some in the Democratic leadership, repeal \nrate reduction or, to state it correctly, we should not increase taxes. \nAgain, that is the last thing you should do in a recession.\n  We know tax cuts are stimulative. When working Americans have more of \ntheir own income, they are more financially secure and comfortable with \nspending.\n  Let me say who really loses when this body fails to act. It is our \ndisplaced workers, it is our fellow Americans who still have a job, it \nis the security of our job base, and it is the soundness of the \nNation's economy.\n  The Senate Democrat leadership will not allow an up-or-down vote on \nour bipartisan White House-centrist stimulus package. At least that was \nthe way it was before our holiday break. The reason why I don't think \nthey allowed it to be done is because it would pass. We have a majority \nof Senators--obviously, a bipartisan majority. Obviously, this proposal \ncomes from the center of the Senate, from conservative Democrats and \nmoderate Republicans. So what. That is how you get things done in the \nSenate.\n  I might not agree with everything in the package. I might be \nconsidered more conservative than those who put it together, but it is \na good package. More importantly, it meets the needs of our country \npost-September 11. It meets the needs of those dislocated workers, \nthose people who don't have health insurance.\n  So now where are we? We are at a point where the distinguished \nmajority leader has offered the skeletal remains of that package. But I \ndon't think there is a majority of Senators supporting that move. When \nyou get it all said and done, it doesn't help those people who don't \nhave health insurance.\n  I urge Senators to think twice before supporting something less than \nthe full stimulus package that was written by Democrats and Republicans \nin the center of the Senate and that was so done in a way that \nsatisfies the White House for signature. We need to enact a plan that \nwill stimulate the current economy and serve as insurance against a \nsecond downturn in the next few years.\n  For those in this body, both Republican and Democrat, there are a few \nwho say we will be better off if we don't pass the stimulus package, or \nthat we are recovering and we might not need it. I say to them, \nremember that most recessions have a double downturn. They have it when \nthe original recession kicks in, and then they have an upturn, and then \nthey have a down tick. A down tick probably is not a negative growth \nsituation, but it is still a downturn. This stimulus package will be \ninsurance against having a steady rise in the economy over the next few \nyears, with no down tick, as is traditional for some recoveries. We \nneed to enact a plan that will stimulate the current economy and give \nus that insurance.\n  The White House-centrist bipartisan package does that. I hope the \nSenate hears the pleas of the American people and will support a \ncomprehensive stimulus package--one that aids displaced workers, tends \nto their health care needs, and gives a real turbocharge to our \neconomy, and to do that into a full recovery, a recovery without a down \ntick, so those who need a job can get it and those who have a job can \nkeep it and relieve a lot of anxiety--particularly anxiety over not \nhaving health insurance, which unemployed people have.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am not interested in casting aspersions \ntoday at the work of our Republican friends with respect to the \neconomic\n\n[[Page S74]]\n\nrecovery package. I think, for the most part, they have entered into \nthis in good faith. Senator Grassley of Iowa has worked hard, as has \nSenator Baucus of Montana, to try to craft a consensus package that we \ncan all agree to--or at least 60 of us can--which would have a \nbeneficial effect. I wanted to speak briefly and reflect back for a \nmoment on the principles that we adopted on a bipartisan basis last \nfall as we approached the creation of an economic recovery package.\n  There are really three principles that come to mind. One is that \nwhatever we came up with should be temporary in nature; second, there \nshould truly be stimulative of our economy; three, it should not \nexacerbate long term the budget deficit of our Nation.\n\n  I can stand here along with any of our colleagues, certainly the \nPresiding Officer, and think of any number of items I would like to \ninclude in a stimulus package that are not included in the four-part \nproposal put forth by the majority leader.\n  He has suggested a 13-week extension in unemployment insurance \nbenefits; a tax rebate for those who did not receive a tax rebate \npreviously and who are very likely to spend that money sooner rather \nthan later; bonus depreciation incentive for businesses to renew \ncapital investment, which has been lacking for the last year or more \nnow; and fiscal relief for States with respect to their health care \ncosts.\n  My State of Delaware and other States are having a very difficult \ntime as the rolls of the unemployed rise, as the numbers of people who \nare eligible for Medicaid rise, and States need help with that.\n  As I look through that list of four proposals Senator Daschle has put \nforward, I see in those proposals ideas that are essentially temporary, \nthat are stimulative, and do not exacerbate our fiscal situation long \nterm.\n  If we are going to do something in this regard--we have been dancing \nthis dance for a long time--we need to get on with it. I applaud our \nleader for bringing it up early on, but if we do not do something soon, \nit is really too late.\n  When we were in economic recovery and expansion during the 1990s, a \nlot of people thought it was going to last forever. We know it did not. \nSimilarly, people think that when we are in a recession it will last \nforever, too, and we know from history that recessions do not last \nforever either. The history of recessions since World War II is that \nthey are generally a year and a half long; most are 12 months in \nduration. We have been in this one for almost 12 months.\n  I think one of the reasons the landing has been as soft as it has \nbeen--and I know it has not been for everyone--one of the reasons this \nrecession is not as deep as it otherwise might have been is because of \nsome of the most aggressive monetary policy by the Federal Reserve I \nhave witnessed in my lifetime, maybe the most aggressive policy which \nis now being felt in our economy.\n  Second, we have seen prices drop precipitously from a year ago. It is \nnot just the price of gasoline we put in our cars, trucks, and vans, \nbut it is the price of the heating oil we are using to heat our homes \nthis winter. Even natural gas prices are down dramatically. We feel \ngood about those things psychologically, but also they have a material \neffect on our economic well-being and our pocketbooks.\n  A third piece that is kicking in to help lessen the severity of the \nrecession is the amount of spending we are doing. We are spending a lot \nof money, and we are spending it, for the most part, on the right \nthings--the war in Afghanistan, the war against terrorism around the \nworld, trying to help the folks of New York recover and rebuild, trying \nto make sure the airline industry does not end up in a real depression \nwith massive layoffs and closings.\n  Those three things taken together--aggressive monetary policy by the \nFed, much lower energy prices, and the deficit spending we are already \ndoing--combine to help, if not lift, the economy to at least reduce the \ndepth to which it is dropping.\n  I am personally bullish about the economy. I think there is a pretty \ngood chance come spring we will be coming out of this recession. Some \nhave said it will be a jobless recovery and maybe mirror what we had in \n1990, 1991, and 1992. My sense is we will probably be coming out of it \nsooner rather than later.\n  The Federal Reserve will meet next week. They will debate whether or \nnot to lower interest rates again by maybe another quarter of a \npercent. I have no crystal ball. I am not sure what they are going to \ndo. They can do that or make no change at all.\n  The time will come when the concerns of the recession will give way \nto inflationary concerns. If we wait too long for this stimulus \npackage, we are going to put ourselves in the position of instead of \nbeing in concert with the Federal Reserve's monetary policy where we \npass a package that supports what the Federal Reserve does, we are \ngoing to be offering a package that will stimulate the economy which is \nalready on the rebound and the Federal Reserve's concerns will move to \nnot so much how do we get the economy moving, but how do we dampen down \ninflationary expectations.\n  I said to our leader any number of times: No bill is better than a \nbad bill with respect to economic recovery. What he has proposed is not \na bad bill. I believe it is quite a good proposal. As I said earlier, I \ncan certainly offer changes that I would like to see adopted that might \nmake it better. Frankly, so could our Republican friends as well.\n  This bare-bones approach works for me, but more important, I believe \nit will work for our country. It will provide the insurance policy \nalong with the Federal Reserve monetary policy, along with the energy \nprice drops, along with the spending we are already doing to make sure \nwhen we do get into this spring that the economic recovery we are \nhoping for will actually materialize.\n  We have been joined in the Chamber by Senator Baucus of Montana, \nchairman of the Finance Committee. I spoke of him when he was not in \nthe Chamber. I now thank him in person. No one has put more time, \nenergy, and effort into trying to develop a package with respect to the \neconomic recovery of our country than Senator Baucus. I wanted to \nexpress my thanks to him for the great work he has done.\n  My hope is we can move from this proposal today and actually adopt \nit, but if we cannot and if we do not, I want him to know he has my \nrespect and certainly my thanks. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what is the present parliamentary \nsituation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is Daschle amendment No. \n2698.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair, and I thank my good friend from \nDelaware, Mr. Carper, who is a great addition to this body, to the \ncountry, and certainly does great service for his State of Delaware. \nThe Senator is a good man.\n  Mr. President, like a lot of others, I have read the David McCullough \nbiography of President John Adams. I commend it to anybody listening \nwho has not read it. It is a wonderful story of a colossus of a man, \nJohn Adams. It is so inspirational, especially reading about that era \nin our country where men and women were very concerned about their \nfutures, most of them having left England, oppressed by Great Britain, \nand how they reacted to it, with the variety of people in the colonies \nat that time with different backgrounds and certainly not having \npresent-day communications. Nothing traveled faster than the speed of a \nhorse. It gave people time to reflect.\n  John Adams read thousands of books. He read all the political \nphilosophers of the time in original Greek, in original Latin, as did a \nlot of our Founding Fathers and women, too. Abigail Adams clearly was a \ngreat force in helping our country come together.\n  John Adams, as a major force for what was right for America, helped \npersuade the delegates assembled at the Continental Congress trying to \ndecide the future of our country to break away and declare \nindependence. He is the main reason for the words in the Declaration of \nIndependence. Thomas Jefferson wrote them, of course, but it was John \nAdams who was the primary mover in helping to persuade men and women in \ndifficult times to come together and do what was right and break away \nfrom Great Britain.\n  Then came the Revolutionary War. We were so ill prepared. Mr. \nPresident,\n\n[[Page S75]]\n\n35,000 British troops landed on Staten Island.\n  We had such a difficult time putting troops together, and it was John \nAdams, as the head of the War Board, who foresaw far ahead of anybody \nelse how difficult the Revolutionary War would be and began putting \ntogether the armaments in order to make that happen and how to prevail \nand how to deal with the Brits.\n  I only mention this because as we are debating an economic stimulus \nbill, an economic recovery bill, in many respects what we are doing is \nso far removed from those great Americans who met in Philadelphia, \nlater met in Washington, DC, in subsequent years, in helping develop \nand frame our country. This is a sterile debate compared with the \ndebates they had. It is a very important debate, but it is a sterile \ndebate. It is very important clearly because our economy is not out of \na recession.\n  Most businesses that study these matters for their livelihood believe \nwe are not out of the woods. The manufacturing sector is in very \ndifficult straits. There is some data that indicates maybe we are near \nthe end of the so-called recession, but it is my belief, in talking to \npeople around the country, business men and women, that we are not. \nThat is clearly the case with respect to at least a couple of million \npeople who, in addition, have lost their jobs compared with previous \nyears and deserve an extension of unemployment compensation benefits.\n  We do need to come together in the way our forefathers did back then. \nI do not want to be too dramatic or too simplistic about it, but when \nwe look back and think of what our Founding Fathers and mothers did and \nhow they came together in very difficult times, it is very inspiring. I \nurge us to tap into that, to remember what they did and to utilize and \nact in the same vein and try to do what is right for America.\n  I think if we are all honest with ourselves we know what is right is \nto forget this partisan bickering back and forth. Forget the labeling. \nForget the criticism. Forget trying to take credit. Just kind of do \nsomething which seems right, and right to me is some modest tax \nstimulus to help business and extending the unemployment compensation \nbenefits to help people who have lost their jobs.\n  Different Senators are going to have different ideas, but in the main \nI think we can do something pretty modest but on target and very \nquickly. I am quite confident the President wants the same thing and is \ntrying to achieve the same goals. I urge all of us on both ends of \nPennsylvania Avenue to in a larger sense be inspired by our Founding \nFathers and think of the difficulties they had in working together, and \nthey worked together.\n  The Thirteen Colonies actually voted unanimously for independence. \nOne State abstained, but 12 Colonies all voted unanimously. It was very \ndifficult. Think of the southern Colonies, the northern Colonies, much \ndifferent backgrounds, but they came together. They knew what was right \nfor America. On a much lower plane, if they could do what is right for \nAmerica back in 1776, clearly in the year 2002 we could pass a modest \neconomic stimulus package that makes sense for America. In that vein, I \nurge all of my colleagues to work together.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2701 to Amendment No. 2698\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \ninclude extension of expired agricultural disaster assistance programs \nto the economic recovery bill. My amendment, cosponsored by Senator \nEnzi, provides $1.8 billion for the Crop Disaster Program for losses \nincurred in calendar year 2001. Further, it provides $500 million for \nthe Livestock Assistance Program, $12 million of which will be directed \nto the American Indian Livestock Feed Program.\n  Extension of these agricultural disaster relief programs is \nnecessary. Why do I say so? It is because of an unprecedented streak of \npoor weather and economic conditions continue to hamper the economic \nprospects for farmers and ranchers throughout our country.\n  Farmers in parts of the South and northern-tier States have been \nparticularly hard hit. Although some sectors and some regions have \nbegun to recover, farmers' overall earnings from their farming \noperations, not including government payments, are down sharply from \nthe levels in the mid-1990s.\n  The current difficulties could not come at a worse time.\n  While struggling to survive three disastrous years, farmers are now \nfaced with sharply escalating operating costs due to higher energy and \nfertilizer prices, and basically higher operating costs.\n  According to the most recent projections provided by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, total farm expenses were estimated to rise \nanother $4.2 billion in 2001. This latest rise came on the heels of a \nnearly $10 billion increase in total farm expenses in the preceding \nyear, 2000.\n  Caught between severe and erratic weather conditions and rising \noperating costs, American agricultural producers have experienced a \nsevere economic squeeze.\n  The data kept by USDA's Economic Research Service demonstrate that \nnet farm business income was at a decade-low in 1999 and 2000. Thanks \nto a limited recovery in some sectors, USDA projects that farm business \nincome will rise slightly in 2001.\n  Still, unless government assistance is continued, net farm income in \n2001 is actually projected to be lower than farm income in those bad \nyears of 1999 and 2000. Even in sectors in which economic conditions \nhave been improving, such as livestock, poor grazing conditions have \npushed many ranchers to feed heifers for slaughter rather than using \nthem to rebuild their herds.\n  Not surprisingly, 3 years of economic hardship have taken a toll on \nthe farm economy. ERS statistics show farm debt rising in the last 3 \nyears at such a rapid rate, more than in the 1980s. In other words, \nfarmers are borrowing to continue their operations. This increased debt \nload adds further to farmers' operating costs.\n  In my home State of Montana, it is anticipated that 40 percent of \nproducers seeking operating loans this year will be denied if we fail \nto provide this assistance in this amendment.\n  Thus, if government efforts to support farm income are now \ncurtailed--with weather problems continuing, costs rising, and no time \nto recover from the contraction in farm operating income since 1998--\nthe economic impact on rural America could be devastating.\n  In a real sense, the economic problems that have afflicted the rest \nof the economy in recent months have been plaguing the farm economy for \nseveral years.\n  A downturn in farm income does not just impact farmers; it wreaks \nhavoc in the rural communities that depend upon them. Farmers in \neconomic distress are not able to make their usual purchases of seed \nand fertilizer, not to mention food and clothing.\n  This makes the agricultural sector--which is directly and indirectly \nresponsible for nearly one-fifth of U.S. gross domestic product--among \nthe most vulnerable sectors of the U.S. economy.\n  To ensure that the stimulus plan also provides benefits to \nagriculture-dependent economies in the South Midwest, and northern-tier \nStates, my amendment extends the disaster relief programs that have \nbeen critical to shoring up farm income over the last 3 years.\n  This will allow farmers--and the rural economies that depend upon \nthem--to share the economic support provided to the rest of the economy \nin the stimulus plan and make real progress in recovering from the \nmultiyear downturn they are now struggling through.\n  Simply put, many rural economies did not fully participate in the \ngrowth in the 1990s. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic \nAnalysis, growth in many rural States, including Montana, Iowa, \nOklahoma, North Dakota, Wyoming, Louisiana, and Mississippi has lagged \nbehind--in some cases, far behind--the national average.\n  In the same vein, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, over \nthe last decade, job growth in rural areas has lagged far behind that \nin urban areas.\n  Further, rural areas appear to have entered the current recession in \nlate 2000, almost a year and a half ago. Rural America seems to be the \nfirst to suffer a recession and the last to recover. For this reason \nand so many more, this stimulus bill should include agricultural \ndisaster assistance.\n\n[[Page S76]]\n\n  I note that this amendment does not include a commodity purchase \nsection that was the subject of much criticism from the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  Some may recall that this provision was attacked for extending \nbenefits to buffalo ranchers and asparagus farmers--among others. I \nbelieve those attacks were unfair and misdirected. I still support \nprovisions for specialty crop producers. However, in order to minimize \ncontroversy and move this amendment forward, I have dropped this \nprovision from my amendment.\n\n  Finally, I have letters of support for this amendment from the \nfollowing organizations: The National Association of Feed Growers, \nMontana Stockbrokers, National Farmers Union, signed by 26 State \npresidents, the National Cotton Council, the National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation, and others. I also have a joint letter from the Montana \nGrain Growers Association and the Montana Farm Bureau Federation \ndescribing the desperate need for this agricultural disaster \nassistance.\n  All I hear when I am home is the need for this legislation. We are in \ndire straits. We have not participated in the national growth of the \n1990s. We are hurting. It is not just my State but in many other parts \nof rural America. We need this.\n  I urge all colleagues to support this amendment and ensure this \neconomic stimulus program truly helps all Americans. That includes \nfarmers, ranchers, and those living in rural communities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I missed part of his statement. This is \nan amendment to the Daschle amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. It costs how much?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. About $2.3 billion.\n  Mr. NICKLES. To be expended this year; and it is for what?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Disaster assistance.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We are not doing the farm bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Right.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator does not want to wait another week or two?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the farmers cannot wait. We don't know the \nprospect of the farm bill either. Income is going down the tubes; \nfarmers are going down the tubes. That is why we are acting now.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I missed part of my colleague's comment. \nI heard he would have an amendment to add an agriculture section to the \nso-called stimulus bill. I don't think that underlying bill qualifies \nas a stimulus bill. I don't see anything in the underlying bill that \ncreates jobs. Now we are talking about an additional 2-point-some \nbillion dollars to be added to agriculture payments. I don't think the \namendment should be on this bill.\n  I want to read the amendment. I know many sections of our country in \nrural areas are hurting in agriculture. We will be debating the \nagriculture bill, the farm bill, probably in the next couple of weeks, \nand I think that would be a more appropriate vehicle. I will read my \ncolleague's amendment. I have great respect for him. My initial \nreaction is it does not belong on this bill. I hope it will not be \nadded to this bill. We will no doubt vote in the not-too-distant \nfuture.\n  I know there are colleagues on this side, and I assume we will \nalternate amendments. Senator Smith has an amendment on accelerated \ndepreciation. It is my hope to bring that amendment up as well.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2701 to amendment No. 2698.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Daschle-Baucus \namendment which is being considered now. What we have is an \nopportunity--and I hope a bipartisan opportunity--to do something about \nthe economy.\n  Senator Daschle has taken those elements of the Republican economic \nstimulus plan and the Democratic economic stimulus plan that we agree \non and brought those to the floor, saying, use this as a starting \npoint, as a bipartisan effort.\n  There are other ideas. Some on the Democratic side have concepts, and \nI am sure those on the Republican side do as well. What Senator Daschle \nis trying to do is to break the logjam, cut through the rhetoric, and \ndo something.\n  I am discouraged that when Senator Daschle tried to do that this \nmorning in the Senate Chamber, some Members\n\n[[Page S77]]\n\non the other side of the aisle objected. I hope this is not an \nindication that we are in another logjam, at an impasse and unable to \nbreak through.\n  Clearly, we have a good-faith effort to find a bipartisan economic \nstimulus package. This package contains elements with which I think \nDemocrats and Republicans should agree. I don't believe there is any \ndebate over the fact of 5.8-percent unemployment in this country and 8 \nmillion people out of work, and there are a lot of people facing hard \ntimes. This recession has made it difficult for them and their \nfamilies. I read about it at home in the newspapers and hear it from \npeople I talk to who call the office. A lot of families face a \ndifficult circumstance and are trying to get by.\n  What we are trying to do with the economic stimulus bill is extend \nunemployment benefits for those who have been unemployed so they can \nkeep their families together.\n  If the problem in America today is the fact we have overcapacity of \ngoods and services and not enough demand and we want to help the \neconomy move forward so more people make purchases, we want to give the \nresources to those who will spend them. The first to spend these \nresources are those out of work. Every dollar given to that unemployed \nworker for his or her family will be turned into a purchase, an \nimportant purchase for that family for clothing, food, to pay the \nutility bill in the cold winter months, shelter, maybe even medical \ncosts. I hope there is no argument about that. I hope we can concede \nthis is something to which both sides should agree.\n  There is another element in this bill of equally importance relating \nto the Medicaid system. Medicaid, of course, is health insurance for \nthe disadvantaged people in America and those on disability. What we \nhave found in my State of Illinois and across the Nation is that a lot \nof hospitals are facing closure today. States are seeing shrinking \nrevenue and cannot match the Federal dollars that might come in from \nMedicaid and are cutting back for Medicaid reimbursement. That means \nsmall hospitals, rural hospitals, inner-city hospitals, hospitals with \na disproportionate share of elderly patients, and patients with \ndisabilities are the ones that are facing closure. The Daschle-Baucus \nbill addresses that.\n  I ask the Senator from Montana if he would like to comment. When he \nspeaks of rural areas, the hospital Medicaid reimbursement in his State \nprobably is similar to my own; inadequate to meet the current need. \nThis amendment, the Daschle-Baucus amendment before the Senate now, \nprovides, if I am not mistaken, additional Medicaid assistance to these \nhospitals in this difficult time. I would not be surprised if in \nMontana, as in Illinois, you had rural hospitals that were on the edge \nof closure. With this dramatic change in lifestyle, the quality of life \nin smalltown Montana or smalltown Illinois is going to change \ndramatically if the travel time to a hospital goes from 25 minutes to \nan hour and a half for the elderly person struggling to press on and \nlive or for the woman delivering a baby. This makes all the difference \nin the world.\n  I ask my colleague from Montana if he would comment on the Medicaid \naspect of this economic stimulus bill before the Senate.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my good friend from Illinois. The Senator is \nabsolutely correct. Unfortunately, we are in a recession, and the data \nwe have is based upon times when the economy was in better shape, a \ncouple of years ago. As a consequence, the formula for distributing \nMedicaid payments from Uncle Sam to the States is based upon old data, \nand now the hospitals are hurting, more people have less income, they \ncross the Medicaid poverty index, they get lower payments--just the \nopposite of what they should receive. As a consequence, what the leader \nsuggested is essentially about a $5 billion reimbursement to the States \nthat have lost revenue as a consequence of the downturn. Revenue, in \nsome respects, they will get. But with the tax provision passed and the \nlagging economic data, these States are losing significant revenues in \nthe provisional help.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the chairman. I can't believe the circumstance is \nany different in Oklahoma. I have to believe the hospitals in rural \nOklahoma and Illinois are facing the same problems. That is why this \namendment offered by Senators Daschle and Baucus as an effort to try to \nhelp those hospitals really shouldn't have much debate. I, frankly, \nthink if we don't face this head on, we are going to face head on a \nserious medical crisis in this country. We are going to see a lot of \nhospital closures. We are going to see a lot of health care providers \nthat can't continue to make provisions for those who are in nursing \nhomes and hospitals. If we don't do something with this bill's \nrecommendations, if we get up in the politics of the moment, if we find \nourselves time and time objecting to bringing this economic stimulus to \nthe floor, it is going to be at the expense of the basic health care of \nsmall towns in America--in the Midwest, Far West, and all over the \nUnited States.\n  When you take a look at these two basic provisions for giving a \nhelping hand to unemployed workers who are trying to keep their \nfamilies together, and giving a helping hand to health care providers \nthat are particularly hard pressed because of this economy, this \nsection seems to be an excellent starting point in our debate about \nmoving this economy forward.\n  There may be other amendments offered on the other side. Senator \nDaschle says we are open to that suggestion. Let us have amendments \noffered on both sides and bring this bill to conference.\n  The President told us to get moving. Senator Daschle offered this \namendment just for that purpose. The question is now whether the \nRepublicans in the Senate will join us in a bipartisan effort to do \nsomething. I can tell you right off the bat there will be Republican \namendments that they might offer which I can't support.\n  I just left a hearing on Enron, which is the topic de jour on Capitol \nHill. We went through what happened in that corporation. It had a \nsituation basically where the Enron ship started to sink. The corporate \nofficials and officers grabbed the lifeboats and left the pensioners \nand investors and employees to drown. That is exactly what happened. As \na result of that, there is little sympathy on Capitol Hill for Enron. \nYet one of the Republican economic stimulus plans was to give--get \nthis-- $260 million in tax breaks to that bankrupt corporation. I am \nnot going to stand for that. I will vote against that every day of the \nweek. Try to explain to people back home why you want to give a tax \nbreak to a bankrupt corporation where the officers and officials \nbasically fleeced investors across America, including the President's \nmother-in-law.\n  Do we want to give a tax break to that operation or a $1 billion tax \nbreak to IBM? Those are issues we can debate at length and get to a \nvote on. I think there ought to be votes taken with time limits for \ndebate and get to the bottom of it. It depends on the bipartisan will \nof this body. The Senate is constructed so one Senator can stand up and \nobject and that is basically the end of the story. That is what \nhappened this morning.\n  I hope my friends on the Republican side of the aisle will take \nanother look. I hope they will understand there are unemployed families \nin every State. They are not just Democrats. They are Republicans and \nIndependents, too. They have people who want a basic helping hand.\n\n  What we are suggesting to help is no radical idea. President Bush's \nfather did that. When he faced a recession during his Presidency, he \nextended unemployment benefits. This isn't some Socialist scheme we are \ncoming up with, I say to my colleagues on the Republican side. This was \nconsidered a good, sound, economic decision by the President's father's \nadministration.\n  This morning we pick up the newspaper and find the political climate \nand scenery has changed quite a bit in America. For a long time, we \nlabored under the deficits with a lot of red ink. It meant that the \nnational debt kept going up and up. So we had to collect taxes from \nbusinesses and individuals across America just to pay the interest on \nthe national debt. This was not tax money collected for education or \nfor the defense of our Nation or for health care. No. It was money \ncollected to pay interest on the national debt largely held by foreign \ninvestors.\n  We have turned that corner. In the last 6 years of the Clinton \nadministration, we started generating surpluses.\n\n[[Page S78]]\n\n We started funding for retirement in America. We could say to our kids \nthat they were going to see in their lifetime the publicly held \nnational debt come to an end. That would basically have changed in our \nlifetime. The money collected was going to be spent to make America a \nbetter place rather than paying interest on old debt. That was the \ntrend line.\n  The fiscal discipline we are facing today and the Congressional \nBudget Office report says the party is over. The surplus is gone. We \nare back into deficits.\n  For some reasons, it is very easy to explain. I voted to fight this \nwar. I voted to give the President the money he needed for our troops. \nI would do it again tomorrow. Did it add to the deficit? Yes. I do not \nthink there is a person in America--certainly not the parents and \nfamilies of those who are serving our country--who would have us \nshortchange the men and women in uniform. That is absolutely the right \nthing to do. We are going to continue to do it, but it means more and \nmore deficit spending so we can wage this war successfully and bring \nour troops home safely. So be it.\n  Also, the fact is it has taken a toll on our surpluses as well. There \nwere some projections that by now we would have rosy scenarios and all \nsorts of good times ahead of us. It hasn't happened. We are still in a \nrecession. The recession takes money out of the Government coffers and \nadds to the deficit.\n  We also passed a tax bill last year--a tax cut bill. Many of us \ncautioned, saying: Go slow. Don't try to guess what the economy is \ngoing to look like 5 or 10 years from now. I may be wrong. It didn't \neven take a year. In 8 months, those rosy projections about surpluses \nhave evaporated with the recession and with the war. It is over. That \nis why, with the suggestions of greater and greater tax cuts in the \nfuture, a lot of us fought the battle to finally end the deficits and \nmove toward a surplus in our Federal budget. We don't want to return to \nthose bad old days.\n  For goodness' sake, for our children, let us retire this national \ndebt and get back to fiscal discipline and a sound approach. We cannot \ngive all the tax cuts that we all would like to give.\n  This is an election year. Every candidate wants to stand in front of \na crowd and say: I voted to cut your taxes. People just cheer and big, \nbroad smiles cross their faces. Folks are coming to understand that \nthere is a price to pay for it. The $300 or $600 rebate checks they got \nlast year added to the deficit. Money is now being taken out of the \nSocial Security trust fund and Medicare trust fund to pay for it. It is \na price that we will pay.\n\n  My colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, said yesterday that \nthis is an analogy between what happened at Enron and what is happening \nhere in this debate. At Enron, the top officials cashed in their stock \nbefore it became worthless while the little guys who had their \n401(k)s--investors and employees--didn't get a chance to cash in their \nstock and were left holding the bag. Everything disappeared. Financial \nsecurity was gone. The same debate is going on here now.\n  There are those who want to give tax cuts to the wealthiest people in \nAmerica at the expense of the retirement of the workers of America--the \nSocial Security trust fund. That doesn't make sense. Let us not do an \nEnron on America. Let us make sure that we have a sound policy that \nreally is good for this economy, and every part of it--small \nbusinesses, family farmers, and workers alike.\n  That is why the Daschle-Baucus proposal before us is a good one. It \nis one that starts us toward a path of doing something sensible to help \nthe economy but not something that will hurt us in the long term.\n  I urge my colleagues, particularly on the Republican side who \nobjected to this economic stimulus package this morning, to please \nreconsider. Let us bring this to the floor. If you have some good \nideas, let us have a debate and vote--and a limit on the time we put \ninto that debate so we know it is going to end and hopefully end up \nwith a bipartisan bill to send to the conference. And maybe with the \nwork on the House and Senate sides we can have a bill for the President \nby the beginning of next week. That is important. I think Senator \nDaschle has stepped forward with a positive, sensible, and fiscally \nconservative approach on this which is good for America and which is \ngood for our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have just a couple of comments. My \ncolleague and friend from Illinois said something about this bill \nbefore us is promoting tax credits. The House Bill 3529 that this \nSenator tried to bring up and that passed the House just recently \nreformed corporate AMT, and didn't have anything that was going to be \nof benefit to Enron. I want to make sure that is understood.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The economic stimulus package passed by the House, the \nRepublican-sponsored package, the first package contained many billions \nof dollars in tax relief for corporations such as IBM and Enron. Is \nthat not correct?\n  Mr. NICKLES. To correct my colleague, the bill we are trying to bring \nup is H.R. 3529, and it contains reformed corporate AMT. The bill the \nSenator is referring to did pass the House earlier. It is not what this \nSenator is trying to bring up? The House, as I am sure my colleague \nalso knows, passed the subsequent measure. That is the measure that has \nbipartisan support. That is the measure the President supports. That is \nthe measure we are trying to pass. That is the measure that Senator \nDaschle wants to pass and then strike the language on the House-passed \nbill and insert it in.\n  I suggest we take up H.R. 3529 and amend it. Again, we just want to \nmake sure. H.R. 3529 is the bill we are trying to bring up, and Senator \nDaschle is trying to bring up his four-point bill. I have some \nreservations about that bill. My colleague from Illinois, I know, said \na couple things he likes about it. There are a couple things I do not \nlike about it.\n\n  I am suggesting we take up the House-passed bill, what Senator \nDaschle is planning on eventually striking, and amending it with \nwhatever we come up with.\n  I suggest we take up the House-passed bill which does not include any \nprovisions that would benefit Enron, which I think may have been \nimplied earlier.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for one more brief question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it not correct, then, your bill would have abolished \nthe alternative minimum tax, a tax paid by corporations that otherwise \nhave no Federal tax liability prospectively in the future?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct. The House-passed bill, H.R. 3529 \neffectively reformed AMT prospectively. That is correct. It has had no \nbenefit for Enron, no cash benefits for IBM. So I want to make that \nclear.\n  Also, just for the record, I just had a chance to read the amendment \noffered by my friend, Senator Baucus. It has $2.3 billion in emergency \nagricultural assistance, $1.8 billion for the Commodity Credit \nCorporation, and an additional $500 million for the Commodity Credit \nCorporation that is designated as livestock. And $12 million is for the \nAmerican Indian Livestock Program, which I did not even know we had. \nAnyway, there is a $500 million program for that. I think my colleague \nfrom Wyoming wants to speak on it.\n  I want to have printed in the Record the emergency spending for \nagriculture that we have done in the last 10, 11 years.\n  It has exploded, absolutely exploded. For the years 1990 through \n1995, the average was less than $1 billion a year. For the last 2 \nyears, agricultural emergency spending was right at $15 billion and \nover $11 billion. I think it has been done kind of haphazardly, and \nmaybe done right before the end of the year, where agriculture has been \nin a tough situation, and we just threw out a lot of money. I am afraid \nthat is what we would be doing if we added another $2.3 billion.\n  What about reforming the crop insurance program? We did that a couple \nyears ago. I remember being in this Chamber and everybody saying: Wait \na minute, let's fix the crop insurance program so we do not have to \ncome up--every time there is a drought or a flood--with a new Federal \nemergency\n\n[[Page S79]]\n\nprogram and write big checks. We are going to fix the insurance \nprogram. And we spent some money to fix it. And we have subsidized that \nprogram enormously.\n  What are we doing now? This is adding more money to agricultural \nemergency assistance. I know we have farmers hurting in my State, just \nas there are in Montana, and I am sure in many other parts of the \ncountry. We are having a drought that is very significant in my State, \nas I am sure in many of the plains States as well.\n  But I am looking at the total cost of this program. I will read \nthrough these last several years. In 1995, the total agricultural \nemergency assistance was $600 million; the next year it was $140 \nmillion; the next year it was $400 million; the next year, 1998, it was \n$160 million; and then in 1999 it jumps all the way up to $6.62 \nbillion--not $6.62 million--$6.62 billion. Then the next year it \ndoubles again to $14.99 billion; and last year, 2001, to over $11 \nbillion.\n  Yet people are saying: Let's add some more billions on top of that.\n\n  Then we are going to be dealing with an agriculture bill in the next \ncouple weeks, and people are going to say: Let's spend an extra $75 \nbillion on top of that. Some of us will have an amendment saying: Let's \nlook at who is getting what. There is a front-page article in the \nWashington Post today that talks about one farmer getting $38 million \nin the last 5 years. Then it basically says there are thousands of \nfarmers who are making enormous amounts--hundreds of thousands of \ndollars--not $50,000, not $80,000, not $100,000. There are thousands of \nfarmers who are getting hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  I think for the top thousand or more in Arkansas, the average payment \nwas almost $500,000. I have some of those in my State. I think that is \noutlandish. And they can get it from all kinds of ways, including \nemergency assistance, including supplemental farm bills. We used to \nhave limitations. We need limitations.\n  When we get to the farm bill, again, I hope we will put limitations \non the payments. In the Harkin-Daschle bill, if I remember, farmers \nwould be able to receive almost $500,000. And I read in the paper today \npeople are able to get millions through multiple entities. We need to \ntighten that up. I know Senator Grassley has an amendment. Others on \nthe Democratic side hopefully will support it. I have one that will \nlimit payments to $150,000. I am sure some people will say the sky is \ngoing to fall because we limit farmers and entities to $150,000. \nRegardless, I think we should do it.\n  I think we should be debating the farm bill and agricultural \nassistance on the farm bill, not on the stimulus package.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe chart from which I was reading.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Emergency Spending for Agriculture: A Brief History of Congressional \n                          Action, FY 1989-2001\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       From FY1989 through FY2001, twenty-one appropriations, \n     authorization, or farm disaster acts have added $43.8 billion \n     in emergency funding for U.S. Department of Agriculture \n     (USDA) programs. Nearly $32.8 billion, or about 75 percent of \n     the total amount, was for FY1999-FY2001 alone.\n       Since FY1989, the vast majority of the total emergency \n     funding has been paid directly to farmers, primarily through \n     two mechanisms: ``market loss payments'' ($21.4 billion, all \n     since FY1999) to compensate for low farm commodity prices, \n     and disaster payments ($15.8 billion) paid to any producer \n     who experienced a major crop loss caused by a natural \n     disaster. The remaining $6.6 billion has funded a wide array \n     of other USDA programs, including other forms of farm \n     disaster assistance, speciality crop assistance, farm loans, \n     overseas food aid, food and nutrition programs, and rural \n     development assistance.\n       Total annual funding additions in the 21 acts providing \n     emergency assistance to USDA programs since FY1989 are as \n     follows:\n       FY1989: $3.39 billion;\n       FY1990: $1.48 billion;\n       FY1991: $0;\n       FY1992: $1.0 billion;\n       FY1993: $1.3 billion;\n       FY1994: $2.57 billion;\n       FY1995: $0.6 billion;\n       FY1996: $0.14 billion;\n       FY1997: $0.4 billion;\n       FY1998: $0.16 billion;\n       FY1999: $6.62 billion;\n       FY2000: $14.99 billion;\n       FY2001: $11.17 billion.\n       Grand Total (FY1989-2001): $43.82 billion.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Wyoming, who has \nan interest in this area, is waiting to speak, as well as others.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Montana, \nSenator Baucus, offering this amendment. I particularly appreciate it \nbecause it gives me an opportunity to recognize that this amendment \nwill allocate $500 million in emergency spending for the Livestock \nAssistance Program.\n  There was a lot of mention in this Chamber about things we have done \nin an emergency way for agriculture. The program that we have left out \nhas been livestock assistance. The ranching folks of this country have \nbeen the ones who for years have said they really don't want the \nFederal Government helping them out. With the exception of the drought \nprograms, that has been true.\n  One of the difficulties is that they are not in line all the time for \nthis money. Consequently, when they need it, we do not always insert \nit. The Livestock Assistance Program is an ad hoc program that is \nadministered by the United States Department of Agriculture--USDA--\nthrough the Farm Service Agency.\n  It is available to livestock producers in counties that have been \ndeclared disaster areas by the President or the Secretary of \nAgriculture. It provides financial relief to livestock producers who \nare experiencing livestock production loss due to drought and other \ndisasters.\n  Livestock producers in my State of Wyoming have been hard hit by \ndrought. And the drought outlook for this year isn't optimistic. In \nfact, right now we are having the driest winter that any of them can \nremember.\n  I was in a store and ran into an old friend of mine and asked him how \nthings were going; and you could see the drought was at the top of his \nmind because that is what he brought up immediately. He did not say \nwhether he was feeling well or his family was well. The drought was \ncausing the problem. And it was a different problem. Usually at this \ntime of year there is enough moisture in the ground and enough cold air \nin Wyoming that the ground freezes. It is pretty solid.\n  When the ranchers go out to feed--and you have to feed when the \nground is frozen solid--they usually can go to the spot where the \ncattle are and lay down the feed. This year, they have to go to a \ndifferent place every day and move the herd because of the destruction \nthey do to the land in raising the dust and covering the feed that has \nbeen put down because of how dry the ground is. It would not even \nfreeze hard. So the outlook for next year is worse than last year. And \nthe year before that was a bad year.\n  There are some problems with the Livestock Assistance Program in \ngetting any kind of continuing help. It actually anticipates you are \nonly going to have a problem 1 year. We are about to go into our third \nyear, and, of course, nobody got any payments for the second year \nbecause that never got put in anywhere last year, even though we were \npromised that somewhere this program, that has existed and needs to \nexist, would exist. It has not existed.\n  You may not know that in the primary case of drought, producers \nusually suffer the loss of grazing sources. The Livestock Assistance \nProgram commonly provides the means to buy supplemental feed for their \nlivestock.\n  Although Congress has made a full commitment to this program when it \nauthorized it several years ago, the program was not funded in fiscal \nyear 2002 in either the emergency agricultural supplemental or the \nagricultural appropriations fiscal year 2002 bill.\n  I believe this program funding is critical to the continuing \nviability of ranches in Wyoming and the West. This amendment would \nprovide short-term immediate economic stimulus to Wyoming's \nagricultural population. The program is appropriate for the economic \nstimulus package because it directly stimulates the agricultural \nsector. This money will be spent immediately in rural areas, and it \nwill be spent to pay debt and to purchase winter feed for livestock--\nprimarily the latter.\n\n[[Page S80]]\n\n  The U.S. Drought Monitor, presented by the United States Department \nof Agriculture, the National Drought Mitigation Center, and the Climate \nPrediction Center show that the entire Northwestern U.S. is \nexperiencing extreme and severe drought. This is the second year of \ncontinuous drought for Wyoming's producers. In these conditions, the \nState's natural resources have been unable to recover. In order to \nconserve those resources, State and Federal Government have evicted \nranchers from State and Federal leased land. Producers have been forced \nto find alternative grazing arrangements where pasture land is limited \nor sell off their herds.\n  Many producers grazed hay fields last summer and fall that had been \nslotted to provide winter feed. Virtually every indicator--\nprecipitation, snow pack, reservoir levels--shows that the drought may \nget worse.\n  In fiscal year 2001, that is the year before last, the Livestock \nAssistance Program was funded at approximately $430 million. In \nWyoming, 933 producers received $7,752,029. That is an average of \n$8,000 per producer. You can see where that would just buy feed to get \nthem by through the drought.\n  Nationally, it provided assistance to about 186,000 producers at 88 \npercent of their grazing loss--that depends on how many people put in \nfor this limited number of dollars--but at 88 percent of their grazing \nloss for the drought. And this year, again, the need is similar. We are \nlooking at perhaps another year of it yet. Providing the program with \n$500 million for drought experienced in 2001 would ensure that \nproducers receive assistance for 100 percent of the anticipated grazing \nlosses due to the drought.\n  Wyoming producers would receive approximately $9 million. Again that \nis about $9,000 per producer. The USDA has indicated that this level of \nfunding would be sufficient for this year. Half of Wyoming's counties \nhave been declared drought disaster areas for the second continuous \nyear. The Secretary of Agriculture has already officially declared many \ncounties as disaster areas in the livestock producing States of \nMontana, Idaho, Washington, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, \nMissouri, Iowa, Texas, Kentucky, and, of course, Wyoming.\n  I ask my colleagues to take a long, hard look at the merits of this \namendment. This amendment would provide the livestock producers with \nwhat everybody has been saying would be provided; that is, the \nopportunity to continue their operations and to stay in business for 1 \nmore year.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bill and to pray for rain and \nsnow in the West.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to make some points in response to \nthe Senator from Oklahoma. He makes some good points, but I think they \nshould be addressed.\n  One is, what about livestock; what about crop insurance. Why don't we \nhave a crop insurance program that works, that takes care of disasters, \nfarmers who suffer disasters? Why do we have to come along every once \nin a while with a disaster assistance bill?\n  If I might suspend, I see my friend from Nevada in the Chamber. He \nmay have a request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, I express my appreciation for his courtesy.\n  We have now been here all day working on this bill. The first \namendment offered is the amendment offered by the Senator from Montana, \nchairman of the committee, which has wide support. It is a bipartisan \nmeasure. Its sponsorship is bipartisan.\n  I ask if we could have a vote on this matter at 3:30. That would be \n45 minutes to continue the debate. The vote would be on or in relation \nto this amendment. I ask unanimous consent that that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nmanager of this bill on our side is off the floor for a moment. Until \nhe arrives and is consulted, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Kentucky \nhaving to object. I would hope that the floor staff would alert Senator \nGrassley to my request. If that time is not sufficient and there are \nother people who want to speak on it, we have absolutely no problem \nwith that. I do think we should have a vote as quickly as possible.\n  I will renew that request at a subsequent time after the message is \nrelated to Senator Grassley and also to the minority leader.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be listed as a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, just some basic points to clear the air \nand to get the facts straight.\n  It has been suggested that we have crop insurance and why isn't crop \ninsurance sufficient to compensate farmers and ranchers through \ndisaster. The argument is made that we have a crop insurance program. \nWhy do we need disaster assistance? The answer is quite simple.\n  First of all, the crop insurance program does not cover livestock. So \nthat point is irrelevant. Second, with respect to crops, program crops, \nthere are a couple of points. No. 1, very few farmers buy Federal crop \ninsurance. Why? Because it is so expensive and the coverage is so poor. \nEven with reform of the crop insurance program, it is not good enough \nfor farmers and ranchers to participate in it. It just is not available \nas a practical matter.\n  In addition to that, it is unavailable today for crop losses in 2001. \nIf you had a loss on your crop in 2001, you cannot go now to buy \nFederal crop insurance in 2002 which will cover losses in 2001. It is \ntoo late. Even if you were to buy Federal crop insurance in 2002, you \nwould not want to, a lot of farmers do not want to because, as I said, \nit is so expensive and the coverage is so poor.\n  The last disaster bill passed here covered losses basically because \nprices were so low. The disaster assistance bill before the Senate now \ncovers natural disaster losses--drought, floods--and also quality crop \nlosses; that is, insect, disease, or for whatever reason the quality of \nthe crop is so poor that the farmer takes a large cut.\n  This is not a new program. This amendment only provides dollars for \nexisting disaster relief programs. For crops, it is a 35-percent loss, \nand for livestock, under the livestock emergency feed program, it is a \n40-percent loss in grazing over 3 months; for quality loss, as I \nrecall, it is about a 25-percent loss. It is existing programs.\n  In many States across our country, we find counties that have already \nbeen declared disaster counties for purposes of this amendment.\n  For example, I will read some of the States. In Iowa: $17 million \nwould be available for crop disaster, $3.1 million for livestock. In \nOklahoma--my good friend from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, would be \ninterested in this--it is about $50 million in disaster assistance to \nfarmers in Oklahoma for crops, and about $40 million for livestock \ndisaster assistance; Texas, $436 million for crops, $92 million for \nlivestock. The list goes on: Wyoming--Senator Enzi, of course, is \ncosponsoring this amendment--Tennessee, a significant amount; \nMississippi, a cotton State, $70 million for cotton producers as a \nconsequence of disaster to the cotton industry in that State; Montana, \nof course, and I might also add that there are many others. At the \nappropriate point, I will indicate all of the States that qualify.\n\n  I might also address a point made by the Senator from Oklahoma that \nall these big farm bill payments--he read in the paper a lot of farmers \nget very high payments under the farm program. That is comparing apples \nwith oranges or watermelons with peanuts or whatever products you want \nto take. We are not talking about the farm bill, Mr. President. This \ndebate is about emergency agricultural disaster assistance, which is \nentirely separate from the farm bill.\n  It is true that some farmers, under the current farm program, get \nhigh payments. It is also true that there are very significant \nlimitations on which farmers or ranchers can get disaster assistance--\nvery significant limitations. A farmer or rancher cannot get disaster \npayments over $80,000. We hear\n\n[[Page S81]]\n\nabout farmers who get large payments under the farm program. Much of \nthat is justified because they are large farms. But that is irrelevant \nto this point. This point is, what do farmers receive and what should \nthey receive under disaster assistance?\n  There is an $80,000 limitation. A farmer or rancher cannot receive \nmore than that in disaster payments. But $80,000 is not a lot of money. \nThat is gross payment. Think of all of the costs that farmer or that \nrancher has to incur. That is not $80,000 in his pocket, that is \n$80,000 to cover expenses and losses. Mr. President, I guarantee you it \nwould not even come close to making a farmer whole.\n  There is another limitation, where no payments can go to any farmer \nor rancher whose gross income is $2.5 million. That may sound like a \nlot of money, but not if it is gross. Anybody who knows anything about \nfarming or ranching knows that what farmers and ranchers receive as \ntheir net profit, in most cases, is zero. In many cases, it is less \nthan zero, or maybe a little bit more than zero. The net return on \nfarmland in America is a pittance. But farmers and ranchers endure that \nlow rate of return because it is a way of life.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I can remember many years ago in the farm industry when the \ncost of pieces of equipment was almost nothing. Now one of those trucks \ncan cost a million dollars. Would the Senator indicate how much farm \nequipment costs, generally speaking? We see the little John Deere \ntractor you used to be able to buy at Sears Roebuck. Now these pieces \nof equipment cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per farm; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct. The Senator makes an excellent point. \nFarm machinery costs have skyrocketed. It is obscene how much tractors \ncost. A combine is over $100,000. I know; I was raised on a ranch. I am \nastounded at how much farm equipment costs today. It is just \nridiculous. On top of that, it cannot be used, in most cases, year \nround. It is not like a factory where you get to use the equipment all \nthe time and have 60, 70, 80, 90 percent capacity. Most farm equipment \nis only used for a short time. You can only harvest cotton a certain \ntime of the year or bail hay or combine grain. It is a very short \nseason. It is not year round. So it is a very expensive piece of \nequipment that does not get a great rate of return because it cannot be \nfully utilized, to say nothing of all the other increased costs that \nare greater for farmers or ranchers; namely, fuel, fertilizer, and \nother things; all of that has gone through the roof, including freight \nrates.\n\n  I am from a State which is a captive shipper State. There is \nvirtually no rail competition in my State. Shippers in my State ask \ngrain farmers to pay twice as much to ship a bushel of wheat than do \nfarmers in other parts of the country who ship that wheat the same \ndistance. Why? Because there is competition in the other States. There \nis none, for all intents and purposes, in Montana. There are other \ncases around of captive shippers. It is not of sufficient competition \nto get trucker or rail rates low enough.\n  However you slice it, this is a sector of the economy that is in deep \ntrouble. For a specific, unique reason--weather-related, cost-related--\nif we are going to pass an economic stimulus bill, as we should, \nbecause our country still needs a stimulus that is fair, direct, short \nterm, a shot in the arm, agriculture should be included.\n  Agriculture, directly and indirectly, is one-fifth of America's gross \ndomestic product. I will bet a lot of people living in cities do not \nknow or appreciate that. But agricultural production, directly and \nindirectly--that is, suppliers and expenditures farmers make on not \nonly equipment but farm products and also farm services, and they also \nbuy clothes and pay the bills and so forth--it amounts to one-fifth of \nAmerica's gross domestic product. If we are going to pass a stimulus \nbill, certainly a good portion of it, a significant portion, or a small \nportion should include agricultural disaster assistance.\n  I will yield the floor. I see my very good friend, my colleague from \nour State, on the floor. I am honored that he is here to speak on the \namendment. I know a lot of farmers and ranchers in the country are \npleased to see Senator Burns supporting this effort.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my colleague from Montana. I thank him for \npresenting a bare-bones amendment covering the emergency agricultural \nsituation we have in our State. He is exactly right. There are a lot of \nfolks who do not realize how big agriculture is in our overall economy.\n  You know, it is not surprising because each and every one of us in \nthis country goes about our way feeding and clothing ourselves. \nEveryone plays a part. It may not be in the area of production, but it \ncould be in the area of transportation, or processing, advertising, \npresenting, or the marketing of food products. I don't think there is a \ncountry like ours in the world that has the advantage of eating fresh \nfruits and vegetables all through the year, even though you may live in \nthe northeastern part of the country where it is snowing and blowing. \nSo it is a marvelous system, a system that is held high as an example \naround the world.\n  When this subject was first offered last fall, it was pretty well \nloaded up. I think we tried to boil the fat out of it and offer some \nassistance to some people who have been impacted. We are going into our \nfourth year of drought. There are many in this Chamber and many people \nacross the country who have seen that wonderful river called the \nYellowstone River, which flows through the park to Williston, ND. Below \nan area called Yankee Jim Canyon to the mouth of the Big Horn River, \nyou can wade across the Yellowstone River and never get your knees wet, \nwhich gives you some indication of the impact this drought has had on \nmy State--now going into its fourth year.\n  It is hard to imagine you would have less than a bushel an acre in \ncombining and fewer prospects of any kind of income. For the marginal \nproducers, those days are gone. There is a ritual that goes on in our \nState.\n  Every year about this time is when you and your wife gather up your \nbooks and make the annual trek to see your banker and arrange for \noperating loans for another year. Those banks that do a lot of business \nwith owners of farms and ranches are telling me that even some \nprofessionals are marginal because of no crops, none at all.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be made a cosponsor of this amendment. \nI thank my friend from Montana for offering it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am still a little concerned about on what \nbill this amendment is being offered. I want this to pass, and I would \nhate to see it passed in the Senate and we get a good warm and fuzzy \nfeeling inside and then we lose it in conference or we lose the \nstimulus altogether. I do not know what is ahead. I do not see that in \nmy crystal ball. I see a very hazy picture. This amendment needs to be \nadopted because this is not only happening in the State of Montana, it \nis happening in other States as well.\n  Keep in mind that the American people have agreed they still want \nthis insurance policy of our ability to feed and clothe this Nation and \nnot become dependent on other sources for our subsistence.\n  I heartily urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the \nChair, and I thank my friend from Montana. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my friend yield for a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. GREGG. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been told that Senator Grassley has \nnot been contacted. I will wait until he has been contacted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the stimulus bill and \naddress one of the issues I hope we will be able to address as we move \nforward on this bill. I recognize the parties are trying to reach an \nagreement on a package which is acceptable to both sides and which is \nbipartisan.\n  In that effort, the majority leader has put forward a bill. \nUnfortunately, a large section of this bill, 25 to 30 percent, is new \nlanguage which has not\n\n[[Page S82]]\n\nbeen agreed to by both sides, and there are serious reservations on our \nside about it.\n  There are initiatives within the bill which are agreed to, however, \nsuch as extending the unemployment compensation. In addition, there are \nother ideas that were agreed to, we believe, that could be added to \nthis bill. That has been highlighted by many of the speakers.\n  I note one idea that I think we should consider because it is \nbipartisan--and there does seem to be some general agreement for it, \nand it is a win-win issue for us from the standpoint of public policy--\nand that is the need to reduce the capital gains rate.\n  We are talking about economic stimulus. We are talking about creating \njobs. We are talking about increasing productivity so our economy \nstarts to move a little more aggressively. Probably nothing can be more \nof a positive factor for that than to make capital more readily \navailable for people to invest and, as a result of investing, create \njobs. The result of an expansion of capital activity is the creation of \njobs.\n  One of the most effective ways to create more capital in the \nmarketplace and make more resources available is to make the cost of \ncapital less, and that is what a cut in the capital gains tax \naccomplishes.\n\n  A cut in the capital gains tax was proposed when we addressed the tax \nbill last year. At that time when I made that proposal, it failed on a \nvery close vote, 47 to 51, with two people not voting. Interestingly \nenough, it was a bipartisan vote in favor of cutting the capital gains \nrate.\n  Why was that? Because the amendment I proposed at that time had a \nsunset to it. It was a 2-year proposal which reduced the rate from 20 \npercent to 15 percent, but only for 2 years so it would not have a \nnegative long-term impact on the budget. In fact, by sunsetting it \nafter the 2-year period, we will actually have a positive cashflow \nsituation.\n  Why is that? If we generate the capital gains activity from assets \nwhich are locked up, which are not being used--for example, if somebody \nhas owned stock for 10 years, 5 years, or even 2 years but they are not \ngoing to sell that stock because they think the capital gains tax on it \nwill be too high, if we can do something which causes that person to \nsell that stock, then we create a taxable event.\n  We have proved throughout history in our country that every time we \ncut the capital gains rate, it generates a lot of economic activity. A \nlot of people sell assets, which are capital assets, in order to take \nadvantage of that lower rate, assets which they would not have \notherwise sold.\n  What happens as a result is that we create more taxable events. And \nwhat happens as a result of that is the Treasury gets more money. So in \nany reasonable scoring of the capital gains issue, a capital gains tax \ncut actually generates more money to the Federal Government in the way \nof revenues than if we do not do anything in the early years. In the \noutyears, we lose money.\n  If we sunset a capital gains tax cut after 2 years, the practical \neffect is that we get the good side. We get the new revenues, added \nrevenue activity without the outyear activity of reduced revenues. As a \npractical matter, a capital gains tax cut which has a 2-year sunset \nattached to it, as did my amendment when I offered it last year, is \nbasically a window of opportunity for people to free up assets which \nare presently locked down, take the money from those assets, pay taxes, \nand, as a result, add more money to the Treasury and then take that \nmoney and reinvest it in something which will arguably be a more \nefficient use of those dollars.\n  By doing that, it creates more capital in the marketplace which in \nturn creates more economic activity which in turn creates more jobs.\n  The practical effect of a capital gains tax cut which has a sunset \nattached to it is that it is a win-win event for us from the standpoint \nof public policy in that, one, it generates more revenues during a time \nwhen we are heading toward a deficit and those revenues will assist us \nin alleviating that deficit and, two, it generates more economic \nactivity, more efficient use of capital and, as a result, it generates \nmore jobs.\n  As we move down the road of debating this issue of economic stimulus \nand we are looking for bipartisan concepts which makes sense, I suggest \nwe take a hard look at the capital gains tax cut which I proposed \nduring the prior process.\n  During that process, as I said, the amendment was offered. It failed \non a narrow vote. I think some people voted against it because they \nwere committed to this package or that package, not because they did \nnot think capital gains reduction, especially when it was sunsetted, \nwas a bad idea. I note that the people who voted for it--it was a \nsignificant bipartisan vote in the context of tax matters.\n\n  As a practical matter, as we move down this path to a stimulus \npackage, I hope we revisit this issue of cutting the capital gains tax \nrate for 2 years from 20 to 15 percent and, as a result, generate more \nrevenues for the Treasury, create more economic activity, create more \nefficient use of capital, and in the end the biggest plus will be that \nwe will be creating more jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nSenator Baucus's amendment to provide disaster assistance to farmers. I \nbegin by thanking my very distinguished colleague from Montana who has \nconsistently championed the need to help farmers throughout the country \nwho have crop losses due to natural disasters. I thank the Senator for \nhis leadership and strongly support this amendment that will provide \ndisaster assistance to farmers who need it and will be further \ndevastated without it.\n  American agriculture has been in a recession for the last several \nyears; or even for some farmers, a depression. Last August, the \nMinnesota Farm Service Agency calculated that Minnesota farmers had \nsuffered $500 million in crop losses in the first half of 2001. Then in \nNovember of last year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the \nlargest monthly drop in commodity prices in USDA's 91 years of \nrecording that statistic. In a single month, overall commodity prices \nplummeted nearly 10 percent nationwide. With prices that low, farmers \nhave no ability to withstand additional losses that a disaster creates. \nAt that time last November, the Senate Agriculture Committee was \ncompleting its markup of legislation that would provide desperately-\nneeded assistance to farmers and producers. Amazingly, we spent most of \nDecember sitting through a filibuster of the farm bill. That filibuster \nwas harmful to all farmers--it was catastrophic to those who need \ndisaster aid and whose farms may not survive without it. Senator \nBaucus' amendment will provide this vital assistance before is too \nlate. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have a letter addressed to me, signed by \nJames Echols, who is chairman of the National Cotton Council. I will \nnot read the entire letter, but I will read the operable paragraph. \nEssentially, the letter urges the passage of the pending amendment and \nit includes this statement:\n\n       Cotton producers have suffered late season losses from \n     flood damage in the Mid-south and dry growing conditions \n     followed by excessive moisture during harvest in West Texas. \n     In most cases crop insurance coverage was inadequate or \n     nonapplicable as damage occurred to seed cotton stored in \n     modules stored in the fields while waiting to be ginned. \n     Further we understand crop insurance policies have a \n     provision which deny coverage for losses due to unnamed \n     storms such as the one that occurred in the Mid-south last \n     fall. Producers of other commodities have suffered similar \n     losses and also need assistance.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter from the National Cotton \nCouncil be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S83]]\n\n\n                                           National Cotton Council\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2002.\n     Hon. Senator Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, Senate Hart Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The National Cotton Council appreciates \n     your continued support for inclusion of funding in the \n     economic stimulus package to provide assistance for weather \n     related crop losses. Weather related losses in many parts of \n     the Cotton Belt have made a dire economic situation much \n     worse.\n       Cotton producers have suffered late season losses from \n     flood damage in the Mid-south and dry growing conditions \n     followed by excessive moisture during harvest in West Texas. \n     In most cases crop insurance coverage was inadequate or non-\n     applicable as damage occurred to seed cotton stored in \n     modules stored in the fields while waiting to be ginned. \n     Further we understand crop insurance policies have a \n     provision which deny coverage for losses due to unnamed \n     storms such as the one that occurred in the Mid-south last \n     fall. Producers of other commodities have suffered similar \n     losses and also need assistance.\n       We realize the daunting task facing Congress in building a \n     consensus for an economic stimulus package. However, we urge \n     the Senate to include assistance for weather related crop \n     losses.\n       Thank you for your favorable consideration of our request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James E. Echols,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLandrieu of Louisiana be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, seeing no speakers at this point, I hope \nmy co-manager, my good friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, will come \nfairly quickly so we can get an agreement on further time remaining for \ndebate on this amendment. When that occurs, then we will get closer to \na vote.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask to be added as a cosponsor of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus. I know he has offered this \namendment previously on a different vehicle. This amendment is \ncritically important to farm States, to farmers, and Main Street \nbusinesses that are trying to do business in a pretty tough economy. \nThis is an awfully good amendment, as has been stated by a number of \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. I hope we get a strong \nbipartisan vote for it. I commend Senator Baucus for this amendment. It \nis a great idea. It is important. I ask unanimous consent to have my \nname added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while we are waiting to hear from the \nminority as to whether or not we can agree on a certain time for a vote \non this very important amendment, I would like to indicate how I \npersonally feel.\n  We need an economic stimulus program. We need it now. With America in \nthe midst of a recession, there is no time for delay. Our Nation cannot \nafford to have Congress play games for political purposes. We do not \nneed to, and should not, wait until the President addresses the Nation \nin the State of the Union Address on Tuesday. We should take action \nbefore then. Now is a time to move forward and, in so doing, help our \nNation's economy move forward.\n  My concern, of course, is that we have a situation where, as reported \nyesterday in the press, there are some who do not want to move forward. \nI have the greatest respect for the minority leader. I have worked with \nhim now for many years. When asked yesterday, would debate likely last \nthrough next Tuesday, meaning the State of the Union Address, Senator \nLott said: It might--pause--and then winked to the press. Meaning, of \ncourse, with the wink and the nod, that the answer to the question \nwas--yes, this would be stalled until the State of the Union.\n\n  There are a lot of important things we can do to help the country, \nnot the least of which is this amendment of which I am a cosponsor, \noffered by the chairman of the Finance Committee and also the Senator \nfrom Wyoming. We need to move forward on this legislation.\n  We have an economic stimulus plan that helps accomplish that. It is \nnot perfect, but it is one whose component parts will get more than 60 \nvotes. It is part of a bipartisan agreement. It is a good plan made up \nof solutions Democrats and Republicans alike would support. This plan \nwould have immediate impact and help those most in need.\n  What do we propose? First, extending unemployment benefits for an \nadditional 13 weeks for all workers who have exhausted their \nunemployment insurance benefits after September 11. Talk about \nstimulus. Try giving money to people who have nothing. They will spend \nit. That will help the economy. They will be buying groceries, they \nwill be buying small appliances--tires for their car maybe. Assisting \nworking families in this way is not only the compassionate thing to do \nbut also an effective way to jump-start the economy.\n  Second, providing a tax rebate to everyone who did not get one last \nyear. The part of the President's tax cut that was the most popular and \nthe most successful was the tax rebate. That was our idea. We talked \nabout the tax rebate. We talked about the tax rebate idea, and the \nPresident took that. Fine, all ideas from wherever they come, if they \nare good, should be used. The tax rebate idea was our idea. We believe \nthose people who did not get one should get one this year. We have \nalready taken steps to help some of our ailing businesses, such as \nairlines, which in the process helps other industries and corporations.\n  What about consumers? This tax rebate will increase consumer \nspending. As consumers are more active and are able to purchase more, \nbusinesses will respond by increasing investment and production.\n  Third, increasing the bonus depreciation deduction available to \nbusinesses for certain capital costs. This will encourage businesses to \ninvest more now, and that will spur economic growth. Talk about a shot \nin the arm. If this depreciation allowance is not good for this year, \nwhen are they going to do it? They are going to do it this year.\n  Fourth, providing fiscal relief for States by temporarily increasing \nthe Federal Medicaid matching rates. Most States, as a result of the \nfinancial strain on the budget, have imposed significant cuts on \nMedicare eligibility, or if they have not, they are in the process of \ndoing that. Why? Because they are running out of money. So we must \nprotect Medicaid programs from budget cuts to improve health care for \nNevadans, and all Americans, and ease the burden on States.\n  Our plan, then, attends to critical needs and offers immediate help.\n  Some amendments or alternatives supported by both parties have merit, \nbut not the votes needed to pass. But we have a process here. The \nmajority leader came today and said: You have four, we have four. We \nwill even agree to time limits on those. They simply refused to do \nthat.\n  We have propounded an agreement to say let's have a vote at 3:30. \nThat was 45 minutes ago. We are willing to resume that and have a vote \nin a half hour. Vote on this amendment offered by the chairman of the \nFinance Committee and Senator Enzi. This is an important amendment \ndealing with a large segment of our society. It would stimulate the \neconomy.\n\n  But neither the plan embraced by the House Republicans nor the plan \nsupported by Senate Democrats on the Finance Committee would receive 60 \nvotes in the Senate. It is a fact of life. We have had people today on \nthe floor, from the minority, saying: It has a majority. Why don't they \nlet it come forward? It has a majority.\n  We are in the Senate. We did not set the rules yesterday. They were \nin the process of developing starting 200 years ago. Some object to \nrequiring 60 votes\n\n[[Page S84]]\n\nfor approval of an economic stimulus bill or an amendment. That is the \nway it is.\n  If they want to use that logic, I think it is something we should \nmaybe strongly consider accepting. If that were the case, we could go \nback and look at campaign finance reform, which passed the Senate by 59 \nto 41, a majority vote. We would already have campaign finance reform. \nMany of the questions involved in the Enron investigation would no \nlonger be an issue because campaign finance reform would have already \nbeen passed.\n  Or the Social Security lockbox, which passed 53 to 47. It is a \nmajority plus 2. If that were the case, using their logic, all of these \nvotes we have had over the years--I will just limit it to the last \ncouple of years where we have gotten more than 51 votes--those things \nwould be law.\n  In the Senate, because of the rules we have, you need 60 votes. That \nis the way it is. I accept that. But for people to come here and say: \nWe have the majority, why won't they let us do it?--they should be very \ncareful with that logic because I just picked two examples. There are \nscores of them, in addition to campaign finance reform and Social \nSecurity lockbox. And the Social Security lockbox vote is becoming more \nimportant each day because we are now spending Social Security \nsurpluses.\n  The American public should understand. The Social Security surpluses \nare being spent this year. For the last 4 years we have not been \nspending them, but now we are.\n  This stimulus plan now before the Senate offered by the majority \nleader was created from a consensus. I would like to have added more \nstuff to this. I think we need something in a stimulus package to help \ntourism. The State of the Presiding Officer, Florida, relies heavily on \ntourism. Tourism has been hurt very badly in the State of Florida and \nother places in the United States. I think any stimulus package should \nhave a provision to deal with tourism.\n  I personally believe, if we want to really stimulate the economy, we \nshould do something to develop the infrastructure of this country. \nLet's build some roads--highway construction. For every $1 billion we \nspend on highway construction, we get 42,000 jobs. Not 4,200--42,000 \njobs--and all of the 42,000 people working in those construction jobs \npay taxes, buy cars, refrigerators, and all kinds of other things. But \nat this stage I cannot get 60 votes for my tourism stimulus. I know it \nwould stimulate the economy. So does the Presiding Officer.\n  The National Conference of Mayors has its winter meeting taking place \nin Washington, DC, today. The mayors support my stimulus package as it \nrelates to infrastructure 100 percent. They have passed resolutions. \nBut in the Senate, I can get 51 votes but I can't get 60, and therefore \nit is not going to happen right now. I will keep working on it.\n  So it is very unfortunate that the minority is now saying the House \nbill has more than 50 votes over here, why won't you just let us bring \nit up and pass it on that basis? Because we live in the mature world of \nthe Senate. That is how things work here.\n  As I have said, Senator Daschle's plan is not perfect but it is the \nbest he could do. It is what we agree on. That is the consensus \npackage. I think we should pass it quickly, and I wish we could do \nthat. I hope we can do it before Tuesday. But with winks and nods, it \nappears we will not be able to do that.\n  Mr. President, there is nobody in the minority on the floor so I do \nnot want to offer my unanimous consent request, but I am going to offer \nit in the next few minutes. I ask everyone to be alerted to that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, while we are waiting for an agreement--I \nhope that comes very soon--on the time to vote on the pending \namendment, I would like to introduce into the Record letters of support \nfor the amendment.\n  The first is from the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a letter \nto myself signed by Lynn Cornwell, president of the NCBA; next, a news \nrelease from the National Association of Wheat Growers expressing \nsupport in favor of the pending disaster relief amendment; next, a \nletter from the National Farmers Union in support of this amendment \nsigned by 26 different State farmers unions; letters to me from the \nMontana Stockgrowers Association, the Montana Farmers Union, and the \nMontana Grain Growers Association, all in support of the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Cattlemen's\n\n\n                                             Beef Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2002.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Senate Finance Committee, Hart Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Chairman Baucus: The National Cattlemen's Beef Association \n     (NCBA) appreciates the hard work and effort that has gone \n     into the Economic Stimulus package to date. Livestock \n     Assistance Programs included in the Committee passed package \n     will prove to be a vital economic stimulus in many areas of \n     the country impacted by severe and lingering drought. NCBA \n     supports your efforts to include Livestock Assistance Program \n     funding, at the appropriate levels, in the Stimulus package \n     currently moving in the United States Senate.\n       NCBA believes that Livestock Assistance can prove to be a \n     vital stimulant to the local economies in the areas affected. \n     We hope that during the upcoming debate on the Economic \n     Stimulus package that you will continue your support of this \n     very important program.\n       The program funds will be used immediately to help \n     producers offset the increased cost of feed and forage \n     acquisition due to Mother Nature. NCBA continues to work with \n     USDA, land-grant universities, extension service personnel, \n     local and state governments, and state cattle associations to \n     address the best use of funds that will be available.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to share these requests with \n     you. Please contact NCBA staff at 202-347-0228 if you have \n     any questions or concerns with these or any other issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lynn Cornwell,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          The National Association\n\n\n                                             of Wheat Growers,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 12, 2001.\n\n  NAWG Supports Disaster Spending Proposed by Senate Finance Committee\n\n       Washington, D.C.--The National Association of Wheat Growers \n     (NAWG) expressed support today for including agricultural \n     disaster spending in the stimulus package being considered in \n     the Senate. Several wheat producing states have experienced \n     crop disasters in 2001, and NAWG views this mechanism as an \n     appropriate way to provide much-needed assistance.\n       ``Many of our nation's wheat producers had severe crop \n     disasters that not even crop insurance will completely \n     mitigate,'' said NAWG President Dusty Tallman. ``In this \n     period of poor economic conditions, these farmers are unable \n     to bear the burden of crop failure.''\n       Proceeds from the disaster assistance will largely go to \n     repay loans and expenses against the drought-stricken 2001 \n     crop.\n       ``Rural America is in as much need of economic stimulus as \n     anywhere else,'' said Tallman, ``and in this way we can \n     provide support to hard-hit farmers and the communities where \n     they live.''\n       NAWG is a nonprofit organization representing U.S. wheat \n     growers who, by combining their strengths, voices, and ideas \n     are working to ensure a better wheat industry for today and \n     tomorrow.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        National Farmers Union\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 28, 2001.\n     Member,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 300,000 family farmer and \n     rancher members of the National Farmers Union (NFU), the \n     undersigned NFU Board of Directors urges your support of \n     provisions in the Economic Recovery and Assistance for \n     American Workers Act providing disaster assistance for family \n     farmers and ranchers.\n       Farmers across the nation have suffered substantial \n     economic losses from adverse weather and disease during the \n     2001 crop year. The needs are immediate. We encourage you to \n     support the production and quality loss assistance program in \n     Finance Committee Chairman Baucus' economic recovery package \n     passed out of the Senate Finance Committee which includes \n     $1.8 billion in emergency assistance for crop producers and \n     $500 million for livestock producers.\n       From Montana to Louisiana, Texas to the Northeast, and \n     California to Missouri, farmers and ranchers have experienced \n     adverse weather conditions, disease, insect infestations, and \n     sudden weather phenomena. These disasters resulted in massive \n     crop production\n\n[[Page S85]]\n\n     and quality loss and losses impacting livestock producers. \n     These losses are negatively impacting the livelihoods of \n     family farmers, ranchers and their rural communities in all \n     regions of the country.\n       As you seek ways to strengthen the U.S. economy through an \n     economic stimulus package, it is critical that agriculture, \n     which represents nearly twenty percent of all U.S. economic \n     activity and whose foundation is this Nation's farmers and \n     ranchers, receives priority consideration. We again urge you \n     to support production loss assistance in the economic \n     stimulus bill and we look forward to working with you on this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n         Leland Swenson, President, National Farmers Union; Vicki \n           Trytten, President, Alaska Farmers Union; Joaquin \n           Contente, President, California Farmers Union; Larry \n           Quandt, President, Illinois Farmers Union; Gary Hoskey, \n           President, Missouri Farmers Union; Carl McIlvain, \n           President, Michigan Farmers Union; Russ Kremer, \n           President, Missouri Farmers Union; John Hansen, \n           President, Nebraska Farmers Union.\n         Robert Clunk, President, Ohio Farmers Union; Dan Joyce, \n           President, Oregon Farmers Union; John Stencel, \n           President, Rocky Mountain Farmers Union; Wes Sims, \n           President, Texas Farmers Union; Jim Davis, President, \n           Washington Farmers Union; Alan Bergman, Vice President, \n           National Farmers Union; Jim Miller, President, Arkansas \n           Farmers Union; Gary Turner, President, Idaho Farmers \n           Union.\n         Larry Coomer, President, Indiana Farmers Union; Donn \n           Teske, President, Kansas Farmers Union; Dave \n           Frederickson, President, Minnesota Farmers Union; Del \n           Styren, President, Montana Farmers Union; Robert \n           Carlson, President, North Dakota Farmers Union; Ray \n           Wulf, President, Oklahoma Farmers Union; Larry Breech, \n           President, Pennsylvania Farmers Union; Dennis Wiese, \n           President, South Dakota Farmers Union; Arthur Douglas, \n           President, Utah Farmers Union; Bill Brey, President, \n           Wisconsin Farmers Union.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Montana Stockgrowers Association,\n\n                                    Helena, MT, November 14, 2001.\n     Re: Economic Recovery and Assistance for American Workers Act \n         of 2001.\n\n     Senator Max Baucus,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Baucus: On behalf of the members of the \n     Montana Stockgrowers Association, I am writing this letter to \n     express our support and appreciation for your efforts to pass \n     an economic stimulus package, the Economic Recovery and \n     Assistance for American Workers Act of 2001. The tragic \n     events of September 11th have obviously added to the economic \n     woes of this country and efforts such as yours are absolutely \n     necessary to allow us to endure and recover.\n       In particular, we are asking that you continue your \n     steadfast support for the reestablishment of the Livestock \n     Assistance Program. As you are well aware, Montana livestock \n     producers continue to struggle with the impacts of successive \n     years of drought and this assistance may prove invaluable to \n     our producers.\n       Again, thank you for your efforts in this important area. \n     If you or your staff have any questions, please feel free to \n     contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Steven L.

It provides $1.8 billion \n     for crop disaster assistance and $500 million for livestock \n     disaster assistance.\n       ``From Montana to Louisiana, Texas to the Northeast, and \n     California to Missouri, farmers and ranchers have experienced \n     prolonged adverse weather conditions, disease, insect \n     infestation and severe weather events,'' Swenson said. \n     ``These disasters are resulting in massive production loss \n     and sustained quality loss in harvested crops and livestock \n     grazing.''\n       The letter to the senators was signed Wednesday, November \n     28, 2001, by the 26-member NFU board, which was in \n     Washington, D.C. for its quarterly meeting and to make \n     personal visits with senators about the farm bill, which will \n     be debated soon by the Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n         Montana Grain Growers Association, Montana Farm Bureau \n           Federation, Montana Farmers Union,\n                                                 November 9, 2001.\n\n  Needed Ag Disaster Assistance Included in Economic Stimulus Package\n\n       Montana farm groups applauded the inclusion of agricultural \n     disaster assistance in the economic stimulus package approved \n     Thursday by the Senate Finance Committee. The package, \n     introduced by Chairman Max Baucus, is expected to go to the \n     full Senate next week.\n       Nearly 2,000 square miles of central Montana hardly saw a \n     combine this season. According to state statistics, winter \n     wheat production was down 50 percent statewide, and 75 \n     percent in the golden triangle--the heart of wheat production \n     in Montana. Crop insurance loss ratios are expected to top \n     500 percent, unmatched previously in Montana.\n       ``I wish I could say the drought in Montana has eased,'' \n     stated Dale Schuler, president of the Montana Grain Growers \n     Association. ``But it has not, and the cumulative effects \n     over four years puts too many Montana farm operations close \n     to the edge. Our Congressional delegation has viewed \n     firsthand the drought situation and has responded. This \n     legislation introduced by Senator Baucus moves us one step \n     closer''.\n       Jake Cummins, Executive Vice President of the Montana Farm \n     Bureau Federation, added, ``there will be a battle ahead to \n     keep ag disaster assistance in place as the bill moves to the \n     floor of the Senate. But support for agriculture is crucial \n     to stimulating our economy and providing a strong base for \n     one of the most fundamental industries in America. In this \n     time of uncertainty, we can't cede our production agriculture \n     to other countries''.\n       Diana Adamson, Vice-President of the Montana Farmers Union, \n     echoed the comments. ``This prolonged drought is starting to \n     impact all segments of Montana's economy. It's not just a \n     farm problem, but all of the businesses in rural communities, \n     and even the larger town, are affected. I hate to see what \n     happens if this does not come through''.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there are a number of States that have a \ngood number of counties which have been designated as having disasters.\n  In Michigan, for example, there are 82 counties that are eligible for \nthese emergency loans due to losses by drought.\n  In Texas, 58 counties received emergency designations. To quote a \npress release from Secretary Veneman, ``Texas has experienced a variety \nof weather-related disasters this year, including drought, excessive \nrain, tornadoes, hail and flooding.'' These counties were in addition \nto the 23 counties designated for emergency earlier in the month of \nDecember 2001.\n  In Idaho, 28 counties were designated; in Maine, 16 counties; in \nTennessee, 16 counties were designated; in New York, 33 counties, \nbecause of drought, hail, and excessive rain; Nebraska, 36 counties due \nto draught and severe heat; Pennsylvania, 3 counties were named on \nJanuary 8th of this year, but 58 counties in Pennsylvania were \ndesignated December 14 because of drought; in Ohio, 36 counties \ndesignated for disaster qualification due to losses caused by excessive \nrain and flooding. That designation was on November 8 of last year. In \nOklahoma, in October of last year, the entire State was designated due \nto losses caused by excessive heat and drought. Secretary Veneman \nstated at that point:\n\n       Oklahoma has experienced severe drought conditions this \n     year. Our farmers and ranchers need this assistance to \n     recover from these natural disaster losses.\n\n  That is Secretary Veneman commenting on the problems in Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, there are more I could cite, but I think that is \nenough at this point. I see other Senators standing in the Chamber. I \nassume they want to address the Senate. I am not positive. But I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, since last January, economic growth \nhas slowed in our country and nearly 2 million Americans have lost \ntheir jobs.\n\n[[Page S86]]\n\n Behind them are children whose tuition is in danger and families who \nare in trouble with mortgage payments or rents that are due. There is \nan enormous loss of family security. The tragedy of terrorist attacks \nin September only exacerbated the already slowing economy.\n  As Americans continue to suffer the effects of this economic decline, \nCongress simply needs to implement a plan to deal with their pain and \nto help the recovery. That opportunity was lost in the closing weeks of \nlast year. It cannot be lost again.\n  The Democratic leadership has brought to the Senate floor a modest \nproposal to stimulate economic growth and national recovery. It \ncontains four principal provisions that both parties included in their \neconomic recovery plans last year. One would assume, therefore, since \nthey are four common elements previously proposed by both parties, they \nshould be acceptable now.\n  The four elements combined provide effective short-term stimulus to \nbring the most economic activity with the least damage to the Nation's \nfiscal health. They provide broad-based, rather than industry-specific, \nstimulus, and they are directed to individuals who are most likely to \nneed and spend the tax reductions rather than people generally. These \nmore targeted, more thoughtful approaches minimize loss in revenue, \npreserve the balance of the Federal budget, and give more relief.\n  The four provisions are:\n  First, the extension of unemployment benefits. In December, the \nunemployment rate reached 5.8 percent. It was the fifth consecutive \nmonth with a rise in unemployment. At least 1.1 million jobs were lost \nin the last 4 months of 2001 alone.\n  In times of economic recession, people turn to unemployment insurance \nfirst. It is not only a proper thing to help families in their pain, it \nis itself an economic stabilizer. As people become unemployed, they \nnaturally spend less money. If they have no unemployment insurance, \nthey spend no money and the economic contagion and unemployment spread. \nWe are at that point.\n  This legislation provides 13 additional weeks of unemployment \ninsurance. In the last recession, in 1992, 56 percent of those \ncollecting unemployment insurance benefits had their benefits expired. \nThey were without resources. That extends and deepens a recession.\n  These extra weeks are necessary for the families. They are also \nnecessary for the country. We now know from our research that every $1 \ninvested in unemployment insurance generates $2.15 in gross domestic \nproduct. Unemployment insurance in the last recession mitigated 15 \npercent of the economic decline. It is the right thing to do, it is the \nfair thing to do for people, and it is good economics. That is the \nfirst provision.\n  Second, tax rebates. Putting money directly in the pockets of people \nwho are struggling helps families make ends meet, but it also increases \ndemand. This is the single best way to generate new economic activity.\n  The Democratic proposal before the Senate will provide a second round \nof tax rebates to those Americans who did not benefit fully from the \ntax cuts of last summer. There are 130 million taxpayers in America, \nyet only 82 million received a full rebate last summer, and 34 million \nAmericans got no tax cut at all.\n\n  This plan provides $300 per individual, $500 per head of household, \nand $600 per couple for taxpayers. People would receive a rebate. But \nthey are also the people--lower income people--who are more likely to \nspend the money.\n  I voted for last year's tax cut. But even I will concede, \noverwhelmingly, the money that went out in rebates did not go into \nconsumer spending. It went to middle-income people. It went to higher \nincome people. This rebate, we know from our research, will go to \npeople who will spend it and spend it immediately, thereby helping \ntheir neighbors, helping businesses, helping the country recover.\n  Third, fiscal relief for the States. I know something about this \nissue because my State of New Jersey now, per capita, as a percentage \nof State spending, has the largest deficit in the United States. It is \nfully 12 percent of the State budget.\n  Approximately 30 States in the Union are now in the midst of a \nrecession. In addition to their falling revenues and budget shortfalls, \n29 States face a $600 million cut in Federal Medicaid payments this \nyear. It could not come at a worse time. As a result, many States are \nconsidering reductions in their Medicaid Programs to deal with the \nbudget shortfalls. This could result in substantial numbers of low-\nincome people losing health insurance.\n  My State of New Jersey has been forced to suspend further enrollments \nin its expansion of Medicaid to childless adults with incomes below the \npoverty line because of budget constraints. At the same time, the \ngrowing ranks of the unemployed have generated an increased demand for \nMedicaid coverage.\n  This proposal will help States meet the increase in Medicaid costs by \ntemporarily increasing the Federal Medicaid matching rate. Without it, \nthe health care crisis becomes worse, State budget impacts worsen, they \ncut vital services, or they raise taxes, or they do both. Either way, a \ndifficult recession becomes deeper and more painful.\n  Fourth and finally, the bill provides a tax depreciation deduction, \nfor a limited time, to encourage businesses to invest in new plants and \nequipment. It increases the depreciation deduction for the cost of any \ncapital asset purchased before the end of the year. The bonus \ndepreciation of 30 percent of the cost of the asset is in addition to \nthe normal first-year depreciation.\n  I know something about this provision in New Jersey, as well, because \nwhile there has been an overall drop in capital spending, most of it \nhas been in new equipment. The largest drop in equipment has been in \ntelecommunications, impacting Verizon, Lucent, AT the very pillars of \nthe economy of my State.\n  This is the best way, through this advanced depreciation, to make it \naffordable for companies to buy the productive, efficient equipment \nthey need to be more competitive. And doing it now assures continued \nemployment and helps to end the recession.\n  This is not only a balanced plan, it is a fair plan. I regret it is \nso modest in scope. The Nation actually requires more. But our first \nresponsibility is to achieve something, not simply to stake out \npositions of partisan advantage. This both has merit and should be \nachievable. I urge my colleagues to adopt it. The American people will \nwork their way out of this recession, but this Congress has an \nobligation to make it easier, to give them the tools.\n  There is work to be done in this country defending the Nation from \nenemies from abroad--winning the war, protecting our security here at \nhome--but also there are the age-old problems: Educating children, \ngiving them equal opportunity, modernizing our infrastructure, dealing \nwith a health care crisis that goes generation to generation. In a \nrecession, these things become difficult to impossible. In a growing \neconomy, they can be both likely and achievable.\n\n  This may not end the recession immediately, but it eases the pain. It \nshortens the time. It is a good and fair plan. I urge my colleagues to \nadopt it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nelson of Florida pertaining to the submission of \nS. Res. 201 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of \nConcurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I thank the Chair for the time. \nI am going to withhold offering an amendment. I understand the leaders \nare working out an agreement between mine and Senator Baucus's \namendment. With respect to their efforts, I will not offer this \namendment now, but I would like to talk about it.\n  The Presiding Officer and I were privileged to be in a hearing this \nmorning with Chairman Greenspan and heard his very insightful views on \nthe economy and what we can do. I noted in his testimony this \nparagraph:\n\n\n[[Page S87]]\n\n\n       The retrenchment in capital spending over the past year was \n     central to the sharp slowing we experienced in overall \n     activity. The steep rise in high-tech spending that occurred \n     in the early post Y2K months was clearly not sustainable. The \n     demand for many of the newer technologies was growing \n     rapidly, but capacity was expanding even faster, exerting \n     severe pressure on prices and profits. New orders for \n     equipment and software hesitated in the middle of 2000 and \n     then fell sharply as firms reevaluated their capital \n     investment programs. Uncertainty about economic prospects \n     boosted risk premiums significantly, and this rise in turn \n     propelled, required or hurdled rates of return to markedly \n     elevated levels.\n       In most cases, businesses required that new investments pay \n     off much more rapidly than they had previously.\n\n  That is the sentence that I think is so significant:\n\n       In most cases, businesses required that new investments pay \n     off much more rapidly than they had previously.\n\n  If that is, as the chairman indicated, central to the sharp slowing \nin our economy, then it seems to me if we are going to do a stimulus \npackage, we ought to do something that is meaningful, something that \nhas economic heft to it, enough weight to actually stimulate our \neconomy. I have said for a long time that I support the ideas on health \ncare, the ideas on extending unemployment benefits. In fact, I am \ncosponsor of one of them. I think getting cash into the hands of \nconsumers, as Senator Torricelli just indicated, is very important to \nthe demand side of getting our economy moving.\n  I think it is important that we also look at the supply side. If we \nwant employers to employ people again in large numbers, then we ought \nto do something to help with the retooling of industry, getting enough \nof a stimulus so that business and planners can make a difference in \nordering and redoing their plants and reemploying their people. I don't \nquestion the sincerity of some of the proposals, but as I evaluate \nthem, compared to the amendment I will offer, I think they lack the \nweight that our economy needs at this critical hour.\n  In fact, I think it is important to note that while Chairman \nGreenspan is not in a position to endorse anybody's particular idea or \namendment, he and former Secretary Rubin have both uniformly stated \ntheir support for stimulus ideas with respect to depreciation, \naccelerated depreciation, or a bonus depreciation, however you want to \nterm it--that these things would increase cash flow, add to asset \nvalues, and would have an immediate stimulating effect on our economy.\n  What I am going to be proposing is that we have a 30-percent \ndepreciation bonus that lasts for 3 years. One of the competing \nproposals is that it be for 1 year. This is better than the 10 percent, \n1-year proposal that was earlier offered. However, it still falls very \nshort because if you figure that it only lasts for 1 year, much of this \nyear is already gone. What can a business reasonably prepare for, plan \nfor, employ for, if they have only a few months left in the year, \nliterally, between now and September, when it would end, to take \nadvantage of it? They may get a few copiers and a few new rugs for the \nfront office, but this is not what our country needs if we are serious \nabout reemploying people.\n  So my proposal, conversely, will give companies the time to do major \nprojects which would generate thousands of jobs. It will allow us to \nbuild heavy equipment, modernize a lumber mill, repair a rail bed, \nrevamp a management information system for a factory, or even construct \nan airplane. We say a lot about airplanes right now. I know Boeing is \nsuffering greatly, and an accelerated depreciation program that will \nlast for 9 months will not be very helpful to them at all. Certainly, \nthe high-tech community, whether you are talking about the Silicon \nForest in Oregon or the actual forest in Oregon, needs something with \nenough teeth in it, enough time to it that will allow them to make the \nplans and the investments that are necessary.\n  Then I think about the farm community. It may not be until 2002 that \nfarmers see much improvement in their economy, and I hope it is sooner. \nBut if it is not, I would like to have this in place when their \ncashflows improve and they can replace old, unreliable, or dilapidated \nequipment and get the advantage of this bonus depreciation.\n\n  Madam President, I appreciate this time. I will come back later to \ntalk again about it and specifically offer this amendment when we work \nout an agreement between ours and Senator Baucus's.\n  I truly hope this meaningful depreciation amendment can be adopted by \nover 60 of our colleagues. I think it is critical that we do that \nbecause I think we need to marry the best ideas of the Democratic Party \nand the best ideas of the Republican Party. We need to work on the \nsupply side and the demand side. There is a human side and there is a \nbusiness side. There is a very nice marriage to be had in a stimulus \npackage that will truly leave our country better because it has the \neconomic weight that is required for this critical hour.\n  So in doing that, we will sooner throw off the shackles of recession \nand leave our country the better for it.\n  Madam President, I yield my time and simply say I will return as soon \nas our leaders have worked out the agreement and specifically offer the \namendment, hoping it can be voted on tonight or tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we are very close to being able to offer a \nunanimous consent agreement and we will call for a vote immediately and \nthen go thereafter to the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 4:20 p.m. today, the Senate vote on \nor in relation to the Baucus amendment, the pending amendment; that no \nother amendments be in order prior to that vote; that upon the \ndisposition of that amendment, Senator Gordon Smith be recognized to \noffer an amendment regarding depreciation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

A point of order has been made by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma that the Chair is prepared to rule on, unless there is \nsome intervention.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Montana would increase the amount \nby which the Finance Committee exceeds its allocation under section \n302(a) of the Budget Act in violation of section 302(f) of that same \nact. The point of order is sustained.\n  The amendment falls.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senator from Oregon is going to be recognized. I \nwould just say to my friend, the manager of this bill and the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, I hope he will offer this amendment again \nbefore we get off this stimulus package. This was an extremely good \nvote. There were a number of people missing, and I have no doubt in my \nmind if this amendment, of which I am a cosponsor along with a number \nof others, were offered again, it would be agreed to.\n  I think this is extremely important, and I hope the Senator from \nMontana will offer this amendment at the earliest possible date. I \nthink it is too bad that we had some people not here today because I \nthink there is obviously overwhelming support for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

years ending after such date.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, this amendment is really very \nsimple. It does address in a meaningful way the stimulus side of our \neffort. I think we are all deeply concerned when we go home and we meet \nthe unemployed who need extensions on unemployment benefits and health \ncare insurance benefits from COBRA.\n  I would like to help. What they really need long term is a job. What \nwe need to do is remember there is a supply side to this economic \nequation as well. We have to do something meaningful in order to help \nbusinesses retool, reinvest, restart, and reemploy the citizens of this \ncountry.\n  There is a proposal--I believe well-intentioned--that is improving on \nthe other side. Originally, it was a 10-percent depreciation bonus over \n1 year's time. Now it is up to 30 percent over 1 year's time with \neligibility.\n  I believe 30 percent is the right number for this bonus depreciation, \nbut as a person of business prior to politics I can tell you it takes \nmore than what is remaining in the year of eligibility. We have already \nused up 4 months. By the time the President might see this, there may \nbe 5 months used up. Seven months to make a business plan in capital \nequipment in order to restart plants is simply inadequate to be \nmeaningful to have the economic test that our country requires.\n  My amendment will actually help stimulate the economy. We have heard \nthis from experts such as Alan Greenspan, such as Secretary Rubin of \nthe Clinton administration, and others who have said this is one \nmeaningful thing you can do that will actually help stimulate the \neconomy in the short run and reemploy people quickly.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It is critical. \nWhether you are talking about the silicon forest of the high-tech \nindustry in Oregon or the timber industry of the forests in Oregon, \nthey need this bill. They need it desperately if we are serious about \nrestarting plants and reemploying our people.\n  I hope tomorrow morning when we vote on this there will be 60 \ncolleagues and more who will understand that while we are going to do \nmuch on the demand side to help with unemployment benefits and to help \nwith health care benefits, we are also going to do something to help on \nthe supply side and actually help to stimulate jobs and reemployment.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator's amendment deals with the accelerated \ndepreciation. The essence of the Senator's amendment is there would be \naccelerated depreciation of 30 percent for 3 years in contrast to \nSenator Daschle's amendment, which is 30 percent for a timeframe \nbetween September of 2001 and 2002. Senator Daschle's amendment has 30 \npercent basically from February--basically 8 months.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. The Senator is correct. My point is simply that \nis not enough time to do much more than buy a few typewriters or rugs \nfor the front office. You can't make a serious business plan in that \namount of time and represent to the American people that we are \nactually helping to reemploy people. We need to rebuild some railroad \nbeds. We need to retool some plants. We need to allow businesses the \ntime necessary to do the engineering, to do the environmental studies, \nand to make the plans that can take advantage of it. And they will do \nit if they are given time sufficient to get the job done.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator include me as a cosponsor of the \namendment?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be made a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cleland). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Harkin). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to \nincrease the 30-percent bonus depreciation from 1 year to 3 years.\n  The underlying proposal, while improvement over the previous one, \nwhich was only 10 percent, is still too short. It is not enough time to \nhelp revive the high-tech economy, and, indeed, our general economy to \nhelp create more jobs.\n  If the underlying proposal were implemented, the bonus depreciation \nwould only last until September of 2002, which is merely 8 months away.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Oregon was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives and was supported by the Bush administration. The \nargument that the Senator from Oregon has made makes a great deal of \nsense. It will boost investment. It will boost growth in the high-tech \nsector in particular.\n  Why does that matter? I was just meeting with high-tech folks from \nRedmond, WA, Silicon Valley in California, and here in Virginia. \nWhether in Oregon, or anywhere else, this proposal makes good sense.\n  Senator Smith's amendment takes aim at the core problem of our \nslumping economy which is seeing a huge drop in investment, in \nequipment, and in machinery. Over 3 years, a 30-percent bonus \ndepreciation would get the investment engine going and running strong \nagain. It would lower the cost of new capital spending. It would \nprovide a stimulus for a broad array of industries, including \ntelecommunications, technology and others, including transportation.\n  The current depreciation schedule clearly has not kept up with our \neconomy. It is especially harmful in this economic slowdown.\n\n  Senator Smith introduced this proposal on behalf of the Senate \nRepublican High Tech Task Force late last year. Indeed, looking at the \nconcept of the enhanced expensing as proposed by Senator Smith for \nbonus depreciation, it would be highly beneficial to the high-tech \ncommunity, the sector of our economy that has driven productivity \ngrowth and created millions of jobs during the last decade.\n  The information technology industry makes up only 8.2 percent of the \nU.S. economy. Yet it has accounted for almost 30 percent of the real \ngross domestic growth from 1994 to 2000. Much of this growth resulted \nfrom the increase in investment in hardware, software, networking, and \ncommunications systems.\n  As the economic slowdown has persisted, decreasing IT investments \nhave substantially weakened our American economic growth. During these \nuncertain economic times, as Senator Smith stated, businesses have \ndecreased motivation. They do not want to take those risks in buying \nnew equipment and new systems because they are worried about what the \neconomy may do. The result, obviously, has an adverse impact on job \nopportunities for those who fabricate the chips, for those who assemble \nthe computers, and for those who work on the programs and all the \ninnovations and adaptations that improve our lives--whether it is in \neducation or communication services and manufacturing.\n  This amendment has a robust expensing provision. I think it can turn \naround our bleak economic scenario. The enhanced expensing provision in \nthis amendment, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor with Senator \nSmith, has broad support.\n  As I noted previously, the House passed it. This has the support of \nleading high-tech trade associations, including AeA, CapNet, EIA, BSA, \nthe Information Technology Association of America, the Information \nTechnology Industry Council, and TechNet.\n  We need to get into some details of the economy because that bolsters \nthe argument about why we need to pass this amendment.\n  Diminishing IT investments impact our economy. By the fourth quarter \nof\n\n[[Page S90]]\n\n2000, conditions were changing dramatically from what they were in the \nprevious 6 years. Gross domestic product growth plunged. It was \nprecipitated in part by an 8.4-percent drop in investment for all \nequipment and software, and a 9.5-percent decline in investments in \ncomputers and peripheral equipment in the first half of the year 2001.\n  To put this in perspective, 2001 was the first time since 1974 that \nbusiness investments in IT declined over a 12-month period. In the \nfirst quarter of 2001, the trend acted as a drag on our economy \nsubtracting an estimated 4.41 percentage points from overall growth.\n  In the second quarter of 2001, the impact was even more dramatic with \ndiminishing investments in technology equipment and software \nsubtracting over 1.52 percentage points from U.S. economic growth.\n  Some of the decline in IT investments may be attributed to the \nlingering effects of Y2K, which caused many firms to accelerate their \nIT spending to ensure they could maintain current operations during the \ncentury date change in the year 2000.\n  Other factors included diminishing revenues to commit to business \nexpansion and upgrades, and the tendency to conserve capital during \ntimes of economic uncertainty and concerns arising from the terrorist \nattacks of September 11. All of these factors contribute to the \ndecision to hold onto technology assets longer than normal in part to \nmaximize tax deductions under the current five-year depreciation \nrules. So you might as well use it for the whole 5 years. That ought to \nbe changed also. That is not the purpose of this amendment, but it \npoints out the value of this amendment. If you have a long 5-year \ndepreciation, such as if you upgraded for Y2K, and you have economic \nuncertainty, you see the exacerbated negative impact on our whole \neconomy and jobs and spending.\n\n  We need to have that stimulus. This is what this is. Of all the \nthings that are in this underlying bill, this idea meets the concept \nand the definition of economic stimulus more than anything else that \nhas been presented so far. There may be others coming up, but this is \nthe best so far.\n  An economic stimulus ought to be a change in our tax or regulatory \npolicies that induces or spurs spending or economic decisionmaking that \nwould not otherwise occur but for that change in the tax laws. This \nmeets that definition. This will spur businesses to say: Hey, let's \nstart planning. Let's upgrade our technology. Granted, we may have 5 \nyears of depreciation, but with this 30-percent depreciation, this \nbonus depreciation, this makes economic sense for us.\n  What will be the result of that? Our businesses will be more \nproductive. They will be more efficient. But those who produce and \nfabricate the chips, those who assemble the computers, those who \ndevelop the programs will all have jobs. And they are good-paying jobs. \nAnd that helps out the whole economy.\n  So the tendency we have right now of people delaying the decision to \nmake new investments will certainly be changed by this amendment. So I \nask that all our colleagues unite for the one thing that really does \nunite us; and that is this amendment by Senator Smith of Oregon.\n  There are many cosponsors, including virtually everyone on the High \nTech Task Force on the Republican side. I hope our friends on the other \nside of the aisle, who have made progress from the original proposal, \nwill realize this is the ideal and this will not only be bonus \ndepreciation for businesses and entrepreneurs and enterprises across \nAmerica, and help create jobs, but it will be a bonus for the American \neconomy.\n  I commend Senator Smith of Oregon and ask my colleagues to support \nthis amendment. Let's get America working again. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. While we are waiting for the next speaker, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the \nRepublican High Tech Task Force to the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Senate Finance Committee and the chairman and ranking member of the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee dated November 30, 2001.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                November 30, 2001.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. William Thomas,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Rangel,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members: As members of the Senate \n     Republican High Tech Task Force (HTTF), we write to recommend \n     that any final economic stimulus package include an enhanced \n     expensing provision. We view the expensing provision in the \n     House-passed stimulus bill. H.R. 3090, which would allow 30 \n     percent enhanced expensing over three years, as the minimum \n     the Congress should enact.\n       Enhanced expensing would be highly beneficial to the high \n     technology community--the sector of the economy that has \n     driven productivity growth and created millions of jobs \n     during the last decade. The information technology (IT) \n     industry makes up only 8.2 percent of the U.S. economy, yet \n     it accounted for almost 30 percent of real Gross Domestic \n     Growth (GDP) from 1994 to 2000. Much of this growth resulted \n     from the increased investment in hardware, software, \n     networking and communications systems. As the economic \n     slowdown has persisted, decreasing IT investments have \n     substantially weakened U.S. economic growth. During these \n     uncertain economic times, businesses' decreased motivation to \n     buy new equipment or build new plants will further impact \n     opportunities for job creation and squander revival of the IT \n     industry. A robust expensing provision can turn around this \n     bleak scenario.\n       Enhanced expensing has broad support. As we noted above, \n     H.R. 3090, the Economic Security and Recovery Act, passed by \n     the House of Representatives, included the 30 percent, three-\n     year expensing provision. The Bush Administration also \n     supports this provision, which also was included in the \n     Senate Republican stimulus proposal. On behalf of the HTTF, \n     Senator Gordon Smith filed an amendment to the substitute \n     amendment to H.R. 3090 offered by Senator Baucus to include \n     the House-passed expensing language. Leading high tech trade \n     association, including AeA, CapNet, EIA, the Information \n     Technology Association of America, the Information Technology \n     Industry Council, and TechNet, have placed enhanced expensing \n     among their most important legislative goals for the year. We \n     urge you to--at a minimum--include the House-passed expensing \n     provision in any final stimulus bill.\n       We appreciate you consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         Senator Gordon Smith, Senator George Allen, Senator Sam \n           Brownback, Senator John Warner, Senator Wayne Allard, \n           Senator Mike Crapo, Senator John Ensign, Senator Conrad \n           Burns, Senator Kit Bond, Senator Day Bailey Hutchinson, \n           Senator Tim Hutchinson.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, while we have this moment, I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I planned on rising to ask to set this \namendment aside so I might offer an amendment. I understand there is to \nbe an objection on the other side, so I want to take these moments to \ntantalize my colleagues with the thought of the tremendously important \namendment that I will, at some time, offer. Frankly, it follows very \nclosely along the lines of the amendment that the Senator from Oregon \nhas offered and the Senator from Virginia has just so eloquently \nexplained.\n  Basically, if we are going to get the economy moving again, it is \nvery important that we get small business moving. I do not know about \nmy colleagues, but I can tell you in my State there are a very \nsignificant number of small businesses that have been very directly \nhurt and very heavily impacted by the events of September 11 and the \nfollow-on necessary reaction to shut down on terrorism.\n  We need to get support for small business. I have, in the past, \nworked with the chairman of the Small Business Committee, Senator \nKerry, to provide assistance for loans. We hope that will be included \nin this bill.\n  But the bill I am talking about would raise the expensing limits for \nsmall business. This is extremely important because right now, even \nunder the Daschle amendment, if there is a 30-percent bonus, you still \nhave to depreciate the rest of the equipment over 5 years. If you are \nbuying a computer, in\n\n[[Page S91]]\n\n5 years there is going to be something totally different. You need to \nbe able, as a small business, to purchase equipment and write it off.\n  Why do we say it is for small business? Because we would raise the \nthreshold. But the threshold would still be $325,000 worth of assets \nput into place during the year. So only the smallest businesses that \nare struggling to get back on their feet, that seek to grow by buying \nequipment, would be able to take advantage of this expensing.\n  Expensing means, in this instance, if it is up to $40,000, you write \nit off. You do not have to set up a depreciation schedule. You do not \nhave to hire accountants. You do not have to have all that folderol \nthat you go through for depreciation.\n  For the smallest businesses, the ones we hear from the most--at least \nthe ones I hear from back home--they are really the smallest ones which \nhave several employees. They are busy providing a product or a service. \nThey do not have time to go out and hire an accountant and set up \ndepreciation schedules.\n  So this amendment says--the amendment that at some point I will \noffer--that small businesses will be able to expense up to $40,000 a \nyear, which is an increase from $24,000, and it would increase the \nphaseout threshold to $325,000 of assets put in play in the year from \nthe current $200,000 limitation. This is similar to but $5,000 more \ngenerous than the centrist proposal. Frankly, the centrist proposal had \n$35,000. This is a $40,000 limit. I think that is a reasonable figure. \nI think this would encourage the small businesses to put capital to \nwork to buy the equipment they need.\n  With the freed up capital, the business can invest in equipment. The \nsmall enterprise will stimulate other enterprises. The more they can \nreduce their taxes by making the purchase of the equipment, the more \nemployees they will be able to keep working.\n  Chairman Greenspan has indicated again in his testimony today that \nsmall businesses expanding and growing is a vitally important part of \nthe long-term vitality of our economy. Small businesses, we know, \nrepresent about 99 percent of all employers. They employ 51 percent of \nthe private-sector workforce. They provide about 75 percent of the net \nnew jobs. They contribute 51 percent of the private-sector output. And \nthey represent 96 percent of all exporters of goods.\n\n  Size is the only small aspect of small business. It really is a \ndynamic force in our economy. As the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia was discussing, this would allow the smallest businesses to \nbuy a computer or other information technology equipment for up to \n$40,000 and write it off immediately and not have to go through the 5-\nyear depreciation system.\n  My colleague from Nevada is in the Chamber. I ask if I can gain \nunanimous consent to set the underlying amendment aside or if he wishes \nme to offer it later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from Missouri is \nalways very courteous. I certainly do not want to be discourteous to \nhim, but we believe, with this most important legislation pending, we \nshould work on an amendment at a time. We just completed the \nagriculture amendment. We are now going to bonus depreciation. We will \nhave a vote on that tomorrow. Following that vote, I think we should \nhave another amendment laid down. And using this tradition--I do not \nknow if ``tradition'' is the right word--usually, on these bills, where \nthere is an open amendment process, we go back and forth--Democrat-\nRepublican--amendment by amendment. So having said that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I understood they would object. Senator \nCollins and I do wish to have this amendment included at the \nappropriate time. I ask the managers, as they work out the schedule, to \nput this amendment in the queue at the first available opportunity.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If I understand what the Democratic assistant leader \nsaid, we will have a Democrat amendment. So then Senator Bond's should \nbe the first Republican amendment up after we have a Democrat amendment \nup.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the floor manager and the majority \nwhip. I appreciate very much their consideration of it. I will offer \nthis to the floor manager to introduce at the appropriate time.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor of the amendment of the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \namendment.\n  Bonus depreciation was one of the proposals that both Chairman \nGreenspan and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin uniformly endorsed \nfor a stimulus package.\n  They argued accelerating depreciation was the most stimulative thing \nthat we could do to jump start the economy.\n  They said it would increase cash flows and add to asset values.\n  They lauded its immediate stimulus effect on the economy and \nemphasized that a temporary enactment would not have long-term \nbudgetary impact.\n  Despite all these advantages and the endorsement of Chairman \nGreenspan and former Clinton Treasury Secretary Rubin, and Democrats \nhave give us an inadequate depreciation proposal.\n  They would allow 30 percent bonus depreciation for only 1 year.\n  Granted, this is an improvement on their first idea. That was to \nallow only 1 percent bonus for 1 year.\n  The bipartisan White House-Centrist economic stimulus package offered \na solid proposal calling for a 30 percent bonus depreciation over 3 \nyears.\n  Senator Daschle's bonus depreciation proposal is only for one year. \nNow what does 1-year period allow us to stimulate?\n  Well, it probably gives business people time to buy an office copier, \ndesks, or some new throw rugs for front office.\n  But I do not think this bill includes any incentives to continue \nprojects that are already in the pipeline.\n  It does not give companies time to do a major project, which could \ngenerate thousands of jobs.\n  It does not allow us to build heavy equipment, modernize a lumber \nmill, repair a railbed, revamp a management information system for a \nfactory, or construct an airplane.\n  Farmers may not see an economical turnaround until after 2002. When \nthey do, they will need to update their equipment. The farm economy has \nbeen so bad for so long that many farmers have not been in a financial \nposition to replace unreliable equipment. They will need more time than \n1 year to do this.\n  And aircraft is an interesting point. This is one of the industries \nthat has been hit the hardest by the events of September 11.\n\n  We know from our discussions with the few remaining U.S. aircraft \nmanufacturers, that it can take up to 18 months to build an airplane.\n  One year is not enough time to finish a project of this size.\n  Moreover, a 1-year bonus depreciation period does not provide \ninsurance against a future down tick in our recovery cycle. This \ncommonly occurs as an economy struggles to throw off the shackles of \nrecession. We need to capture a booming economy not just for today but \nfor the next several years.\n  Economic growth is key to eliminating the future budget deficits that \nhave been forecast by the CBO.\n  So I must emphasize that the Democrat's 1-year bonus depreciation \npackage is seriously lacking in economic weight.\n  It is a temporary proposal for what should be the centerpiece of an \neconomic recovery package.\n  Bonus depreciation is probably the best idea any stimulus proposal. \nSenator Daschle's proposal simply fails to recognize its importance to \nour economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I have just been handed a press \nrelease by the Secretary of the Treasury. I ask\n\n[[Page S92]]\n\nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement by Secretary Paul O'Neill on Bonus Depreciation Amendment \n                           Before the Senate\n\n       The economic stimulus bill under consideration in the \n     Senate includes a 30% bonus depreciation provision which \n     expires in one year. Senator Gordon Smith has introduced an \n     amendment for consideration on the Senate floor that would \n     make the same bonus depreciation available for 3 years. \n     Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill made the following comment:\n       The short period of eligibility for new investment under \n     the base proposal would result in no stimulus to the kind of \n     job creating major projects that are fundamental to our \n     growing economy. Under the base proposal, a project begun \n     tomorrow must be completed by December 31 of this year to get \n     any benefit. Senator Gordon Smith is right to propose an \n     amendment extending the 30% bonus depreciation provisions to \n     3 years, so that more investment takes place and more jobs \n     are created. Senator Smith's amendment greatly enhances the \n     job creation that will be generated by the bonus depreciation \n     provisions under consideration in the Senate.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I want to do this in concert with \nthe majority. But I am asking for the yeas and nays and am anxious to \nknow at what point either Senator can get a vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are in the process of getting consent on \nthe Senator's matter and other matters for tomorrow. I think we will be \nable to work it out soon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank my friend from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Friday, \nJanuary 25--tomorrow--the time until 10:30 a.m. be equally divided and \ncontrolled for debate with respect to the Smith of Oregon amendment; \nthat at 10:30 a.m. the Senate vote in relation to the amendment, with \nno intervening amendment in order prior to the disposition of the Smith \namendment; further, that on Friday the next amendment be one offered by \nthe majority leader or his designee regarding unemployment insurance; \nthat following the presentation of that amendment, and a brief \nexplanation, the amendment be temporarily laid aside and that Senator \nBond or his designee offer the next Republican amendment regarding \nsmall business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, tomorrow a small bipartisan \ndelegation, of which I will be part, will go to Guantanamo, Cuba to see \nfor ourselves directly the questioning process in trying to elicit \ninformation from the detainees, the unlawful combatants, the prisoners, \nwhatever you want to call them.\n  I think in a lot of the commentary that has come out about this--and \nthis is one of the reasons I want to go; I want to see for myself how \nthese detainees are being kept and how the process goes about trying to \nelicit information from them--it seems what we call them and the \nquestion of humane treatment is certainly a legitimate question, but I \ncan't imagine, although I will see for myself tomorrow, that the United \nStates is not giving anything but humane treatment. That is the \ncharacter, that is the nature of our people. And certainly with as much \nattention on Guantanamo, it is certainly going to be the case of humane \ntreatment.\n  What I want to find out is, are we getting information? We are in a \nwar against terrorists. Many of these detainees are suspected to be \nsome of the most ruthless and lethal of the terrorists. Therefore, we \nneed to get as much information from them as we can in order to help \nprevent the kind of tragedies that this Nation went through on \nSeptember 11.\n  As we survey the situation--and I have been to Guantanamo Naval Base \nyears ago--I am quite interested to see how we are going about the \nprocess of eliciting this information from them.\n  Interestingly, there are a few other detainees in Guantanamo, not \nmany in number, but very important to us in this country. There are \neight Haitians detained for immigration reasons. There are 27 Cubans \ndetained because of the policies of administrations, both past and \npresent, that in enforcing the immigration laws do not allow anyone \nfrom a foreign land just to come to the United States; thus, \nintercepted on the high seas, be they Haitians or Cubans, certainly \nsmall in number but important in each of their cases.\n\n  In most of the cases of the Cuban detainees, 25 of the 27 have \nalready been interviewed and determined that they are eligible to go to \na third country. They do not want to return to Cuba. They are not \neligible to come to the United States--the process of finding a third \ncountry that will receive them. I want to see firsthand for myself and \ntalk to some of these people to see that each one of them, both the \nHaitian group and the Cuban group, have that personal attention. I will \nhave a followup with our staff to see that that process is carried on \nin an orderly and prompt fashion.\n  This trip tomorrow is a direct result of having just been with a \ndelegation of a total of nine of us into central Asia, including \nAfghanistan. What we saw there--and I gave a report to the Senate \nyesterday and I will not repeat it; it was an optimistic report \nreflecting the enthusiasm and the determination expressed in the faces \nof our young people, our young men and women in uniform serving our \ncountry in that part of the world and serving very successfully.\n  As a followup to that, at the end of that trip, it started occurring \nto a number of us, bipartisan, that we wanted to make this trip to \nGuantanamo.\n\n[[Page S93]]\n\n That is what we will do.

Mr. President, I rise today to support the Senate \nresolution honoring Dave Thomas, founder of the successful Wendy's \nrestaurants. His death is a loss to the business and entrepreneurial \nworld, the most powerful engine in the American economy. He opened \ndoors for thousands of young people who used Wendy's as entry-level \nemployment that launched their future. He was a symbol and shining \nexample of leadership that one could be proud to be associated with. \nBut this man was more than Wendy's. The sign that carried Wendy's logo \nstood for more than just tasty, square hamburgers. The little freckled-\nfaced girl represented much more.\n  I knew Dave through the Shrine of North America. As a Shriner, he \nexhibited his dedication to children across this country by supporting \nthe 22 Shriners Hospitals for Children and the three Shrine Burn \nCenters. He was a living example of the phrase, ``No man stands so tall \nthat stoops to help a kid.'' He had a passion for thousands of children \nwho are caught in the circumstance of adoption. He was an adopted child \nand he never forgot his roots or the wonder of parental love.\n  As an adopted child himself, Dave served as a credible spokesman for \nboth Republican and Democrat White House administrations on numerous \nadoption initiatives between 1990 and 2000. Using proceeds from two \nbooks and many speaking engagements, Dave founded the Dave Thomas \nFoundation for Adoption in 1992 to work with families wishing to adopt \nchildren. Dave also worked with national adoption agencies to raise \nawareness about children who are waiting for adoption. Dave went on to \ncreate the Dave Thomas Center for Adoption Law to facilitate the \nadoption process through education and research.\n  Dave was also a driving force in persuading corporate America to \nreshape their policies to help cover the adoption expenses of \nemployees. Thanks to his efforts, three out of four of the Fortune 1000 \ncompanies now offer adoption benefits to employees.\n  Yesterday was the anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark \ndecision in the Roe v. Wade case. As everyone knows, I support the \nrights of America's unborn. I recognize, however, that in today's \nsociety, unwanted pregnancies will continue to occur. Rather than \ntaking an innocent life, I urge Americans to embrace adoption as an \nalternative to abortion.\n  Dave never forgot his good fortune and he willingly gave his time and \nfinancial resources to make us, as Americans, aware of the less \nfortunate. All for a kid. We who know him are better for it. Thousands \nof kids find themselves in better circumstances because of him and the \npassion that lived deep in his heart. What a legacy.\n  Along with the sponsors of this resolution, I simply want to thank \nDave for making the world a better place for thousands of adopted \nchildren and also to send my sympathy to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/24/senate-section/article/S93-3", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S93]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             PROJECT ALPHA\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, during consideration of the Defense \nappropriations bill on Friday, December 7, my distinguished colleagues, \nthe chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator \nInouye, and Senator Harkin, a member of that subcommittee as well as \nthe chairman of the Agriculture committee, engaged in a colloquy \nregarding the George Washington University's, proposed Project Alpha. I \nsupport this unique effort to deal with potential terrorist threats to \nthe U.S. food supply. I have been working with GWU since May on this \nproject. In July, Iowa State University joined the consortium at my \nrequest. I want to point out that support for this very worthwhile \nprogram and requests for its expeditious implementation come from both \nsides of the aisle. I am glad that Iowa State University can contribute \nits expertise in this area as a major partner in this effort and that \nthe National Animal Disease Center will also be a key player.\n  An important component of the Project Alpha formula is its ``National \nDecision Assessment Immersion Center,'' to be located in existing \nfacilities at the Virginia Campus of the George Washington University \nand to serve as a model for replication by those wishing to pursue \nindividual variations of this new approach to complexity management in \nnational security.\n  As was pointed out in the December 7 colloquy, Project Alpha is a \nproactive approach to terrorist threats to U.S. national security, a \nconcept initiated and developed long before the tragic events of 9-11. \nIt utilize advanced technology in complexity-analysis techniques \ndesigned to help us both predict and prevent or ameliorate critical \nsituations before they can become real-world disasters. Project Alpha \ncombines sophisticated information-gathering and data-mining \nmethodologies with high-performance data analysis, professional-level \nsubject and issue expertise, decision support systems of proven \nefficacy, and state-of-the-art technology for communication and \ninformation dissemination.\n  Project Alpha offers the opportunity for exploration of the broadest \nrange of threat possibilities, available options and their effects and \nultimate consequences, especially those that would normally remain \nunforeseen and unpredicted. The program will allow rapid exploration of \na massive range of relationships and interactions that are beyond the \nability of our liner-reductions minds alone to follow or foresee. \nProject Alpha provides a mechanism for complexity consequence-\nprojection of far greater scope, magnitude and immediacy than has ever \nbefore been available. The crucial element that makes this possible is \nthe rapidly expanding supercomputing technology that has not yet been \nharnessed for this purpose. Through its use, Project Alpha can \nfacilitate direct encounters with the unexpected and the unintended in \norder that potential terrorist events may be anticipated and rendered \npreventable, manageable and unsurprising. The purpose of Project Alpha \nis to help use learn more what we don't know in ways that we might \nnever imagine, so that real-life catastrophes can be avoided. \nProtecting the U.S. food supply is high on the list of national \nsecurity priorities, and the application of Project Alpha to this \ncritical need can be of significant public benefit in dealing with the \nthreat of agroterrorism now and in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/24/senate-section/article/S93-4", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S93-S94]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE NEED FOR GUN LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, at end of the First Session of this \nCongress, as I have before, I urged my colleagues to debate and pass \nsensible gun safety legislation. Since that statement, we have seen \nthree separate incidences of gun violence in our Nation's schools. In \nNew York City, a teenager walked into a high school and seriously \nwounded two other students. In Grundy, VA, a man walked into a law \nschool and shot and killed three people. In Raymond, MS, a 17-year-old \nstudent who had just been suspended, returned to school and\n\n[[Page S94]]\n\nheld the principal and assistant principal hostage at gunpoint for \nnearly three hours.\n  These are not simply isolated events. According to the Children's \nDefense Fund Study of 2001 gun violence data, 3,365 children and teens \nwere killed by gunfire in the United States last year, which is one \nchild every 2\\1/2\\ hours. And, every year, four to five times as many \nchildren and teens suffer from non-fatal firearm injuries. The safety \nof our children and communities are at stake and access to guns is a \nmajor reason why. As we begin a new session of Congress, I once again \nurge the Senate to close the gun show loophole, prevent children from \ngaining access to guns and provide law enforcement the tools they need \nto investigate gun-related crimes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/24/senate-section/article/S94-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S94-S95]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BELARUS--OPPORTUNITIES SQUANDERED\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, periodically, I have addressed my \ncolleagues in the United States Senate on developments in the last \ndictatorship in Europe Belarus. More the 5 months have passed since the \nSeptember 9, 2001 Belarusian Presidential elections, which the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well at \nthe Helsinki Commission, which I chair, concluded did not meet \ninternational democratic standards. Since that time, the Belarusian \nleadership has had ample opportunity to begin to live up to its freely-\nundertaken OSCE human rights and democracy commitments. Thus far, these \nopportunities have been squandered. As Secretary of State Powell \nremarked in his speech at the December 2001 meeting of OSCE Ministers \nin Bucharest:\n  The Government of Belarus ignored the recommendations of the OSCE on \nwhat conditions would need to be established in order for free and fair \nelections to take place. It is unfortunate, indeed, that the government \nof Belarus continues to act in a manner that excludes Belarus from the \nmainstream of European political life.\n  Since September, human rights violations have continued. There has \nbeen no progress with respect to resolving the cases of opposition \nleaders and journalists who ``disappeared'' in 1999--2000. Belarusian \nleader Aleksandr Lukashenka has retaliated against opposition members, \nindependent journalists, human rights activists and others, especially \nyoung people. Beatings, detentions, fines and other forms of pressure \nhave continued unabated. To cite just one example, two defendants in a \ncriminal case against Alexander Chygir, son of leading Lukashenka \nopponent and former Prime Minister, Mikhail Chygir, were reportedly \nbeaten and otherwise maltreated during pre-trial detention. Criminal \ncases have been launched against journalists and NGOs as well. A number \nof leading industrialists have been arrested on what some observers \nbelieve are politically motivated charges.\n  Freedom of religion is also an area of concern. The registration \nscheme, required for a group to obtain full legal rights, is the \nultimate ``Catch-22.'' Registration cannot be granted without a legal \naddress; a legal address cannot be obtained without registration. Even \nthe state controlled media is a concern for religious freedom, due to \nthe highly critical reports in newspapers and television about the \nCatholic Church and Protestant churches. Very recently, the regular \nbroadcast on national radio of a Miensk Catholic mass was unexpectedly \nhalted.\n  Efforts to promote human rights and expand support and develop civil \nsociety in Belarus are being thwarted. The Belarusian Government has \nthreatened the OSCE Mission in Miensk with what amounts to expulsion \nunless the mandate of the Mission is changed more to its liking and has \nshown reluctance to accept a new Head of Mission. It is vital that the \nOSCE be allowed to continue its important work in developing genuine \ndemocratic institutions and a strong civil society in Belarus.\n  I am also deeply troubled by allegations that Belarus has been acting \nas a supplier of lethal military equipment to Islamic terrorists, a \ncharge that the Belrausian Government has denied. The troubling \nallegations contained in this article are a reminder of the importance \nof remaining steadfast in supporting democracy, human rights and the \nrule of law in Belarus. The lack of functioning democratic \ninstitutions, including an independent parliament, together with \nsuppression of free media contribute to an environment void of \naccountability. Writing off Belarus as a backwater in the heart of \nEurope would play into the hands of the Lukashenka regime with \ndisastrous consequences not only for the Belarusian people. It is more \nimportant than ever for the OSCE to maintain a strong presence on the \nground in Belarus and for the United States to continue to support \ndemocratic development in that country.\n  I ask unaminous consent that the Washington Post article ``Europe's \nArmory for Terrorism be printed in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 3, 2002]\n\n                     Europe's Armory for Terrorism\n\n                            (By Mark Lenzi)\n\n       The country in Europe that deserves the most attention for \n     its support of terrorist groups and rogue states continues to \n     receive the least. That is the lawless and undemocratic \n     country of Belarus, under the rule of Alexander Lukashenko.\n       Without a doubt no world leader benefitted more from the \n     September terror attacks than Lukashenko, Europe's last \n     dictator, whose ultimate wish is to reunite the Soviet Union. \n     Just as world scrutiny and condemnation were beginning to \n     mount after his rigged and falsified presidential election of \n     Sept. 9 the tragic events two days later took Washington's \n     quick glance away from this little-known and backward \n     country.\n       Washington needs to wake up to what is happening in NATO's \n     backyard: Belarus is quietly acting as a leading supplier of \n     lethal military equipment to Islamic radicals--with \n     terrorists and militant organizations in the Middle East, \n     Balkans and Central Asia often the recipients.\n       In 1994, Lukashenko's first year as president, Belarus sold \n     machine guns and armored vehicles to Tajikistan. This \n     equipment quickly made its way into the hands of warring \n     factions in neighboring Afghanistan, as well as Islamic \n     freedom fighters aiming to overthrow the government in \n     Tajikistan itself--ironically the same country where Belaru's \n     big brother, Russia, has thousands of soldiers stationed to \n     protect Central Asia and Russia from Islamic destabilization.\n       Many of Lukashenko's arms deals have followed a similar \n     pattern: Weapons sent from Belarus are ``diverted'' from a \n     listed destination country to an Islamic extremist group or a \n     country under U.N. arms embargo while Belarusian government \n     officials cast a blind eye on the transactions.\n       While it is deplorable that Belarus's weapons have been \n     responsible for prolonging civil wars and internal strife in \n     countries such as Tajikistan, Angola and Algeria, it is \n     particularly disturbing that Sudan, a country where Osama bin \n     Laden used to live and one that is known as a haven for \n     terrorists, has obtained from Belarus such proven and capable \n     weapon systems as T-55 tanks and Mi-24 Hind Helicopter \n     gunships. Weapons sent from Belarus to Sudan either fall into \n     the hands of terrorists or are used in a civil war that has \n     already killed more than 2 million people.\n       Lukashenko's efforts to sell weapons to generate much-\n     needed income for his beleaguered economy appear to have no \n     bounds. For a country of only 10 million people, it is \n     unsettling that Belarus is ranked year after year among the \n     top 10 weapons-exporting countries. To put in perspective how \n     much military equipment left over from the Soviet Union \n     Lukashenko has at his disposal, consider the following fact: \n     The Belarusian army has 1,700 T-72 battle tanks. Poland, a \n     new NATO member with the most powerful army in Central Europe \n     and with four times the population of Belarus, has only 900 \n     T-72s.\n       Despite strong denials from Lukashenko, Belarus has been a \n     key partner of Saddam Hussein in his effort to rebuild and \n     modernize Iraq's air defense capability. Belarus has violated \n     international law by secretly supplying Baghdad with SA-3 \n     antiaircraft missile components as well as technicians. Given \n     that Iraq has repeatedly tried to shoot down U.S. and British \n     aircraft patrolling the U.N. no-fly zone--with more than 420 \n     attempts this year alone--covert Belarusian-Iraqi military \n     cooperation is disturbing and should set off alarm bells in \n     Western capitals.\n       Former Belarusian defense minister Pavel Kozlovski, \n     obviously someone with firsthand knowledge of Minsk's covert \n     arms deals, recently summed up Belarus's cooperation with \n     Iraq and other rogue states by saying, ``I know that the \n     Belarusian government does not have moral principles and can \n     sell weapons to those countries [such as Iraq] where \n     embargoes exist. This is the criminal policy of Belarusian \n     leadership.''\n       In many ways, the mercurial and authoritarian Lukashenko \n     feels he has a free hand to sell arms to nations and groups \n     that are unfriendly to the West, because the European Union \n     and the United States do not recognize him as the legitimate \n     Belarusian head of state anyway. Threats of U.S.-led economic \n     sanctions or other diplomatic ``sticks'' against Belarus hold \n     little weight,\n\n[[Page S95]]\n\n     since the country is already isolated to a degree rivaled \n     only by a handful of other countries.\n       It is only thanks to cheap energy subsidies from Russia \n     that the Belarusian economy remains afloat. Since Russia is \n     the only country that has the necessary economic and \n     political influence on Belarus, it is imperative that \n     Washington use its new relationship with Moscow to encourage \n     the Russians to exert their leverage on Belarus to cease \n     covert arms sales to rogue states and terrorist groups.\n       In the Bush administration's worldwide effort to combat \n     terrorism, it should not overlook a little-known country \n     right on NATO's border.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/24/senate-section/article/S95-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S95-S96]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THREATS TO NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, for over 200 years, our Nation has championed \nideas and ideals that have placed us in harm's way. In certain parts of \nthe world, our actions have at times made us the object of ridicule. \nBut liberty, toleration, and the inalienable rights of the individual \nhave been our strength, and that strength is undimmed by criticism of \nthe United States. We stand legitimately for freedom; for us it is not \na mere word employed in presidential speeches or diplomatic exchanges. \nThe concept of ordered liberty has been the foundation of our national \nresolve, consecrated with the blood of our sons and daughters on many \nfields of battle across the world, and now, tragically, in the wreckage \nin New York, Pennsylvania, and the Pentagon.\n  I rise to call my colleagues' attention to a speech that the senior \nSenator from North Carolina delivered to the second annual Hillsdale \nCollege Churchill Dinner on December 5, 2001, which I will ask to be \nprinted in the Record. This speech is a remarkably good statement of \nour national character and our national purpose, drawing as it does \nupon a wealth of knowledge and experience second to none. We need to \nhear from statesmen like Jesse Helms at a time like this. In his \nHillsdale speech, he offers a powerful assessment of the state of \naffairs facing United States policy makers who must develop a strategy \nto combat forces that would seek to destroy us and our way of life.\n  As Senator Helms so ably explains, this is a task that we have faced \nbefore. Though the names and the faces and even the tactics of our \nadversaries change, the threat to us is the same. We must confront this \nthreat and we must defeat it. At the same time, Senator Helms \nadmonishes us to remain vigilant of those world powers that maintain \nhistoric practices of hostility toward us, powers that are \nstrengthening their war-making capacities, and that might well seek to \nlull us into a false sense of security as we pursue our campaign \nagainst the terrorist networks.\n  The good Senator provides us with a thought-provoking analysis that \nis sobering, but also hopeful. He urges us, at a time when the \ngeopolitical map of the world is in great flux, to remember and \nreaffirm, in all we do, the principles upon which America was founded. \nHe remarks on how well we are bearing up under the worst assault we've \nsustained since Pearl Harbor. ``They thought that their attacks would \nfrighten and divide us,'' writes Senator Helms. ``Instead, they have \ndrawn us closer to God, and to each other.''\n  I highly commend to my colleagues this Churchillian call to unity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Helms' speech be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From Imprimis, Jan. 2002]\n\n          Emerging Threats to United States National Security\n\n                     (By the Honorable Jesse Helms)\n\n       The following is an abridged version of Senator Helms' \n     speech at the second annual Hillsdale College Churchill \n     Dinner, held at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., on \n     December 5, 2001.\n       America is the only nation in history founded on an idea: \n     the proposition that all men are created equal, and are \n     endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights to life, \n     liberty and the pursuit of happiness. No other nation can \n     make such a claim. This is what makes us unique. It is why, \n     for more than two centuries, America has been a beacon of \n     liberty for all who aspire to live in freedom. It is also why \n     America was so brutally attacked on September 11.\n       The terrorists who struck the Pentagon and the World Trade \n     Towers despise what America stands for: freedom, religious \n     toleration and individual liberty. They hate the success with \n     which the American idea has spread around the world. And they \n     want to terrorize us into retreat and inaction, so that we \n     will be afraid to defend freedom abroad and live as free \n     people at home. They will not succeed.\n\n\n                      a revived sense of vigilance\n\n       The terrorists we fight today are not the first aggressors \n     of their kind to challenge us. Indeed, at this moment of \n     trial, it is altogether fitting that we gather to honor the \n     memory of Sir Winston Churchill, whose courage, conviction \n     and steely resolve led the Allies to victory over Fascism, \n     and who went on then to warn us about the danger of the \n     emerging Communist threat and the Iron Curtain then \n     descending across Europe. Today we face a new and different \n     enemy--one who hides in caves, and who strikes in new and \n     unexpected ways. Yet in a larger respect, this new enemy is \n     no different from the enemy Churchill faced 60 years ago. And \n     as shocking as September 11 was, it should have come as no \n     surprise that our nation was once again challenged by \n     aggressors bent on her destruction.\n       Jefferson warned that ``the price of liberty is eternal \n     vigilance.'' And since our founding, Jefferson has been \n     proven right, time and time again. New enemies have \n     constantly emerged to threaten us. The lesson of history is \n     that to secure our liberty, America must be constantly on \n     guard, preparing to defend our nation against tomorrow's \n     adversaries even as we vanquish the enemies of today.\n       Over the past decade, America let down her guard. With the \n     collapse of the Soviet Union, our leaders assumed that the \n     post-Cold War world would be one of unlimited peace and \n     prosperity, and that our greatest security challenges would \n     be invading Haiti, or stopping wars in places like Bosnia and \n     Kosovo. The Clinton people slashed our defense budget in \n     search of a ``peace dividend,'' while sending our forces all \n     over the world on a plethora of missions that drained \n     America's military readiness. They put off investments needed \n     to prepare for the real energing threats to U.S. national \n     security. Instead of focusing on new dangers, they spent \n     their time and energy forging ridiculous new treaties--like \n     the Kyoto Protocol and the International Criminal Court--\n     while fighting desperately to preserve antiquated ones, like \n     the ABM Treaty!\n       In light of America's new war, it is almost humorous to \n     look back on some of the foreign policy debates of the 1990s. \n     Can anyone imagine Kofi Annan today declaring as he did two \n     years ago, that the United Nations Security Council is the \n     ``sole source of legitimacy for the use of force in the \n     world''? Or former Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott \n     repeating his ridiculous assertion that all countries, ``no \n     matter how permanent or even scared [they] may seem,'' are in \n     fact ``artificial and temporary''?\n       ``Within the next hundred years,'' Talbott went on to say, \n     ``nationhood as we know it will be obsolete; all states will \n     recognize a single global authority.'' Let him tell that to \n     the policemen and firemen at the World Trade Towers. Let him \n     tell it to all the millions of Americans flying flags from \n     their homes and cars. Let him tell it to the thousands of \n     brave Americans in uniform, who at this very moment are \n     voluntarily risking their lives to defend our country.\n       In the wake of September 11, a measure of sanity has been \n     restored to debates over U.S. foreign policy. Awakened to new \n     dangers, our challenge is now twofold: First, we must win the \n     war on terrorism that took our nation by surprise. And \n     second, we must prepare now for the threats that could emerge \n     to surprise us in the decades ahead.\n\n\n                           Beyond Afghanistan\n\n       Thanks to the outstanding leadership of President Bush, the \n     Taliban is in retreat and Osama bin Laden is on the run. But \n     the war on terrorism is far from over. Indeed, one could \n     argue that the most difficult challenge comes now, as the \n     Afghan campaign moves from the taking of cities, to a \n     cave-by-cave hunt for bin Laden and his terrorist network. \n     Ripping that network out by its roots will be long, \n     difficult and dangerous work. Moreover, President Bush's \n     greatest challenge may come after the Afghan phase of the \n     war is over.\n       The bin Laden terrorist network operates in dozens of \n     countries. Nor is it the only one that threatens America and \n     her allies. Terrorist networks operate across the world, with \n     the support of dozens of states. President Bush has made \n     clear that this war will not end until every terrorist \n     network with global reach is decisively defeated. He has also \n     made clear that the United States will no longer tolerate \n     states that support or provide safe haven to these \n     terrorists. That means, I am convinced, that the war on \n     terrorism cannot and will not end until Saddam Hussein \n     suffers the same fate as the Taliban.\n       While we do not yet know that Saddam was directly involved \n     with the tragic events of September 11, there is a mountain \n     of evidence linking him to international terrorism generally, \n     and to bin Laden's terrorist network specifically. We know \n     for a fact that Saddam attempted to assassinate former \n     President Bush. We know with certainty that he has chemical \n     and biological agents, and is pursuing nuclear weapons. We \n     know for certain that, days before coming to the U.S., one of \n     the September 11 hijackers met with an Iraqi agent in \n     Prague--and that soon\n\n[[Page S96]]\n\n     after that meeting, this same bin Laden operative was in the \n     United States inquiring how one goes about renting a crop \n     duster. So the obvious next step in the war on terrorism is \n     the elimination of Saddam Hussein's tyrannical terrorist \n     regime.\n       Just as the United States teamed up with determined Afghans \n     who were ready, willing and able to overthrow the Taliban \n     with American support, there are Iraqis ready to overthrow \n     Saddam. But taking the war to Saddam will be no easy task. We \n     must accept the probability that many of the nations rallying \n     around us today will be nowhere to be found. Indeed, some are \n     likely to scream and yell and stomp their feet, demanding \n     ``evidence'' of Iraq's involvement in the September 11 \n     attacks. It is then that President Bush must patiently remind \n     them that the war on terrorism is a war against all \n     terrorists who threaten America, regardless of whether they \n     bombed the World Trade Towers, sought to murder a former \n     President of the United States, or threaten our people with \n     nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       We must proceed against Saddam with the same resolve with \n     which we have proceeded against the Taliban in Afghanistan. \n     Once the world sees two terrorist regimes in rubble, I \n     suspect that support for international terrorism will dry up \n     pretty quickly. Dictators will begin to understand that \n     waging a war by proxy against the United States carries \n     deadly consequences.\n       While we prosecute the war on terrorism to its logical \n     conclusion, we must, at the same time, begin preparing for \n     the next threats to America--threats which could be quite \n     different from those we face today. The next challenge we \n     face may come from a rogue state armed with ballistic \n     missiles capable of reaching New York or Los Angeles. It may \n     come from cyber-terrorists who seek to cripple our nation and \n     our economy by attacking our vital information networks. It \n     may come from a country that has developed small ``killer \n     satellites'' capable of attacking our space infrastructure, \n     on which both our defense and our economy depend. Or it may \n     come from a traditional state-on-state war, such as a Chinese \n     invasion of Taiwan. In any event, it is essential that we \n     begin preparing now for all of these possibilities, by \n     developing defenses against a wide range of asymmetric \n     threats.\n\n\n                  Distinguishing Friends From Enemies\n\n       We must also look realistically at who our potential \n     adversaries could be in the decades ahead. For example, \n     Communist China--a nation with no respect for human rights, \n     for religious freedom, or for the rule of law--remains both a \n     present and an emerging threat to the United States. Its \n     annual double-digit increases in military spending, its \n     virulent anti-American propaganda, and its aggressive arms \n     acquisitions are all very clear indications that China fully \n     intends to become a superpower--and, when it is able, to seek \n     regional hegemony in Asia and threaten our democratic friends \n     on Taiwan. Moreover, China has for years exported dangerous \n     missile technology to Pakistan--support that, according to \n     the Director of Central Intelligence, continues today \n     unabated. China has also supplied chemical weapons-related \n     equipment and technology to Iran. And earlier this year, U.S. \n     and British war planes had to destroy fiber-optic cables that \n     had been laid by Chinese firms in Iraq, as part of Saddam \n     Hussein's ever-improving air defense infrastructure.\n       Today, China is a thorn in our side. We must make sure \n     that, as China rises, it does not become a dagger at our \n     throat. Nor is China by any means the only nation that could \n     one day threaten us. Countries like Iran, Syria, Sudan, North \n     Korea and Cuba continue to provide aid, comfort and refuge to \n     terrorist elements that wish to harm the United States, and \n     several of them are seeking weapons of mass destruction and \n     the means to deliver them.\n       In times of war, the enemy of our enemy is often our \n     friend. During World War II, Churchill explained his wartime \n     alliance with Stalin this way: ``If Hitler invaded Hell,'' \n     Churchill said, ``I would make at least a favorable reference \n     to the Devil in the House of Commons.'' But let us not forget \n     what happened in the aftermath of World War II, when the \n     Soviet Union went from wartime ally to Cold War adversary. We \n     must be careful that, in our zeal to build the coalition \n     against terrorism, we do not mistakenly turn a blind eye to \n     the true nature of certain regimes whose long-term interests \n     and intentions remain contrary to ours.\n       Of course we must, and should, take the opportunity to \n     reach out to nations that are willing to step up and take \n     concrete steps to help us in the fight against terror. Not \n     for several generations has the geopolitical map of the world \n     been so much in flux, as a variety of countries decide how to \n     respond to the events of September 11 and to President Bush's \n     ultimatum that ``either you are with us or you are with the \n     terrorists.'' President Bush is certainly to be commended for \n     the rapid transformation of our relationship with Russia, \n     whose long-term interests clearly lie with the West. \n     President Putin seems to have seized September 11 as an \n     opportunity to align Russia more closely with the United \n     States, and he should be encouraged in this regard. But we \n     must proceed with care. For example: The idea of giving \n     Russia a decision-making role within NATO--including a veto \n     over certain Alliance decisions (as NATO Secretary General \n     Lord Robertson suggested the other day)--is absurd. Russia \n     still has much to prove before being given de facto \n     membership in the Atlantic Alliance.\n       We must make clear--as President Bush has made clear--that \n     we want closer cooperation with Russia and a new relationship \n     that puts Cold War animosities behind us. But in building \n     that relationship, we must stand firmly behind our intention \n     to build and deploy ballistic missile defenses. If the United \n     States and Russia are to establish a new strategic \n     relationship based on trust, cooperation, and mutual \n     interests, then Russia must recognize that such missile \n     defenses, in protecting the United States and our allies \n     from mutual adversaries, will enhance the security of both \n     nations in today's new and dangerous world.\n\n\n                     moral foundations of security\n\n       America is indeed the greatest nation on the face of the \n     earth, a beacon of freedom for the entire world. We have met \n     tremendous challenges to our freedom before September 11 and \n     defeated them. We will do so again. but in the long run, the \n     greatest emerging threat to America may not come from \n     without, but rather from within. As I have said often during \n     my years in public life, we will not long survive as a nation \n     unless and until we restore the moral and spiritual \n     principles that made America great in the first place.\n       On September 11, 4,000 innocent Americans were killed by a \n     foreign enemy. The American people responded with shock, \n     sadness, and a deep and righteous anger--and rightly so. Yet \n     let us not forget that every passing day in our country \n     almost 4,000 innocent Americans are killed at the hands of \n     so-called doctors, who rip those little ones from their \n     mothers' wombs. These are the most innocent Americans of \n     all--small, helpless, defenseless babies. For unborn \n     Americans, every day is September 11.\n       America was attacked by terrorists on September 11 because \n     of what America stands for--our dedication to life, liberty \n     and justice under God. As we defend those principles abroad, \n     let us also renew them here at home. As we go after the \n     terrorists who committed those unspeakable acts against our \n     people, let us, at the same time, get about the task of \n     restoring our nation's moral and spiritual foundations. No \n     matter how successfully we prosecute the war against \n     terrorism--no matter how brilliantly we prepare for the \n     threats of the future--we will never be truly secure if we do \n     not return to the principles on which America was founded, \n     and which made America great.\n       This is already taking place. In the wake of September 11, \n     flags are flying and church pews are overflowing. This great \n     patriotic and spiritual outpouring is proof that the \n     terrorists' plans have backfired. They thought that their \n     attacks would frighten and divide us; instead they have drawn \n     us closer to God--and to each other. We must encourage this \n     spiritual rebirth, and nurture it so that it becomes another \n     Great Awakening. We must instill in our young people an \n     understanding that theirs is a nation founded by Providence \n     to serve as a shining city on a hill--a light to the nations, \n     spreading the good news of God's gift of human freedom.\n       Thank you, God bless you, and, as Ronald Reagan always \n     said, God bless America!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/24/senate-section/article/S96-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S96-S97]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE RECENT ELECTIONS IN ZAMBIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express concern over the \noutcome of the presidential elections last month in Zambia. A number of \nAfrican states will hold important elections this year, the results of \nwhich could shape the governance and prosperity of the continent for \nyears to come. Unfortunately, several troubling aspects of the Zambian \nelections demonstrate the need for a more concerted international \neffort to demand democratic accountability and transparency in many \nAfrican states.\n  The Movement for Multiparty Democracy's candidate for President of \nZambia, Levy Mwanawasa, was inaugurated on January 2 as the new \nPresident, after claiming a very narrow victory in general elections \nheld on December 27. As the handpicked successor of outgoing president \nFrederick Chiluba, Mwanawasa approached the contest from an advantaged \ninstitutional position and ran against a divided opposition. But polls \nleading up to the election predicted that Anderson Mazoka, a prominent \nbusiness executive, would win, or that the race would at least be \nexceptionally close.\n  Unfortunately election monitoring reports from the Carter Center, the \nEuropean Union and national nongovernmental organizations suggest that \nthe balloting may have been marred by fraud. There are credible reports \nof tabulation irregularities and voter intimidation. Those reports \ncorroborate claims made by the opposition parties themselves. The \nCarter Center has issued a statement expressing serious concern over \nthe reports of irregularities in the tabulation process, although they \nhave not been able to\n\n[[Page S97]]\n\nverify those irregularities independently. At minimum, it seems clear \nthat the elections were characterized by highly troubling \ninconsistencies and exceptionally poor management.\n  Equal consideration must also be given to alarming pre-election \nreports. An assessment conducted by the Carter Center immediately prior \nto the voting concluded that some steps taken by Zambian authorities in \nthe pre-election period ``handicapped the opposition, created barriers \nto civil society participation and disenfranchised many voters.'' \nReports of intimidation and the misuse of state resources by government \nofficials undermined the credibility of the ruling party's campaign. At \nthe same time, the Carter Center estimated that only 2.6 million out of \nan eligible 4.6 million citizens were registered to vote. In part, this \nlow level of registration related to difficulties in obtaining national \nregistration cards. But prolonged uncertainty about the election date, \nfollowed by the selection of a date in the middle of the rainy season \nand during a common holiday travel period also complicated the \nadministration of the elections and lowered participation in certain \nregions. And the failure of President Chiluba to declare an official \nholiday on the date of the elections prevented some workers from \nwaiting in long lines that day to vote.\n  The mismanaged December elections have led to protests in Zambia, \nalthough it is a testament to the Zambian people's desire for a \ngenuinely democratic state, governed by the rule of law, that the \nprotests have not exploded into more destabilizing violence. Turning to \nthe courts, the opposition is expected to lodge a full appeal to the \nSupreme Court. The high court in Lusaka dismissed an earlier opposition \npetition, declaring that Zambian law required that such petitions be \nfiled after the winning candidate assumed office. But most legal \nprofessionals note that the judiciary remains weak and that it will be \nexceptionally difficult to overturn any election results now that the \nresults have been certified.\n  In the meantime, the United States and the rest of the international \ncommunity must work with the Zambian advocates of democracy as they \nseek credible political options that might resolve the current crisis. \nSome influential voices are calling for the creation of an independent \ncommission to review the election. That is one option that the United \nStates could support, particularly if the courts are unable or \nunwilling to resolve the dispute. But any attempt by the United States \nto help mediate the impasse must be transparent and must have as its \ngoal the inauguration of a Zambian government that responds to the \nwill, and the needs, of the Zambian electorate. And above all, the \nUnited States must stand firm in defending the right of the opposition \nto speak out, and to contest the election results through legal means. \nUnfortunately, in his first days after assuming the presidency, Mr. \nMwanawasa has demonstrated an ominous reluctance to tolerate opposition \npolitics, and he has publicly warned the opposition against taking any \nadditional steps to contest the results.\n  A peaceful and credible resolution to election disputes is essential. \nWithout the confidence of the Zambian people, the President of that \ncountry will find it difficult, if not impossible, to address the \ncountry's precipitous social decline, which has been nudged along by a \nworsening economic climate, widespread corruption and a massive HIV/\nAIDS epidemic in a country where the average income is only about one \ndollar a day. Once the election dispute is resolved, the United States \nwill have to work closely with the legitimate government of Zambia to \nhelp address this growing humanitarian crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/24/senate-section/article/S97-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S97-S98]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MICKEY MIANO\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with sorrow and \nprofound respect to honor the life of Michael ``Mickey'' Miano, a \nConnecticut institution and personal friend who passed away earlier \nthis month, just 2 months shy of his 96th birthday.\n  By trade, Mickey was a restaurateur and businessman, but that doesn't \nbegin to describe the depth of his influence on Connecticut's capital \ncity or the State that was his home. Anyone who wanted to understand \nHartford's social and political life in a glance needed only to visit \nMickey in his restaurant or in the office of one of the many other \nbusinesses he ran over the course of his life. He was a political \nleader without political office--a man who understood that communities \nare held together not by government but by the private citizens who \nlive, work, own homes, and raise their families in them.\n  Mickey came to this country from Italy at age 6 in 1912, left school \nafter the fifth grade to work in the tobacco fields, later joined the \nmerchant marines, and then went into business. His life's trajectory \nexemplified the rise of a whole generation of Italian-American \nimmigrants, and immigrants of every nationality throughout American \nhistory. The fact that Mickey had an uphill climb did not slow his \nascent one bit. By age 30, he was well on his way to being a force in \nConnecticut politics, earning it all through his hard work and the \npower of his personality. Mickey's place in the history of Connecticut \npolitics is secure. It was an attempt to secure that place that led me \nto include him in two books I wrote about Connecticut politics earlier \nin my own life.\n  And over the years that followed, as more people came to learn how \ngenerous he was in spirit and how committed he was to improving his \ncity and state, he grew more and more instrumental in Connecticut's \npolitical life, and my home State grew more and more indebted to him.\n  I was privileged to have Mickey as a friend. Despite many attempts to \ndraft him into official public service, Mickey never ran for political \noffice--perhaps because he understood that in America, there's no \ngreater honor or privilege than an active and caring private citizen. \nThat is what he was: a grassroots leader who cared about the common \ngood and got results. I know that his optimism and patriotism will \ncontinue to inspire all those who knew him as long as we live. I ask to \nprint the following tribute to his life by Tom Condon, another good guy \nwho also happens to write for the Hartford Courant, in the Record.\n  The tribute follows:\n\n               [From the Hartford Courant, Jan. 16, 2002]\n\n                        Mickey Miano Dies At 95\n\n\n           Restaurateur Helped Define An Era In City Politics\n\n                            (By Tom Condon)\n\n       Michael ``Mickey'' Miano, restaurateur, businessman and an \n     enduring figure in Hartford politics for much of the last \n     century, died last weekend, two months shy of his 96th \n     birthday.\n       Miano, street-savvy and stylishly stout, feisty and \n     flamboyant, got his start in politics at age 9, handing out \n     fliers for Woodrow Wilson in the 1916 election. He gained \n     local prominence in the rough-and-tumble world of East Side \n     politics in the 1930s.\n       He was part of the first generation of Italian American \n     politicians to gain power in the city, a group that included \n     such figures as Anthony Zazzaro, Rocco Pallotti, Joseph \n     Fauliso and Dominick DeLucco.\n       Miano declined many requests to run for office, preferring \n     the behind-the-scenes neighborhood and committee work where a \n     job, a favor or a remembered birthday translated into votes \n     and power. He was so good at it that even in his 80s, when \n     he'd lost a step and his influence had waned, politicians \n     still stopped at his memento-filled Franklin Avenue office to \n     pay homage. ``You don't want him against you,'' then-State \n     Rep. Anthony Palermino told a reporter.\n       He was a soft touch for a favor, but if a situation called \n     for a firm hand, Miano provided it. As a precinct moderator \n     in 1933, he twice settled disputes with his dukes. But he \n     could also be a diplomat.\n       His East Side restaurant, Mickey's Villanova, was the hot \n     spot for politicians and reporters in the World War II years. \n     Shortly after a bruising municipal election in 1943, heads of \n     the three factions that had been fighting it out all appeared \n     at Mickey's. Miano tactfully seated them in different corners \n     of the restaurant, and shuttled back and forth until each \n     group was buying drinks for the others.\n       Miano was born in Sicily and came to this country at age 6 \n     in 1912. He left school after the fifth grade to work in the \n     tobacco fields. After a stint in the merchant marine he came \n     back to Hartford and went into a remarkable number of \n     businesses in the next 70-plus years.\n       He sold wholesale grapes, drove a fruit wagon, brought the \n     circus to town, promoted fights, ran a nightclub and finally \n     got into the restaurant business. Mickey's Villanova, on \n     Market Street, was central to the political action in a way \n     that Frank's, Scoler's and Carbone's would later be. During \n     the war, Bob Steele, Willie Pep and others broadcast to \n     American troops from the restaurant.\n\n[[Page S98]]\n\n       The Constitution Plaza redevelopment project took away the \n     restaurant and the beloved East Side neighborhood, over \n     Miano's strenuous objection, but he persevered. He made salad \n     dressing, started a rubbish removal company and sold \n     incinerators.\n       In his last decades, he was in real estate and mortgages \n     from the Franklin Avenue office. He made no concession to \n     age, his son Paul Miano said, and was as hungry to do a deal \n     at 87 as he was at 17. ``The only way we got him to stop was \n     by closing the office when he went in for surgery. He was 88, \n     and we wanted him to take it easy.''\n       But Mickey came through the surgery, lost more than 100 \n     pounds and was raring to go again. During his last illness, \n     at 95, he'd say to Paul, ``When I get out of here, let's open \n     up a little office, just a couple days a week.''\n       His daughter, Michelle Bradley, said the family was never \n     more proud of her father than when U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman \n     was nominated for vice president. Lieberman mentioned Mickey \n     in both of his books about Connecticut politics. ``The Power \n     Broker'' and ``The Legacy.''\n       ``That a prospective vice president of the United States \n     would write about this man of humble origin is remarkable,'' \n     she said.\n       And, Paul said, his dad got a lot of mileage out of the \n     mentions. He was vacationing in Florida during the \n     campaign.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/24/senate-section/article/S98-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S98]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF JOHN T. CURRAN\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to offer my \nthanks and appreciation for the service of Mr. John T. Curran of \nIndianapolis who is retiring this month following a forty-year career \nthat included twenty-four years as the Meteorologist-in-Charge for the \nNational Weather Service, NWS, office in Indianapolis.\n  Throughout his illustrious career, Mr. Curran has played an essential \nrole in the agency's integration of computer technology and development \nof the sophisticated equipment that has revolutionized the way the \nUnited States performs the vital function of monitoring and predicting \nour nation's weather. Mr. Curran's career began in 1961 where he worked \nas a trainee at the Weather Bureau Airport Station in Omaha, NE, and \nlater as a severe local storms analyst and computer programmer. Mr. \nCurran's knowledge of, and experience with, the early computers and \nemerging technology made him an invaluable asset as the agency adopted \nnew and better ways to carry out its mission.\n  As the Meteorologist-in-Charge at the Indianapolis office, Mr. Curran \noversaw operations in Indiana during a time of dramatic change for the \nNWS. Integration of new technologies and the dramatic changes brought \nforth by National Implementation Plan required competent and steadfast \nleadership to ensure that Hoosier communities benefitted from these \nremarkable new developments.\n  Mr. Curran understood, however, that the people involved in this \nprocess were the backbone of the Weather Service. While the tremendous \nleaps in technology enable us to learn more about weather patterns \nbetter than ever before, it is the committed professionals at the \nagency that maintain its strength in providing this vital public \nservice. Mr. Curran's thoughtful management of the Indianapolis office \nhas helped ensure that this important federal responsibility is \nfulfilled for Indiana.\n  The work of the NWS is essential to our economy and to public safety \nthroughout Indiana. Accurate, reliable and helpful weather information \nis integral to our agricultural sector and to our transportation and \nmanufacturing industries in Indiana. State and local officials and \nunits of government rely on NWS alerts, warnings, and forecasts to \nprepare for and respond to emergency situations that occur in our \ncities, towns and neighborhoods.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \nspecial resource study to determine the national significance of the \nMiami Circle site in the State of Florida as well as the suitability \nand feasibility of its inclusion in the National Park System as part of \nBiscayne National Park, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the city of Miami is constantly changing. \nNew buildings and facilities are being built daily adding to the \ncosmopolitan and modern flavor of the city. However, while in the \nprocess of building for the future, Miami has found a piece of its \npast, the Miami Circle.\n  Discovered in 1998, the Miami Circle is 38 feet in diameter and has \nbeen carved into the underlying bedrock. While its true purpose is \nunknown, it is thought that the circle was used to support different \ntypes of structures. Along with the Circle, myriad other ancient \nartifacts have been found at the site, making it a treasure trove of \narchaeological artifacts and a window into the history of the area. The \ntrue origin of this site has yet to be determined but it is widely \nbelieved it was created by the Tequesta Indians.\n  This piece of Miami's heritage is also part of Florida's as well as \nthe Nation's. It is believed to be the only cut-in-rock prehistoric \nstructural footprint ever found in eastern North America. It is and \nwill be a valuable tool in understanding America's indigenous peoples, \ntheir culture, and their technological prowess. In fact, a recent \ndiscovery of a Tequesta burial grounds not far from the Miami Circle \nhas made the Miami Circle an even more significant historical site.\n  For these reasons, the site of the Miami Circle needs to be \npreserved. This legislation will set the preservation process in motion \nby authorizing a feasibility study to be conducted to determine if \nMiami Circle should be preserved as part of Biscayne National Park. \nThis important piece of America's heritage deserves the same protection \nthat other American archaeological treasures enjoy. This study will \nhelp make that happen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD:\n  S. 1895.

ENHANCED DISCLOSURES BY INVESTMENT ADVISERS.\n\n       The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80b-1 et \n     seq.) is amended by inserting after section 204A the \n     following:\n\n\n                 ``public disclosure of ties to issuers\n\n       ``Sec. 204B.

A bill to prohibit accounting firms from providing \nmanagement consulting services for the companies they audit and any \nother non-audit related services that could result in a potential \nconflict of interest or otherwise impair the independence of the \nauditor, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Auditor \nIndependence Act of 2002. The Act directs the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, SEC, to issue regulations prohibiting accounting firms from \nproviding management consulting services for the companies they audit \nand barring accounting firms from providing any\n\n[[Page S102]]\n\nother non-audit related services that could result in a potential \nconflict of interest.\n  Using the rule that former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt proposed in \n2000 as a model, my legislation removes the actual conflict of interest \nas well as the perception of a conflict of interest that results when \nan auditing firm provides a client with consulting and auditing \nservices.\n  The scandal resulting from the relationship between Enron and Arthur \nAndersen is only one example of the overdue need for this reform. In \nNovember 2001, Enron disclosed that it had overstated profits by more \nthan $580 million since 1997. That means that Enron lied to investors \nabout its earnings and the Arthur Andersen auditors failed to expose \nthat lie in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000. During each of those years, \nArthur Andersen worked as both auditor and consultant to Enron.\n  In 2000 alone, Enron paid Arthur Andersen $27 million for its audit \nwork and paid the firm $28 million in management consulting fees. In \nauditing Enron, Arthur Andersen clearly made a series of errors. It is \nreasonable to assume that Arthur Andersen's dependence on the \nconsulting fees that it charged Enron may have affected the quality of \ntheir audit work.\n  But the problem is not limited to Arthur Andersen. In a study \nanalyzing the effects of accounting firms' consulting business on the \nindependence of their auditors, Stanford professor Karen Nelson an her \ncolleagues provide evidence showing that the provision of non-audit \nservices impairs an auditor's independence.\n  The study used new data that has become available just since February \n2001, when the SEC began requiring corporations to disclose all audit \nand non-audit fees paid by a corporation to its auditor. The study \nlooked at the ratio of non-audit versus audit revenues paid by a \ncorporation to its auditing firm. It found that over half of the firms \npaid more for consulting services than audit services, and that over 95 \npercent of firms purchase at least some non-audit services from their \nauditor.\n  The study also found that corporations with the least independent \nauditors, those who paid the most in consulting fees versus audit fees, \nare more likely to just meet or beat earnings benchmarks, such as \nanalysts' expectations and prior year earnings expectations, and to \nreport large discretionary earnings. This suggests more ``earnings \nmanagement'', manipulation of debt and earnings data, went on among \ncompanies in the sample that paid the highest proportion of management \nconsulting fees to their auditors. We must remove this conflict of \ninterest from the accounting business.\n  Public confidence in the integrity of an accounting firm's audit will \ndepend now more than ever before on whether auditors are independent \nfrom the companies that they audit. Auditors clearly cannot be \nindependent from the companies they audit if they rely on those \ncompanies for lucrative consulting fees.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass \nthis bill quickly as a part of our larger legislative response to the \nEnron scandal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CARNAHAN (for herself and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 1897. A bill to require disclosure of the sale of securities by an \naffiliate of the issuer of the securities to be made available to the \nCommission and to the public in electronic form, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, America has the most vibrant and \ndynamic economy in the world. The foundation of our economy is our \ncapital markets, which are robust and resilient. But the success of \nthese markets depends on the free flow of accurate, reliable \ninformation. Our markets are the envy of the world, because of the \nconfidence investors have in the private and public institutions that \nproduce, verify, and analyze this information.\n  The collapse of Enron, represents a dramatic failure of these \ninstitutions. Even sophisticated investors did not detect that Enron \nwas in was in poor financial condition. We need to create greater \ntransparency and an early warning system so investors can better \nprotect themselves.\n  One warning sign that a company may be in trouble is when its \nexecutives are selling large amounts of company stock, as occurred at \nEnron. I have learned, however, that information about insider sales of \nstock is not easily accessible. Under our current system, a company's \nofficers are required to file a disclosure form with the Securities and \nExchange Commission, (SEC), any time they sell securities issued by \ntheir company. Tens of thousands of these forms are filed annually. \nHowever, the vast majority of these forms are filed on paper, rather \nthan electronically.\n  The paper disclosure forms are not easily accessible to the public. \nPeople can see the disclosure forms at the Public Reference Room of the \nSEC in Washington, DC. Alternatively, people can request in writing \nthat the SEC mail copies of the disclosure forms to them. Requests \nsubmitted in writing may take weeks to process. This is unacceptable in \nthe electronic age.\n  So today I am introducing legislation that requires information about \ninsider sales of publicly traded companies to be filed electronically \non the day of the sale. The Fully Informed Investor Act mandates that \ndisclosure forms required by the SEC be filed electronically whenever \nofficers, directors or other affiliates of the company sell shares of \ntheir company. The forms will be due at the SEC by the end of the day \nof the transaction. The SEC would then make the forms available to the \npublic over the Internet. In addition, any company that maintains an \ninternal company website would be required to post these disclosure \nforms on that website on the day of the transaction.\n  This single reform would dramatically level the playing field between \ninsiders and ordinary investors. Never again would company executives \nbe able to quietly dump large amounts of company stock without facing \nimmediate scrutiny about the financial health of their company.\n  As I said, our capital markets are the envy of the world.

Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution calling \nfor the creation of ``National Importance of Health Care Coverage \nMonth'' to call attention to the need for information about health care \ncoverage options. I am joined in this effort by Senator Collins of \nMaine.\n  A person's physical and mental well-being are fundamental to his or \nher ability to learn, to work, and to contribute to our society. For \nhealthy communities, the health of our citizens is vital. It is a fact \nthat people who have health insurance have better health; forty-four \nmillion Americans, however, do not enjoy the protection of health care \ncoverage. This resolution calls for the promotion of a multifaceted \neducational effort about the importance of health care coverage; to \nincrease awareness of the many health care coverage options already \navailable; and to inform those who are eligible for public insurance \nprograms on ways to access those programs.\n  This resolution alone will not provide insurance to the millions of \nAmericans who need it. However, it will draw much-needed attention to \nan issue that touches every citizen in every state.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Oregon in submitting this concurrent resolution expressing the \nsense of Congress that health care coverage is of the utmost importance \nand that a National Importance of Health Care Coverage Month should be \nestablished to promote awareness and education about the importance of \nhealth insurance coverage.\n  One of my top priorities in the Senate has been to expand access to \naffordable health care for all Americans. There still are far too many \nAmericans without health insurance. An estimated 42 million Americans \ndo not have health care coverage, including more than 150,000 people in \nMaine.\n  The simple fact is that people with health insurance are healthier \nthan those who are uninsured. People without health insurance are less \nlikely to seek care when they need it, and to forgo services such as \nperiodic check-ups and preventive services. As a consequence, they are \nmore likely to be hospitalized or require costly medical attention for \nconditions that could be preventable. Not only does this put the health \nof these individuals at greater risk, but it also puts additional \npressures on our hospitals and emergency rooms, which already are \nfinancially challenged. Compared with people who have health coverage, \nuninsured adults are four times and uninsured children five times more \nlikely to use the emergency room. The costs of care for these \nindividuals are often absorbed by providers and passed on to the \ncovered population through increased fees and insurance premiums.\n  This is one of the reasons that the cost of health insurance has \nsoared in recent years. In Maine, employers, and in particular small \nemployers, have faced premium increases of 15 to 30 percent or more. \nThis is a remarkable contrast to the mid-to-late1990s, when health \ninsurance premiums rose less than 3 percent, if at all. Clearly we must \ndo more to make health insurance more available and affordable.\n  Since most Americans get their health insurance through the \nworkplace, it is a common assumption that people without health \ninsurance are unemployed. The fact is, however, that most uninsured \nAmericans are members of families with at least one full-time worker. \nAs many as 82 percent of Americans who do not have health insurance are \nin a family with a worker.\n  In Maine, small business is not just a segment of the economy, it is \nthe economy. I am therefore particularly concerned that uninsured, \nworking Americans are most often employees of small businesses. Some 60 \npercent of uninsured workers are employed by small firms. Small \nbusinesses want to provide health insurance for their employees, but \nthe cost is often just too high. This is why I have introduced \nlegislation with my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, to help \nsmall employers cope with rising costs. Our bill, the Access to \nAffordable Health Care Act, will provide new tax credits for small \nbusinesses to help make health insurance more affordable. It will \nencourage those small businesses that do not currently offer health \ninsurance to do and will help businesses that do offer insurance to \ncontinue coverage even in the face of rising costs.\n  While costs are clearly an problem, knowledge should not be an \nadditional barrier to health insurance access. Public education and \nawareness initiatives are also critical to the success of\n\n[[Page S104]]\n\nour efforts to expand health coverage. Many small employers are not \nfully aware of the laws that have already been enacted by both States \nand the Federal Government to make this benefit more affordable. For \nexample, in one recent survey, 57 percent of small employers did not \nknow that they can deduct 100 percent of their health insurance \npremiums as a business expense. More than 60 percent did not know that \ninsurers may not deny them health coverage even when the health status \nof their workers is poor. Small businesses clearly need better \ninformation about health insurance, which is why public awareness, \noutreach and education programs like the one this resolution is \npromoting are so important.\n\n  The same is true for our public programs. One of the first bills I \ncosponsored as a Senator was legislation to establish the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, which provides insurance for the \nchildren of low-income parents who cannot afford health insurance, yet \nmake too much money to qualify for Medicaid. This important program now \nprovides affordable health insurance coverage to over two million \nchildren nationwide, including over 10,000 in Maine's Cub Care and \nexpanded Medicaid program. Even so, hundreds of thousands of qualified \nchildren nationwide have yet to be enrolled in this program, many \nbecause their parents simply don't know that they are eligible for the \nassistance.\n  The resolution we are submitting today is simple. It expresses the \nsense of Congress that a National Importance of Health Care Coverage \nMonth be established to promote a comprehensive educational effort \nabout the importance of health care coverage; increase awareness of the \navailable health care coverage options; and inform those eligible for \npublic insurance programs about ways to access those programs. The \nresolution further calls on the President to issue a proclamation \ncalling on the federal government, States, local governments and \nbusinesses in the United States to conduct appropriate programs and \nactivities to promote this educational effort.\n  The resolution we are submitting today will assist in our efforts to \nexpand access to affordable health care by helping small businesses, \nfamilies and uninsured individuals learn more about health insurance \nand the various options which may already be available to them, and I \nurge all of our colleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/24/senate-section/article/S104-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2699.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto S. Res. 201 introduced earlier today by Senators Nelson of Florida \nand Graham of Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 201) commending the University of \n     Miami Hurricanes football team for winning the 2001 NCAA \n     division I-A collegiate football national championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to note the \naccomplishment of the University of Miami Hurricanes football team, who \non January 3, 2002 won the NCAA Division I-A football championship, \ndefeating the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers in the 88th Rose Bowl \ngame.\n  It was an exciting and memorable game, pitting two of college \nfootball's elite programs in the ``Granddaddy of Them All''. \nUltimately, the Hurricanes won 37-14, capping an extraordinary season \nwith their 5th national championship all since 1983.\n  Along with students, alumni and fans from across the country, the \nState of Florida has become accustomed to great teams and a rich \nhistory of collegiate football success. While the future of Florida \nfootball is sure to yield many more great teams and great battles, \ntoday I want to congratulate the University of Miami for their latest \ntriumph, which truly was a team effort.\n  Led by Consensus All-Americans Bryant McKinnie and Edward Reed, as \nwell as Joaquin Gonzalez who was named the nation's top college \nfootball scholar-athlete, the Hurricanes showed that individual \nachievement, well-rounded student leadership and team spirit add up to \nsuccess both on and off the field.\n  Head Coach Larry Coker has much to be proud of, molding this team \ninto national champions and becoming the first rookie coach to do so \nsince 1948. For his efforts, dedication and success, he was awarded the \nBear Bryant Award as the college football Coach of the Year.\n  The University of Miami program is a meaningful example for all \nAmericans of determination, perseverance and excellence, and I want to \nextend my appreciation to every member of this team that contributed to \nthe Hurricanes' victory.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full roster of this championship \nteam, and their first-rate coaching staff be printed in the Record. \nThey have made us very proud.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               University of Miami Hurricanes Team Roster\n\n       1.
