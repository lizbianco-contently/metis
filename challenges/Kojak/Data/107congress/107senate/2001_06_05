Mr. President, it is likely that soon the Senate will \nundergo a historic change in leadership. I am concerned about some news \nreports that the new Democratic leadership may not proceed forthwith to \nthe consideration of an energy bill that the administration very much \nwould like to see us consider. It is my understanding that, at least \nfrom news reports, there are some other priorities the new Democratic \nleadership will probably pursue.\n  I just want to make it as clear as I can I think we should, as soon \nas possible, consider the legislative recommendations of President Bush \nand Vice President Cheney to deal with this most serious crisis. In \nfact, I think we saw this past weekend that the President thought it \nwas important enough to travel to California to visit with Governor \nDavis, who has certainly expressed his views on the importance of the \nissues facing his State. And his is not the only State that has faced \nthis energy crisis.\n\n[[Page S5806]]\n\n  There are a couple of statistics worth noting in this regard. Our \nenergy demands are growing very rapidly while our production side is \nrelatively stagnant. Oil consumption, for example, will grow by over 6 \nmillion barrels per day over the next 20 years, but oil production is \nexpected to decline by 1.5 million barrels per day. Natural gas \nconsumption will grow by over 50 percent over the next 20 years, but \nproduction will only grow by 14 percent. And electricity demand, which \nis especially of concern on the west coast and in my region of the \ncountry, will rise by 45 percent over the next 20 years. This will \nrequire 1,300 to 1,900 new power plants. So we have a big job ahead of \nus. I think we need to get on with some of the solutions as soon as \npossible.\n  There has been some criticism that the President's recommendations \nare primarily longer term solutions. We will make them even longer term \nthe longer we take to get to them. We will have shorter range solutions \nthe quicker we get to the legislation that is required.\n  I note that many of the recommendations from the commission the Vice \nPresident headed are recommendations that can be effectuated by the \nadministration itself. Twelve can be implemented by Executive action; \nseventy-three are directives to Federal agencies. For example, the \nPresident has already directed Federal entities to reduce consumption \nby 10 percent, including the military. But there are some 20 \nrecommendations for action by the Congress. These are among the things \non which we need to get moving:\n  The plan of the President to modernize and increase conservation, to \ndiversify energy supply, and modify and expand the infrastructure \nthrough which those sources of energy are delivered to the American \npeople, and to strengthen our energy security. This is the core of the \nset of recommendations.\n  Without getting into all of the details, because I only have 5 \nminutes this morning, let me just say that one of the things that has \nbeen proposed is price caps. Price caps, as the President and Vice \nPresident have said, are exactly the wrong thing to do. Price caps \nwould keep demand increasing and do nothing to enhance supply. In fact, \nit would tend to keep supply down because there is nothing for the \ninvestor to look forward to if there is a price cap on how much can be \ncharged for the energy that is being produced. And, of course, there is \nno incentive to conserve if there is a price cap. If prices, on the \nother hand, are allowed to rise, as they do with gasoline, then people \nwill be more careful about how much they use.\n\n  We have seen news reports of people cutting back a little bit on the \ndriving they intend to do this summer. Why? Because there are no price \ncaps on the price of gasoline. People understand that to save money \nthey are going to have to drive less; they are going to have to \nconserve.\n  So I do not understand why, on the one hand, we have this drumbeat of \ncomment that we have to conserve our way out of this problem--certainly \nconservation is an element but not the sole element--and yet, on the \nother hand, to put in place price caps, which would have exactly the \nopposite incentive--for people not to conserve but to go ahead and \ncontinue to use those electricity supplies. So I think price caps are \nnot the answer. There are other elements of the bill that are.\n  Finally, a point about some of the criticism of the Vice President \nand the President. I hope our colleagues will not join in this kind of \ndemagogy that we have seen from outside the Senate. It is true that \nboth the President and the Vice President have been in the business of \nproducing petroleum products. I do not know why we would be critical of \npeople who know something about the solution coming up with some good \nideas. They are, after all, our top two elected leaders. They know \nsomething about the problem and its solutions, and neither of them can \nany longer directly benefit.\n  So I think this criticism that they know something about the problem \nand therefore they should not be involved in the solution is very \nmisdirected.\n  I hope we can focus on solutions rather than ad hominem attacks. \nAfter all, there are two kinds of people in the United States: There \nare producers and consumers. Almost all of us are consumers, and we \nshould be grateful for those who are the producers because they are the \nones who make it possible for us to enjoy our great standard of living. \nThey would not be producing if we did not provide the demand for that \nproduction. It is the consumers of the country who, in effect, are \ncreating the opportunity for these people to do the demanding.\n  Some of these critics remind me of kids who think that food comes \nfrom the refrigerator or the grocery store.\n  Obviously, they are unaware of all the work the farmers and the \npeople in between the farmers and the grocery store put in to make \nthose food supplies available. We should not be talking in terms of \ncriticizing the people who are coming up with the solutions simply \nbecause they happen to know something about it. I suggest that the new \nleadership of the Senate, as soon as they possibly can, bring the \nlegislation forward in whatever form because we will all have an \nopportunity to propose amendments if we don't like its original form.\n  This is very near a crisis; if it is not a crisis. We have to get on \nwith the solutions. The administration has led the way by its executive \ndirectives. It has done all it can do. Now it is time for the Congress \nto respond. I urge the new leadership of the Senate to join with the \nadministration in a bipartisan effort to begin to consider the solution \nto our energy problem.\n  The ACTING PRESIDING pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the junior Senator from \nArizona, I don't know where he heard that the new Democratic leadership \nwas not going to move forward on energy. We are most happy to move \nforward on energy.\n  There are all kinds of problems, as the Senator knows. The President \nhas an energy program he has put forward. There are not many specifics \nwith it, but we should move forward and pass those issues on which we \nagree. Those issues on which we disagree, we can debate and vote up or \ndown.\n  The Senator has said what we believe is important. We have to start \napproaching some of these problems in a bipartisan fashion. We hope \nthat can be done on energy.\n  There is no question that there is a lot of dialog about energy and, \nof course, there are all kinds of things being said, such as ``the GOP, \ngas, oil and plutonium.'' I don't think that gets us anyplace.\n  There has been a lot of bad news from California, but today there was \nsome good news. The good news is that in California they have already \nfound a way to conserve up to 11 percent of the electricity that they \nwere using. That is significant.\n  When Vice President Cheney said that conservation was a good personal \nhabit but it wouldn't do anything to solve the energy crisis, I don't \nthink he really believes that. It may not have come out the way he \nwanted it. We know there has to be conservation along with anything we \ndo to stimulate production.\n  One of the criticisms I have--and I think it is a valid criticism--\nwith this administration, I serve on the Energy and Water Development \nSubcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations. We found in the budget \nthe President gave us, there is almost a 40-percent cut in research and \ndevelopment for renewables. That is something we need to change. We can \ndo that.\n\n  In those States in the West--the Senator from Arizona has a State \nquite similar to Nevada--there are a lot of things that can be done--\nagain, not in the short term bit in the long term--dealing with solar, \ndealing with wind, and, in the case of Nevada, with geothermal. These \nare some of the things on which we need to work. Most importantly, we \nhave to work together on this problem.\n  Senator Dorgan and I have sponsored legislation--in fact, there is an \namendment on the education bill, and we also have freestanding \nlegislation--that would cause a joint committee of the House and Senate \nto be appointed to determine why prices have gone up. Maybe there is a \ngood reason they have gone up. I don't think we should have a witch-\nhunt. I think it should be an investigation conducted with dignity so \nthe American people could at least say, after we finish, we have done \neverything we can to find out why the prices are so high.\n\n[[Page S5807]]\n\n  For example, the Senator and I remember when the price of fuel was so \nhigh in the early 1970s. You went to gas stations then and there was no \ngas. You would wait in line. You would get to the pump and there would \nbe no gas to buy. We don't have that problem now. It doesn't appear to \nbe a problem of supply. Then why are the prices so high?\n  I hope the Senator from Arizona will look at the legislation the \nSenator from North Dakota and I are sponsoring dealing with why are the \nprices so high.\n  In short, there has certainly been nothing said by any part of the \nDemocratic leadership in the Senate that we were not going to take a \nlook at energy. It is an issue we need to address; we need to do it as \nsoon as we can; and we need to do it in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a quick comment?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate the comments of the Senator. I look forward to \nworking with him in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I had heard the comments that the Republican leadership was going to \ntake the energy bill up right after the education bill. My \nunderstanding is the Democratic leadership intends to take that up at a \nsubsequent date. I think the Patients' Bill of Rights may be the next \nitem taken up. That was the nature of my concern.\n  As soon as possible, I hope it will be considered. I certainly look \nforward to working with the Senator from Nevada to find solutions to \nthe problem.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDING pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I seek recognition in morning business to \nfollow up on the issue raised by the Senator from Nevada. I can't think \nof a bigger issue in terms of the people I represent in the State of \nIllinois.\n  A lot of families in Illinois who rely on natural gas to heat their \nhomes saw dramatic increases in their heating bills this past winter. \nFamilies of very modest means who budgeted very carefully found their \nheating bills for last winter were $1,000 to $1,500 higher than they \nhad been in the previous year. Very little explanation was forthcoming. \nA lot of families just had no choice. They turned down the thermostat \nand the bills still went through the roof.\n  I ran into a lady who was a domestic housekeeper in a hotel. She \nworked nights for her family. She said to me that she had budgeted the \nsame amount as last year to heat her home in Chicago. She ended up \n$1,000 in debt when it was all over. She is determined to pay off that \ndebt. She is a very hard working person and takes her debts seriously. \nWhen you think about that, you just wonder, is this inevitable? Is this \nthe market at work, where we have such wide variations?\n  I have read a lot--I am sure the Senator from Nevada has as well--\nabout the energy problem in the West--California and other States--\nwhere they have seen dramatic increases in utility bills, electric \nbills.\n  The other issue the Senator from Nevada alluded to touches close to \nhome in the Midwest. Last year we had this terrific increase in the \nprice of gasoline. It seemed the Easter holiday was the kickoff for a \nrunup in record-level gasoline prices. Last year we asked the oil \ncompanies what happened. Why did you do this? They said: We had this \nchange. We had this reformulated gas to reduce air pollution, and it \ncaught us by surprise. We were not ready for it.\n  It was kind of hard to understand because it had been more than 8 or \n10 years they knew this was coming. They weren't prepared for it. They \nsaid: We had pipeline breakdowns, refinery problems. They said: We are \nsorry that it happened.\n  It went on for about 6 or 8 weeks. People were paying over $2 a \ngallon for gasoline primarily in the upper Midwest but in St. Louis as \nwell. Then the price started coming back down.\n  Lo and behold, this year exactly the same thing occurred. At Easter \nit was as though there was another starter's gun, and gasoline prices \nwent through the roof again.\n  What is odd about it is that the oil companies are seeing no dramatic \nincrease in the price of crude oil. The defenders of the oil companies \ntell us this is just the market at work. But if you take a look at some \nof the elements in that market, you can raise some serious questions.\n  For example, if the price of crude oil is not going up, why is the \nprice of gasoline going up dramatically? Secondly, if this is just a \nreflection of some problems within the industry, why is it that the oil \ncompanies are now experiencing the highest profits in current memory? \nThis is one of the few businesses in the world where you can guess \nwrong about consumer demand and make more profit. That seems to be what \nis happening to us in the Midwest.\n  I am encouraged by the announcement of our colleague, Senator Levin \nof Michigan, who has said that once the leadership change takes place \nin the Senate, as chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations of the Committee on Government Affairs, he would hold a \nhearing and ask, once and for all, what is behind this; why are \nfamilies and small businesses faced with these high energy costs that \nseem to spike out of control, whether it is for the heating bill in \nyour home or for the gasoline in your car? What is it about this market \nmechanism that you see all the stations in your city in lockstep going \nup in gasoline prices and coming down, trickling down ever so slowly in \nthat same fashion? This does not sound like competition to me; it \nsounds like something else is going on.\n\n  We have been unable in the last few weeks, despite these energy \nincreases, to really convince the White House or the Republican-\ncontrolled Congress to look into this issue, to investigate it. But if \nwe do not do this in Congress, who will?\n  Fortunately, Senator Levin of Michigan has announced he is going to \nmove forward with a series of investigations as soon as the leadership \nin the Senate changes. This concern about energy and its future has to \ntake into account problems that families and businesses are facing \ntoday.\n  It is true, we have medium- and long-term energy challenges. There \nare many issues we need to consider but, honestly, shouldn't we try to \naddress the current problems that people are facing and try to find \nsome relief? Senator Levin's call for this hearing is one I support; it \nis one in which I have joined with Senator Dorgan from North Dakota and \nothers in asking for previously. I hope we can move forward on this \nmatter.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I also support Senator Levin. Not only will he be chairman \nof that subcommittee but chairman of the Armed Services Committee. The \nArmed Services Committee has jurisdiction to find out why oil prices \nare going up so high anyway because the armed services are some of the \nworld's biggest consumers of oil products.\n  I said to the junior Senator from Arizona, in the seventies we had \nlong lines, and sometimes one got to the gas pump and there was no gas. \nThere was a shortage of supply. That is not the case now. That is why \nthe Senator from North Dakota and I have called for a joint \ninvestigation by the Congress to find out why these prices are priced \nthe way they are. The Senator from Illinois has gone through a number \nof problems that simply do not make sense.\n  The Senator has already said what the Senator from Michigan is doing \non his subcommittee, and it is important. But does the Senator think \nthis is one of the most important issues to face the American public \nthis decade or last decade or any decade and that a joint investigation \nis warranted?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I certainly do. And I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nhis leadership. I was happy to join him on this legislation. What \nreally frustrated many of us was the fact that Congress was unwilling \nto even look at the issue.\n  It is something to go back home, whether the home State is Illinois \nor Nevada, and find people who are telling you real-life stories, \ntragedies of businesses that have had to cut back in the number of \nemployees and the work they are doing, because of the cost of energy.\n  I am from a farming State. Illinois, of course, is proud of the fact \nthat it produces so much corn, soybeans, wheat, pork, and beef, but the \nfarmers with whom I have talked face the same thing. It is not just the \ncost of operating their businesses on the farm but\n\n[[Page S5808]]\n\nthe cost of fertilizer. All of this is directly linked to the cost of \nenergy.\n\n  We can explore and debate future energy policy, but we have to be \nvery honest in dealing with the reality of the challenge facing \nfamilies today. That is why I am hoping--and I hope the Senator from \nNevada agrees with me--that there can be an agreement very soon between \nthe Democrats and Republicans to reorganize this Senate and to move \nforward.\n  There are so many issues of importance to this Nation that need to be \naddressed and addressed quickly. We have before us the whole issue of \neducation. This bill was pending in the Senate before we took up the \ntax bill, and we will return to it. The sooner the Senate gets \norganized, the sooner we are in business under the new leadership of \nthe majority leader, Tom Daschle, the sooner we can return to issues of \neducation.\n  There has also been talk about issues involving a Patients' Bill of \nRights. That is something which I have supported. It means when your \ndoctor makes a decision for you and your good health, it will not be \noverruled by an insurance company. That seems pretty basic to me, but \nwe need to pass legislation to make sure the health insurance companies \nand the HMOs do not go too far and make these medical decisions.\n  Energy is another issue. We want to work with the President and the \nWhite House. We should go to that issue. We should work on it. There \nare some important issues to be resolved. One of them is whether or not \nwe should drill in Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This is a piece of \nreal estate in Alaska that is owned by the American people and which \nhas been set aside to be maintained as a wilderness.\n  There are not many places on Earth that are set aside and maintained \nas a wilderness. Many of us think, particularly in this fragile \necosystem in Alaska, with the wildlife that is there --some of it is \nvery rare, with species that are not found in other places--that for us \nto invade that territory to be drilling for oil and gas is to run the \nrisk that we might disturb that balance, and, once having done that, we \nmay face consequences which we cannot repair. The best of intentions of \nthe Congress and the President notwithstanding, Mother Nature and God \nhave decided how certain things will exist.\n  If we want to bring in the trucks and the pipelines and start \ndrilling away for oil and gas, we should stop and ask the hard \nquestion: Is this really our best alternative to find fuel for \nAmerica's future?\n  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, it is estimated, has 180 days' \nworth of energy for the United States. Mr. President, 180 days is, of \ncourse, almost 6 months, but that represents energy that is taken out \nof Alaska over a 10-year period. It means a very small part of our \nenergy picture.\n  Even with drilling in this wilderness and running the risk of \ndisturbing this ecosystem forever, we are still going to find ourselves \ndependent more than 50 percent on foreign oil and energy to sustain the \nUnited States. Many of us think that before we start drilling in \nwilderness areas such as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we should \nexplore alternatives, including conservation.\n  I see another Senator on the floor.

Mr. President, I want to talk about the direction the \nSenate has been taking. Certainly, we have many things to do. We have \nmoved through a number of important issues --the budget and meaningful \ntax relief. We now move to education and energy.\n  I have to respond to the comments of the Senator from Illinois on \nenergy and suggest this energy crisis did not just happen in the last 5 \nmonths. It is interesting to note that for the past 8 years we have not \nhad an energy policy. We have let ourselves get into a position where \nwe are totally dependent on OPEC and foreign production, and it has put \nus in this position.\n  It is also interesting to note that it may not always be a shortage \nof oil but that refining may have something to do with it. We have not \nbuilt any new refineries over the last number of years, and the idea of \naccusing someone of causing the problem--we need to take a look at it.\n  We have many things to do, there is no question, but we need to deal \nwith domestic production and we need to deal with the transportation of \nenergy. We in Wyoming could produce energy for California if we had a \nway to get it there. We need refineries to refine gasoline. We need to \nget away from having to develop 15 types of gasoline. It is easy to get \naway from the facts and get off into blaming somebody for this \nbehavior.\n  The Senate needs to move on to education. It has been on this issue \nfor quite a long time. It has not moved. We have had a certain amount \nof obstruction. When there are still 300 amendments, it is a little \nhard to talk about wanting to move forward, but perhaps we will be able \nto do that.\n  I hope when we do, we take a long look at where we want to be in \neducation. Too often, we get so involved with little issues that are \neither political or they have to do with one minute thing. The fact is, \nwe do not have a clear vision of what the role of the Federal \nGovernment is in education, and we need to define that role.\n  In elementary and secondary education, the Federal Government \nprovides about 7 percent of the funding. Why should they also provide \nall the rules and regulations that go with it? That has been the \nposition many have taken: If we are going to give them any money, then \nwe have to tell them how to do it.\n  One of the arguments, of course, is how do we help support education, \nhave a policy on education, but allow the differences that exist in the \nlocal education facilities.\n  What is needed in Chugwater, WY, is different from what is needed in \nPittsburgh, PA. We have to allow flexibility for local school boards \nand States.\n  I hope to take a look at where we want to be and have a vision of \nwhere we are going. Of course, we want high-quality education. We want \naccountability for education. We have to have quality teachers. We need \nto have choices for families, whether it is charter schools or schools \nof choice as we have in my hometown. The public schools have a \ndifferent approach to it. Parents can decide where they want to send \ntheir children. These are the items about which we have to have a \nvision instead of coming out every day and wrestling over something \nthat has very little impact. Where do we want to be 10 years from now \nor 15 years from now with regard to education.\n  Our hope as we change leadership--and that is not the end of the \nworld--is that we move to govern and we move to do the things for the \nAmerican people that we want to see happen over time: Where do we want \nto be and what is our role in getting there, that we can measure; high \nstandards; we have to have funding that works; increased flexibility \nfor local control; provide options for students. Those ought to be our \ngoals. We should state how we will get there.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/05/senate-section/article/S5808-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, sometime later this afternoon we will take \nup legislation on which we have been working for the better part of the \nlast month; that is, to define as best we can the role of the Federal \nGovernment with respect to public education in this country.\n  There are a number of points about which Democrats and Republicans or \nindependents disagree. There are also a number of areas around which we \ncan rally and around which we can agree. I want to take just a moment \nto address some of those points.\n  In this country, the role of the Federal Government for the last 30 \nor 36 years has been really to level the playing field for young people \nfrom especially disadvantaged backgrounds to make sure they have an \nopportunity to be successful when they walk into kindergarten at the \nage of 5. We do that through programs that provide nutritional support \nfor children; programs to try to ensure that healthy babies are born; \nto try to ensure that children who can benefit from Head Start have a \nchance to be in that prekindergarten program; to try to ensure that \nchildren in the elementary years and beyond have the opportunity to get \nextra help in reading, if they need it; if they need extra help in \nmathematics, they will get that assistance, too; to try to ensure that \nwe recruit some of the best and brightest young people to be our \nteachers; and to better ensure that not only do those teachers go to \nthe wealthiest school districts in our country but they go to those \ndistricts in which the need is the greatest.\n  The Federal Government has for almost four decades sought to ensure \nthat all children who enter our schools, whether they are in Delaware \nor the other 49 States, have a real chance to be successful.\n  There are 49 States in America today which have established rigorous \nacademic standards, spelling out clearly what they expect students to \nknow and be able to do. More than half the States today offer or \nrequire many of their students to take tests to measure the progress of \nthose students towards their State's academic standards in math, \nscience, English, social studies, or a variety of other subjects. \nAlmost half the States in America today have worked to put into place \naccountability systems. By that, we simply mean consequences for \nstudents who do well or do not do well; for schools that do well or do \nnot do well; for educators who do well or who do not do well.\n  I think we agree here in our Nation's Capital between the Congress, \nacross the aisle, and with the President that there is an important \nrole for the Federal Government to play.\n  We agree that it is important for the Federal Government to infuse \nmore resources into our schools. We agree that it is appropriate that \nthose schools adopt rigorous academic standards--not standards we set \nin Washington but standards adopted in the 50 States--in core academic \nsubjects such as math, science, English, and social studies.\n  We agree, first of all, on the idea of more resources. Some would \nhave enormous resources and others more modest. We agree on the premise \nthat more resources need to be invested.\n  Second, we agree on the need to invest those resources with more \nflexibility for the States, with greater flexibility for school \ndistricts and the schools.\n  This past week, during the recess, I was in several schools in \nDelaware. I will mention one of them, a little elementary school in the \ntown of Seaford, DE, in the southwestern part of our State, roughly 100 \nmiles from here--not even that as the crow flies.\n  In meeting with the school principal and a number of the teachers, \nthey have a host coordinator who helps students succeed. That is a \nperson who coordinates the efforts of 50 mentors in that school. That \nis a person who is there as a paid staff member from the Delaware \ndepartment of--we call it the kids department. It is the department \nthat represents families and provides services to families.\n  One of the things I heard in that visit is something I want to share \nwith my colleagues today. This school takes money, raised by local \nschool property taxes--they are local funds, and they receive State \nmoney and Federal money--and what they are about is trying to raise \nstudent achievement so that all the kids in that school will be able to \nread at grade level, write at grade level, do math at grade level, do \nscience at grade level, or do better than that.\n  I was struck when I heard how West Seaford Elementary is using extra \ntime/money to be able to provide the resources and the help that kids \nneed to read better or do math better. I was struck how they are using \ntitle I money with some of the flexibility legislation that this body \ngave them under the education flexibility legislation adopted roughly 2 \nyears ago.\n  I was struck to hear how the State's State employee from the kids \ndepartment works at that school every day as the go-between for the \nschool and a family or families in crisis. This is a family crisis \ntherapist who knows the social service network and knows how to take a \nfamily and a child who is hurting and get them the help they need.\n  The point I am trying to make is this--I have taken a long time to \nmake it. When we set rigorous academic standards for schools--when we \nsay to them: We expect you and your kids to reach those standards; we \nare going to give you more money--when we give them that money with \nmore flexibility, we have a right to demand results. The States have a \nright to demand results. The school boards and the parents have a right \nto demand results.\n  So what we have is a trilogy, if you will. There are more resources \ntargeted to where they are needed, in programs that work. The money is \ngiven more flexibly to school districts which are empowered to use that \nmoney more flexibly, with literally teams of teachers, administrators, \nand parents deciding: Do we need another school counselor or do we need \nanother reading specialist? Do we need to put a paraprofessional in a \nclassroom, or a number of them? Or do we need to hire more teachers? Do \nwe need to have a coordinator for a mentoring program or do we need \nto put that money into hiring a new science teacher?\n\n  Those are the kinds of decisions where I think, more often than not, \nschools will make the right decision. We have to give them that \nflexibility.\n  The fourth point on which I think we agree is that we should empower \nparents to have greater decisionmaking authority in the education of \ntheir children. There has been a lot of debate in this Chamber this \nyear and in past years that part of what we ought to do is to give a \nvoucher. They can take that voucher and send their children to a \npublic, private, or parochial school. We are not going to do that this \nyear. I understand it is being done on a limited demonstration basis, \nand it ought to continue in those places. There are other ways to \nempower parents to make choices for their children and they involve \npublic schools. I want to mention two of them today.\n  One of those is public school choice. The other is the establishment \nof charter schools. I will start with the charter schools first. \nCharter schools are public schools. Charter schools are not private \nschools. They are not parochial schools. Charter schools are public \nschools. They are public schools in my State and in 35 or so other \nStates, where the faculty, the administration, and the parents have \nbeen uniquely empowered to harness the energy of that education staff, \nto harness the energy and creativity of the parents, the \nadministrators, and the community, to raise the level of achievement \nfor the students.\n  They are given, in some cases, less money, at least for brick and \nmortar costs for their schools, than our other traditional public \nschools. In many\n\n[[Page S5810]]\n\nStates they are given roughly the same amount of money to educate each \nchild, at least in operating funds, as other public schools enjoy. But \nsome amazing things have happened in charter schools in my State. One \nof them has failed and was closed after 1 year. The rest have not.\n  One of the schools, the charter school in Wilmington--the first \ncharter school created with partnerships with a number of our major \ncompanies--has had the best high school results on the Delaware State \ntests of all 29 public high schools in our State for the last 2 or 3 \nyears in a row.\n  We measure student progress in reading, writing, and math. If you \nlook at the percentage of students at the Wilmington charter school who \nhave a disadvantaged background, who are eligible for free or reduced-\nprice lunch, it is under 20 percent, maybe even under 10 percent. It is \na relatively middle-class, upper middle-class school. It attracts \nstudents from throughout northern Delaware.\n  There is another charter school in Wilmington, DE, in the middle of \nthe projects called the East Side Charter School. The East Side Charter \nSchool does not have a 10 or 15 or 20 percent rate of poverty. Eighty-\nthree percent of the students there are there on free or reduced-price \nlunches. It has the highest level of poverty of any school in our \nState. Yet the students who go to that school come early and they stay \nlate. My sons will be finishing up their schooling this school year \nthis coming Friday, June 8, a day to celebrate in our household.\n  Over at the East Side Charter School they do not finish on June 8. \nThey do not finish on June 18 or June 28. They will be going well into \nJuly. Kids going to East Side Charter School not only start early and \ngo late but they have a longer school year. They also wear school \nuniforms. The children's parents are asked to sign something like a \ncontract of mutual responsibility where they agree to be part of their \nchild's education, to give something back in terms of parental \nvoluntarism at that school during the course of the year. The teachers \nand the administrators are freed up to be creative and innovative in \nways that sometimes do not occur in some of our traditional public \nschools. They work in teams in ways that do not always happen in other \nschools, public or private.\n  Last year, when the State of Delaware gave its annual Delaware State \nmath tests--we test kids in almost 200 public schools; testing them in \nreading, writing, and math--there was one public school in Delaware in \nwhich every child tested in math met or exceeded the State's standards \nin mathematics. It was the East Side Charter School.\n  If, in the East Side Charter School, with the highest incidence of \npoverty in my little State, every child can meet or exceed our State's \nstandards in math, we can educate every child in this country to meet \ntheir State's standards in math or reading or writing or other \nsubjects.\n  We have to be smart enough to invest the resources; we have to be \nsmart enough to make sure that schools have the flexibility to use \nthose resources; we have to demand results; and we have to empower \nparents and teachers to be creative and innovative. Not every parent in \nour State chooses for their child to go to a charter school. The number \nof charter schools is growing and is playing an important role in our \nState.\n  Unfortunately, I would like to say, the charter schools in Delaware, \nand most other States, don't get the kind of capital support for brick \nand mortar for building a charter school or upgrading a charter school \nor renovating a charter school that inures to students in regular \npublic schools. That is not the case. For those who have wanted to \nstart a charter school in my State and in most States, they have to go \nout and borrow money, sometimes from a bank. Unlike a traditional \npublic school which borrows money, the interest is tax free, which \nlowers the interest cost for those traditional public schools, when a \ncharter school goes out and borrows money for its school, the interest \non that loan is not tax free. The interest on that loan is taxable. The \ninterest rate is higher.\n\n  The State of Delaware issues bonds from time to time. We issue bonds \nnot just for capital projects for the State, for roads and prisons and \nhealth facilities and other things, parks, but we also issue tax-exempt \nbonds to help raise the money for our public schools.\n  The State of Delaware provides anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of the \ncapital costs for building and renovating schools in my State. When a \ncharter school wants to go out and raise the money for its brick and \nmortar needs, the State of Delaware doesn't issue bonds. It does not \npay 60 percent or 80 percent or even 6 percent of the capital costs for \nthe charter schools. The same is true in almost every other State where \nthere is a charter school.\n  Later during the course of the debate--not today but later this or \nnext week--Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and I will offer an \namendment that says, given the kinds of results we are seeing in \ncharter schools in our States and other places, maybe there is an \nappropriate role for the Federal Government in leveling the playing \nfield a little bit for capital costs for charter schools.\n  The other topic I want to discuss is public school choice. We \nintroduced, statewide in Delaware, public school choice 4 or 5 years \nago. Today any parent can elect to send their child to a public school \nnot on their feeder pattern. We choose the public schools that our two \nsons attend in Delaware. Other States are moving to public school \nchoice as well.\n  In S. 1, the legislation we will be taking up in a few minutes, there \nare real consequences for schools that fail to make significant \nimprovement for all kinds of students: rich, poor, male, female, \ndisabled, nondisabled. We expect real improvement, real progress toward \nthe academic standards those States have adopted. For States where a \nschool fails for 4 years in a row to make real progress toward their \nacademic standards, there are consequences which include providing real \npublic school choice with transportation for those children in that \nfailing school, allowing that school to be turned into a charter \nschool, turning that school over to the private sector or the State has \nto take over the operation of the school. Yet we don't provide anywhere \nin our legislation help to the States, advice or assistance, technical \nassistance or otherwise, on how, if you have never had an experience \nwith public school choice, you all of a sudden put in place a public \nschool choice system in your State. Or if you have never started \ncharter schools or your charter schools are struggling to get started, \nhow do you help them get up and running so they can mirror the success \nstories I have talked about here today in Delaware?\n  Again, Senator Gregg and I will be offering an amendment later in the \ndebate which would provide some help to States that haven't been \nthinking about public school choice but are going to have to under the \nlegislation we are going to adopt and States that, frankly, haven't \ngiven any help on the brick and mortar capital side to charter schools. \nMy State is as guilty as others that need to start doing that, \nparticularly if we want to invest our money in what works.\n\n  I will close with this: There are a lot of important issues we will \nconsider, whether the Republicans are in the majority or the Democrats. \nThe most important thing we are endeavoring to do in this country today \nis to raise the level of achievement of our students. Those kids in our \nschools will some day in many cases go on to college. In most cases \nthey will go on to work. It is important that when they reach that \ncollege or when they reach the employer or employers for whom they will \nbe working, they have the ability to read, the ability to write, to \nthink, to do math, and to use technology so they and their employers \ncan be successful, and they can have the kind of life they want for \nthemselves and their families.\n  It is not the role of the Federal Government to run our schools. That \nis the job of the local folks in the States and the schools and the \nschool districts. Our job is to level the playing field. We have an \nopportunity, through the legislation we are again taking up this \nafternoon, to try to level that playing field a little bit and to \ninvest the resources needed in our schools, particularly for kids \nstruggling from disadvantaged backgrounds, to provide those resources \nmore flexibly, to say, when we provide more money with greater \nflexibility, we want results; we are going to hold folks accountable \nfor results, and\n\n[[Page S5811]]\n\nfinally, to say we want to give parents more authority, to empower \nparents to choose more often than not the public schools they attend.\n  I will close with this: If I needed any proof that public school \nchoice was going to work, I got it, literally, the week after I signed, \nas Governor of Delaware, public school choice legislation into law. I \nwas in a forum where there were a number of school administrators \ntalking amongst themselves. During the break, I overheard one school \nadministrator say to another, about public school choice: If we don't \noffer what parents want for their kids, they will simply send their \nchildren to another school.\n  I said to myself: He has it. In our State, if we are not offering in \nschool A what parents want for their kids, if they are offering it in \nschool B, the child can go to school B and the money follows the child. \nThe State appropriation follows the child. It infuses competition and \nmarket forces into our schools and other schools attempting public \nschool choice in ways we never imagined possible. That is the \npotential. That is the hope of part of what we are doing today, this \nweek, and later this month.\n  I ask my colleagues, as we address the consequences for schools going \nforward in the future, if we are serious about empowering them to do \npublic school choice, if we are serious about making charter schools a \nreality, keep in mind the legislation and the amendment to be proposed \nby Senator Gregg and myself.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER.

Mr. President, as we gather today in this Chamber, it is \nquiet. We have people here prepared to take down our words, but \nrelatively few words are being said. We are on the threshold of a \nhistoric occasion here in the Senate, where the leadership, at least \nthe majority, is about to pass from our Republican friends to the \nDemocrats' side of the aisle.\n  While there are many issues about which there might be partisan \ndisagreements, there are many issues on which there is bipartisan \nagreement. One of those is the education of our children.\n  Today, visiting our Nation's Capitol, coming to this Chamber and that \non the other end of the building in the House of Representatives, are \nthe young and the old. In those groups of visitors to their Nation's \nCapitol are many schoolchildren. In many cases they are with parents \nand with teachers. They have come here to experience our Capitol, to \nexperience the longest living democracy in the history of the world, \nthe United States of America.\n  This Chamber was not silent just for a good part of this day but for \nmuch of last week as well, as we were in recess in observance of \nMemorial Day. In Delaware and in States across the country, on Memorial \nDay and during last week, we remembered and saluted and thanked our \nveterans who served in our Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines, who in \nmany cases sacrificed their lives in wars of the past century, and the \ntwo before that.\n  There is a document we are all proud of in this country called the \nConstitution. The Constitution of our Nation is the longest living \nwritten constitution of any nation on Earth. It was adopted on \nSeptember 17, 1787, first by the little State of Delaware. As I like to \nkid my colleagues, Delaware for one whole week was the entire United \nStates of America. Then we opened it up, and other States came in: \nPennsylvania and New Jersey and Maryland and the rest joined us. \nEventually there were 50 of us, and it has turned out well.\n\n  Mr. President, 213 years later we are going strong. Every now and \nthen our democracy is put to the test. That democracy will be put to \nthe test in this Chamber as we prepare for the passing of the torch \nfrom the current majority, Republicans, to the next majority, the \nDemocrats.\n  One issue we will address later this afternoon, to take up again, is \none we have been addressing for the better part of a month, and that is \nredefining the role of the Federal Government in the education of our \nchildren. While we have some disagreements in the margins, there is \nmuch about which we agree.\n  I say to all who come here today and in the days ahead to observe \nthis debate, whether you happen to be from schools in Claymont, DE, or \nschools in Colorado or any other place, that we will endeavor to do our \nbest to make sure the young people--very young people and those not \nquite so young--will have every opportunity to be successful in their \nschools and in their later endeavors, so when they walk across the \nstage and get that diploma and leave high school, it means they are \nready to go on to be successful in college, careers, military, the \nprivate sector, public service sector--whatever they do--to be \nsuccessful for their employers and, just as importantly, for \nthemselves.\n  There is a meeting commencing this afternoon, after the Democrat and \nRepublican caucuses. A number of Democrat and a number of Republican \nSenators were invited to the White House, presumably to meet with the \nPresident and members of his administration to discuss education \nreform.\n  While the numbers have shifted here a bit in the Senate, what should \nnot have shifted is our commitment to our young people and making sure \nthe Federal Government plays a more appropriate role in the years \nahead. As we infuse more resources into our public schools, as we \nprovide greater resources to the public schools, we seek to hold those \nschools accountable for results, rewarding the kind of performance we \nwant to see and, where it is not happening, to make sure we take steps \nand the schools take steps to get the kind of performance they want and \nneed and we desire as well.\n  Finally, we must make sure, better than we did before, that we \nempower parents to make decisions, real decisions, meaningful \ndecisions, about the education of their children in the public schools \nof America.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/05/senate-section/article/S5811-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 465.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the original cosponsor of this amendment is Senator \nFeingold from Wisconsin. I thank him for his support. Other cosponsors \nare Senators Kennedy and Clinton.\n  Mr. President, let me try to summarize this amendment.\n  Right now on this education bill there is a bonus incentive for \nStates to move forward with tests that this legislation calls for. \nRemember that this legislation on the floor of the Senate is very \nsweeping, for better or for worse. I think all Senators should think \nvery seriously about that.\n  Right now we are basically mandating or telling every school district \nin every State in the United States of America that every child in \ngrades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will be tested every year. This is not an \noption. School districts don't decide. States don't decide. At the \nFederal level, the Congress and the Federal Government are saying to \nStates: You will do this.\n  In the legislation, as I say, the additional bonus money is for \nStates that are able to move forward, and, as a matter of fact, put \nthis testing into effect earlier than 2005.\n  What this amendment would say is that it is not speed that is the \nmost important criteria. The most important criteria is the quality of \nthe test. What we want to say to States and school districts around the \ncountry is that we will provide an additional bonus to you if you, in \nfact, are designing and implementing quality tests. Again, what I mean \nby that is States should not be relying on single standardized \nmultiple-choice tests.\n  There are probably some students even in the gallery as I speak \ntoday. If they were the ones who were out here on the floor and were \ngoing to have a chance to speak, I think the students would say: Look. \nIf, in fact, you are going to measure what we have learned and what we \nknow, if you are going to measure what education is on the basis of \nsingle tests, standardized tests, or multiple-choice tests, the result \nwill be teachers teaching to those tests, and drilling to get ready to \ntake those tests. This is not all of what education is. In fact, I \nthink it can become quite educationally deadening.\n  The best teachers I know--I am in schools about every 2 weeks in the \nState of Minnesota--are teachers who never teach to worksheets. The \nbest teachers I have met are teachers who engage students, who get \nstudents to think about their lives in relation to the material, who \nget students to stand on their own two feet and think for themselves \nand speak for themselves.\n  At the very minimum, we ought to be saying to States that we do not \nwant States and school districts to abuse tests by relying on the sort \nof off-the-shelf standardized fill-in-the-bubbles multiple-choice \ntests. That is just outrageous.\n  By the way, these multiple-choice tests put the real world into \ncategories. They do not measure a student's sense of irony. They do not \nmeasure how profoundly students are thinking. They do not measure \nwhether students can think creatively. There is a whole lot that these \ntests don't measure.\n  Indeed, when the other amendment I introduced was passed, one of the \ncriteria was that the testing that is going to be done has to use \nmultiple measures, and not just one single, standardized test. We need \nto encourage that type of assessment.\n  We also need to talk about whether the assessments are coherent. That \nis to say, are they measuring what is actually taught in the \ncurriculum? If you have a single, standard, multiple-choice test that \nis generic that just sort of measures students in relation to other \nstudents but does not have anything to do with the curriculum and the \nmaterial and what is actually being taught, then basically you are \nputting all of America in an educational straightjacket. Aren't we \ngoing to make sure, I say to my good conservative friends, that local \nschool districts have some say over defining what makes for good \neducation?\n  I think we want to make sure the tests are comprehensive. We want to \nmake sure they are coherent.\n  Then the other thing we want to do is to make sure they are \ncontinuous; that is, if we are going to say we want an assessment, then \nwe want to try to measure the progress of the student over a period of \ntime. So what this amendment says is, look, let's make sure the \nassessment gives us the best picture of how students are really doing; \nif we are going to be engaged in testing, let's make sure it is high-\nquality testing; let's make sure we are really measuring how well \nstudents are doing; and, for God's sake, let's not force school \ndistricts and schools and teachers and students into some drill \neducation, what I would call straitjacket education.\n  I was really pleased that in an op-ed piece in the Washington Post, \nSecretary Paige himself wrote:\n\n       A good test, the kind the President and I support, is \n     aligned with the curriculum so schools know whether children \n     are actually learning the materials that their States have \n     decided a child should know.\n\n  Again, that is what I mean by a test that is coherent.\n  Above and beyond that, let me just simply say to all of my colleagues \nthat the independent panel review of title I, which was mandated in the \n1994 reauthorization, has issued its report in January called \n``Improving the Odds.'' The report concluded that:\n\n       Many States choose assessment results from a single test, \n     often traditional multiple choice tests. Although these tests \n     may have an important place in State assessment systems, they \n     rarely capture the depth and breadth of knowledge captured in \n     State content standards.\n\n  The panel went on to make a strong recommendation:\n\n       Better assessments for instructional and accountability \n     purposes are urgently needed.\n\n  So I again say, with this amendment, if you want to have a bonus \nsystem set up, if you want to provide additional moneys for States--not \nto hurry up, not to just bring a test off the shelf, a test that does \nnot even give us a good idea of how our students are doing--have a \nbonus that focuses on high-quality testing.\n  Frankly, I am surprised that I have to come out in this chamber and \ndebate this amendment. I would think this amendment would be adopted \nwith 100 votes. Maybe it will be before we are done.\n  Now, let me just quote Robert Schwartz, the president of Achieve, \nIncorporated, which is the nonprofit arm of the standards-based reform \nmovement. Here is what he said:\n\n       You simply can't accomplish the goals of this movement if \n     you're using off-the-shelf, relatively low-level tests. Tests \n     have taken on too prominent a role in these reforms, and \n     that's, in part, because of people rushing to attach \n     consequences to them before, in lots of places, we have \n     really gotten the tests right.\n\n  Mr. President, these are important words by a man whose work, whose \nprofession, is in the accountability field. I would like to quote the \nlast part of it again:\n\n       Tests have taken on too prominent a role in these reforms, \n     and that's, in part, because of people rushing to attach \n     consequences to\n\n[[Page S5813]]\n\n     them before, in a lot of places, we have really gotten the \n     tests right.\n\n  That is exactly my point. We need to get the tests right.\n  ``Quality Counts,'' a recent study on the state of assessments in the \nUnited States, concludes this way:\n\n       In too many States, the tests still focus too much on low \n     multiple choice questions and are poorly aligned with \n     the standards they are designed to measure.\n\n  So again--and I will emphasize this for maybe the 20th time this \nafternoon--what we want to do is we want to make sure that if there is \ngoing to be this testing--all in the name of accountability, all in the \nname of assessing how our students are doing--then we had better make \nsure we get it right. And if we are going to have a bonus system, let's \nprovide the bonus money to those States on the basis of their putting \ntogether high-quality tests. That is what this amendment says: That \nabove and beyond timeliness, the other criterion, the criterion that is \nso critically important, is that we have high-quality tests.\n  I say to Senators--and, by the way, I have a real question about \nthis; I have not decided this question in my own mind; I have not \ndecided what the right answer is--if we are going to mandate--I think \nthis is breathtaking, what we are doing here, frankly--if we are going \nto mandate that every school district in every State test every kid, \nthen, at the very least, it is our obligation to make sure these tests \nare done right so that they achieve the best effect.\n  Let's not give States an incentive to do low-quality tests which can \nhave such a damaging effect by rewarding them for rushing. What we \nought to reward States for is having high-quality tests, which means \nthey are comprehensive, which means they are coherent, which means we \nare actually assessing the progress of students over a period of time.\n  I want to make it really clear that if we do not focus on high-\nquality tests, we are asking for real trouble. I say to Senators, \nbefore you vote on this amendment, if we do not provide a bonus payment \nto States for high-quality tests, if we do not make that our priority, \nand instead our emphasis is just on States rushing forward with any \nkind of test, we will not be helping children or teachers or schools in \nAmerica; rather, we will be doing damage because if the only thing we \ndo, all in the name of ``reform,'' is to barrel down this path where \nyou have State after State after State being forced by the Federal \nGovernment to do the testing, just taking off the shelf these \nstandardized tests, with no multiple measures, and not being related to \nthe curriculum that is taught, then we are going to have something \nwhich amounts to what I call drill education.\n  Again, I am looking up at the gallery. I know there are students up \nthere. Students hate drill education. And they should hate drill \neducation. And teachers hate drill education. It is not real teaching, \nand it is not real learning, to just sort of drill, drill, drill, and \nhave students memorize, memorize, memorize, and then have some simple \njingo standardized testing and nothing else.\n  I fear for where education is going to go if, at the very minimum, we \nare not, in our work in the Senate, focusing on quality testing.\n  I also point out to my colleagues that there has been recently in the \nNew York Times--and, frankly, I wish the New York Times had done this 6 \nmonths ago, not just within the last several weeks--an excellent and a \nvery troubling series, of articles on the perils of testing.\n  I again mention to my colleagues that right now this legislation \nencourages States to rush to develop their new annual tests so they can \nreceive bonuses from the Federal Government. What my amendment says is \nthat every State has to be on time. Not one Senator can say: Senator \nWellstone, you are trying to stop the testing. By the way, if it were \nwithin my power, I might. I am not so sure we should be doing this. But \nthat is not what this amendment says. What this amendment says is that \nevery State is going to have to implement the testing, if we pass this \nlegislation, but if they do it, then they ought to receive a bonus from \nthe Federal Government for having high-quality tests. That is what this \namendment says.\n  This amendment, cosponsored by Senator Feingold, Senator Kennedy, and \nSenator Clinton, rewards those States that develop high-quality \nassessments as gauged by a peer review process, rather than simply \nspeeding towards implementing tests with no consideration as to the \nquality of these assessments.\n  In the New York Times articles, they point out, in a very crystal-\nclear way, that quality matters. I want to just read from a couple of \nthese pieces in the New York Times.\n  I quote from a piece in the New York Times. This is on some of the \ndangers of rushing:\n\n       Each customized test the State orders must be designed, \n     written, edited, reviewed by state educators, field-tested, \n     checked for validity and bias, and calibrated to previous \n     tests--an arduous process that requires a battery of people \n     trained in educational statistics and psychometrics, the \n     science of measuring mental function.\n       While the demand for such people is exploding, they are in \n     extremely short supply despite salaries that can reach into \n     the six figures, people in the industry said. ``All of us in \n     the business are very concerned about capacity''. . . .\n\n  What we have is people in the educational area saying: We are really \nworried about whether or not we are going to be able to follow through \non this mandate. And there are all sorts of examples in different \nStates, from New York to Arizona to Minnesota, where either there have \nbeen testing errors and kids have been kept back or have not graduated, \nwith unbelievably harsh consequences, or principals and teachers have \nlost jobs, with the argument being that they were not able to teach \nwell when in fact, as it turns out, the tests were not reliable or \narticles about teachers who were high-quality teachers who we would \nwant to teach in inner cities or in rural areas--the Presiding Officer \nis from Maine--and who basically are now leaving the teaching \nprofession because they are saying, wait a minute; not only do we want \nthe resources but we certainly don't want to be forced to be involved \nin drill education, just teaching to these simple standardized tests.\n  The New York Times, again, had several articles which pointed out \nsome of the real dangers.\n  The Washington Post had a piece February 10, 2001. I quote from one \nof the pieces.\n\n       But 21 states test in three or fewer of the six grades, \n     according to the center, and under President Bush's plan \n     would have to at least double the number of students they \n     test annually.\n\n  Only seven States right now are testing every year in grades 3 \nthrough 8 in a way that is aligned with state standards; other States \ndo it every other year; some States, have not even met the requirements \nset out in the 1994 law. What we are now going to say is every State, \nevery school district has to test every child every year. They are not \ngiven any choice. Not only are we saying that, but we are also saying \nthere will be consequences based upon how the students do on those \ntests.\n  There will be consequences in terms of additional money, in terms of \nwhether or not those schools will be sanctioned, in terms of whether or \nnot those schools will be told that they have to operate differently, \nin which case, what my amendment is saying is: With this bonus system, \nlet's not provide bonuses for States for rushing, since we have example \nafter example after example of the abuse of testing and what can go \nwrong. Let's provide bonuses to States on the basis of quality.\n  My definition of quality, which is based on a recent report by the \nNational Research Council, ``Knowing What Students Know'' and on other \nsources such as the ``Professional Standards on Educational and \nPsychological Testing'' is: A, the tests should be comprehensive and \nnot rely on just one single standardized test, B, the tests should be \ncoherent. The tests should test the curriculum being taught. Otherwise, \nyou have teachers in schools who have to teach to standardized tests \nthat have nothing to do with the curriculum being taught in a school \ndistrict in Maine or in Minnesota. That makes no sense whatsoever. And \nC, you want to track the progress of a child over a period of time.\n\n  What this amendment says is, right now in the legislation, we have it \nbackwards; we are talking about providing\n\n[[Page S5814]]\n\nan incentive, a bonus, to States for rushing. My amendment says, even \nthough I have concerns about this Federal mandate, it is amazing: Here \nI am, a liberal Democrat from the State of Minnesota--I don't think the \nChair would refer to me as a conservative Republican--and yet I am not \nsure in my own mind--I mean this; I am not trying to be gimmicky--I am \nnot sure the Federal Government should mandate this. I am not sure we \nreally have any business telling every school, every school district, \nevery State, you have to test every child every year, 8-, 9-,\n10-, 11-, 12-, and 13-year-olds. But that is almost beside the point. \nWith my amendment, what we are saying right now is, if we are going to \ndo it, let's do it the right way.\n  Last week, we passed, with 50 votes, an amendment which said this \ntesting needs to meet professional standards and that states have to \nshow that their tests are of adequate technical quality for each \npurpose for which they are used. That is really important. What this \namendment says is, when we do the bonuses, let's be clear to the \nStates--all my colleagues who believe otherwise about testing, this is \nnot an amendment that says we don't have testing. Every State will have \nto meet the deadline. Every State will have to meet the deadline by \n2005. But what this amendment says is, on the bonus payment, let's give \nthe bonus payments to the States and to the school districts for high-\nquality testing. That should be the criterion.\n  It makes no sense to say we give bonus money to States solely on the \nbasis of who does it first. Then you have everybody rushing. When \npeople rush, they might not get it right. If you don't get it right, \nyou don't have an accurate assessment. If we are going to do it, we had \nbetter get it right; it had better not be inaccurate. Some of this \ntesting around the country has been inaccurate. As I said, the New York \nTimes had a whole series of articles about that. It had better be \naccurate.\n  Secondly, if you are going to do it, it had better measure real \nteaching and real learning and real education. Let's not put all of the \nchildren and all of the schools and all of the teachers in America in a \nstraitjacket. Let's make sure they know that we are expecting and \nsupport multiple measures. Let's make sure they know we want it to be \ncoherent and measure the curriculum they are teaching. Let's make sure \nwe are, indeed, measuring the progress of a child. Let's make sure it \nis done the right way, in which case, let's have bonus payments that \nprovide the money and provide the additional payment and provide the \nadditional bonus to those States that are engaged in high-quality \ntesting.\n  That is what the amendment says. I could go on, but I think this is a \nfairly accurate summary of my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as we have just heard from our good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Wellstone of Minnesota, we are back on \nlegislation that the Senate is considering on support for elementary \nand secondary education. I welcome the fact that we are on it, and am \nvery hopeful we will stay on it until we conclude. We have been on this \nlegislation in one way or the other probably for the better part of 4 \nor 5 weeks, but we have only been on it for a few days at a time.\n  As most of you understand, the reauthorization of ESEA is an \nextremely important piece of legislation. It deserves the full time and \nattention of the Senate. We had a series of amendments, and over the \nMemorial Day recess we had the opportunity to go through the more than \n200 amendments which were initially offered. We have been able to \ndispose of 33 of those amendments, and we have a number of amendments \nthat will be withdrawn. Others are acceptable. And there still remain a \nnumber that are still pending a vote on the floor of the Senate. We \nwant to get about the business of completing our work on education. I \nwelcome the fact that we are back on this legislation.\n  I will address the amendment we have before us in a moment or two, \nbut I do want to let our colleagues know that earlier in the afternoon \nthe President called a number of members of the Senate Education \nCommittee and a few others to the White House to talk about the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. He indicated at that time that \nthe legislation, as it stands, would be acceptable to him, and he \ndidn't need to have it enhanced or altered or changed. He urged us to \nget about the business of completing the reauthorization of ESEA.\n  I indicated to the President that we have been working diligently on \nthis legislation, and have been working in a bipartisan manner. We have \nhad the opportunity of working with the Secretary of Education and the \nPresident's education advisers. And now we have a very important, \nsignificant blueprint that can make a difference in the quality of \neducation for children in this country by building on the standards \nwhich have been established by 49 of the States, by using high-quality, \nmeaningful assessments so that we know what children are learning, \nparticularly in the areas of math and literacy and, eventually, in 2007 \nand 2008, in science, and by using data from those assessments to \nidentify the strengths and weaknesses of students, and provide the \nneeded assistance for them to succeed.\n  We are going to hold the schools, communities, children, and parents \naccountable. The point I made to the President was that I thought we in \nWashington ought to be held accountable as well by ensuring that the \nbenefits of this legislation should be available to all the needy \nchildren and not, as is currently the case, to just a third of the \nchildren.\n  It has been our position from the beginning that with the changes \nincluded in this legislation, we should fund the Title I program. Now \nit is funded at a third. We ought to be able to fund it at two-thirds \nnext year and reach two-thirds of the children. Over the 4 years of \nPresident Bush's Presidency, we ought to have a commitment to reach the \nfinal third so that we will have the full funding of the Title I \neducation program that can be flexibly used by local communities. With \nthe provisions included in this legislation, we can provide a very \npositive learning experience for every child.\n  We are not there yet. The President indicated we will continue to \nhave ongoing discussions, particularly as the Appropriations bills are \nconsidered. He certainly has not ruled full funding of Title I out, but \nhe has not ruled it in.\n  We indicated that our position was supported by 79 Members of the \nSenate, Republicans and Democrats alike. I indicated to the President \nthat support for mandatory, full funding of IDEA, funding that helps \nlocal communities to fund their special needs programs for children \nwith disabilities, has very broad bipartisan support. We are very \nhopeful that any conference committee will once and for all provide for \nfull funding of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. It is \na position supported by more than 70 percent of the Senate, a good \nshare of Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  In any event, we had a good exchange at the White House. We welcome \nthe President's strong support for our legislation, and we have every \nintention of working to respond to Senator Daschle's strong desire to \nmake this legislation the first order of business. We ought to complete \nthis legislation. I urge our colleagues who have amendments to bring \nthem to our attention so that we can dispose of them in an orderly way.\n  As we return to our ongoing education debate here in the Senate, I \nthink it appropriate to review briefly what our pending legislation \ndoes and its sources of inspiration.\n  Our goal in this bipartisan legislation has been to support proven, \neffective reforms. Time and again we have seen individual schools \nfollow a similar path and achieve successful improvements in the \nquality of education. This reform bill builds on that grassroots \nexperience.\n  The bill requires every child to be tested each year in grades 3-8 so \nparents and educators alike will have better information on where their \nchildren stand and what needs to be done to help them learn more \neffectively.\n  The bill requires that students, schools, and school districts are \nheld to challenging academic standards. Low-achieving children will \nreceive additional help. Students in failing schools\n\n[[Page S5815]]\n\nwill be free to transfer to other public schools or take advantage of \nafter-school supplementary tutoring. If a failing school does not turn \naround in a reasonable number of years, it will be completely \nreorganized.\n  The bill provides high-quality assessments aligned with State \nstandards that measure a full range of the child's learning. Off-the-\nshelf, fill-in-the-bubble tests too often compromise the quality of \ninstruction and undermine genuine efforts for school improvements.\n  I salute the very strong efforts of the Senator from Minnesota in \nmaking sure that tests are quality tests that challenge children and \npositively affect the learning process, not just measure what they have \nbeen able to memorize in a particular class. That is enormously \nimportant. This legislation is going to be strengthened because of the \nefforts of the Senator from Minnesota.\n\n  Parents and the public deserve to know not only where their children \nstand, but also how their local schools and districts measure up. \nAnnual report cards are required at each level. Sunshine can be a \npowerful force for change.\n  Our bill is strict in asking more of students, teachers, and schools \nand in holding them accountable for their performance. Just as \nimportant, the bill is intended to provide the resources that we know \nare necessary for all of them to have a genuine chance for success.\n  Our bill provides support to reach the goal of a qualified teacher in \nevery classroom and a qualified principal in every school. Today, 39 \npercent of all teachers are teaching a subject in which they have no \nundergraduate major or minor degree. Clearly, that figure is \nunacceptable, and Congress can help do something about it.\n  Our bill revises and strengthens professional development programs to \nprovide teachers with year-long mentors, ongoing training in their \nsubject matter, and the best teaching methods and practices in child \ndevelopment.\n  It offers additional support to school districts with high \nconcentrations of limited-English-proficient students to teach them \nEnglish and make sure they meet the same high academic standards we \nexpect all children to meet.\n  The bill expands the successful 21st Century Learning Centers Program \nthat does such an excellent job of offering worthwhile after-school \nactivities to students. Our goal is to reach every latch-key child over \nthe next 7 years to provide them with supplementary learning \nopportunities after school that keep them off the streets, away from \nthe gangs, and out of trouble.\n  Our bill also provides full funding for the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. Twenty-five years ago, the Federal \nGovernment promised to pay 40 percent of these costs, but we have never \nmet that promise. Today the figure is still only 15 percent. It is long \npast time for Congress to meet its commitment to special needs \nchildren.\n  Our bill's emphasis on better results and targeted resources comes \nfrom experience at the grassroots. Those experiences demonstrate that \nall schools can do better, not just the elite few.\n  Hundreds of successful local schools and school districts around the \ncountry are making impressive strides in improving student achievement. \nWe can turn that number into thousands by helping guide the way. Many \nchallenged schools are already turning themselves around as a result of \nreforms that focused on increased accountability linked to higher \nstandards and quality testing, early intervention for children who need \nadditional help, and adequate investments in proven reforms, especially \nin high-needed areas.\n  Three schools that have recently reported improvements are excellent \nexamples. The Ashley Elementary School in Denver, Colorado, has an \nalmost 100-percent minority population with a 90-percent poverty rate. \nIt recently reported that since 1998, the number of third graders \nmeeting State reading standards had soared by 280 percent--280 percent.\n  After years of reported failure, the school was shut down and \nreopened with new teachers and a new principal. Results of the Colorado \nStudent Assessment Program were carefully analyzed, and the entire \nstaff of the school signed on to a goal of raising student literacy \nskills. As a result, literacy was emphasized in every subject and in \nevery class. Assessments of each student are monitored bimonthly. \nStudents who fall behind receive extra support quickly or new methods \nof instruction. Every teacher gets professional development support \nevery week. Ninety-minute reading blocks were created with a class size \nof 12 students per teacher, compared to 25 students per teacher in \n1998.\n\n  Strict accountability, high-quality assessments, early intervention, \nprofessional development, and class-size reduction--these are precisely \nthe types of proven reforms that will be strongly supported in the \npending legislation.\n  Another example is Humboldt Elementary School in Portland, Oregon, \nwhich has been turned around with a similar combination of reforms. In \n1997, only 17 percent of third grade Humboldt students and 10 percent \nof fifth grade students met Oregon's benchmark scoring in reading. \nTwenty-five percent of third graders and only 9 percent of fifth \ngraders met the math benchmark.\n  In the face of this serious challenge, the city of Portland shut down \nand reconstituted the school. Two-thirds of the staff was reassigned. A \nnew principal was hired. Academic and performance expectations were \nraised for all students. Class size was reduced from 28 to 1, to 21 to \n1. All teachers now receive weekly professional development. Individual \nstudent assessment results are analyzed regularly and learning needs \nare diagnosed to respond to quickly. Eighty percent of Humboldt \nchildren participate in afterschool learning programs. Humboldt found \nout that reform costs money. In 1998, Portland added $540,000 to \nHumboldt's budget to carry out their reconstitution program.\n  I will later provide examples of schools, in my State of \nMassachusetts, that have experienced dramatic results when given the \nnecessary resources to succeed. In many cases, schools reversed low-\nperformance using less $540,000--the amount allocated to reversing low-\nperformance in the Humbolt budget. The New American Schools Corporation \nestimates that it costs approximately $180,000 to implement a \ncomprehensive school reform model in a given school--often the first \nstep toward turning around low-performance. We have 10,000 failing \nschools at the present time, which equates to $1.8 billion to begin the \nprocess of turning around the nation's low-performing schools. If we \nare committed a quality education for all of America's students, we \nwill include those resources in our legislation. Those resources have \nnot yet been included. We think they should be.\n  According to the Oregon assessment in 2000, the percentage of \nHumboldt students meeting the State benchmark for academic performance \nincreased to 67 percent among third graders and 60 percent with fifth \ngraders. The percentage of third graders more than doubled, to 57 \npercent in math, and the percentage of fifth graders meeting the math \nstandard soared to 70 percent.\n  Another impressive example of a successful school is the Jeremiah \nBurke High School in Dorchester, MA. Not long ago it was thought of as \na hopeless, high-poverty school, but it is turning itself around with \nprecisely the types of reforms emphasized in this current bill.\n  The Burke High School story was featured on the front page of the \nBoston Globe of May 22: ``Dorchester School Gains Acceptance.'' I ask \nunanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Dorchester School Gains Acceptance\n\n                          (By Anand Vaishnav)\n\n       Six years after the Jeremiah E. Burke High School lost its \n     accreditation--symbolizing both the decay of urban Boston and \n     the struggles of its public schools--the Dorchester school \n     has reached a new milestone: All eligible seniors in the \n     Class of 2001 have been accepted to two- or four-year \n     colleges.\n       ``Now we have proof to show people what we can do,'' said \n     Shannon Phillips, who will attend the University of New \n     Hampshire.\n       In 1995, despite athletic prowess and school spirit, such \n     proof was hard to find. Academic and physical woes, from no \n     librarian to no drinking water, caused the New England \n     Association of Schools and Colleges to strip the Burke of its \n     accreditation, jeopardizing students' chances to get into \n     college.\n       With an infusion of new money, an exodus of teachers which \n     Headmaster Steven C. Leonard was able to replace with his own\n\n[[Page S5816]]\n\n     picks, and the billy club of shame, the Burke gained its \n     certification back in 1998. Leonard then embarked on another \n     piece of the improvement puzzle: getting more students into \n     college.\n       ``We just convinced them that they couldn't graduate until \n     they applied to college,'' Leonard said with a smile. ``We \n     were bluffing. But it worked.''\n       Whether the acceptance rate sets a new standard or is an \n     aberration is open to question. A five-year school district \n     agreement in 1996 promising more money for teachers, \n     maintenance, and counselors to get the Burke back on its feet \n     expire this year. And Mayor Thomas M. Menino, while touting \n     the school, said he can't promise to maintain its financing.\n       ``I'm not going to say that,'' Menino said. ``But we're \n     going to continue the progress they've made. We're not going \n     to let the school go backwards.''\n       Boston School Superintendent Thomas W. Payzant said the \n     likely scenario is gradually adding more students--the \n     school's enrollment has been kept below 700--while keeping \n     the money and staffing the Burke has had.\n       ``There's not as much magic in the number of students as it \n     is the work they've learned to do with them.'' Payzant said.\n       The Class of 2001 with about 200 freshmen, and 172 became \n     seniors, a number whittled down by transfers, moves, and \n     dropouts. (The Burke's dropout rate is 13 percent, down from \n     17 percent five years ago, but still higher than the \n     district's dropout rate of 8 percent.)\n       Of the 172 seniors, 14 are in jail or a state juvenile \n     facility and won't graduate, Leonard said. Another four are \n     illegal immigrants and will graduate but can't attend college \n     because of their immigration status.\n       That leaves 154 graduates, many of whom are headed to \n     local community colleges, technical colleges, or state \n     universities such as a University of Massachusetts campus \n     or Bridgewater State College. A few are headed to Berklee \n     College of Music or Boston College, and some who got into \n     college are weighing the military instead.\n       So how did they get there?\n       Three years ago, with the accreditation dilemma solved, \n     Leonard began thinking of ways to boost the college-\n     acceptance rate. Last year, he made an application to college \n     part of the year-end ``portfolio'' all seniors must present \n     to graduate.\n       This year, he told teachers that he wanted students to move \n     beyond application to acceptance to a two- or four-year \n     college--and he made it clear to students that it was a \n     condition of receiving a diploma, even though it wasn't \n     enforceable by law.\n       ``We are preparing kids so that if they don't go to \n     college, it's got nothing to do with us,'' Leonard said.\n       The Burke's guidance counselors and teachers then got to \n     work, badgering students about financial aid forms, asking \n     for essays, and introducing them to colleges they hadn't \n     considered.\n       Had it not been for the personal attention, students said, \n     they either would not have considered college or would not \n     have applied to as wide a variety of schools. Senior Melanie \n     Silva, who will attend Hesser College in New Hampshire, \n     recalled how her sophomore biology teacher, Ernest Coakley, \n     was relentless.\n       ``He just stuck on me: `I want to see your personal \n     statement, I want to see your college application,' '' Silva \n     said. ``He's still on me.''\n       The City Council is expected to consider a congratulatory \n     resolution for the Burke tomorrow.\n       Yet some worry about the intense focus on college, \n     especially for students who simply aren't ready. Debra \n     Wilson, who has a son at the Burke and one who graduated in \n     1998, is ``ecstatic'' about the high college acceptance rate. \n     But she said she is concerned that the drive to get all \n     students into college comes at the expense of spending time \n     on other activities.\n       ``We're losing sight of the student as a person, and a \n     student needs to be a fully rounded person,'' Wilson said. \n     ``Sometimes we can overwhelm our children.''\n       Leonard says he will live with any choice a student makes. \n     But when he speaks to Burke students--and he interviews every \n     new one--he tells them there are 18 other Boston high schools \n     they can attend if college isn't in their cards.\n       As headmaster, Leonard said he now worries about \n     maintaining what the school has, and his concern is rooted in \n     history.\n       The schools' most recent renaissance was in the 1980s under \n     headmaster Albert Holland, who got much of the same money and \n     attention Leonard did. In 1991, budget cuts and rising \n     enrollment devastated the school, coinciding with a citywide \n     rise in youth violence that divided the school's hallways \n     into gang turf.\n       While losing accreditation was a powerful tool for \n     improvement, Leonard hopes the school's recent taste of \n     success is a stronger catalyst to sustain achievement.\n       ``My constant energy drain,'' he said, ``is to hold \n     everything together long enough so that enough people will \n     realize that it's possible in the inner city.''\n\n                            GOING TO COLLEGE\n[The percentages of graduates of some area highs schools who will attend\n                       two- or four-year colleges]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Going to\n                    High school                       No. of    college\n                                                    graduates  (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBurke (Boston)....................................        154        100\nBillerica.........................................        331      84-86\nBrockton..........................................        700         76\nCharlestown.......................................        192         81\nEverett...........................................        338         96\nSt John's Prep (Danvers)..........................        268         99\nWayland...........................................        175         95\nWellesley.........................................        211         92\nWestwood..........................................        144         95\nWeymouth..........................................        395         75\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Some percentages are approximate because data is still being\n  compiled.\nSource: School districts.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Burke High School lost its accreditation 6 years ago \nbecause of low test scores. Only 36 percent of the senior class was \naccepted into college. After doubling per pupil spending, hiring new \nstaff, and raising academic standards, the school regained its \naccreditation in 1999.\n  Last year 62 percent of its seniors were accepted into college. This \nyear every eligible senior, 100 percent of the Class of 2001, was \naccepted into a two or four year college. At Burke High School, no \nchild is left behind.\n  Burke High School is one of the most dramatic stories that has come \nacross our desk. I visited that school when it was facing enormous \nproblems. It is now doing extraordinarily well. It is a major \nachievement and accomplishment.\n  The school's principal, Dr. Steven Leonard, attributes the turnaround \nto sustained ongoing school-based professional development for \nteachers. Teachers are trained outside the classroom, coached inside \nthe classroom, and have year-long mentors at the school. When the Burke \nHigh School carefully analyzed its State test results, it discovered a \nwidespread and deep need throughout the school. Dr. Leonard then raised \nmore than $500,000 in 3 years from private sources to implement three \nschoolwide professional development programs. Over 3 years, he was able \nto spend a little over $125,000 a year for professional development for \nthat school.\n  We know what works. This legislation has the framework to make sure \nthat it can work for children across the country, but we also know it \ntakes the investment, the resources, to give life though these reforms.\n  The Jeremiah Burke High School is an extraordinary example. Teachers \nhave been trained to integrate literacy instruction throughout the \ncurriculum. Teachers have learned to use technology as an educational \nsupplement that enhances quality instruction instead of replacing it. \nEach classroom is now connected to the Internet. Every teacher at Burke \nparticipates in an ongoing professional development program that \nencourages college application, including financial aid applications. \nEvery staff member at the school, not just guidance counselors, are \ntrained in the procedures for college admissions and financial aid \napplications.\n  Last year, Dr. Leonard required a complete college application to be \na part of a year-end portfolio that all seniors must have in order to \ngraduate. This year, he has made college acceptance an informal \ncondition of graduation, and every child has measured up and met that \nchallenge. It is extraordinary. With the same type of skillful analysis \nand hard work, every school can do the same.\n  In the education reform legislation before the Senate, we encourage \nthe same combination of high expectations, diagnostic testing, quality \nteaching, high-tech classrooms, and after-school learning opportunities \nthat have worked at Burke High School in Massachusetts, Ashley \nElementary School in Colorado, Humboldt Elementary School in Oregon, \nand scores of other schools such as these.\n  We authorize $11 billion in additional funding for next year alone so \nnew reforms can be launched in schools across the Nation and ongoing \nreforms can be sustained.\n  This bill is solidly grounded in a vast amount of widely accepted \nresearch and practical experience. If we continue to work together on a \nbipartisan basis and enact this legislation, the real winners will be \nstudents, schools, communities, States, and the whole Nation. Let's \nfinish the job we started so well.\n  On the Wellstone amendment, I want to indicate my strong support. I \nagree we should be focusing on the use of tests that are of high \nquality rather than how quickly they be developed. State assessments \nare the base of new accountability system in Title I, and\n\n[[Page S5817]]\n\nwe want assurance that the assessments are of high quality and an \naccurate measure of what students know and can do.\n  I had the good opportunity last Friday morning to be at a conference \nin Boston with 500 principals, teachers, and administrators of schools \nwho have been working in the whole area of academic enhancement for \nchildren and accountability. This was a nonprofit organization that \nworks to promote standard-based reform. They found the States have \nimproved their standards in testing but they still have a way to go.\n  I agree with the Senator that their evaluation of what works for \nchildren is enormously important. They have been at this for a long \nperiod of time. There is no superior organization in this area. We \ncannot afford to compromise the quality of assessment at the expense of \nquickly developing the test.\n  The Administration has wanted to make sure we are going to create \nincentives in the States to move toward accountability. That is an \nadmirable desire. However, we want to make sure that accountability \nsystems are tied to quality tests. That is what the Senator's amendment \nis all about. I believe it is completely consistent with what the \nobjectives of this bill are. It will also provide the assessment on the \nbasis of the content standard more effectively than the off-the-shelf \ntests, which in too many instances are being taught to. We cannot \nafford to compromise the quality of assessments at the expense of \nquickly developing tests.\n  I heard the Senator talk about the mistakes. Most of us have read the \nNew York Times article on the tests that were given in New York City \nand the mistakes that were made and how this disadvantaged children as \nwell as principals as well as the school administrator and how the \ncompany still claims they have 99.997 percent accuracy. But just that \namount of failure resulted in dramatic adverse developments for \nstudents as well as for teachers and administrators.\n\n  In my State of Massachusetts, there are several quality control \nmeasures in place to ensure reliability in the scoring of the MCAS \ntest, our State assessment. Aside from the contract on assessment \noutside of the State, the results of all MCAS tests are also \nindependently reviewed by testing experts at the University of \nMassachusetts. In addition to soliciting an additional review of the \ntests from the University, Massachusetts also trains its teachers, who \nare well-versed in the State standards, in the scoring of the MCAS. \nTeachers in Massachusetts review at least 25% of the test questions, \nincluding all of the written compositions in English language arts. \nTeachers are trained in the rubric and scoring process for a week-long \nperiod every July.\n  Massachusetts' example illustrates the points made by the Senator \nfrom Minnesota regarding the need for ensuring quality in the test \ndevelopment and administration. We cannot afford to compromise the \nquality of assessment at the expense of quickly developing tests. \nDeveloping a high-quality assessment, even in just one subject for one \ngrade, is a lengthy process. According to experts on test development, \nthere are eight basic steps in the test development process. They are \nas follows:\n  Defining the purpose for which the test is being developed; convening \na technical committee to work with the States to write test \nspecifications and determine the content and form of the test; \ndeveloping and reviewing the questions and ideas on the test; \nconducting pretesting to ensure fairness, reliability, and accuracy of \nitems on the test; data analysis and test assembly to make sure the \ntest is aligned with the required subject matter and skills; and test \nadministration and the development of accommodations for students with \nspecial needs.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Maine in the chair. I know she is \nvery familiar with these activities because the State of Maine is one \nof the States which has given an enormous amount of attention to all \nthese matters of testing and also with regard to special needs \nchildren.\n  The steps also include developing scoring changes and cut points \nassociated with proficiency levels; and analysis of specifications and \nreadjustment and realignment of items. States should not be encouraged \nto rush through this process but should take the time to develop \nassessments of high quality. States should be rewarded for taking the \ntime to develop valid and reliable measures of what students know and \ncan do.\n  Good tests work. They provide us with information on student \nperformance, help educators identify the needs of individual students, \nand measures our impact on working to change schools and turn around \nlow-performing schools. However, while 15 States have developed tests \nin third through eighth grade math and reading, only seven States use \nhigh-quality tests that are aligned with academic standards in those \nsubject areas. We should encourage States to use that time to develop \nquality assessments rather than develop assessments quickly.\n  Awarding bonuses for the quality of assessment is consistent with our \ncommitment to help States improve the quality of their tests. The \nSenate passed the Wellstone amendment to enhance the quality of test \nassessments by a vote of 50-47. We should continue to encourage States \nto improve the format of their tests, align the tests to standards, and \nemploy multiple measures so the tests are reliable measures of what \nstudents know and can do.\n\n  I strongly support the amendment offered by my friend from Minnesota. \nIn this bill, we establish standards that define what we expect \nchildren to know each year. Then, we establish assessments to provide \nfor the evaluation of that knowledge. High academic standards and \nquality assessments go hand in hand.\n  We hope to avoid what is happening in too many States. That is, \ncurriculum is not aligned to high standards, and tests are not aligned \nto high standards. When this happens, we risk compromising student's \nlearning. We risk having teachers teaching to tests because they don't \nwant to have a bad record of their students not being able to perform. \nThat is not what this legislation is about.\n  Senator Wellstone has spent a good deal of time trying to make sure \nthat this legislation includes high-quality assessments, and that it \naccomplishes our goal of improving student learning. I thank him and \ncommend him for the excellent work he has done in this whole area.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I will just take a few minutes. I \nthank the Senator from Massachusetts and thank him for being a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  Madam President, I refer my colleagues to the series of articles in \nthe New York Times, and also a very interesting piece in the Atlanta \nJournal titled ``Teachers Find Flaws in State Test's Science Part.''\n  I thank Senator Feingold for his support as an original cosponsor of \nthis amendment and Senators Kennedy and Clinton for their support as \ncosponsors as well.\n  To remind my colleagues, since it has been a long time since this \namendment was first introduced, this amendment is very non-\ncontroversial. It says that instead of the bill's language, which would \nreward states solely based on how quickly they finish their \nassessments, the Secretary should instead reward states that develop \nthe highest quality assessments. The awards would be granted through a \npeer review system. We should not be giving states an incentive to rush \non such an important issue. We have to give more incentives to improve \nthe quality of the assessments.\n  This amendment really goes back to why we are measuring student \nachievement in the first place and what are our goals in setting up the \naccountability systems we have. Are we measuring for the sake of \nmeasuring only, or are we measuring to get the best picture of how our \nchildren are doing? If we want to get the best picture of how students \nare doing, we need to have the best possible assessments. They need to \nbe aligned with standards. They need to be free from bias. They need to \nreflect both the range and depth of student knowledge and assess not \njust memorized responses, but student reasoning and understanding. This \nis exactly what my amendment on the quality and fairness of State \nassessments that was passed earlier in the\n\n[[Page S5818]]\n\nconsideration of this bill is all about. That is what this amendment is \nabout. If there is anybody who thinks that speed is more important than \nquality, please, vote against this amendment. Please, come down and \ndebate me on it. I would be happy to.\n  I was happy to see that Secretary of Education Paige also agrees that \ntests need to be high quality. He wrote that state assessments must be \ntied to the state standards and curriculum in his Washington Post op-ed \nthat was published a couple of weeks ago. Secretary Paige writes: ``A \ngood test--the kind the president and I support--is aligned with the \ncurriculum so that schools know whether children are actually learning \nthe material that their states have decided a child should know.'' I \nwould like to thank the Secretary for this statement, and based on it, \nI would hope that he and the administration and every Member of the \nSenate would support this amendment.\n  Let me review quickly my statements here on the floor before the \nrecess about the key components of high-quality and fair assessments. \nThe standards used by experts in the field--as laid out in the recent \nNational Research Council Report ``Knowing What Students Know''--in \nanalyzing assessment quality are summed up in three questions:\n  Are the assessments comprehensive? That is, do they use multiple \nmeasures to capture the complexity of student learning rather than rote \nmemorization of test content?\n  Are the assessments continuous? That is, do they capture student \nlearning across time?\n  Finally, are the assessments coherent? That is, do they measure what \nis actually being taught in the curriculum?\n  So, based on Secretary Paige's comments, there now seems to be some \nagreement that the new state assessments need to be high-quality and \nfair. But, anyone working in the field of educational assessment will \ntell you that high-quality assessments take a long time to develop. \nThey require a deliberative process. They should not be rushed.\n  It seems odd that, in this context, we would reward states simply \nbecause they finish their assessments quickly. If in fact, seems like \nan incentive for people not to spend time developing, improving and \nperfecting their assessments, but rather to take the easy way out. If \nthey do, they can get a reward. If they do not, they get nothing.\n  This would be extremely problematic, because all the research \nindicates that we need to move toward higher quality assessments, not \nlower quality assessments. I believe that those states that invest \nresources in the very expensive endeavor of developing high-quality \nexams that reflect state standards should be rewarded for the value \njudgment that they have made.\n  The Independent Review Panel on title I which was mandated in the \n1994 Reauthorization issued its report ``Improving the Odds'' this \nJanuary. The report concluded that:\n\n       Many States use assessment results from a single test--\n     often traditional multiple choice tests. Although these tests \n     may have an important place in state assessment systems, they \n     rarely capture the depth and breadth of knowledge reflected \n     in state content standards.\n\n  The Panel went on to make a strong recommendation. It said:\n\n       Better assessments for instructional and accountability \n     purposes are urgently needed.\n\n  Further, as Robert Schwartz, the president of Achieve, Inc., the \nnonprofit arm of the standards-based reform movement recently said:\n\n       You simply can't accomplish the goals of this movement if \n     you're using off-the-shelf, relatively low-level tests . . . \n     Tests have taken on too prominent of a role in these reforms \n     and that's in part because of people rushing to attach \n     consequences to them before, in a lot of places, we have \n     really gotten the tests right.\n\n  That is exactly my point. We need to get the tests right. ``Quality \nCounts,'' a recent study on the state of assessments in the United \nStates, also concludes, ``In to many states, the tests still focus to \nmuch on low level multiple choice questions and are poorly aligned with \nthe standards they are designed to measure.''\n  Low quality assessments can actually do more harm than good. I would \nlike to quote from the National Standards on Educational and \nPsychological Testing. The standards state:\n\n       The proper use of tests can result in wiser decisions about \n     individuals and programs than would be the case without their \n     use and also can provide a route to broader and more \n     equitable access to education and employment. The improper \n     use of tests, however, can cause considerable harm to the \n     test takers and other parties affected by test-based \n     decisions.\n\n  It is our obligation to see that tests are done right so that they \nachieve the best effect. Let's not give states an incentive to do low \nquality tests, which can have such a damaging effect, by offering them \nan award for rushing.\n  The National Standards state that this is our obligation. The \nStandards say:\n\n       Beyond any intended policy goals, it is important to \n     consider any potential unintended effects that may result \n     from large scale testing programs. Concerns have been raised \n     for instance about narrowing the curriculum to focus only on \n     the objectives tested, restricting the range of instructional \n     approaches to correspond to the testing format, increasing \n     the number of dropouts among students who do not pass the \n     test, and encouraging other instructional or administrative \n     practices that may raise test scores without effecting the \n     quality of education. It is important for those who mandate \n     tests to consider and monitor their consequences and to \n     identify and minimize the potential of negative consequences.\n\n  Let's enhance our accountability systems by trying to enhance the \nquality of assessments so we can avoid the negative outcomes described \nin the Standards and more accurately measure what students know and can \ndo. This way we can more effectively use tests for their best purpose: \nto diagnose students' needs and help students improve.\n  I urge support for this amendment, for quality and for better reform.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 465, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to send my \nmodified amendment to the desk. Basically what this amendment does, \nMadam President, is it makes crystal clear the bonus payments will go \nto States--first of all, they have to meet the deadline. I don't want \ncolleagues to think I am giving States any way of not meeting the \ndeadlines.\n  Second, the other requirement is that the bonus goes to States that \ndevelop assessments that most successfully assess the range and depth \nof student knowledge and proficiency in meeting State performance \nstandards in each academic subject on which the States are required to \nconduct their assessments. There will be a peer review. I send my \nmodified amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, (No. 465) as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 776, strike lines 1 through 5, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Assessment Completion Bonuses.--\n       ``(1) In general.--At the end of school year 2006-2007, the \n     Secretary shall make 1-time bonus payments to States that \n     develop State assessments by the deadline established under \n     1111(b)(3)(F) and as required under section 1111(b)(3)(F) \n     that are of particularly high quality in terms of assessing \n     the performance of students in grades 3 through 8. The \n     Secretary shall make the awards to States that develop \n     assessments that most successfully assess the range and depth \n     of student knowledge and proficiency in meeting State \n     performance standards, in each academic subject in which the \n     State is required to conduct the assessments.\n       ``(2) Peer review.--In making awards under paragraph (1), \n     the Secretary shall use a peer review process.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I think the Senator from \nMassachusetts has said it well. I will have more to say about this \noverall education bill later on, but this is all in the spirit of \ntrying to improve this bill. I hope there will be a lot of support for \nthis amendment. So far no one has come out on the floor of the Senate \nto debate the amendment, and we are going to have a vote actually at \n5:30 or thereabouts, or we think we will. If not, we will have a vote \ntomorrow.\n  We all have our expertise. I don't even want to say--it is a little \npresumptuous. I don't know that I am the expert, but 20 years of my \nadult life was education. I take it seriously. I happen to have been \nsomeone who did not do well on some of these standardized tests. I know \nthe danger of relying on just one standardized test. I think the \namendment that was agreed to last week was important. We do want to \nhave multiple measures, and I think we do want to have a relationship \nbetween\n\n[[Page S5819]]\n\nthe tests and the curriculum being taught.\n  The only thing this amendment does is say: Look, let's be clear. All \nStates have to meet the deadline. I am sure those of my colleagues who \nare all for mandatory tests would insist on that. I am not going to \ndisagree at all. But I am saying let's give the bonus to States for \nhigh-quality tests. That is really what we want to reward. That is what \nwe are trying to push.\n  If we are going to do this, let's make sure we are doing an accurate \nassessment of how the children are doing. If this is all being done in \nthe name of accountability, that is to say we want to know how children \nare doing in different schools in America, then let's make sure we have \nthe best assessment. That is all this amendment says. Let's have a \nbonus payment that goes in the direction of nurturing and promoting the \nbest possible assessment.\n  It is a good amendment, and I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, Senator Collins has an amendment also \ndealing with the issue of testing. When she arrives on the floor, I \nwill yield the floor. I want to make some additional comments regarding \nfunding and why I think it is so important.\n  At the present time, we are only reaching about a third of all the \nchildren who are eligible. Listen to this. This is with regard to my \nState of Massachusetts. I will try by the end of the week to have a \nsimilar kind of breakdown for all the other States because I believe \nthey will find that their situation is very similar.\n  In the 1999-2000 school year, the supplemental Title I funding for \ndisadvantaged children went to 980 out of the 1,900 Massachusetts \nelementary schools. But because of insufficient Federal funding, 624 \nMassachusetts schools with poverty rates in excess of 30 percent \nreceived zero in Title I education aid.\n  That is part of the problem. In 600 schools, 30 percent of their \nchildren are Title I eligible, and they receive virtually no funding \nwhatsoever.\n  This is part of our dilemma in terms of wanting to make sure there is \na range of different support services, the kinds of requirements that \nare going to be necessary in terms of well-qualified teachers, \nprofessional development and mentoring for teachers, and after-school \nprograms.\n  If we are serious about doing the job, doing it right and doing it \nwell, we want to try to put ourselves on a glide path to full funding \nof Title I. Maybe we can't reach all of the children overnight. We \nunderstand that. We ought to be able to move ourselves on a glide path \nso we can look at all the children and, most importantly, their \nparents, and say that over the life of this legislation we are going to \nbe able to assure those parents that their children who are ineligible \nfor the program are going to get the support and the help and \nassistance they need.\n  As you well know, Madam President, this is not the beginning of the \npathway in terms of the academic achievement and accomplishment of \nchildren. We are looking against a background where the Head Start \nProgram is funded at about 40 percent. We are going to find that some \nchildren are going to be coming up with the Head Start Programs and go \ninto the Title I programs which are funded, and will get into \nsupplementary services, and to the extent that these kinds of support \nelements make an important difference--and they do make an important \ndifference--they are going to be helped and assisted.\n  But we are going to find, in the same way, that a majority of \nchildren who are otherwise eligible for Title I are not going to \nbenefit and then will go to school and fail to get help and assistance. \nIt is going to be extremely difficult to think we are making an \nimportant difference in their lives and enhancing their ability in \nreading and in math.\n  Almost every study and review--most recently, the Institute of \nMedicine review of January of this last year--talks about the \ndevelopment of the neurons in children's brains and the importance in \nthese first 3 years in terms of being able to sort of stimulate the \ninterest of the children in various kinds of activities, hoping to stir \nthe elements in the children's brains so they open them up in ways that \nthey will be more receptive to the learning experience--we know this \nmedically from all of these various studies.\n  The Carnegie Commission report has pointed these out for the last 10 \nyears. Yet we still do not give that kind of intervention, support, and \neffort that we should and that we know makes an important difference.\n  I think many of us are very hopeful that we can see investment in \nthese early years, then we have further support in terms of the Head \nStart Program. We have further to go in funding the special needs \nprogram for children with disabilities, and further to go in terms of \nfunding the Title I program for disadvantaged children.\n  As the Chair understands, we will end up actually saving resources. I \nknow the Chair is familiar with all of the studies that were done at \nthe end of World War II on the GI bill where they estimated that for \nevery $1 invested in education, the Federal Treasury got $8 back in \nenhanced earnings by those who received those programs. Investing in \nthese children, in terms of savings and other social costs, is more \nthan predictable. It is certain. We believe we have legislation that \nmoves us very strongly in that direction. That is particularly why we \nare so strong in terms of wanting to get the funding for these \nprograms.\n  For the benefit of the Members, we will consider the Wellstone \namendment tomorrow and probably begin the discussion. We will have an \nexact unanimous consent request in a few moments.\n  For the benefit of the Members, as I understand it, we are coming in \nat about 11:00 a.m. and will be dealing with some necessary measures \nand we will then come back to the bill at approximately 11:30 a.m. We \nwill have 20 minutes on the Wellstone amendment and then vote. We will \nfollow that with consideration of the amendment of the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Collins.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 445, 453, as modified; 470, 473, 503, 506, 508, 598, \n                         625, and 631, en bloc\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, in the meantime, I have a package of \ncleared amendments. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for \nthese amendments to be considered en bloc and that any modifications, \nwhere applicable, be agreed to, the amendments be agreed to, and the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc.\n  For the information of the Senate, these amendments are the DeWine \namendment No. 445; the Ensign amendment No. 453, as modified; the \nRoberts amendment No. 470; the Landrieu amendment No. 473; the Bennett \namendment No. 503; the Collins amendment No. 506; the Collins amendment \nNo. 508; the Sessions amendment No. 598; the Wyden amendment No. 625; \nand the Levin amendment No. 631.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment to the \nBetter Education for Students and Teachers Act that will make a minor \nbut important technical change to the Rural Education Initiative, \nlocated in Title V of the bill. The Rural Education Initiative directs \nfunds to school districts that lack the personnel and resources needed \nto compete for Federal competitive grants and often receive formula \nallocations in amounts too small to be effective in meeting their \nintended purposes.\n  As the bill is currently drafted, districts must meet two \nrequirements to qualify for grants under this program. One of these \nrequirements is that the district must have less than 600 students. \nThis requirement poses a problem for many States that have \ngeographically large districts. For instance, in my home State of Utah, \nthere are only 40 school districts. Compare this to States of similar \nor smaller geographic size, some of which have more than 500 districts. \nThe result is that many districts in States like Utah have more than \n600 students and therefore fail to qualify for rural assistance, \ndespite the fact that these districts may be in the most rural parts of \nthe State. I have been to these districts. If the members of this body \nwere to travel with me to Beaver School District in Beaver, Utah, they \nwould find it hard to dispute the fact that Beaver is a rural district. \nBut the students in Beaver School District will not receive any \nassistance under the Rural Education Initiative as it is currently \nwritten.\n  I do not wish to argue the merits of large districts versus small \ndistricts. The way a State chooses to run its educational system is \nrightly left up to State and local education authorities. However, \nCongress should not be in the business of penalizing States based on \ntheir educational systems.\n  My amendment alters the Rural Education Initiative to include an \neither/or provision that will allow districts to qualify in one of two \nways: a district must have less than 600 students or must have a total \npopulation density of less than ten people per square mile. This minor \nchange will allow a handful of school districts that do not currently \nqualify to become eligible for funding under this provision. It is \nimportant to note that no school district currently qualifying under \nthe Rural Education Initiative will be disqualified by my amendment. \nHowever, this change will have a serious impact on places like Beaver, \nUtah, and on many other rural school districts around the country.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank colleagues for their cooperation.\n  We are going to continue to work closely with our Members to try to \nmove this process forward, and to do it in a timely way that will \npermit our colleagues, obviously, to speak to these measures where \nnecessary and permit us to dispose of the amendments where necessary. \nBut we do want to move ahead. I have every expectation we will have an \nopportunity to clear additional amendments tomorrow as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my understanding, therefore, that for the balance of \nthe evening we will simply participate in general debate on the bill \nand that tonight no more amendments will be offered to the bill. \nTomorrow, as the Senator from Massachusetts has represented, there will \nbe 20 minutes of debate equally divided when we go back to the bill, at \nwhich time there will be a vote on the Wellstone amendment, followed by \nthe Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is not a unanimous consent request. That is just a \nsummary of where we are. We are waiting for the formal written document \nto make it clear that I did not make any mistakes, and pending that, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes consideration of the education bill on Wednesday, there \nbe 20 minutes of debate on the Wellstone amendment equally divided with \nno amendments in order to the amendment. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that following the use or yielding back of the time, the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relationship to the amendment. I further ask \nunanimous consent that following that vote, the Senate then begin \nconsideration of the Collins amendment No. 509.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the 20-year anniversary \nof a truly remarkable event which, at the time, no one in the world \nwould have envisioned its impact--its impact on people throughout the \nUnited States and on people throughout the world--indeed, its impact on \nimpact. No one could have foreseen an impact which, from a public \nhealth perspective, has resulted in the single worst public health \ncrisis since the bubonic plague ravaged Europe more than 600 years ago.\n  That event occurring 20 years ago today was the publication of a \nbrief description of the first five cases of a disease that could not \nbe explained. The five people mentioned happened to have been infected \nwith a virus that had never previously been described, and which at the \ntime had no name. The five people had been infected with what was later \ncalled the HIV virus,\n\n[[Page S5822]]\n\nand they died of complications associated with AIDS.\n  It was a case study. It was published by the CDC. At the time I was a \nthird year surgical resident at the Massachusetts General Hospital in \nBoston. I remember very vaguely 20 years ago those first case reports \nbeing talked about. And it was vague. It was obscure. Nobody had any \nidea because that virus had never been described in the history of \nmankind. Nobody had ever before talked about a virus with such power to \ndestroy--to destroy cells, to destroy cellular function, to destroy \nlife itself: the HIV/AIDS virus.\n  During my surgical residency, I was involved in operating every day. \nAt the time, we had no earthly idea that this virus would infect much \nof our blood supply. No one knew that it would ultimately be \ntransformed, 5 or 6 years later, into what became known as ``universal \nprecautions,'' where, for the first time, we began to treat all blood \nin the operating room as potentially infected or potentially toxic. We \nstarted to wear double gloves. We started to wear a mask when we \noperated. We took these precautions to protect ourselves--not our \npatients This all occurred within a few years after these initial five \ncases were described. It changed the practice of medicine.\n  I had the opportunity earlier today to meet a wonderful person, a \nperson whom I had previously only heard about. Her name is Denise \nStokes. She has a wonderful voice and a wonderful story. The story was \ntold to me and many others today.\n  Denise was infected with the HIV virus at the age of 13. Shortly \nafter her infection was identified, she became active in the struggle \nagainst the virus. She described her many experiences in an intensive \ncare unit. She described what it was like not to have access to \navailable drugs. She talked about watching, in the depth of her \nillness, as policymakers talked about AIDS on television. She wondered \nwhether at any point they would be able to respond to what has become \nthe largest, most significant public health challenge in our lifetimes, \nin the last century--perhaps in the history of the world.\n  She talked about saying a silent prayer that hopefully there would be \na cure someday. She talked about her hopes that someday she, by sharing \nher experiences, could become a catalyst for ultimately discovering a \ncure for HIV/AIDS.\n  Denise helped to put a face on heterosexual HIV infection in the \n1980s. She was instrumental in gaining access to African-American \nchurches in the early 1990s. As I said, she was infected when she was \n13 years old. She is now 31. She talks to college students, community \ngroups, and professional organizations sharing her story, a story that \nis powerful, a story that puts a face on HIV/AIDS.\n\n  No one 20 years ago, or even 15 years ago, would have ever guessed \nthat this disease would become the single worst public health crisis in \nover 700 years.\n  People ask: What do we think about this virus now 20 years later? The \nKaiser Family Foundation, in a very recent survey, showed two things \nabout Americans' thinking: No. 1, they see AIDS is the most urgent \ninternational health issue; and, No. 2, after cancer, Americans view \nHIV/AIDS is the most urgent health issue here at home.\n  And the American public is right on target. We have learned a great \ndeal about this disease over the last 20 years. We know how to prevent \nit. We have fairly effective drugs and treatment therapies today for \ntreating HIV and AIDS-related infections. They work in most cases if \nthey are available and if they are taken properly.\n  Over the last 20 years--remember, this virus was not around 21 years \nago--AIDS has become a very effective killer. About 8,000 people will \ndie somewhere in the world today from this virus, this single little \nvirus that 21 years ago, to the best of our knowledge, had killed no \none.\n  Its impact has been tremendous. Consider the research field--speaking \nas a physician and medical scientist, I can say that in 1981 we had no \ndrugs to treat this virus. About 6 years later, we had six or seven \ndrugs. Now, we have about 65 drugs to treat this virus. In spite of \nthat, as I said, it is killing about 8,000 people a day.\n  One thing that gives us some hope is the great boldness, the genius \nof our research industry--both the public sector through NIH and the \nprivate sector through the pharmaceutical companies --where there are \ntoday over 100 drugs in the pipeline to combat HIV/AIDS.\n  Our successes have been many. We have reduced the incidence of \nmother-to-child transmission thanks to counseling, voluntary testing, \nand AZT for pregnant women. New HIV infections have declined sharply. \nThe Ryan White CARE Act, which originated in the Congress, supports \ncare for over 100,000 people who otherwise would not be able to afford \ntherapy. The drugs have doubled their life expectancies. That's a \ntremendous success. It has cut in half the average length of stay for \nHIV-related hospitalizations.\n  This body, I am proud to say, has responded to the changing face of \nHIV/AIDS, in the communities where it appears. For example, last year \nCongress expanded the reach of the Ryan White CARE Act to include a \nwider range of communities. We created supplemental grants for emerging \nmetropolitan communities that previously had not been affected and in \nthe past did not qualify for such funding.\n  The expansion in the program will benefit such places as Nashville, \nTN, where the Comprehensive Care Center, led by Dr. Steve Raffanti, has \nserved more than 3,000 patients over the last 6 years, and is currently \nfollowing almost 1,900 patients, 40 percent of whom fall below the \npoverty level.\n  How? The Congress first authorized the Ryan White CARE Act ten years \nago and we reauthorized it five years ago and then again last year.\n  Congress has also responded with increased funding. Ryan White \nfunding is now at a level of $1.8 billion a year. That is not double \nwhat it was when we started, or tripled, or quadrupled. It is 7 times \nwhat we initially put into the funding of the Ryan White Care Act.\n  But there is so much more to be done. There are 500,000 to 600,000 \nAmericans living with the HIV infection and another 320,000 people with \nAIDS. We have reduced the number of new infections from 150,000 a year \ndown to 40,000 a year. That is tremendous progress, but it is not \nacceptable. 40,000 new infections per year is one new infection every \n13 minutes, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n  Our loved ones are at risk. Even worse, there are some new danger \nsigns on the horizon. The progress and the advances that have been made \nappear to have created an element of complacency. Surveys indicate \ntoday that 80 percent of our young people do not believe they are at \nrisk for HIV infection. Such ignorance and complacency breeds \nincaution, less prevention, and, ultimately, more infections.\n  Last week, the CDC featured a report which cited a frightening \nincrease in HIV incidence for young African-American gay and bisexual \nmales. In Tennessee, the number of HIV/AIDS infections increased by a \nstartling 35 percent over the 2-year period of 1998 to the year 2000. \nWe simply cannot allow this increase in the number of infections. We \ncannot allow a new wave of infections in our country. All of this is a \ncall to arms, a call to arms for all of us as citizens of our \ncommunities, as Americans, and as citizens of the world.\n  As we were talking this morning, Denise talked about initially \nwithdrawing within herself as the virus infected her at age thirteen. \nAs she grew older, she started to reach out--first, to her community; \nlater, to policy makers.\n  Denise should be an example for all of us. We have a moral obligation \nto reach out within our communities and beyond, to the United States of \nAmerica and beyond. We need to reach out to the entire world. Indeed, \nas troubling as the trends are in this country, they pale beside the \nstaggering disaster of HIV/AIDS in the developing world, especially in \nsub-Saharan Africa.\n  The historical enemies of human beings--and we all know what they \nare: war, famine, natural disasters, persecution--today are dwarfed by \nthe global epidemic of HIV/AIDS. The crisis is one of public health. \nThe crisis is one of developmental economies. The crisis is one of \nhumanitarian outreach.\n  The global statistics of HIV/AIDS are chilling. I just mentioned that \nan American is infected with HIV/AIDS every 13 minutes. During that \nsame 13 minutes, 72 people will die of HIV/AIDS somewhere in the world. \nTwice that number will become newly infected.\n\n[[Page S5823]]\n\n  I have had the opportunity to serve on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. In that committee, I chair the Africa subcommittee. I have \nhad the opportunity to travel to Uganda, to Kenya, to the Congo, to the \nSudan. I have had the opportunity to perform surgery in hospitals in \nthe last several years where HIV infections among patients run as high \nas 50 percent. When you travel to Africa, just as Secretary Powell did \n2 weeks ago, you see that Africa is losing an entire generation. It is \nthat middle generation that is being wiped out. It is that working \ngeneration that is being wiped out. It is the parenting generation that \nis being wiped out.\n\n  How many orphans result? How many devastated families? How many \nimpoverished villages? How many ruined economies?\n  The good news is we know a lot about how to reverse the epidemic \nthrough a combination of political commitment--I am speaking to my \ncolleagues and to the political leadership of others around the world--\nof donor support--again, I am speaking to those both inside and outside \ngovernment who are in a position to contribute--and of newly committed \nleadership in countries being devastated by the disease. Those three \nelements, in places such as Uganda, Senegal, and Thailand, have had \nremarkable successes.\n  On the ground in these countries, work by community-based \norganizations, both religious and secular, has been the linchpin of \nsuccess.\n  It is very important that we not separate prevention from care and \ntreatment. Science has not yet found a cure. There is no vaccine for \nHIV/AIDS. Not yet. It will be 5 years, or 7 years, or 10 years maybe \nmore. I am not sure if it will even be a vaccine. It may be a highly \neffective treatment. One of the many problems of this virus is, once it \ngets into the memory system of the cells of the human body, those cells \nstay there for decades, 60 and 70 years. That's just one of the \nchallenges for our research community.\n  Recent action by the pharmaceutical companies to slash prices on \nantiretrovirals for poor countries has done two things. First, it sends \nthe message of hope. Second, it puts a spotlight on the necessity of \nestablishing an infrastructure of health care to be able to engage in \nprevention and care and treatment.\n  Access to treatment and drugs for opportunistic infections such as \ntuberculosis is also critical. For all the damage that HIV/AIDS does, \ntuberculosis kills more people in Africa with AIDS than any other \nopportunistic infection.\n  Creation and ongoing support of public health infrastructure, of \nhealth care delivery systems, including personnel training, is \nessential to effective treatment and education programs.\n  What more should we do to address this challenge?\n  The reason I am discussing this tonight is that 21 years ago, before \nthe first case studies, we had no idea of the catastrophe of this \npandemic which now travels across the world. I have spoken a lot about \nAfrica in the last few minutes; and there is increasing public \nawareness of the magnitude of the disaster there. When I ask which \nsingle country in the world has more HIV/AIDS cases than any other, \nmost of my colleagues and those listening would guess a country in \nAfrica. That's wrong. It is believed that India now has more cases than \nany other country.\n  If I ask what country in the world has the fastest growth rate in \nHIV/AIDS, again, most would guess an African country. That's also \nprobably wrong. We think it's Russia. Frankly, we're not sure because \npublic health information is so poor in most of these places.\n  There is no debate that no region of the world is more affected than \nAfrica. But guess which region is second; it's the Caribbean.\n  This is truly a global challenge. The price tag for an effective \nresponse is staggering. Billions of dollars are going to be required. \nThe United Nations estimates that $3 to $5 billion will be required in \nAfrica alone. $3 to $5 billion to develop an appropriate human and \nphysical infrastructure to address this challenge. Governments must \nrespond. Legislatures like ours, the executive branch, and the \ngovernments of the world are the only ones able to commit the resources \nneeded.\n\n  New public-private partnerships that draw on our creativity must be \ndeveloped to implement the strategies that are put forward.\n  The United States has taken real leadership on this issue. Although \nwe often are criticized by other nations, we need to make it clear that \nthe United States right now is contributing about half the funds that \nthe entire world is currently spending internationally to fight the \nproblem.\n  We spend more than anyone on research and on education. We spend more \nthan anyone on treatment of HIV/AIDS. We spend more than anyone to help \nthe rest of the world deal with this problem. Indeed, U.S. foundations \nalone have contributed more money to attack this problem than most \nother governments.\n  This does not mean that we are the only ones doing our part. Other \nnations, the United Nations, the World Bank, corporations, and \nphilanthropies have been joining together, particularly over the past \nyear.\n  President George W. Bush, just 3 or 4 weeks ago, took a real \nleadership position, committing $200 million, the first country to do \nso, to a global fund to combat AIDS.\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell, on his recent return from Africa, \nsaid:\n\n       There is no war that is causing more death and destruction \n     . . . that is more serious . . . than the war in sub-Saharan \n     Africa against HIV/AIDS.\n\n  I will close with seven steps we can take to engage this war:\n  No. 1. United leadership. We should ask the political, religious, and \nbusiness leaders of the world to unite in joining the international \ncommitment to halt the spread of HIV/AIDS and to help those afflicted \nwith the disease. They should commit both financial and human resources \nto the fight.\n\n  No. 2. A global fund. I mentioned and commended President Bush's \ncommitment to this global international fund for HIV/AIDS, \ntuberculosis, and malaria. This should not be an American fund. It \nshould not even be a United Nations fund. It should be a global fund \nthat represents a new way of doing business--transparent and \nresponsive. Traditional donors such as European countries, Japan, and \nothers, as well as the business community, foundations, and other \ninstitutions of civil society should all be participants in this fund.\n  In the very near future, I intend to offer legislation authorizing \nU.S. contributions to this new global fund, this new way of doing \nbusiness.\n  No. 3. Swift funding. We should put nongovernmental and community-\nbased organizations, both religious and secular, at the forefront of \nthe action on the ground by getting funds to them quickly so they can \nmost effectively do their jobs reaching out. We know they have an \nenormous impact, and speed saves lives.\n  No. 4. Partnerships. We should encourage and empower coalitions and \npartnerships of governments, universities, academies, research \ninstitutions, multilateral institutions, corporations, and the \nnongovernmental organizations to come together as partners, as \ncoalitions, to help fill the gap between the available resources and \nthe unmet needs of prevention, care, and treatment. Each member of the \npartnership brings a unique contribution to the battle.\n  No. 5. Research. We should make absolutely certain that international \nresearch efforts on disease affecting poor countries--and that includes \nAIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis--are reinforced in a manner that \nassures the best scientific research in the world can lead to real \nbenefits for the developing world at a cost they can afford.\n  We should continue to aggressively support and encourage research \ninto vaccines and treatments in both private and public institutions \nlike the National Institutes of Health. The Senate has recently \nsupported the doubling of funding at the NIH over 5 years. We should \nalso give new financial incentives for private research. The \npharmaceutical companies are doing tremendous research in the field of \nHIV/AIDS, but more is needed.\n  There are numerous vaccines currently under investigation. Their \nsuccess will be measured in millions of lives saved. Just think of it.\n  No. 6. Prevention, care, and treatment. I already mentioned that \nprevention needs to be tied to care and treatment. I am very excited \nabout new low-cost options which can link care and treatment with \nprevention over time.\n\n[[Page S5824]]\n\n  No. 7. And I will close with this--is hope. As I talked with Denise \nStokes today, I was struck by her remarkable enthusiasm, her optimism, \nand her commitment to teaching others about this disease which changed \nher life from the age of 13.\n  The most remarkable thing to me, as I listened to her and learned \nthat she was just in the emergency room 2 days ago, was the simple fact \nthat here she was talking to a large crowd of people with her story. \nShe was sharing what was inside, reaching out broadly to people from \nall over the world, bringing her special message which can be summed up \nin one word: ``hope.''\n  We should do all we can to provide comfort and care to families all \nover the world today. We should address the issue of the orphans \ncreated by this terribly destructive disease. We have a moral \nresponsibility to give them hope.\n  Yes, the challenge is before us--a moral challenge, a humanitarian \nchallenge. There has never before been such a challenge in terms of \nsheer magnitude.\n  As Americans, it is natural to reach out to those around us, \ndomestically, to give a helping hand. Now we must join with other \nnations to extend our helping hand further to create a better world, a \nsafer world, and a more fulfilling world. We do that here at home with \nboldness, genius, and creativity, along with a healthy dose of courage, \npersistence, and patience. Let us now rise to the global challenge as a \ncompassionate people in a great and compassionate nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/05/senate-section/article/S5824-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5824-S5825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMEMORATING TWENTY YEARS SINCE THE FIRST DIAGNOSES OF AIDS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the beginning of a \ntragic chapter in human and medical history. Twenty years ago today the \nfirst cases of AIDS were diagnosed. Since that initial diagnosis in \n1981, the toll wreaked upon humanity by this disease is mind boggling. \nTwenty-two million people have already died. And an additional thirty-\nsix million people have become infected with HIV, the virus that causes \nAIDS.\n  In 1981, no one imagined the impact HIV/AIDS would have in the \nensuing two decades. And, unfortunately, no one would have imagined \nthat the United States would be as slow as it has been to respond to \nwhat has become a grave international crisis.\n  International public health experts estimate that the global fight \nagainst AIDS demands at least $7 billion per year. Meanwhile, in the \nlast 15 years combined, the United States has invested only $1.6 \nbillion or a little over $100 million per year to fight this pandemic. \nIn 1999, a year during which nearly five and a half million people in \nAfrica alone were newly infected, the United States invested just $142 \nmillion, less than .001 percent, of our foreign assistance budget that \nyear, to fight AIDS.\n  Too much time has been lost, and too little leadership has been \ndemonstrated by America. President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and \nSecretary Powell have indicated they now recognize this pandemic for \nwhat it is: a national security threat. It is time that we begin \ndedicating the resources that such a threat demands.\n  In recent months, some progress has been made in combating AIDS. \nGovernments, foundations, and corporations have begun to pledge \ndonations to the Global Trust Fund to fight AIDS. Drug producers have \nalso begun to make AIDS treatment more affordable for the more than 25 \nmillion HIV-positive Africans. But much more remains to be done.\n  However, the activities of the Global Trust Fund should not and \ncannot replace our bilateral efforts to bolster the health \ninfrastructure of the countries struggling against this pandemic. \nTherefore, Congress can take three important steps to bolster our \nbilateral efforts and invest in the health care workers and researchers \nneeded in the affected countries.\n  First, Congress must provide the resources needed for increased \ntraining of public health workers on the ground.\n  Second, Congress must increase spending on research in Africa--and \ninsist that research dollars spent in these countries also go to the \ndevelopment of indigenous research capabilities.\n  And third, Congress must try to create the incentives necessary to \nstop the steady outflow of African doctors and nurses from these \nravaged countries.\n  It is time to act. We have already lost two decades and tens of \nmillions of lives to this deadly disease. We cannot afford to wait \nanother two decades before we confront this disease with the dedication \nit demands.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today marks the 20th year since the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention first published information \nin the Morbidity and Mortality Report on this illness we now call HIV/\nAIDS. The past 20 years have seen immense loss, as well as significant \nmedical advances, and this anniversary is a fitting time to renew the \nworldwide call for stronger action in the battle against this \ndevastating global epidemic.\n  Tragically, current reports from the CDC and from the Retrovirus \nConference in Chicago indicate that the transmission of HIV is \nincreasing among our youngest citizens. At least 50 percent of new \ninfections in the U.S. occur in those under 25 years of age. Clearly, \nwe can do more to combat this serious challenge that threatens to \nblight the lives of many of the Nation's youth.\n  Our concern extends far beyond America's borders. President Bush has \npledged $200 million for HIV/AIDS internationally, but we need to do \nfar more, especially to help combat this massive HIV/AIDS crisis in \ndeveloping nations. From orphaned children, to untrained workforces, to \ndestabilized economies, the realities of HIV/AIDS in third-world \nnations are harsh. Today, nearly 40 million people worldwide continue \nto live with HIV/AIDS.\n  Dealing more effectively with this global epidemic requires a \nstronger commitment from all of us both in Congress and in the \nadministration, so that medical advances will benefit as many people as \npossible worldwide. The United States can set a proud example for the \nworld community in dealing with HIV/AIDS by doing all we can to provide \nthe resources needed for effective prevention programs, good treatment \nfor those suffering from HIV/AIDS, and the development of a cure that \nwill finally conquer it and save the lives of millions.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to note the 20th \nanniversary of the passing of a constituent of mine . . . one of the \nfive original deaths sited by a CDC report published 20 years ago \ntoday. Though the 553-word article only outlined a rare type of \npneumonia--it also noted that the same strain had struck five gay men \nin Los Angeles, California. One of those five men in Los Angeles was an \nOregonian and I stand here today to mark this somber anniversary.\n  The world marks this date, June 5, 1981 as ground zero for the AIDS \nepidemic. Those early days marked a panic among urban populations of \ngay men, who at first made up the bulk of early AIDS cases. It wasn't \nuntil 1984 that researchers identified the AIDS virus, and throughout \nthe 1980s much of the gay community's efforts were focused on \norganization and education, which became the hallmark for the early \nfight against AIDS. As this Nation all too slowly wakened to this \nepidemic, much of the groundwork had been laid by a community \ndevastated by this disease. Slowly funding on the Federal level grew, \nand by the mid 1990s new drugs slowed but did not stop the progression \nof the disease.\n  Today 36 million people are HIV-positive: almost a million in the \nUnited States alone, and almost a third of them don't know they have \nHIV. AIDS is the fourth leading cause of death globally and the leading \ncause of death in Africa. The statistics in that continent are mind-\nnumbing--in some countries, one of four adults are living with HIV/\nAIDS. Life expectancies in those countries over the next five years \nhave been slashed from the mid-60s to the early forties. Cumulative \ndeaths attributable to AIDS on that continent numbered over 13 million \nby 1999, and the number of children orphaned by AIDS is estimated \nbetween 7 and 10 million. An estimated 1 million children in Africa are \nHIV-positive.\n  There were about 5,000 cases of AIDS in Oregon last year, and the \nNational Institutes of Health allocated over $16 million to \nuniversities and other institutions in the state to conduct research \nfor the treatment of HIV/AIDS. In addition the government provided\n\n[[Page S5825]]\n\nabout $800,000 in grants under the Housing Opportunities for Persons \nwith AIDS program.\n  But this day is not one solely devoted to statistics about this \ndisease. Though the numbers are mind-numbing, sometimes the most \ndevastating loss is measured in terms of those who contributed to our \nculture, our society, through literature, sports, public service and \nprivate business. AIDS has created a loss for our society in terms of \nbooks not written, music not played, business left undone, research \nundiscovered--put simply--lives not lived. On this somber anniversary I \nstand here on the Senate floor to note that one of the first was an \nOregonian, a man named ``Chuck'' whose medical history is annotated in \na CDC report released twenty years ago. Today's Washington Post noted \nonly a sliver of his life--that he was from Oregon and that he had a \npenchant for wearing cowboy boots. Chuck has been dead for 19 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/05/senate-section/article/S5825-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5825-S5826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Caucus on \nInternational Narcotics Control, I rise today to compliment the men and \nwomen of the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA. As chairman, I have \nwatched these American heroes work day and night on the front lines of \nthe struggle against international drug trafficking.\n  DEA's mission is to identify, target, and dismantle the most powerful \ndrug syndicates operating around the world that smuggle their poison \ninto American communities. These syndicates are far more powerful and \nviolent than any organized criminal groups that American law \nenforcement has yet encountered. Unlike traditional organized crime, \nthese 21st century crooks operate globally with transnational networks \nto conduct illicit enterprises simultaneously in many different \ncountries.\n  The drug traffickers whom DEA faces pose nothing less than a foreign \nthreat to the national security of the United States. International \ntrafficking groups today have at their disposal the most sophisticated \ncommunications technology and their arsenal includes radar-equipped \naircraft, advanced weaponry, and an army of workers who oversee the \ndrug business from the source zones to the urban areas and rural \nlocations within the United States. These drug traffickers reach even \ninto my home State of Iowa, in America's heartland. Local, rural police \nand sheriffs departments must now deal with international organized \ncrime.\n  All of this modern technology and these vast resources enable the \nleaders of international criminal groups to build organizations that, \ntogether with their surrogates operating within the United States, \nreach into all parts of America. The leaders of these crime groups use \ntheir organizations to carry out the work of transporting drugs into \nthe United States, and franchise others to distribute drugs, thereby \nallowing them to remain beyond the reach of American justice. Those \ninvolved in international drug trafficking often generate such \ntremendous profits that they are able to corrupt law enforcement, \nmilitary and political officials overseas in order to create and retain \na safe haven for themselves. DEA's focus on international trafficking \norganizations makes that agency a critical and effective weapon in \ncountering this threat to our way of life, here and abroad.\n  The threat posed by Colombian drug traffickers is particularly dire. \nThe international drug syndicates headquartered in Colombia, and \noperating through Mexico and the Caribbean, control both the sources \nand the flow of many dangerous drugs into the United States. The vast \nmajority of the cocaine entering the United States continues to come \nfrom the source countries of Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru. For the past \ntwo decades--up to recent years--criminal syndicates from Colombia \nruled the drug trade with an iron fist, increasing their profit margin \nby controlling the entire continuum of the cocaine market. Their \ncontrol ranged from the wholesale cocaine base production in Peru, \nBolivia, and Colombia, to the cocaine hydrochloride, HCL, production \nand processing centers in Colombia, to the wholesale distribution of \ncocaine on the streets of the United States.\n  In response to this threat, the DEA carries out cutting-edge, \nsophisticated investigations like Millennium and White Horse which have \nled to the dismantling of major portions of the most significant drug \ntrafficking organizations operating not just out of Colombia, but \nthroughout the world. DEA's accomplishments could take hours to review \nin detail, but let me mention just a few here today.\n  In 1999, Operation Millennium successfully targeted major traffickers \nwho had previously operated without fear of capture or prosecution in \nthe United States, believing that only their low-level operatives were \nat risk. This enforcement operation effectively demonstrated that even \nthe highest level traffickers based in foreign countries could not \nmanage drug operations inside the United States with impunity. \nOperation Millennium was made possible by direct support from the \ngovernments of Colombia and Mexico, and underscore the importance of \ncooperation among international drug law enforcement agencies.\n  In November 2000, DEA, FBI, and U.S. Customs culminated an 18 month \ninvestigation targeting a multi-ethnic, transnational MDMA, Ecstasy, \nand cocaine distribution organization, following up on enforcement \naction by Dutch police in the Netherlands. The investigation, known as \nOperation Red Tide, was a textbook example of the new multi-agency, \nmulti-national law enforcement cooperation needed to thwart organized \ncrime in the 21st Century. As a result of this cooperative effort, \n1,096 pounds, 2.1 million tablets, of MDMA, the largest single seizure \nof the drug in history, were seized by U.S. Customs agents. The head of \nthe organization, Tamer Adel Ibrahim, fled the U.S. after the seizure, \nbut was quickly traced to Mexico and then to Europe by the multi-agency \nteam. Ibrahim, along with others, were arrested and 1.2 million tablets \nof MDMA were seized by the Dutch National Police.\n  Cases similar to Operation Red Tide exemplify the unprecedented level \nof international law enforcement cooperation in effect today. The \ninvestigation targeting the transnational MDMA and cocaine trafficking \nsyndicate was a cooperative effort by the U.S. law enforcement \nagencies, as well as the Dutch National Police/Regional Team South, \nMexico's Fiscalia Especializad Para La Atencion De Delitos, FEADS, the \nIsraeli National Police, the German Federal Police, Bundes Kriminal \nAmt, the Cologne, Germany Police Department, the Duissburg Germany \nPolice Department, the Italian National Police and the French National \nPolice.\n\n  This investigation is extremely important because MDMA, Ecstasy, is a \nnew threat with a potential to cause great damage, especially to \nAmerica's youth. Operation Red Tide has ensured that a large volume of \necstasy that would have made it into the hands of our youth never hit \nthe streets. It has sent a strong message to the traffickers that the \nUnited States and DEA is leading a global response to the drug threat.\n  Last December, the DEA, again together with U.S. Customs and the FBI, \ncompleted Operation Impunity II, resulting in 82 arrests and the \nseizure of 5,266 kilograms of cocaine, 9,708 pounds of marijuana, and \napproximately $10,890,295 in U.S. currency. Impunity II follows earlier \nsuccesses dating back to 1996 in Operation Limelight and Operation \nImpunity I--and was the result of the outstanding coordination between \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement officials and prosecutors \nacross the country.\n  Operation Impunity II was a multi-agency law enforcement program that \ntargeted a wide ranging conspiracy to smuggle thousands of pounds of \ncocaine and marijuana from Mexico, across the southwest border into \nTexas, for distribution throughout the United States. The organization \nplaced managers in the United States and retained the organizational \ncommand and control elements in Mexico. In addition to remnants from \nthe Carrillo-Fuentes organization, U.S. agents learned that some \nmembers of the Mexican Gulf Cartel had also become associated with the \norganization, including Osiel Cardenas-Guillen, allegedly a former Gulf \nCartel lieutenant.\n\n[[Page S5826]]\n\n  You may remember that Cardenas-Guillen is also charged with assault \non an FBI agent and a DEA agent in Matamoros, Mexico, on November 9, \n1999. Clearly this operation sends a clear signal that if traffickers \nthreaten or harm a federal agent, they will not get away with impunity.\n  In January of this year, Operation White Horse targeted a large scale \nheroin trafficking organization, directed by Wilson Salazar-Maldonado, \nwhich was responsible for sending multi-kilogram quantities of heroin \nfrom Colombia to the Northeastern United States via Aruba. The \ninvestigation was conducted jointly by the Colombian National Police, \nDEA Bogota, Curacao, Philadelphia and New York, and the Special \nOperations Division. This investigation resulted in 96 arrests, as well \nas the seizure of multi-kilograms quantities of heroin and cocaine, \nweapons and U.S. currency.\n  DEA remains committed to its primary goal of targeting and arresting \nthe most significant drug traffickers in the world today. Their \nsuccesses include not only the operations I just mentioned, but also \nthe historic destruction of the Cali and Medellin Cartels. DEA meets \nthe ultimate test of bringing to justice the drug lords who control \ntheir vast empires of crime, which bring misery to so many nations. As \nwe sustain a relentless assault against drug traffickers, we must \ninsist that these drug lords be arrested, tried and convicted, and \nsentenced in their own countries to prison terms commensurate with \ntheir crimes, or, as appropriate, extradited to the United States to \nface justice in U.S. courts. I hope other Senators will join with me in \nacknowledging the fine work by DEA, and in supporting their efforts in \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/05/senate-section/article/S5826-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE, RESEARCH AND EDUCATION \n                           AMENDMENTS OF 2001\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, S. 805, introduced on May 1, 2001 by Senator \nWellstone, is a vital step toward the day when advanced research will \nfind ways to halt, and even cure, the maladies of muscular dystrophy.\n  Muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder--actually, nine separate \ngenetic disorders that cause wasting of muscle tissue throughout the \nbody. One-quarter of a million Americans of all ages suffer from the \ndisease. One form of it, Duchenne's, strikes young boys, and usually \ntakes their lives before they reach their twentieth birthday. All forms \nof it are disabling and costly.\n  Since 1966, the entertainer Jerry Lewis has conducted a telethon on \nLabor Day, calling the nation's attention to muscular dystrophy, and \nasking help for its victims and their families. The Muscular Dystrophy \nAssociation, which Jerry Lewis chairs, has raised hundreds of millions \nof dollars for the treatment and relief of this disease. It supports \nover two hundred clinics, and makes wheelchairs and braces available to \npeople suffering from muscular dystrophy.\n  Part of the money the association raises--about $30 million yearly--\ngoes to support research projects. But for the breakthroughs to occur \nthat will enable scientists not just to treat, but to halt the disease, \nresearch funding must be substantially increased. This is the purpose \nof S. 805.\n  S. 805 calls upon the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the \nCenters for Disease Control to establish Centers of Excellence, in \nwhich intensified clinical research can be conducted that will speed \nthe discovery of cures for the various forms of muscular dystrophy. \nThis legislation would provide the Director of the NIH, and the \nDirectors of the several institutes within the NIH where research into \nmuscular dystrophy is being conducted, with authority and \nresponsibility to concentrate and intensify that research effort, with \nthe funds needed to conduct clinical trials. In short, it gives NIH the \norganization and the mandate to exploit recent advances in gene \ntherapy. The goal is the swiftest possible rescue for children and \nadults whose lives will otherwise be lost or badly damaged by muscular \ndystrophy.\n  The Congress has responded generously and often to the demand for \nresearch funding aimed at other diseases that shorten or impair the \nlives of Americans. It is time to add muscular dystrophy to the list of \nthose diseases. I commend my colleagues for introducing S. 805, and I \nask that my name be added as a cosponsor of the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/05/senate-section/article/S5826-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a heinous crime that occurred August 11, \n2000 in New York City. A 17-year-old, who announced to his parents he \nwas gay earlier this year, was recovering after his parents severely \nbeat him. Police say that Hendrick Paterson, 49, and Sharon Paterson, \n36, allegedly repeatedly smashed their son with a lead pipe at a \nrelative's home as they yelled anti-gay slurs. ``God will punish you \nfor your lifestyle!'' ``You can't be gay,'' the couple is quoted as \nsaying. The son was rushed to the hospital where he was treated and \nreleased for multiple welts to his body.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/05/senate-section/article/S5826-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5826-S5827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, the latest round of violence in the \nMiddle East has dealt more pain and suffering to the people of that \nregion, as well as another blow to the peace process. And though I \nremain firmly convinced that a final status agreement--which provides \nfirm and enforceable security guarantees for Israel--remains not only \nthe most desirable way out of the cycle of violence but indeed the only \nway to achieve lasting peace and security for all of the people in the \nregion, the fundamental problem at present is whether or not Yasir \nArafat is capable of ever becoming a reliable partner in the peace \nprocess. The answer, as unfortunate for future generations of \nPalestinians as for Israelis and for all of those who crave peace in \nthe Middle East, would seem to be an emphatic NO, as indicated by his \ndismissal of the historic compromise offered by then-Israeli Prime \nMinister Ehud Barak late last year. Unless and until Chairman Arafat, \nor a successor, can demonstrate the capacity to make peace as well as \nwar, the outlook for the Middle East peace process will remain bleak.\n  Thomas Friedman makes this case effectively and forcefully in a May \n22 editorial in the New York Times, entitled ``It Only Gets Worse.'' I \nask unanimous consent that the Friedman editorial be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 22, 2001]\n\n                           It Only Gets Worse\n\n                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)\n\n       The long-awaited Mitchell commission report about Israeli-\n     Palestinian violence was released yesterday, and now there is \n     a debate over what to do with its recommendations. I have a \n     suggestion. It's kind of a two-for-one deal. Take all the \n     Mitchell reports, make a big pile out of them, and set them \n     ablaze into a gigantic bonfire. It would surely generate \n     enough heat, and light, to make a small contribution to the \n     Bush energy plan.\n       Am I being unfair? Yes, just a bit. George Mitchell is a \n     good man, and the central argument of his report is right, in \n     the narrowest sense: If you want to stop the latest Israeli-\n     Palestinian slide into the abyss, first there must be a \n     cessation of all violence, and then confidence-building \n     steps, including a settlements freeze and Palestinian \n     security measures.\n       My problem with the Mitchell report is that it \n     fundamentally ignores how we got into this abyss and the only \n     real way out. It is not because of Israeli settlements. The \n     settlements are foolish, and their continued expansion is a \n     shameful act of colonial coercion that will meet the fate of \n     all other colonial enterprises in history. The inability of \n     American Jewish leaders or U.S. governments to speak out \n     against settlement expansion--which should be stopped under \n     any conditions for Israel's sake--is a blot on all of them.\n       But the settlements are not the core problem. The core \n     problem right now is Yasir\n\n[[Page S5827]]\n\n     Arafat--the Palestinian leader who cannot say ``yes'' and \n     will not say ``uncle.''\n       President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Ehud Barak put on \n     the table before Mr. Arafat a historic compromise proposal \n     that would have given Palestinians control of 94 to 96 \n     percent of the West Bank and Gaza--with all the settlements \n     removed, virtually all of Arab East Jerusalem, a return to \n     Israel of a symbolic number of Palestinian refugees and \n     either the right of return to the West Bank and Gaza or \n     compensation for all the others.\n       Not only would Mr. Arafat not take it, he would not even \n     say: ``Well, this was insufficient, but this is the most far-\n     reaching and serious proposal Palestinians have ever seen. \n     Now, I want to enter into a dialogue with the Israeli people \n     and government to see if I can get them to 100 percent.''\n       No, instead, Mr. Arafat launched this idiotic uprising. He \n     did so because he is essentially a political coward and \n     maneuverer, who apparently has not given up his long-term aim \n     of eliminating Israel and who was afraid in the short run \n     that if he took 99 percent, he would be killed for the 1 \n     percent he left on the table. Mr. Arafat has never been \n     willing to tell his people he got them most of what they \n     wanted and now is the time to end the suffering of as many \n     Palestinians as possible and move on.\n       This truth is what the Mitchell ``investigation'' should be \n     telling the world and the Palestinians. There was an Israeli \n     leader, and a slim Israeli majority, for a fair historic \n     compromise. But there was no Palestinian equivalent, and \n     unless there is a Palestinian partner, and a Palestinian \n     leader, for a historic compromise roughly along the Clinton \n     lines, no cease-fire is going to hold.\n       The best Hebrew biography of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel \n     Sharon is entitled ``He Doesn't Stop at Red Lights.'' Mr. \n     Arafat's biography should be entitled ``He Doesn't Go at \n     Green Lights.''\n       Now Mr. Sharon--who was elected in the Israeli backlash \n     against the failure of Camp David--is trying to pummel Mr. \n     Arafat into submission. That won't work either. Because Mr. \n     Arafat is as afraid to say ``uncle'' to Sharon as much as he \n     was afraid to say ``yes'' to Clinton. He fears he would be \n     killed for saying uncle as much as he would be killed for \n     saying yes to 99 percent. The Palestinians will never be \n     bombed into submission. One hundred years of Palestinian \n     history tells you that.\n       The real problem is that the Palestinians are leaderless \n     today, and that is what the U.S., the U.N. and the Arab would \n     have to face up to. Deep down, they all know it and they \n     admit it to each other in private. There is no Palestinian \n     leader right now willing or able to say yes to a fair \n     historic compromise, and we simply fool ourselves with \n     commissions that don't acknowledge that. Unless the Arabs can \n     stiffen Mr. Arafat by supporting him in any grand compromise, \n     or by creating a context in which an alternative leadership \n     can emerge, this bonfire will rage on and it will consume \n     many, many others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/05/senate-section/article/S5827-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to one of \nNevada's finest ladies, Lillian Wallace. Born in New Haven, CN on June \n13, 1911. Lillian attended P.S. 132 and graduated from George \nWashington High School. In 1941, she joined the Army Medical Corps as a \ngeneral clerk and was promoted to head of the Medical Supply Division. \nHaving a life long desire to see California, Lillian moved there after \nthe war and met her future husband, Julian. They drove to Las Vegas to \nwed in 1947 and later became residents of Nevada. Together, they \ndevoted their lives to helping those who needed help, particularly \nsenior citizens. They worked with the Mobile Home Owners League of the \nSilver State, an organization that fights for the rights of mobile home \nowners. Lillian also gave her time to Hadassah and the City of Hope \nMedical Center.\n  In 1982, she and Julian took a floundering group called Seniors \nUnited, and turned it into one of the most formidable seniors advocacy \ngroups in Nevada. Lillian created the Senior Highlights magazine and \nhas been the editor for 17 years. She takes great pride in choosing \narticles that are of interest and educational to our senior population. \nShe believes in promoting the positive aspects of government and giving \ngovernment officials a chance to meet with Seniors United members to \ndiscuss the issues. Lillian has always believed that education is the \nkey to getting people to respect their government and get involved.\n  Lillian lost her beloved husband and soulmate last year. Moving \nforward alone has been one of her greatest challenges in life, but she \nlooks to the future and continues to help seniors in need and work on \nthe expansion of Seniors United. Her contributions to the seniors of \nthe State of Nevada are legend and the honors she has received are too \nnumerous to mention. I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing this \ngrand dame of Nevada a happy 90th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/05/senate-section/article/S5827-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WE THE PEOPLE\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, We the People . . . The Citizen and \nConstitution program, administered by the Center for Civic Education, \nhas provided curricular materials at upper elementary, middle, and high \nschool levels for more than 26.5 million students nationwide. The \nprogram provides students with an in-depth, working knowledge of our \nConstitution, the Bill of Rights, and the principles of democratic \ngovernment. Members of Congress and their staff enhance the program by \ndiscussing current constitutional issues with students and teachers, as \nwell as by participating in other educational activities.\n  The class from Stillwater High School, in Stillwater, MN, took part \nin the program's national competition here in Washington, D.C., April \n21st-23rd, 2001. I would like to thank the students, Lindsay Jasicki, \nLeah Abbe, Aaron Williamson, Patrick Hueller, Anders Johnson, Stephanie \nEbner, Aaron Ulland, Lee Howard, Jessica Mcglauflin, Kyle Ellefson, \nJeffrey Morency, Jordan Hild, Rebecca Siemers, Patrick Horst, Blake \nRasmussen, and David Hoffman and their teacher, Ms. Kathleen Ferguson, \nfor representing Minnesota at this prestigious event.

LIBRARY HONORED\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, It is official. The Richland \nCounty Public Library is the best library system in the country. \nLibrary Journal magazine and the Gale Group, the Nation's largest \npublisher of reference works for libraries, recently named the Richland \nlibrary the National Library of the Year 2001. The library's executive \ndirector, C. David Warren, will accept the award on June 18 at a \nceremony in San Francisco during the annual conference of the American \nLibrary Association. This honor is the latest in a string of honors \nbestowed on Richland County's system. In 1999, the American Library \nAssociation chose the library as the No. 1 large library system in the \nSoutheast and, in 2000, Hennen's American Public Library Ratings ranked \nit fourth among urban libraries serving populations of 250,000-499,999. \nIt was only a matter of time before it earned top billing nationwide.\n  Three key factors influenced selection of the Library of the Year: \nservice to the community, creativity in developing community programs \nand leadership in creating programs that other libraries can emulate. \nThe Richland library shines in each of these areas\n\n[[Page S5828]]\n\nthanks to the hard work of Mr. Warren, his staff, the Friends of the \nLibrary group, the County Council and voters. In 1989, voters approved \na $27 million bond referendum used to build a striking new main library \non Assembly Street and seven new branches. Many Richland County \nresidents already knew they had a gem on their hands, but it sure is \nnice to have that pride substantiated by such a prestigious honor. I \ncommend the Richland County Public Library for its outstanding service \nand wish Mr. Warren and his staff the best of luck as they continue to \nbuild an exemplary library system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/05/senate-section/article/S5828-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            IN RECOGNITION OF THE ALLENHURST FIRE DEPARTMENT\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

A bill to promote primary and secondary health promotion and \ndisease prevention services and activities among the elderly, to amend \ntitle XVIII of the Social Security Act to add preventive health \nbenefits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues \nSenators Jeffords, Kennedy, Lugar, Bingaman, Chafee, Murray, Hollings, \nRockefeller, Levin, Lincoln, and Corzine, to introduce the Medicare \nWellness Act.\n  For too long, the Medicare approach to health care has been wholly \nreactive. Benefits are designed to treat illness and disability once a \nrecipient is already suffering. This approach is outdated. It is time \nfor Medicare to become pro-active. It is time to focus on helping \npeople to prevent disease in the first place so that they may live not \njust longer, but more fulfilling lives.\n  The Medicare Wellness Act shifts the focus of Medicare, changing it \nfrom a program that simply treats illness to one that promotes \nwellness. For this reason, The Medicare Wellness Act has support from a \nbroad range of groups, including the National Council on Aging, the \nAmerican College of Preventive Medicine, the American Heart \nAssociation, and the National Osteoporosis Foundation.\n  Currently, 70 percent of medical spending is the result of \npreventable illnesses, many of which occur in older adults. It does not \nhave to be this way. Research shows that declines in health are not \ninevitable with age. In fact, many chronic diseases can be prevented by \nmaking lifestyle changes such as taking up an exercise program\n\n[[Page S5834]]\n\nor quitting smoking. A healthier lifestyle adopted at any time during \none's lifetime can increase active life expectancy and decrease disease \nand disability.\n  The Medicare Wellness Act helps promote preventive health care among \nolder Americans, first by adding to the list of Medicare benefits \nseveral services that we know to be effective in preventing disease.\n  These benefits focus on some of the most prominent, underlying risk \nfactors for illness that face all Medicare beneficiaries, including: \nScreening for hypertension, counseling for tobacco cessation, medical \nnutrition therapy services for cardiovascular patients, counseling for \npost-menopausal women, screening for vision and hearing loss, expanded \nscreening for osteoporosis, and screening for cholesterol.\n  The addition of these new benefits represent the highest \nrecommendations for Medicare beneficiaries in the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force, recognized as the gold standard within the \nprevention community, and the Institute of Medicine.\n  The benefits can help reduce Medicare beneficiaries' risk for health \nproblems such as stroke, cancer, osteoporosis, and heart disease.\n  Other major components of our bill include the establishment of the \nHealthy Seniors Promotion Program. This program will be led by an \ninteragency group within the Department of Health and Human Services, \nwhich will look at existing preventive benefits and offer suggestions \nto make their use more widespread.\n  This point is critical.\n  The fact is that there are a number of prevention-related services \navailable to Medicare beneficiaries today, including mammograms and \ncolorectal cancer screening. But those services are seriously \nunderutilized. A study published by Dartmouth University, The Dartmouth \nAtlas of Health Care 1999, found that only 28 percent of women age 65-\n69 receive mammograms and only 12 percent of beneficiaries were \nscreened for colorectal cancer. These are disturbing figures.\n  Additionally, the Medicare Wellness Act incorporates an aggressive \napplied research effort to investigate new methods of improving the \nhealth of Medicare beneficiaries and the management of chronic \ndiseases.\n  Further, our bill would establish a health education and risk \nappraisal program aimed at major behavioral risk factors such as diet, \nexercise, alcohol and tobacco use, and depression.\n  This program will target both pre-65 individuals and current Medicare \nbeneficiaries and will strive to increase awareness among individuals \nof major risk factors that impact health, to change personal health \nhabits, to improve health status, and ultimately to save the Medicare \nprogram money.\n  In addition to new research on prevention among Medicare \nbeneficiaries, the Medicare Wellness Act would require several reports \nto assess the overall scientific validity of the Medicare preventive \nbenefits package.\n  First, our bill would require the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission, known as MedPAC, to report to Congress every three years on \nwhether the Medicare program needs to change over time in order to \nensure that Medicare benefits are appropriate for the population being \nserved and is as comprehensive as private insurance plans offered.\n  Currently, there is no regular assessment to ensure that Medicare is \nproviding a healthcare package that is up-to-date with either the \ncurrent needs of seniors or current scientific findings. Quite frankly, \nMedicare hasn't kept up with the rest of the health care world, we need \nto do better.\n  A second study that our bill would require is one in which the \ninstitute of Medicine, IOM, would assess, every three years, the \nscientific validity of the entire Medicare preventive benefits package.\n  The study will be presented to Congress in a manner that mirrors The \nTrade Act of 1974. The Institute of Medicine's recommendations would be \npresented to Congress in legislative form. Congress would then have 60 \ndays to either accept or reject the recommendations. But Congress could \nnot change the recommendations themselves.\n  This ``fast-track'' process is a deliberate effort to get Congress \nout of the business of micro-managing the Medicare program allowing \nscience to dictate the medical needs of seniors in America.\n  In the aggregate, the Medicare Wellness Act represents the most \ncomprehensive legislative proposal in the 107th Congress for the \nMedicare program focused on health promotion and disease prevention for \nbeneficiaries. It represents sound health policy based on sound \nscience.\n  However, at a time when there is concern over the solvency of \nMedicare and concern that it won't be able to provide future seniors \nwith the health care that they are promised, one may question whether \nit is wise to expand upon benefits already offered. And one is wise to \ndo so.\n  However, the issue of prevention is different.\n  Benjamin Franklin was truly on the mark when he first said that ``an \nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure''. Offering preventive \ncare under Medicare, or the ``ounce of prevention,'' will definitely \ncost the government money up front. However, this initial outlay of \ndollars will be returned in terms of costs saved in the long run by \navoiding long-term, cost intensive treatments, or the ``pound of \ncure''.\n  And, just as important, although unmeasurable, will be the enhanced \nquality of life for seniors. Prevention helps us all to live more \nhealthy lives in the long run which translates into more productive and \nfulfilling lives as well.\n  Today, many people continue to work beyond the age of 65 contributing \nto the workforce and the economy. However, they are only able to do so \nif their health allows.\n  When considering the future of Medicare, the question really comes \ndown to this. Is the value of improved quality of life for seniors and \ntheir ability to maintain healthy, functional and productive lives \nworth the expenditure?\n  While improving Medicare's financial outlook for future generations \nis imperative, we must do it in a way that gives our seniors the \nability to live longer, healthier and valued lives.\n  I believe that by pursuing a prevention strategy that addresses some \nthe most fundamental risk factors for chronic illness and disability \nthat face seniors, we will make an invaluable contribution to the \nMedicare reform debate and, more importantly, to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join us on this important bill and to \nwork with us to ensure that the provisions of the bill are reflected in \nany Medicare reform legislation that is debated and voted on this year \nin the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of groups supporting this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n          Groups Supporting the Medicare Wellness Act of 2001\n\n       American Cancer Society.\n       American College of Preventive Medicine.\n       American Dietetic Association.\n       American Geriatrics Society.\n       American Heart Association.\n       American Lung Association.\n       American Physical Therapy Association.\n       American Public Health Association.\n       American Speech-Language Hearing Association.\n       Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids.\n       Families USA.\n       National Campaign for Hearing Health.\n       National Osteoporosis Foundation.\n       National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n     Medicare.\n       National Council on Aging.\n       National Chronic Care Association.\n       National Mental Health Association.\n       Partnership for Prevention.\n       Strong Women Inside and Out.\n       United Cerebral Palsy Associations.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Graham \ntoday in introducing the Medicare Wellness Act of 2001. Our Nation's \nrapidly growing senior population and the ongoing search for cost-\neffective health care have led to the development of this important \nlegislation. The goal of the Medicare Wellness Act is to increase \naccess to preventive health services, improve the quality of life for \nAmerica's seniors, and increase the cost-effectiveness of the Medicare \nprogram.\n  Congress created the Medicare program in 1965 to provide health \ninsurance for Americans age 65 and over.\n\n[[Page S5835]]\n\n From the outset, the program has focused on coverage for hospital \nservices needed for an unexpected or intensive illness. In recent \nyears, however, a great escalation in program expenditures and an \nincrease in knowledge about the value of preventive care have forced \npolicy makers to re-evaluate the current Medicare benefit package.\n  The Medicare Wellness Act adds to the Medicare program those benefits \nrecommended by the Institute of Medicine and the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force. These include: screening for hypertension, \ncounseling for tobacco cessation, counseling for hormone replacement \ntherapy, screening for vision and hearing loss, cholesterol screening, \nexpanded screening for osteoporosis, and nutrition therapy counseling \nor seniors with cardiovascular disease. These services address the most \nprominent risk factors facing Medicare beneficiaries.\n  In 1997 and again in 2000, Congress added several new preventive \nbenefits to the Medicare program through the Balanced Budget Act and \nthe Beneficiary Improvement and Protection Act. These benefits included \nannual mammography, diabetes self-management, prostate cancer \nscreening, pelvic examinations, glaucoma screening, and colorectal \ncancer screening. Congress's next logical step is to incorporate the \nnine new screening and counseling benefits in the Medicare Wellness \nAct. If these symptoms are addressed regularly, beneficiaries will have \na head start on fighting the conditions they lead to, such as diabetes, \nlung cancer, heart disease, blindness, osteoporosis, and many others.\n  Research suggests that insurance coverage encourages the use of \npreventive and other health care services. The Medicare Wellness Act \nalso eliminates the deductibles and coinsurance for new and current \npreventive benefits in the program. Because screening services are \ndirected at people without symptoms, this will further encourage the \nuse of services by reducing the cost barrier to care. Increased use of \nscreening services will mean that problems will be caught earlier, \nwhich will permit more successful treatment. This will save the \nMedicare program money because it is cheaper to screen for an illness \nand treat its early diagnosis than to pay for drastic hospital \nprocedures at a later date.\n  However, financial access is not the only barrier to the use of \npreventive care services. Other barriers include low levels of \neducation or information for beneficiaries. That is why the Medicare \nWellness Act instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \ncoordinate with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the \nHealth Care Financing Administration to establish a Risk Appraisal and \nEducation Program within Medicare. This program will target both \ncurrent beneficiaries and individuals below the age of 65 who have high \nrisk factors. Outreach to these groups will offer questions regarding \nmajor behavioral risk factors, including the lack of proper nutrition, \nthe use of alcohol, the lack of regular exercise, the use of tobacco, \nand depression. State of the art software, case managers, and nurse \nhotlines will then identify what conditions beneficiaries are at risk \nfor, based on their individual responses to the questions, then refer \nthem to preventive screening services in their area and inform them of \nactions they can take to lead a healthier life.\n  The Medicare Wellness Act also establishes the Healthy Seniors \nPromotion Program. This program will bring together all the agencies \nwithin the Department of Health and Human Services that address the \nmedical, social and behavioral issues affecting the elderly to increase \nknowledge about and utilization of prevention services among the \nelderly, and develop better ways to prevent or delay the onset of age-\nrelated disease or disability.\n  Now is the time for Medicare to catch up with current health science. \nWe need a Medicare program that will serve the health care needs of \nAmerica's seniors by utilizing up-to-date knowledge on healthy aging. \nEffective health care must address the whole health of an individual. A \nlifestyle that includes proper exercise and nutrition, and access to \nregular disease screening ensures that proper attention is being paid \nto the whole individual, not just a solitary body part. It is time we \nreaffirm our commitment to provide our Nation's seniors with quality \nhealth care.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues in Congress will examine this \nlegislation and realize the inadequacy of the current package of \npreventive benefits in the Medicare program. We have the opportunity to \ntransform Medicare from an out-dated sickness program to a modern \nwellness program. I want to thank Senator Bob Graham and all the other \ncosponsors of the Medicare Wellness Act who are supporting this bold \nstep towards successful Medicare reform.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join Senator Graham \nand Senator Jeffords in introducing the Medicare Wellness Act of 2001, \nMedicare reform for the 21st century. This important legislation will \nmake it easier for senior citizens to take advantage of the preventive \nbenefits to them, while strengthening Medicare at the same time.\n  Greater investment in the health of the nation's elderly is long \noverdue. Although we have made significant progress in reducing chronic \ndisability among older Americans, we still have a long way to go. \nAccording to the World Health Organization, the United States ranks \nbehind 23 other nations in ``healthy life expectancy.'' Surely, we can \ndo better than that.\n  Each year, chronic disability adds $26 billion to the nation's health \ncare costs. Unless we act, the burden of these costs will become \nincreasingly unbearable for countless senior citizens. In the next 30 \nyears, Medicare will be under even heavier pressures as the baby boom \ngeneration retires. Nearly one fifth of the population will be 65 and \nolder by 2025, which means that a larger number of beneficiaries will \nbe supported by a smaller number of workers. To avoid hard remedies \nsuch as benefit cuts or tax increases, we should do all we can to \nreduce future Medicare costs by improving the health of senior \ncitizens.\n  According to a study at Duke University, if the 1.3 percent decline \nin disability achieved over the last 12 years can be raised to 1.5 \npercent, we can potentially save enough in Medicare to avoid any \nsubstantial long-term increase in Medicare tax or reduction in \nbenefits. The Medicare Wellness Act attempt to do that. It waives cost-\nsharing for a series of preventive benefits, provides individual health \nrisk appraisals, encourages a falls prevention campaign, and funds \npilot projects and new research on the most effective ways to encourage \nsenior citizens to adopt healthier lifestyles.\n  Prevention saves lives and saves money. Screening can often be the \ndifference between a successful battle with cancer and a failed one. \nColorectral cancers, for example, have a five-year survival rate of up \nto 90 percent if detected at an early stage--but currently only 37 \npercent of these cancers are actually diagnosed early. Unfortunately, \nscreening tests are significantly under-used by Medicare beneficiaries. \nOnly approximately a third of men and women at-risk for these cancers \nare currently being screened.\n  Our bill helps to combat this problem by eliminating cost-sharing and \ndeductibles for a wide range of preventive services, such as screening \nfor colorectral cancers, mammography, screening for glaucoma, bone mass \nmeasurement, medical nutrition therapy services, and screening for \ncholesterol problems and hypertension.\n  The Medicare Wellness Act also creates a national ``falls \nprevention'' education and awareness campaign to reduce these injuries. \nOlder Americans are hospitalized for fall-related injuries five times \nmore often then they are for other types of injuries. This awareness \ncampaign will educate senior citizens about precautions they can take \nto reduce the likelihood of such injuries.\n  Clinical depression also takes a heavy toll on the nation's elderly. \nCompared to all other age groups, senior citizens have the highest \nsuicide rate in the nation. Twenty percent of persons age 55 and older \nsuffer from a mental disorder that is not part of the normal aging \nprocess. As with so many other illnesses, depression is under-diagnosed \namong the elderly. This bill provides needed funding for demonstration \nprojects to screen for depression, so that elderly persons suffering \nfrom this problem can be diagnosed and referred to specialists for the \ntreatment they need.\n\n[[Page S5836]]\n\n  The Medicare Wellness Act also encourages senior citizens to improve \ntheir health and reduce the risks of illness in other ways. Typical \nfactors leading to poor health include smoking, physical inactivity, \nand excessive use of alcohol. A health risk appraisal initiative under \nthe Act will given senior citizens the individual attention they need \nto make the changes in lifestyle necessary to improve their health.\n  In addition, the Medicare Wellness Act encourages research to explore \nthe most effective ways to improve Medicare's role in preventing \ndisease and improving health. Pilot programs are authorized to \nexperiment with innovative ways to promote healthier lifestyles and \nreach out to senior citizens in various settings.\n  Federal agencies will undertake particular research programs on these \nissues. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission is asked to evaluate \nMedicare benefits in relation to private sector benefits. The National \nInstitute on Aging is asked to report on ways to improve the quality of \nlife for the elderly. The Institute of Medicine is asked to make \nrecommendations to Congress about the medical and cost effectiveness of \nexisting Medicare benefits and the potential benefit of preventive \nservices.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. The \nMedicare Wellness Act can be a significant contribution to healthier \nsenior citizens and a healthier Medicare.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 983.

A bill to improve the Veterans Beneficiary Travel Program of \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President I rise today to introduce the Veterans Road \nto Health Care Act 2001. This legislation would raise the travel \nreimbursement rate for veterans who must travel to Veterans \nAdministration hospitals for treatment. The current reimbursement for \nveterans is 11 cents per mile. This bill would raise that figure to \nmatch the Federal employees travel reimbursement rate which is 34.5 \ncents per mile.\n  The average price for gas in Wyoming right now is $1.63 per gallon. I \nknow it varies across the Nation. The current rate of 11 cents per \nmiles barely makes a dent in the expenses incurred by veterans who have \nno choice but travel by automobile for health care. I have received \nnumerous letters from veterans in Wyoming describing how difficult it \nis to work into their budget the money necessary to travel between \ntheir hometown and the VA hospital. Being able to access health care is \nvital, it should not be a choice between driving to receive needed \ntreatment or being able to afford other necessities.\n  In Wyoming, we have two VA hospitals, one in Cheyenne and one in \nSheridan. Veterans have to travel to one of these facilities to be \ntreated for health conditions and be covered by the health care plan \nthat the military provides for them. This poses a serious problem in \nterms of travel expense, especially with the rise in gasoline prices. \nIt was a problem before; it is a bigger problem now. Some of the \nlargest towns in Wyoming like Evanston and Cody are over 300 miles away \nfrom the nearest VA facility. A veteran living in Evanston has to drive \n360 miles to reach the nearest VA hospital, and from Cody it is about \n300 miles to the nearest facility.\n  This bill addresses the healthcare of veterans who have special \nneeds. It would allow veterans who have been referred to a special care \ncenter by their VA physician to be reimbursed under the Travel \nBeneficiary Program for their travel to the specialized facility. This \napplies only to those veterans who cannot receive adequate care at \ntheir VA facility and who have a nonservice connected disability.\n  This legislation is important to all veterans, but it is especially \nsignificant to those veterans who live in rural States, like my home \nState of Wyoming. Rural States are less populated, there is greater \ndistance between towns and far fewer options for transportation. \nWyoming has miles and miles of miles and miles. Cars are the main mode \nof transportation. In urban areas, there are more readily available \nhealth care facilities and more transportation options for accessing \nthose facilities. There are subways and bus systems and the towns and \ncities and VA hospitals are closer together.\n  I believe that the Government has a duty to compensate our service \nmen and women for the sacrifices they made defending the freedoms of \nthis country. With our current recruitment and retention problems in \nthe military, I think it is our Nation's responsibility to give \nveterans the kind of access to healthcare they have earned through \ntheir service to our country. The rising cost of gasoline should not be \nthe driving factor for a veteran to go untreated at veterans clinics. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 984\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Road to Health Care \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. IMPROVEMENT OF VETERANS BENEFICIARY TRAVEL PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Payments for Certain Additional Medical Care.--(1) \n     Section 111(b)(1) of title 38, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(G) A veteran whose travel is in connection with \n     treatment or care for a non-service-connected disability at \n     non-Department facility if the treatment or care--\n       ``(i) is provided upon the recommendation of medical \n     personnel of the Department; and\n       ``(ii) is not available at the Department facility at which \n     such recommendation is made.''.\n       (2) The amendment made by paragraph (1) shall take effect \n     on October 1, 2001, and shall apply with respect to fiscal \n     years after fiscal year 2001.\n       (b) Calculation of Expenses of Travel.--(1) Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law, in calculating expenses of travel \n     for purposes of the Veterans Beneficiary Travel Program, the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall utilize the current \n     mileage reimbursement rates for the use on official business \n     of privately owned vehicles prescribed by the Administrator \n     of General Services under section 5707(b) of title 5, United \n     States Code.\n       (2) In this subsection, the term ``Veterans Beneficiary \n     Travel Program'' means the program of payment or \n     reimbursement for necessary expenses of travel of veterans \n     and their beneficiaries prescribed under sections 111 and \n     1728 of title 38, United States Code, and under any other \n     provisions of law administered by the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs for payment or reimbursement for such expenses of \n     travel.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Smith \n        of New Hampshire, Mr. Allard, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 986. A bill to allow media coverage of court proceedings; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Sunshine \nin\n\n[[Page S5837]]\n\nthe Courtroom Act.'' This bill will give federal judges the discretion \nto allow for the photographing, electronic recording, broadcasting and \ntelevising of federal court proceedings. The Sunshine in the Courtroom \nAct will help the public become better informed about the judicial \nprocess. Moreover, this bill will help produce a healthier judiciary. \nIncreased public scrutiny will bring about greater accountability and \nhelp judges to do a better job. The sun needs to shine in on the \nfederal courts.\n  Allowing cameras in the federal courtrooms is consistent with our \nFounding Fathers' intent that trials be held in front of as many people \nas choose to attend. I believe that the First Amendment requires that \ncourt proceedings be open to the public and, by extension, the news \nmedia. The Constitution and Supreme Court both support the fundamental \nprinciples and aims of this bill. The Supreme Court has said, ``what \ntranspires in the courtroom is public property.'' Clearly, the American \nvalues of openness and education are served by using electronic media \nin federal courtrooms.\n  There are many benefits and no substantial detrimental effects to \nallowing greater public access to the inner workings of our federal \ncourts. Fifteen states conducted studies aimed specifically at the \neducational benefits derived from camera access to courtrooms. They all \ndetermined that camera coverage contributed to greater public \nunderstanding of the judicial system.\n  Moreover, the widespread use in state court proceedings show that \nstill and video cameras can be used without any problems, and that \nprocedural discipline is preserved. According to the National Center \nfor State Courts, forty-eight states allow modern audio-visual coverage \nof court proceedings under a variety of rules and conditions. My own \nState of Iowa has operated successfully in this open manner for 20 \nyears. Further, at the federal level, the Federal Judicial Center \nconducted a pilot program in 1994 which studied the effect of cameras \nin a select number of federal courts. That study found ``small or no \neffects of camera presence on participants in the proceeding, courtroom \ndecorum, or the administration of justice.''\n  I would like to note that even the Supreme Court has recognized that \nthere is a serious public interest in the open airing of important \ncourt cases. At the urging of Senator Schumer and myself, Chief Justice \nRehnquist allowed the delayed audio broadcasting of the oral arguments \nbefore the Supreme Court in the 2000 presidential election dispute. The \nSupreme Court's response to our request was an historic, major step in \nthe right direction. Since then, other courts have followed suit, such \nas the live audio broadcast of oral arguments before the D.C. Circuit \nin the Microsoft antitrust case and the televising of appellate \nproceedings before the Ninth Circuit in the Napster copyright case. The \npublic wants to see what is happening in these important judicial \nproceedings, and the benefits are significant in terms of public \nknowledge and discussion.\n  We've introduced the Sunshine in the Courtroom Act with a well-\nfounded confidence based on the experience of the states as well as \nstate and federal studies. However, in order to be certain of the \nsafety and integrity of our judicial system, we have included a 3-year \nsunset provision allowing a reasonable amount of time to determine how \nthe process is working before making the provisions of the bill \npermanent.\n  It is also important to note that the bill simply gives judges the \ndiscretion to use cameras in the courtroom. It does not require judges \nto have cameras in their courtroom if they do not want them. The bill \nalso protects the anonymity of non-party witnesses by giving them the \nright to have their voices and images obscured during testimony.\n  So, the bill does not require cameras, but allows judges to exercise \ntheir discretion to permit cameras in appropriate cases. The bill \nprotects witnesses and does not compromise safety. The bill preserves \nthe integrity of the judicial system. The bill is based on the \nexperience of the states and the federal courts. And the bill's net \nresult will be greater openness and accountability of the nation's \nfederal courts. The best way to maintain confidence in our judicial \nsystem, where the federal judiciary holds tremendous power, is to let \nthe sun shine in by opening up the federal courtrooms to public view \nthrough broadcasting. And allowing cameras in the courtroom will bring \nthe judiciary into the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the Sunshine in the Courtroom Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 986\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SUNSET.\n\n       The authority under section 2(b) shall terminate 3 years \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am proud to once again be an original \ncosponsor of the Grassley-Schumer bill on cameras in the courtroom. I \nstrongly support allowing cameras in federal courtrooms for a simple \nreason. Trials and court hearings are public proceedings. They are paid \nfor by the taxpayers. Except in the most rare and unusual \ncircumstances, the public has a right to see what happens in those \nproceedings. We have a long tradition of press access to trials, but in \nthis day and age, it is no longer sufficient to be able to read in the \nmorning paper what happened in a trial the day before. The public wants \nto see for itself what goes on in our courts of law, and I think it has \na right to do so.\n  Experience in the state courts--and the vast majority of states now \nallow trials to be televised--has shown that it is possible to permit \nthe public to see trials on television without compromising the rights \nof a defendant to a fair trial or the safety or privacy interests of \nwitnesses or jurors. Concerns about cameras interfering with the fair \nadministration of justice in this country I believe are overstated.\n  Let me note also that I believe the arguments against allowing \ncameras in the courtroom are the least persuasive in the case of \nappellate proceedings, including the Supreme Court. I had the\n\n[[Page S5838]]\n\nopportunity to watch the oral argument at the Supreme Court late in \n1999 in an important case dealing with campaign finance reform. It was \na fascinating experience, and one that I wish all Americans could have. \nOf course, the entire country was able to hear audio feeds of the two \noral arguments in Bush v. Gore only hours after those arguments were \ncompleted. Hearing those arguments directly was an important and \npositive public educational experience. Seeing the arguments live would \nhave been even better. I do not believe that a discreet camera in that \ncourtroom would have changed the argument one iota.\n  There is no question in my mind that the highly trained and \nprestigious judges and lawyers who sit on and argue before our nation's \nfederal appellate courts would continue to conduct themselves with \ndignity and professionalism if cameras were recording their work. These \nproceedings are where law is made in this country. The public will \nbenefit greatly from being able to watch federal judges and advocates \nin action at oral argument.\n  The bill that my friends from New York and Iowa are introducing today \nis a responsible and measured bill. It gives discretion to individual \nfederal judges to allow cameras in their courtrooms. At the same time, \nit assures that witnesses will be able to request that their identities \nnot be revealed in televised proceedings. This bill gives deference to \nthe experience and judgment of federal judges who remain in charge of \ntheir own courtrooms. That is the right approach.\n  My state of Wisconsin has a long and proud tradition of open \ngovernment, and it has served us well. Coming from that tradition, my \napproach is to look with skepticism on any remnant of secrecy that \nlingers in our governmental processes at the federal level. When the \nworkings of government are transparent, the people understand it better \nand can more thoroughly and constructively participate in it. And they \ncan more easily hold their elected leaders and other public officials \naccountable. I believe this principle can and should be applied to the \njudicial as well as the legislative and executive branches of \ngovernment, while still respecting the unique role of the unelected \nfederal judiciary.\n  Cameras in the courtroom is an idea whose time came some time ago. It \nis high time we brought it to the federal courts. I am proud to support \nthe Grassley-Schumer bill, and I hope we can enact it this year.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Grassley in \nintroducing this legislation to permit federal trials and appellate \nproceedings to be televised, at the discretion of the presiding judge.\n  Former Chief Justice Warren Burger once said of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, ``A court which is final and unreviewable needs more careful \nscrutiny than any other. Unreviewable power is the most likely to \nindulge itself and the least likely to engage in dispassionate self-\nanalysis . . . In a country like ours, no public institution, or the \npeople who operate it, can be above public debate.''\n  I believe that these words are applicable to the entire federal \njudiciary. As such, I strongly support giving federal judges discretion \nto televise the proceedings over which they preside. When the people of \nthis nation watch their government in action, they come to understand \nhow our governing institutions work and equip themselves to hold those \ninstitutions accountable for their deeds. If there are flaws in our \ngoverning institutions--including our courts--we hide them only at our \nperil.\n  The federal courts are lagging behind the state courts on the issue \nof televising court proceedings. Indeed, 47 out of the 50 states allow \ncameras in their courtrooms in at least some cases. Moreover, a two-\nand-a-half year pilot program in which cameras were routinely permitted \nin six federal district courts and two courts of appeals revealed near \nuniversal support for cameras in the courtroom.\n  Our bill would simply afford federal trial and appellate judges \ndiscretion to permit cameras in their courtrooms. It would not require \nthem to do so. Furthermore, to protect the privacy of non-party \nwitnesses, the legislation would give such witnesses the right to have \ntheir voices and images obscured during their testimony.\n  I eagerly anticipate Senate passage and the day when openness is the \nnorm in our federal courtrooms, not the exception.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 988. A bill to provide that countries receiving foreign assistance \nbe conducive to United States business; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the International \nAnti-Corruption Act of 2001. This legislation addresses the growing \nproblem of official and unofficial corruption abroad. This bill is \nbased on S. 1514, which I introduced in the 106th Congress.\n  Endemic corruption around the world negatively impacts both the \nUnited States and the citizens of countries where corruption is \ntolerated. Overseas corruption directly hurts U.S. businesses as they \nendeavor to expand internationally. U.S. workers are affected when \ncorruption closes doors to our exports. In addition, the honest and \nhard working citizens of countries stricken with corruption suffer as \nthey are compelled to pay bribes to officials and other people in \npositions of power just to get the permits and licenses they need to \nget things done. The trade barrier created by corruption also limits \nthe purchasing choices available to these people. Finally, many leading \nU.S. companies that are eager to invest and build factories overseas to \nproduce consumer goods for consumption in those countries, often wisely \nchoose not to do so because they are not willing to deal with the \ncorruption they would encounter. Overall, honest and hard working \npeople living all around the world suffer as productive output is \nunjustly harmed.\n  As the Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, known as the Helsinki Commission, I am working to address the \nproblem of corruption. In the 106th Congress, I chaired a Commission \nhearing that focused on the issues of bribery and corruption in the \nregion of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, an \narea stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok. During this hearing, the \nCommission heard that, in economic terms, rampant corruption and \norganized crime in this vast region has cost U.S. businesses billions \nof dollars in lost contracts with direct implications for our economy.\n  In addition, two years ago while attending the annual session of the \nOSCE Parliamentary Assembly in St. Petersburg, Russia, I had an \nopportunity to sit down with U.S. business representatives and learned, \nfirst-hand, about the many obstacles they face.\n  Ironically, in some of the biggest recipients of U.S. foreign \nassistance--countries like Russia and Ukraine--the climate is either \nnot conducive or outright hostile to American business.\n  The time has come to stop providing aid as usual to those countries \nwhich line up to receive our assistance, only to turn around and fleece \nU.S. businesses conducting legitimate operations in these countries. \nFor this reason, I am introducing the International Anti-Corruption Act \nof 2001 to require the State Department to submit a report and the \nPresident to certify by March 1 of each year that countries which are \nreceiving U.S. foreign aid are, in fact, conducive to American \nbusinesses and investors. If a country is found to be hostile to \nAmerican businesses, aid from the United States would be cut off. The \ncertification would be specifically based on whether a country is \nmaking progress in, and is committed to, economic reform aimed at \neliminating corruption.\n  In fact, monitoring and measuring corruption, and the corresponding \noverall economic freedom, is nothing new. The Heritage Foundation \nregularly produces a comprehensive report entitled the ``Index of \nEconomic Freedom.'' This year's 2001 report ranks 155 countries on the \nbasis of 10 criteria, including ``government intervention, foreign \ninvestment and black market.'' While corruption is not identified \nindividually in this report, you can bet there is a strong negative \ncorrelation between overall economic freedom and corruption. The more \neconomic freedom you have, the less corruption you will have. It should \nbe no surprise that the countries with the lowest levels of economic \nfreedom are the very same countries that suffer from economic \nstagnation year after year. We owe it\n\n[[Page S5839]]\n\nto the good people trapped in corrupt political systems to do what we \ncan to help root out and get rid of this corruption.\n  Under this bill, if the President certifies that a country's business \nclimate is not conducive for U.S. businesses, that country will, in \neffect, be put on probation. The country would continue to receive U.S. \nforeign aid through that end of the fiscal year, but aid would be cut \noff on the first day of the next fiscal year unless the President \ncertifies the country is making significant progress in implementing \nthe specified economic indicators and is committed to recognizing the \ninvolvement of U.S. business.\n  My bill also includes the customary waiver authority where the \nnational interests of the United States are at stake. For countries \ncertified as hostile to or not conducive for U.S. business, aid can \ncontinue if the President determines it is in the national security \ninterest of the United States. However, the determination expires after \nsix months unless the President determines its continuation is \nimportant to our national security interest.\n  I also included a provision which would allow aid to continue to meet \nurgent humanitarian needs, including food, medicine, disaster and \nrefugee relief, to support democratic political reform and rule of law \nactivities, and to create private sector and non-governmental \norganizations that are independent of government control, or to develop \na free market economic system.\n  Instead of jumping on the bandwagon to pump millions of additional \nAmerican tax dollars into countries which are hostile to U.S. \nbusinesses and investors, we should be working to root out the kinds of \nbribery and corruption that have an overall chilling effect on much \nneeded foreign investment. Left unchecked, such corruption will \ncontinue to undermine fledgling democracies worldwide and further \nimpede moves toward a genuine free market economy. I believe the \nlegislation I am introducing today is a critical step this direction, \nand I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 988\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``International Anti-\n     Corruption Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. LIMITATIONS ON FOREIGN ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Report and Certification.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than March 1 of each year, the \n     President shall submit to the appropriate committees a \n     certification described in paragraph (2) and a report for \n     each country that received foreign assistance under part I of \n     the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 during the fiscal year. \n     The report shall describe the extent to which each such \n     country is making progress with respect to the following \n     economic indicators:\n       (A) Implementation of comprehensive economic reform, based \n     on market principles, private ownership, equitable treatment \n     of foreign private investment, adoption of a legal and policy \n     framework necessary for such reform, protection of \n     intellectual property rights, and respect for contracts.\n       (B) Elimination of corrupt trade practices by private \n     persons and government officials.\n       (C) Moving toward integration into the world economy.\n       (2) Certification.--The certification described in this \n     paragraph means a certification as to whether, based on the \n     economic indicators described in subparagraphs (A) through \n     (C) of paragraph (1), each country is--\n       (A) conducive to United States business;\n       (B) not conducive to United States business;

and\n       (ii) the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the \n     United States Executive Director of each multilateral \n     development bank to vote against any loan or other \n     utilization of the funds of such institution to or by any \n     country with respect to which a certification described in \n     clause (i) has been made.\n       (B) Duration of limitations.--Except as provided in \n     subsection (c), the limitations described in clauses (i) and \n     (ii) of subparagraph (A) shall apply with respect to a \n     country that is certified as hostile to United States \n     business pursuant to subsection (a) until the President \n     certifies to the appropriate committees that the country is \n     making significant progress in implementing the economic \n     indicators described in subsection (a)(1) and is no longer \n     hostile to United States business.\n       (2) Countries not conducive to united states business.--\n       (A) Probationary period.--A country that is certified as \n     not conducive to United States business pursuant to \n     subsection (a), shall be considered to be on probation \n     beginning on the date of such certification.\n       (B) Required improvement.--Unless the President certifies \n     to the appropriate committees that the country is making \n     significant progress in implementing the economic indicators \n     described in subsection (a) and is committed to being \n     conducive to United States business, beginning on the first \n     day of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which a \n     country is certified as not conducive to United States \n     business pursuant to subsection (a)(2)--\n       (i) none of the funds made available for assistance under \n     part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (including \n     unobligated balances of prior appropriations) may be made \n     available for the government of such country;

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Congress that the Humane Methods of \nSlaughter Act of 1958 should be fully enforced to prevent the needless \nsuffering of animals.\n  On April 10, 2001, the Washington Post printed a front page story \nentitled ``They Die Piece by Piece.'' This graphic article asserted \nthat the United States Department of Agriculture was not appropriately \nenforcing the Humane Slaughter Act. In response, I am introducing this \nresolution that encourages the Secretary of Agriculture to fully \nenforce current law including the Humane Slaughter Act of 1958, as \namended by the Federal Meat Inspection Act in 1978.\n  The Humane Slaughter Act simply requires that animals be rendered \ninsensible to pain before they are harvested. However, apparently this \nlaw is not being enforced in some instances. For example, the \nWashington Post article reported that ``enforcement records, \ninterviews, videos and worker affidavits describe repeated violations \nof the Humane Slaughter Act'' and ``the government took no action \nagainst a Texas beef company that was cited 22 times in 1998 for \nviolations that include chopping hooves off live cattle.''\n  While the regulated industry may argue that problems highlighted in \nthis article are not endemic of the entire meat processing industry, \n``a couple of rotten apples could ruin the whole basket.'' As the \nWashington Post article demonstrated, there are some operations that \nmay need oversight to ensure that the entire meat industry does not get \na ``black eye.''\n  Additionally, the Washington Post article pointed out that in 1998, \nthe USDA stopped tracking the number of humane slaughter violations. \nUSDA's Director of Slaughter Operations reportedly admitted ``she \ndidn't know if the number of violations was up or down.'' This is \nsimply unacceptable. We cannot manage nor regulate what we do not \nmonitor nor measure. Thus, the resolution asks the Secretary of \nAgriculture to reinitiate tracking of violations and report these \nresults and relevant trends to Congress annually.\n  This legislation is supported by the Society for Animal Protective \nLegislation, the Humane Society of the United States, and the Humane \nFarming Association. The resolution is sound public policy that enjoys \nbipartisan support. I thank my colleagues, Senators Leahy and Akaka, \nfor joining me as original co-sponsors of this bill, and I encourage my \nSenate colleagues to join us in this endeavor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support from the Humane \nSociety of the United States be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                The Humane Society\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2001.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Human Society of the United \n     States, the nation's largest animal protection organization \n     with 7 million members and constituents, I am writing to \n     express our support for the resolution, soon to be introduced \n     by Senator Peter Fitzgerald, calling on USDA to enforce the \n     Humane Slaughter Act. We urge you to cosponsor Senator \n     Fitzgerald's resolution.\n       On April 10, 2001, the Washington Post printed a front-page \n     story entitled ``They Die Piece by Piece.'' The disturbing \n     investigative article revealed that the USDA is not currently \n     enforcing the Humane Slaughter Act and that the Department \n     has stopped tracking humane-slaughter violations. To address \n     these failings, Senator Fitzgerald is introducing a \n     resolution encouraging the Secretary of Agriculture to fully \n     enforce the law. The resolution calls for enforcement of the \n     Humane Slaughter Act of 1958 and asks that the Department \n     resume tracking humane-slaughter violations and report its \n     findings to Congress annually.\n       The Washington Post reported that prior to ending the \n     tracking of humane-slaughter violations in 1998, USDA records \n     gave us a snapshot of the extraordinarily inhumane slaughter \n     practices occurring at processing plants. For example:\n       USDA took no action against a Texas beef company that was \n     cited 22 times in one year for violations such as chopping \n     hooves off live cattle.\n       Inspectors at a livestock processing plant in Hawaii \n     describe hogs walking and squealing after being stunned (a \n     process meant to render animals unconscious) as many as four \n     times.\n       Another Texas plant had 22 violations in 6 months, \n     including live cattle dangling from an overhead chain.\n       Hogs are submersed in scalding water after being stunned to \n     loosen their hides for skinning. This means that poorly \n     stunned animals are scalded and drowned. Videotape from an \n     Iowa pork plant shows hogs squealing and kicking as they are \n     being lowered into the water.\n       Congress passed the Humane Slaughter Act in 1957. It should \n     be enforced vigorously--now 40 years after enactment. To \n     cosponsor this resolution calling for the enforcement of \n     existing law on humane slaughter, please contact Terry Van \n     Doren of Senator Fitzgerald's office (4-2854) or for more \n     information, please contact Susan Solarz of HSUS (202/955-\n     3664).\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Wayne Pacelle,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     Communications and Government Affairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/05/senate-section/article/S5840-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5840-S5841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      Committee on Armed Services\n\n  Mr. GREGG.
