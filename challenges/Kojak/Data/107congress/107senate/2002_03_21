Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 4 minutes of debate to be equally divided in the usual form \non the Kyl amendment No. 3038.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will go ahead and use the 2 minutes in \nopposition to the Kyl amendment, and then the sponsor, Senator Kyl, \nwill use the final 2 minutes.\n  The main reason to oppose this amendment is that it totally \neliminates, if adopted, any kind of provision in this bill that would \nmove us toward more use of renewable fuels in the future.\n  We need to diversify our supply of energy in this country. We need to \nbe less dependent on some certain specific sources and more dependent \non new technology. That is possible. It is happening. It is not \nhappening as quickly as it should.\n  Ninety-five percent of today's new power generation that is under \nconstruction is gas fired. That is fine as long as the price of gas \nstays low. But if the price of gas goes back up to what it was 18 \nmonths ago, then we are going to see a serious repercussion in the \nutility bills of all consumers.\n  This underlying amendment, which the Kyl amendment would eliminate, \ntries to, in a very modest way, move us toward more use of renewables. \nIt provides that we have 1 percent in the year 2005. Various utilities \naround this country would be required to produce 1 percent of the \nelectricity they generate from renewable sources. That is not an \nexcessive demand. It goes up in very small amounts each year \nthereafter.\n  I believe strongly that the renewable portfolio standard we have in \nthe bill is a good provision. The suggestions Senator Kyl and others \nhave made that this is going to drastically increase everyone's \nelectricity bills is not borne out by the analyses that have been made. \nThe Energy Information Administration has analyzed this. At the request \nof Senator Murkowski, they have concluded that this does not raise \nenergy prices.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me give you the 10 reasons we should \nsupport the Kyl amendment.\n  No. 1, the Bingaman amendment is the command-economy amendment, a 10-\npercent mandate, and the Kyl amendment is for State choice.\n  No. 2, the Bingaman amendment is very costly, at $88 billion over 15 \nyears and then $12 billion each year after that--paid for by the \nelectricity consumers.\n  If you would like to know how much your electricity consumers are \ngoing to be paying under the Bingaman amendment, I have all the \ninformation right here. You had better consult this before you vote \nagainst the Kyl amendment.\n  No. 3, the Bingaman amendment is discriminatory. The Bingaman \namendment provides that some areas subsidize people in other parts of \ncountry.\n  No. 4, hydro is not included. Yet, of all the renewables, hydro is \nabout 7 percent of the electricity production. The other renewables are \nonly about 2 percent.\n  No. 5, it will benefit just a few companies. According to the Energy \nInformation Administration, wind is the only economical way to produce \nthis power, and it is concentrated in just a few areas.\n  Do you know who these few special interests are? You should find out \nbefore you vote against the Kyl amendment.\n  No. 6, renewables are not reliable. If the Sun doesn't shine, if the \nwind does not blow, and if water doesn't flow, you don't get energy. \nBut you do out of coal, gas, and nuclear.\n  No. 7, we are already subsidizing the renewable fuels to the tune of \n$1 billion a year.\n  There is a big difference between encouraging, which we are doing, \nand compelling.\n  No. 8, the administration supports the Kyl amendment and opposes the \nBingaman amendment.\n  No. 9, biomass from Federal land does not count.\n  No. 10, there is no principal reason to discriminate against public \nand private power; yet private power is included in the Bingaman \namendment and public power is excluded.\n  I will throw in a bonus reason.\n  The No. 11 reason to vote for the Kyl amendment and against Bingaman \nis this is the opposite of deregulation, which was supposed to be the \nwhole point of the electricity section of the pending legislation. The \n10-percent mandate is regulation and not deregulation.\n  I urge you to support the Kyl amendment.\n\n\n                RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD APPLICATION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend the Chairman for his fairness and \ndiligence in setting a goal for energy suppliers to meet a renewable \nportfolio standard that ensures power supply from a diverse mix of \nfuels and technologies. I thank the Chairman and his staff for working \nwith my staff to answer questions concerning how the renewable \nportfolio standard would work. We understand the definition for \nqualifying facilities covers existing hydro facilities including pumped \nstorage. This is important to the State of Michigan and we appreciate \nthe clarification.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I echo the statements of the senior \nSenator from Michigan, and thank the Chairman for his work on \ndeveloping a strong renewable portfolio standard. My question is \nwhether renewable power could be measured by plant generating capacity \nor throughout to the customer.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is correct. Pumped hydro is included as an \nexisting renewable. With regard to how renewable power is measured, we \nintend the Secretary of Energy or the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission would set a normalized level for all hydro facilities, \ntaking into consideration capacity and generation at normal or \nhistorical average water flows. For other renewable technologies, the \nvolume is calculated based on actual generation. There has been some \nmisunderstanding about the Texas plan, on which my amendment if \nmodeled. The Texas statute set an overall increase in capacity,\n\n[[Page S2195]]\n\nbut in the implementation the requirement was converted to a generation \nmeasure. A generation metric is critical to ensure efficient operation \nof these facilities.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from New Mexico, the Chairman of the \nEnergy Committee.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my friend from New Mexico.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Coalition for Affordable and Reliable Energy,\n\n                                                   March 19, 2002.\n     Senator Jon Kyl,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: The Coalition for Affordable and Reliable \n     Energy (CARE) endorses your amendment to the Renewable \n     Portfolio Standard (RPS) provisions of the Energy Policy Act \n     (S. 517). While CARE strongly supports the increased use of \n     all domestic energy resources, including renewable forms of \n     energy, we are opposed to prescribed national mandates and \n     timetables for the use of specific energy resources.\n       CARE is concerned that mandating the use of particular \n     sources of energy will substantially increase the cost of \n     electricity and may be difficult to achieve. Your RPS \n     amendment will, instead, permit states to appropriately \n     consider their individual electricity needs and their ability \n     to meet those needs in affordable and reliable ways. Under \n     your amendment, states will also be free to significantly \n     enhance the use of renewables to generate electricity without \n     the burden of Federal mandates and timetables.\n       Senator Kyl, on behalf of CARE's broad and diverse \n     membership, I commend you for offering this amendment to the \n     Renewable Portfolio Standard provisions of S. 517 and urge \n     its adoption.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Paul Oakley,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Electric Consumers' Alliance,\n\n                                 Indianapolis, IN, March 14, 2002.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Hart Bldg., Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senator Kyl: As the Senate debates energy legislation, \n     Electric Consumers' Alliance commends your attention to these \n     critical policy issues.\n       As your consideration moves to the finer points of \n     legislation, we strongly urge you to take a thoughtful \n     approach to the issue of Renewable Portfolio Standards--the \n     amount of electric power that must come from certain \n     renewable sources.\n       While our group favors a progressive approach to setting \n     goals for the production of green power, we strongly oppose \n     provisions that would set a hard percentage goal that must be \n     attained in any given year. We commend the amendment proposed \n     by Sen. Kyl as a balanced approach to this issue.\n       From our perspective as the spokesgroup for tens of \n     millions of residential small business ratepayers, artificial \n     targets are unwise for two reasons. First, they hardwire in \n     goals that may prove to be unreasonable (or too lenient) in \n     future years. This may have the effect of indirectly raising \n     consumer prices or sending distorted signals to the market. \n     In other words, good intentions could (and likely will at \n     some point) go astray.\n       Second, a set percentage goal deprives states of the \n     ability to address these issues and craft a resolution on the \n     basis of local conditions. For instance, economically \n     efficient renewable energy may be much more achievable in \n     rural and sunbelt states that have the potential to develop \n     solar and wind energy.\n       In conclusion, as you consider the issue of renewable \n     portfolio standards, we urge your support of the flexible \n     approach found in the Kyl amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert K. Johnson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on this \namendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The yeas and nays have not been \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment, and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Shelby) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) is \nabsent on official business.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nVirginia (Mr. Warner) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 40, nays 58, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 55 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--40\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Smith (NH)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n\n                                NAYS--58\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Shelby\n     Warner\n       \n  The amendment (No. 3038) was rejected.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12 noon \ntoday, Senator Lott's amendment No. 3033 be considered a first-degree \namendment, and that it be laid aside for the amendment which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I further ask unanimous consent that there be 3 hours for \ndebate on both amendments, beginning at noon today, equally divided \nbetween the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, or \ntheir designees; that at the conclusion of that time, the Senate vote \non Senator Leahy's amendment, and following disposition of that \namendment, the Senate vote on Senator Lott's amendment, with no \nintervening action or debate in order prior to the disposition of these \ntwo amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the time from now until noon will be used \nas follows: Senator Roberts has a statement that will take less than 10 \nminutes; is that right?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I imagine, I tell my distinguished colleague, about 12 \nor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Miller wishes to speak for 10 minutes. We also have \na speech that Senator Byrd indicated several days ago he wanted to give \nwhich will take more time, approximately 22 minutes.\n  I say to my friend, the distinguished President pro tempore, who is \nin the Chamber now, I know the Senator has been involved in other \nmatters this morning. Is it possible for the Senator to speak at a \nsubsequent time or does the Senator wish to speak now?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, my problem is as follows: The chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, Mr. Conrad, has told the members of the Budget \nCommittee that we have a long way to go, with many amendments to vote \non and to discuss. He intends to finish work on the budget today. That \nmeans I have a very limited opportunity to speak. I have two speeches, \nas a matter of fact, one very short, quite short, and the other one \nperhaps 25 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering, if I can interrupt and I apologize, will \nthe other Senators allow Senator Byrd to speak--there is no permission \nneeded, I assume.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the distinguished Senator will yield, I have spoken \nwith Senator Byrd, and I will always yield to his request, but I \nthought we had an understanding that I could precede him for 10 \nminutes. It will not take too long.\n\n[[Page S2196]]\n\n  I thought we had an understanding. I know with this new schedule \nperhaps that is not the case. I leave that up to his judgment.\n  Mr. BYRD. The distinguished Senator did speak with me at the close of \nthe vote, and I told the Senator I would be very happy and willing for \nhim to precede me. I thought while I went down on the next floor to my \noffice to get my speech that the distinguished Senator would be \nproceeding and hopefully finished by the time I got back to the \nChamber.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from West Virginia, what the Senator \nsaid is valid. We closed the vote after 33 minutes which, of course, if \nwe closed the vote earlier when we should have, this would have been \ncompleted.\n  Mr. BYRD. I did tell the Senator he could speak, he could go ahead of \nme.\n  Mr. REID. Can Senator Miller wait until Senator Byrd finishes his \nremarks?\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, certainly I will wait.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Kansas be recognized for 12 minutes, Senator Byrd be recognized \nthereafter, and the Senator from Georgia be recognized after Senator \nByrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I thank Senator Byrd, the institutional \nprotector and flame of the Senate, for allowing me to precede him.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Roberts pertaining to the introduction of S. 2040 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I begin my remarks today by quoting from \nGeorge Bernard Shaw's ``Man and Superman,'' ``If history repeats \nitself, and the unexpected always happens, how incapable Man must be of \nlearning from experience!''\n  I have been concerned about the issue of energy security for many \nyears now. It was in 1992 that the Congress last passed major energy \nlegislation. Now, for the first time in a decade, events have converged \nto make possible substantive progress on a national energy policy. But \nthe question remains as to whether or not real progress will be made.\n  The energy crisis of the 1970s should have been a wake-up call. I \nargued then and throughout the 1980s and 1990s that it was time to get \nmoving to address our long-term energy problems. Each episode of short \nsupply and higher prices spurred renewed talk about our Nation's lack \nof an energy policy. But, each time, supplies stabilized, prices \ndropped, and nothing materialized from all that talk. Will we again let \nthat opportunity slip away?\n  We have heard much in the previous weeks about electricity, oil and \ngas supplies, energy efficiency, energy tax incentives, and fuel \neconomy standards. This is typically how we talk about energy. Yet, \nenergy is about much more than that. Energy is about how we live our \nlives--today and into the future. It is about how we travel to work, \nhow we brew our morning coffee, how the lights come on in this Chamber \nand permit us to read. It is about the coal-fired electricity that \nlights this whole Capitol, but it is also about what we can accomplish \non the Senate Floor because we have this gift of light. God, in \ncreating the world, said: Let there be light. Too often, though, we \ntake for granted the benefits these lights bring.\n  Now when we consider energy security, we must think about fuel \ndiversity. We need a diversity of energy resources to make our nation \nwork. Actually, it is much like the Members of the Senate. It takes a \nvariety of Senators, with all of their views and contributions coming \nfrom all the sections of the country, from the north, south, east, \nwest, to make this body work. I, myself, am from coal country, C-O-A-L. \nOne may laugh at that suggestion, but it is true. I am coal, C-O-A-L. I \nhave been around the Congress for 50 years, which is a very long time \nwhen man's lifetime is considered. I was pulled from the hard scrabble \nmountains of West Virginia to serve this country. In the end, I hope \nthat if I am pressed enough, testing my spirit and worth, the good Lord \nmight realize that this ole piece of coal and carbon might actually be \na diamond in the rough. Each Member of this body represents his or her \nown constituents' particular interests and energy needs. We come at \nthis from different viewpoints, but, working together, we can mold a \nstrong, comprehensive energy package that will provide long-term energy \nsecurity.\n  The events of the last year demonstrate that true national security, \neconomic growth, job protection, and environmental improvements over \nthe long term depend upon a balanced energy plan. The United States \nmust have a comprehensive energy policy that promotes energy \nconservation and efficiency and the greater use of domestic energy \nresources, while it ensures the development and deployment of advanced \nenergy technologies and also improves our energy infrastructure. That \nis a pretty tall order. But all of those components are necessary if we \nare to reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign energy resources.\n\n  As energy debates have ebbed and flowed over the years, so have the \npublic's and media's concerns. These cycles in energy markets--these \nmomentary feasts and sporadic famines-- have occurred and will continue \nto occur in the future. Too often, though, these crises have provoked \ncontroversial, knee-jerk solutions that do little to solve what is \nfundamentally a long-term problem.\n  For example, in response to the spike in gasoline prices not so many \nmonths ago, then-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson jetted off hat-in-\nhand to the Middle East pleading with Arab nations to increase crude \noil production, which would supposedly lower gas prices at home. I also \nrecall several ``snake-oil, miracle cures'' being debated on the Senate \nFloor, such as a federal gas tax ``holiday'' intended to temporarily \nreduce prices at the pump--a measure that a sensible majority in the \nSenate voted against.\n  Such short-term energy crises are brought on by many different \ncatalysts, but they are all based on the same fundamental problem. What \nwe see in the fluctuation of energy prices is a textbook study of how \nsupply and demand can affect the energy markets. Unfortunately, our \ntypical response to an energy crisis is to find a quick-fix solution--\none that is designed to cut off the immediate spike, but does nothing \nto affect the underlying problems.\n  A number of challenges lie ahead. Our dependence on foreign oil \nincreases every day. Because our domestic production peaked in the \nearly 1970s and our consumption has not diminished since the early \n1980s, we grow ever more dependent. This gap is due, in large part, to \nour dependence on oil for our rapidly expanding transportation sector.\n  On a positive note, the U.S. is less dependent on foreign oil than \nmany other industrialized nations. However, it is also true that we are \nreliant on foreign producers for more than 50 percent of our oil supply \ntoday compared to less than 40 percent in the mid-1970s. Fortunately, \nwe rely on a more diverse choice of foreign nations, and we are less \ndependent on Middle Eastern nations, for that growing share of our \npetroleum imports than twenty-five years ago.\n  A central question that we have to ask is what primary goal we are \nstriving to achieve through this legislation. How do we balance our \ngrowing demand for new energy resources while increasing our need to do \nso in cleaner, more efficient ways? Will increased domestic oil \nproduction reduce our dependence on foreign oil? And, if that is the \ncase, when and how should that occur? Looking to the future, I hope \nthat our mounting dependence on foreign oil would serve as a wake-up \ncall for other energy resources. Unless we can find a way to increase \nour natural gas supplies over the long term, we will also be \nincreasingly dependent on foreign producers for our growing natural gas \ndemands.\n  Further, we must understand that there are actually two major energy \nsystems functioning in the U.S. with comparatively little influence on \neach other. Our transportation system is run almost entirely on oil-\nbased resources. The second system provides power to warm our homes, \nlight our businesses, light our Senate Chamber, run our computers, and \ncook our\n\n[[Page S2197]]\n\nmeals. It is supplied largely by domestic industries and resources that \nare in the midst of an historic and difficult transition. The limited \noverlap between these two energy systems can be simply illustrated. The \nelectric power industry gets 2 percent of its energy from oil--the rest \ncomes from coal, nuclear, natural gas, hydroelectric, as well as other \nrenewable sources. Conversely, 97 percent of the energy use in our \ntransportation sector comes from what? Oil. We must intelligently \naddress the needs of these two energy systems simultaneously in order \nto provide a comprehensive solution to our energy needs.\n\n  Furthermore, if we are to craft a workable energy policy, we must \nrecognize the degree to which it will rely on state and local \ndecisions. Many energy experts agree that the country will need more \npower plants, more refineries, new refineries, and additional \npipelines, but local citizens' groups often do not want these \npotentially unsightly, but crucial, facilities in their communities. \nTherefore, a national energy policy must enable government at all \nlevels to work with citizens' groups and private sector interests to \nbetter coordinate a cohesive roadmap for the production, \ntransportation, and use of energy. By working to fill energy gaps and \navoiding jurisdictional conflicts, while improving a diversity of \nenergy resources, authorities at all levels can promote regulatory \ncertainty, stabilize long-term investments, and promote environmental \nprotection all at the same time.\n  Over the years, our awareness has grown about the complexity of \nconstructing a balanced energy policy that will not undermine other \ncompeting and equally legitimate policy goals. How do we reduce \ngasoline consumption, when raising its price to achieve a meaningful \nreduction in demand could be seen as economically disruptive and \npolitically suicidal? How do we encourage the use of alternative fuels \nand technologies that heighten our energy efficiency, when OPEC nations \ncan simply adjust oil prices to keep conventional sources cheaper than \ntheir alternative substitutes? How can we boost domestic energy \nsupplies while protecting the environment?\n  Furthermore, with the severe budget restrictions we now face, we must \nexamine questions about how the government can afford to meet our \nnation's future energy commitments. The projected return to deficit \nbudgeting, the recession, and the demands for increased homeland \nsecurity and for supporting our military abroad, have placed enormous \nlong-term pressures on the entire budget and appropriations process \nthis year, and for as far as the eye can see. Will a long-term energy \nstrategy also be a victim of budgetary constraints? That is a serious \nquestion.\n  I hope not, because the Energy Information Administration estimates \nthat, by 2020, the total U.S. energy consumption is forecast to \nincrease by 32 percent--including petroleum by 33 percent, natural gas \nby 62 percent, electricity by 45 percent, renewable fuels by 26 \npercent, and coal by 22 percent. Because our energy needs are expected \nto grow so quickly, we need to develop and use a diverse mix of energy \nresources, especially coal, in more economically and environmentally \nsound ways.\n  There are those who would like to push coal aside like stove wood and \nhorse power as novelties from a bygone era. But we cannot ignore coal \nas part of the solution. Over the past several years, I have been \ndiligently assembling a comprehensive legislative package that will \npromote the near- and long-term viability of coal both at home and \nabroad. The Senate energy bill provides the opportunity to achieve that \ngoal. Provisions contained in the Senate energy bill extend the \nauthorization for the research and development program for fossil fuels \nfrom $485 million in Fiscal Year 2003 to $558 million in FY 2006. \nAdditionally, the bill contains a $2 billion, 10-year clean coal \ntechnology demonstration program.\n\n  It is undeniable that our quality of life and economic well-being are \ntied to energy, and, in particular, electricity. Coal is inextricably \ntied to our nation's electricity supply. Today, coal-fired power plants \nrepresent more than 50 percent of electric generation in the United \nStates, and 90 percent of coal produced is used in electricity \ngeneration. Coal has become even more important in recent years as a \nbasic necessity for high-technology industries that need this domestic \nresource for computers and cutting-edge equipment that require a \nreliable, cost-effective supply of electricity. Coal is America's most \nabundant, most accessible natural energy resource, but, again, we must \nfind ways to use it in a cleaner, more efficient manner.\n  The importance of clean coal technologies and the development of \nfuture advanced coal combustion and emission control technologies can \nassure the attainment of these goals. The overall emissions from U.S. \ncoal-fired facilities have been reduced significantly since 1970, even \nwhile the quantity of electricity produced from coal has almost \ntripled. At the same time, the cost of electricity from coal is less \nthan one half the cost of electricity generated from other fossil \nfuels.\n  To ensure that coal-fired power plants will help us to meet our \nenergy and environmental goals, the Clean Coal Technology Program and \nother Department of Energy--DOE--fossil energy research and development \nprograms must develop most efficient, cleaner coal-use technologies. \nThis, in turn, will contribute greatly to the U.S. economy and to \nreduction in pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\n  The DOE fossil energy research and development programs have created \na cleaner environment, promoted the creation of new jobs, and improved \nthe competitive position of U.S. companies. The DOE coal-based research \nprogram is estimated to provide over $100 billion--$100 billion--in \nbenefits to the U.S. economy through 2020. In addition, the Clean Coal \nTechnology Program has been one of the most successful government/\nindustry research and development partnerships ever implemented. By \nlaw, the Federal share of this very successful program cannot exceed 50 \npercent. But, over the past 15 years, $1.9 billion in Federal spending \nhas been matched by more than $3.7 billion from the private sector; a \n2:1 ratio that far exceeds the 1:1 ratio set by law.\n  The successes of a range of U.S. clean energy technologies are \nvaluable within our own borders. But, by opening new markets and \nexporting these technologies, we can reap their benefits many times \nover. This is a tremendous opportunity that cannot be ignored because \nthe clean energy policies and technologies adopted today will have a \nprofound influence on the global economic and energy system for decades \nto come. The United States should market our clean energy technologies, \nespecially clean coal technologies, to developing nations, like China, \nIndia, South Africa, and Mexico, to help them meet their economic and \nenergy needs. Just over a year ago, I initiated the Clean Energy \nTechnology Exports Program, an effort to open and expand international \nenergy markets and increase U.S. clean energy technology exports to \ncountries around the world. This commonsense approach can \nsimultaneously improve economic security and provide job opportunities \nat home, while assisting other countries with much-needed energy \ntechnologies and infrastructure. Furthermore, such technologies can \nenable these countries to build their economies in more environmentally \nfriendly ways, thus helping to advance the global effort to address \nclimate change.\n\n  Climate change and energy policy are two sides of the same coin. \nBecause the vast majority of manmade greenhouse gas emissions are \nassociated with energy use, it is here, in an energy bill, that we need \nto deal with the long-term challenges associated with global climate \nchange. We need a climate change strategy and we need a climate change \nstrategy badly. We need a climate change strategy that will not just \npick at this complex problem by putting in place strategies that will \napply in the next 5 or 10 years. We need a comprehensive climate change \nstrategy also that looks 20, 50, and 100 years into the future.\n  Look at the kind of winter we have had. Look at the kind of winter we \nhave had here in Washington: One snow, 3 inches. Look at the drought \nthat has come upon this area of the country during the winter season. \nWhat can we expect for the spring and\n\n[[Page S2198]]\n\nsummer season? What is going to happen to our crops, our livestock, our \neconomy? This is serious.\n  I have lived a long time--84 years. Something is going on out there. \nI don't need a scientist to tell me that. With the differences in the \nwinters, the differences in the summers, in the temperatures, in the \nwater level, there is something happening, and we had better be aware \nof it. We had better do something about it.\n  I sincerely hope that we will be able to work together in a \nbipartisan way and not put off addressing these challenging questions \non another generation, but we must begin that effort now.\n  In June 2001, I introduced with Senator Stevens bipartisan climate \nchange legislation. Our bill received unanimous support in the \nGovernment Affairs Committee last year. Our proposal is based on \nscientifically, technically, and economically sound principles and \nwould put into place a comprehensive, national climate change strategy, \nincluding a renewed national commitment to develop the next generation \nof innovative energy technologies. Senator Stevens and I believe this \nis right policy framework, and I hope that my colleagues will not allow \nthis commonsense approach to be undermined or stricken from this bill.\n  Senator Stevens and I are aware that there may be an effort to strike \nthis from the bill. But Senator Stevens and I will stand as one man, as \none individual, against any such effort.\n  I am glad to say that the Byrd/Stevens legislation is included in \nthis energy package, as I have already indicated, for it will provide \nfor the long-term viability of coal as an energy resource.\n  We must seize this opportunity to learn from past experiences. \nPresident Carter spoke to the nation in 1977 about the energy crisis of \nthat era. He said that:\n\n       Our decisions about energy will test the character of the \n     American people and the ability of the President and the \n     Congress to govern this nation. This difficult effort will be \n     the `moral equivalent of war,' except that we will be uniting \n     our efforts to build and not to destroy.\n\n  Those are the words of former President Carter. At that time, energy \nwas a household concern. Lines, long lines at gas stations were a \ncommon scene. Everybody remembers that--anybody who was living at that \ntime. We were building a national resolve to craft a comprehensive \nnational energy policy. But the gas lines went away, and so did the \nsense of urgency about energy.\n  During my tenure in the United States Senate, I have witnessed the \nebb and flow in energy concerns as energy prices rise and fall. I fear \nthat, as a nation, while our energy supplies are plentiful and prices \nare low, we may have sunk back into somnolence--somnolence--asleep at \nthe wheel. If the United States is going to remain a global economic \npower, we have to tackle these energy issues. If there was ever a time \nto come together and craft an intelligent, responsible, bipartisan, \nlong-term energy policy, it is now.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia for his \ncourtesy and his kindness to me and for allowing me to precede him so I \ncould make this speech and then go back to the Budget Committee where \nwe are having votes and where I should be attending right away. I thank \nhim, and I join with him. I know what he is going to say and what he is \ngoing to speak about. I shall have something to say about that matter \nlater. I thank him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the \ncompletion of the remarks of Senator Miller and Senator Collins I be \nallowed to speak. I will be offering a consensus amendment at that time \nwhich has been agreed to by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Miller are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business'')\n  Mr. MILLER. Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3041 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n   (Purpose: To provide additional flexibility to covered fleets and \n        persons under title V of the Energy Policy Act of 1992)\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], for himself, Mr. \n     Murkowski, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Smith of Oregon, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3041 to amendment No. 2917.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Energy Policy Act that the Senate has \nbeen debating contains a number of strategies to reduce America's \ndependence on foreign oil and to improve the environment, but it does \nomit a key technology that can help this country achieve these \ncritically important goals.\n  That technology is the hybrid electric vehicle. The Senate has heard \na lot about hybrids over the last few weeks, and, last week saw a \nposter of a red SUV--a hybrid vehicle that Ford is developing. Hybrids \nare coming of age. Anyone who has questions about their benefits can \nask our colleague, Senator Bennett from Utah, who does in fact, drive a \nhybrid vehicle.\n  These vehicles can achieve fuel efficiencies that are more than twice \nthe current CAFE standard. Their greenhouse gas emissions are only one-\nthird to one-half of those from conventional vehicles; and for other \npollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, they can meet the country's \nhighest emission standards, those set by the State of California.\n  The overall energy efficiency of hybrid vehicles is more than double \nof any available alternative fuel vehicle. But the result of this \ncountry's current energy policy is that vehicles rated at even 70 miles \nper gallon are disqualified as counting toward energy efficiency fleet \nrequirements just because they do not use alternative fuels. But, \nclearly, they more than fulfill the spirit of a modern energy policy \nthat moves this country towards the critical goal of energy \nindependence.\n  When it comes to alternative fuel, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is \nall windup and no pitch. It requires fleet administrators to buy \nalternative fuel vehicles, but it does not require them to use \nalternative fuels. In many States, even the best-intentioned fleet \nadministrators have real trouble finding enough alternative fuel. That \ncertainly has been true in my home State of Oregon.\n  Out of 178,000 fuel stations across the country, only 200 now provide \nalternative fuel. That is less than one-tenth of 1 percent of our \nfilling stations. The result is, many alternative fuel vehicles are \nbeing operated with gasoline, which completely undermines this \ncountry's goal of reducing the use of petroleum.\n  The energy bill before us, wisely, will close that loophole by \nrequiring alternative fuel vehicles to actually use alternative fuels. \nIf passed, by September of next year, 2003, only 50 percent of the fuel \nthat fleets use in their alternative fuel vehicles could be gasoline.\n  Though the Nation's alternative fuel infrastructure is expanding, the \nquestion still remains: What about those States that still lack enough \nstations where fuel can be purchased? Are they supposed to just let \nthose vehicles sit unused in their parking lots?\n  The amendment I offer today, with Senator Murkowski, Senator Bennett, \nand my colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, will provide fleet \nadministrators with the flexibility to choose between alternative fuel \nvehicles and hybrid vehicles. Like the Energy Tax Incentives Act \nreported by the Finance Committee, it contains a sliding scale that \nallows partial credit for hybrid vehicles based on how good their fuel \neconomy is and how much power they have.\n\n[[Page S2199]]\n\n  For instance, if a hybrid car or light truck averages 2\\1/2\\ times \nthe fuel economy of a similar vehicle in its weight class, it could \nearn credit worth up to 50 percent of the purchase of an alternative \nfuel vehicle. Then, based on how much power it has available, it could \nearn additional credit. So significant credit would only be given to \nthe best performers.\n  To illustrate what this means, for a hybrid vehicle to get one-half \nthe credit of a 3,500-pound alternative fuel vehicle that averages 21 \nmiles per gallon in the city, that hybrid would have to average over 53 \nmiles per gallon. It is clear what a huge reduction in petroleum use \nthis proposal could mean.\n  The amendment is supported by a broad range of interests, including \nthe National Association of Fleet Administrators, the National \nAssociation of State Energy Officers, Toyota Motor of North America, \nand the National Rural Electric Cooperatives Association.\n  I thank my colleagues, particularly Senator Murkowski, Senator \nBennett, and Senator Smith of Oregon, for all of their efforts in \nworking with me to fashion this bipartisan legislation.\n  I also thank Chairman Bingaman, who has been very helpful with \nrespect to this issue. He is a strong advocate of hybrids.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set \naside and that the Senate return to it later in the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I gather there is some concern \nexpressed by the majority leader about the pace at which we are \nproceeding on the energy bill. This often happens in the process of a \ncomplex piece of legislation, particularly a piece of legislation that \nhas not gone through the committee process as a consequence of the \ndecision of the majority leader. This has taken a while. We are not \nthrough by any means. We still have some contentious issues to address, \nsuch as global warming, ANWR, the tax proposal, which is going to take \nsome time.\n  I want to see this bill passed. It is my intention to keep working \nwith Senator Bingaman toward the passage of a comprehensive energy \nbill. It was with the intention that, by amendment, we would try to \ncraft a bill that would be worthy of the Senate's deliberations. There \nis no question that, obviously, we were expected to deliver a bill. The \nreality that the House has done its job and passed H.R. 4 puts the \nresponsibility on the Senate.\n  The President has outlined energy as one of his priorities, \nencouraging that we pass comprehensive energy legislation. So the \nobligation clearly is ours. This afternoon, I gather we are going to go \nback on judges for an undetermined timeframe. At the conclusion of \nthat, I hope we can again go back to some of the outstanding amendments \nwe have before us on the energy bill.\n  I also point out to those who suggest we are holding up this bill \nthat we spent a good deal of time off the bill on campaign finance. I \nam not being critical of that. It is just a reality that the majority \nleader chose to take us off to complete that particular issue, which \nhas been around for so long.\n  I want to make the record clear. We have an ethanol amendment, the \nFeinstein amendment is resolved, and there may be some more amendments \ncoming yet this afternoon. We are working with Senator Bingaman and the \nmajority whip, Senator Reid, to try to conclude a list of amendments. \nOur list is about 2\\1/2\\ pages long, I would guess, with around 60 \namendments listed. Realistically, there are probably not more than 10 \nthat we are going to have to deal with on that list. I know Senator \nBingaman and the Democrats are working toward an effort to identify \ntheir amendments as well.\n  I hope that as soon as we get off the judges, we can go back and \nproceed to move amendments yet today and on into the evening. I have no \nidea what the schedule is tomorrow, but perhaps the majority whip can \nenlighten me. I wanted to make it clear from our point of view as to \nwhat to anticipate and what we have ahead of us.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Alaska will yield, I will respond.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The matter with the judges will be resolved by 3 o'clock \nthis afternoon. We will take that up in 10 minutes. After that, we will \ngo into whatever amendments the distinguished Republican leader of this \nbill wants to move. We hope his number of about 10 serious amendments \nis more accurate than 60. We know that when there is a finite list, a \nlot of people file relevants and they are not really serious about \noffering them. Having spoken to the majority leader and Senator \nBingaman today, we really want to get a finite list of amendments we \ncan put our fingers on, in the hopes of completing this legislation.\n  If there are 10 amendments dealing with serious subjects, that is \ndoable. If we get 25, 30 amendments, there are some who would recommend \nto the leader to file cloture and maybe go to something else. I hope \nthat is not necessary. We have spent a lot of time on this bill. It is \nworthy of time.\n  There is nothing we can do that is more serious than working on the \nenergy policy of this country. We know the Senator has the ANWR \namendment, which has created so much interest, and we hope to get to \nthat soon.\n  In short, we want to finish this bill as badly as the Senator from \nAlaska. We hope by this afternoon we can have some light at the end of \nthe tunnel to do that.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the majority whip yield? Is there any indication \nwhat we might anticipate tomorrow? Is it too early to make that \ndecision?\n  Mr. REID. If we have reason to be here, the leader has not said we \nwill have no votes. There could be votes. It is the day before the \nrecess. If we have things we can do and it will lead to our completing \nthis bill when we get back, I am sure the leader will want to work \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I do not want to misunderstand my good friend. Did he \nindicate there has been a decision there will be no votes tomorrow?\n  Mr. REID. The leader has said just the opposite; there will be votes. \nWe want to have votes on substantive matters. We do not want to, on the \nday before the recess, have make-do votes. We are going to have \nsomething that is meaningful. With the subject matter that was briefly \noutlined by the Senator from Alaska, those are very serious matters, \nand I hope we can be working on some of them tonight and tomorrow.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous \norder be delayed and that I be permitted to speak for up to 15 minutes \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 2042 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 3033 and 3040\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 hours of debate to be evenly \ndivided on two amendments dealing with judicial nominations.\n\n[[Page S2200]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, earlier this week when the Senate was \nconsidering confirming the 42nd judge since the shift in majority last \nsummer, I came to tell the Senate of the progress we have made filling \njudicial vacancies in the past 9 months. The pace of consideration and \nconfirmation of judicial nominees in the last 9 months exceeds what we \nused to see in the preceding 6\\1/2\\ years. During that 6\\1/2\\ years \nunder Republican control, vacancies grew from 63 to 105 and were rising \nto 111. I lay this out so people understand what is happening.\n  Since July, we have made bipartisan progress. This chart shows the \ntrend lines. During the Republican majority, the vacancies were going \nup to 111; in the short time the Democrats have been in the majority, \nthose vacancies have been cut down.\n  The Democrats have controlled the majority in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee for 9 months. What did we do during that 9 months? We have \nconfirmed more judges--42, all nominated by President Bush. In those 9 \nmonths, we confirmed more judges than the Republicans did for President \nClinton in the 12 months of the year 2000. We confirmed more judges in \nthose 9 months than the Republicans did during the 12 months of 1999. \nIn those 9 months, we confirmed more judges for President Bush than the \nRepublicans did for President Clinton during the 12 months of 1997. \nDuring those 9 months, we confirmed more judges for President Bush than \nthe Republicans did for the 12 months of 1996.\n  We can compare our 9 months, and we have not finished a full year of \nbeing in the majority. In 9 months, we confirmed more judges for \nPresident Bush than the Republicans were willing to confirm for \nPresident Clinton in 12 months in the years 2000, 1999, 1997, and 1996.\n\n  Under Democratic leadership, the Senate has filled longstanding \nvacancies on the courts of appeal. We exceeded the rate of attrition. \nIn less than 9 months, the Senate has confirmed seven judges to the \ncourts of appeals. We have held hearings on three others. We have \ndrastically shortened the average time, by approximately a third, for \nconfirmation of circuit court nominees compared to the Senate under \nRepublican control between 1995 and 2001. And we are committed to \nholding more hearings on those where we received blue slips and have \nconsensus nominees. Comparing what the Republicans did during 1999 and \n2000, they refused to even hold hearings or vote on more than half of \nPresident Clinton's court of appeals nominees.\n  I mention this because I have always said let's get these people up, \nhave a hearing, and let the committee vote. In the last 6 years, dozens \nupon dozens of President Clinton's nominees were never even given a \nvote in the committee. I have tried to reverse that.\n  Between 1995 and when the Democrats took over the majority, vacancies \non the courts of appeal rose to a total of almost 250 percent higher \nthan before. When we finally took over, we were faced with 32 vacancies \non the courts of appeal. In spite of this, the Democratic majority has \nkept up with the rate of attrition by confirming seven judges to the \ncircuit courts in only 9 months and holding more hearings on three \nmore. Particularly, we have been working to improve conditions in the \nFifth, Tenth, and Eighth sitting.\n  During the last 9 months, the Judiciary Committee has restored steady \nprogress to the judicial confirmation process. The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee is doing what it has not done for the 6 years before. We are \nholding regular hearings on judicial nominees. We are giving nominees a \nvote in committee, in contrast to the practice of anonymous holds and \nother tactics employed by some during the period of Republican control. \nIn less than 9 months, the Senate Judiciary Committee has held 15 \nhearings involving judicial nominations. That is more hearings on \njudges than the Republican majority held in any year of its control of \nthe Senate. Already, 48 judicial nominees have participated in those \nhearings.\n\n  In contrast, one-sixth of President Clinton's judicial nominees, more \nthan 50, never got a committee hearing nor a committee vote from the \nRepublican majority. This is one of the reasons why there were so many \nvacancies when President Bush took office.\n  No hearings were held before June 29, 2001, by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, even though they were in control. No judges were confirmed \nby the Senate from among the nominees received by the Senate on January \n3, 2001, or further nominees received from President Bush in May.\n  This is the background for the sense-of-the-Senate amendment that \nwill be offered by Majority Leader Daschle which would confirm that the \ncommittee should continue to hold confirmation hearings for judicial \nnominees as expeditiously as possible. That is true for all judicial \nnominees, including those first received on May 9 of 2001.\n  The language offered by Senator Daschle also recognizes that with \nbarely 4 weeks in session before May 9, 2002, calling for confirmation \nhearings on eight controversial courts of appeals nominees is a call \nthat is unheard of. It was certainly never approached during the past 6 \nyears. I would suspect that my friends on the Republican side are most \nafraid of one thing: They hope the Democratic majority would never do \nto them and a Republican President what they did as a Republican \nmajority to a Democratic President.\n  I can assure them as long as I am chairman we will not do to them \nwhat they did to us. I am not going to do that. It hurts the \nindependence of the judiciary, and I am not going to do that.\n  I remember a whole session, in 1996, in which the Republican majority \ndid not confirm a single judge to the courts of appeals; another in \nwhich the committee reported only three courts of appeals nominees all \nyear. But we are not going to go back to those days. We are going to do \na lot better. But you cannot call for hearings on eight courts of \nappeals nominees in 4 weeks. That would be asking the current committee \nto do in 1 month what the committee under Republican leadership did not \ndo for months, in fact sometimes for years.\n  It is disingenuous to compare the last 9 months with the Senate \nmajority and President of different parties to years when the majority \nparty and the President were the same. A fairer comparison might be \nwith the first 9 months of the 104th Congress, where the parties of the \nPresident and the Senate majority were different. That comparison shows \nwe made more progress, held more hearings, confirmed more judges, \nincluding courts of appeals judges, than when the party roles were \nreversed in 1995.\n  In 1995, we had a Democratic President and a Republican majority. \nTake their 9 months. They had nine hearings in 9 months with a \nDemocratic majority and Republican President. We actually had 15. I \nwill correct this--15, because we had one Tuesday. In their 9 months, \nthey had 36 confirmations; we have had 42. So we have made more \nprogress, held more hearings, confirmed more judges than when the party \nroles were reversed in 1995. Actually, 1995 was when the Republicans \nhad one of its most productive years on judges.\n  In a comparison made between the beginning of the second session of \nthe 104th Congress when the President was a Democrat and the Senate \nmajority was Republican, with the beginning of this, when roles were \nreversed, that fair comparison shows that we have already confirmed 14 \njudges this session, including 1 to the court of appeals, while the \nRepublican Senate ended up confirming only 17 judges all year--none to \nthe courts of appeals.\n  When we finish this first year in the majority, I can assure the \nSenate our record will be better than the years we saw with the \nRepublicans, by any kind of standard at all. Look at the first 3 months \nof the session. We have been confirming--we confirmed 14 judges.\n  In March 1995, in their first 3 months, when they were in charge with \na Democratic President and Republican majority, they confirmed 9; by \nMarch of 1996 when they were in charge, they confirmed zero; by March \nof 1997 when they were in charge they confirmed 2; by March of 1998 \nthey hit their zenith, they confirmed 12. They made up for it the next \nyear, March of 1999, they confirmed zero. By March of 2000, they \nconfirmed 7; by March of 2001 they confirmed zero. By March of this \nyear, we confirmed 14.\n\n[[Page S2201]]\n\n  Madam President, I see the distinguished ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee on the floor, so I will yield the floor and reserve \nthe remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For the information of the Senate, the clerk \nwill report by number the amendments currently under consideration.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3033.\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. REID], for Mr. Daschle, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3040.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3040\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . FAIR TREATMENT OF PRESIDENTIAL JUDICIAL NOMINEES.\n\n       That it is the sense of the Senate that, in the interests \n     of the administration of justice, the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee should along with its other legislative and \n     oversight responsibilities, continue to hold regular hearings \n     on judicial nominees and should, in accordance with the \n     precedents and practices of the Committee, schedule hearings \n     on the nominees submitted by the President on May 9, 2001, \n     and resubmitted on September 5, 2001, expeditiously.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, here we go again: statistics judo being \nused on the floor of the Senate courtesy of the Judiciary Committee.\n  I am going to always address these statistics with the facts. The \nbottom line is the facts speak for themselves. We have an unprecedented \nand shocking 31 vacancies on the Federal circuit courts of appeals in \nthis country. That is not progress.\n  Last Thursday, Senator Lott introduced a resolution calling for the \nJudiciary Committee to hold hearings on each of the circuit court \njudges nominated by President Bush on May 9 of last year.\n  We are coming up on the 1-year anniversary of those nominations, and \nyet only 3 of the 11 nominees have had hearings and confirmation votes. \nAll of these nominees have received well-qualified or qualified ratings \nfrom the American Bar Association, which some of my Democratic \ncolleagues have described as the gold standard in evaluating judicial \nnominees.\n  Why is it so problematic that none of these 8 nominees have received \na hearing or vote? It is no secret that there is a vacancy crisis in \nthe Federal circuit courts, and that we are making no progress in \naddressing it.\n  Let's take a look at some numbers. A total of 22 circuit nominations \nare pending in the Judiciary Committee. But we have confirmed only one \ncircuit judge this year, and only seven since President Bush took \noffice.\n  When Senate Democrats took over the Judiciary Committee in June of \nlast year, there were 31 circuit court vacancies, and there remain 31 \ncircuit court vacancies today. This does not represent progress--it \nrepresents stagnation.\n  In contrast, at the end of 1995, which was Republicans' first year of \ncontrol of the Judiciary Committee during the Clinton administration, \nthere were only 13 circuit vacancies.\n  In fact, during President Clinton's first term, circuit court \nvacancies never exceeded 20 at the end of any year--including 1996, a \nPresidential election year, when the pace of confirmations has \ntraditionally slowed.\n  Moreover, there were only two circuit nominees left pending in \ncommittee at the end of President Clinton's first year in office. In \ncontrast, 23 of President Bush's circuit nominees were left hanging in \ncommittee at the end of last year.\n  In light of the vacancy crisis, we cannot afford to let only 10 \nSenators defeat a circuit nominee. This is a question of process, not \nof seeking favorable treatment.\n  For all these reasons, it is imperative to support Senator Lott's \nresolution to get hearings and votes for our longest pending circuit \nnominees. Given the vacancy crisis in our circuit courts, I can't \nimagine anyone voting against it. I must respond to some of the \ncomments that my colleagues across the aisle have made about the pace \nof judicial confirmations. These comments have included a gross \ndistortion of my record as chairman of the Judiciary Committee during \nsix years of the Clinton administration. Although we have all heard \nenough of the numbers, I will not hesitate to defend my record when it \nis unjustly attacked, as it has been over the past week and I think \nhere today.\n\n  I believe that the source of many, if not all, of these attacks stems \nfrom the defensive posture that many of Democratic colleagues have \ntaken since 10 members of the Judiciary Committee refused to send the \nnomination of Judge Charles Pickering to the floor for a vote by the \nfull Senate. Some of these colleagues have defended what they call the \nSenate's fair treatment of judicial nominees in general and Judge \nPickering in specific. But the fact of the matter is that the Senate \nnever got the opportunity to vote on Judge Pickering's nomination. The \nreality is that the 10 Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee \ndetermined for the rest of the Senate the fate of Judge Pickering's \nnomination.\n  We all know that had it been brought to the Senate he would have gone \nthrough with flying colors.\n  This is despite the fact--or perhaps because of the fact--that had \nJudge Pickering's nomination been considered by the full Senate, he \nvery likely would have been confirmed, and I think with flying colors.\n  The committee's treatment of Judge Pickering is problematic for \nseveral reasons.\n  First, during the 6 years that Republicans controlled the Senate \nduring the Clinton administration, not once was one of his judicial \nnominations killed by a committee vote. The sole Clinton nominee who \nwas defeated nevertheless received a floor vote by the full Senate. \nJudge Pickering was denied that opportunity. Some of my Democratic \ncolleagues have said that their treatment of Judge Pickering was not \npayback. In one sense, they are right. If they were interested in \ntreating President Bush's nominees as well as the Republicans treated \nPresident Clinton's nominees, the they would have sent Judge \nPickering's nomination to the floor for a vote by the full Senate.\n  Second, the actions of the Democratic members of the committee were \nclearly orchestrated by liberal special interest groups that have been \ndoing it for years whenever there is a Republican President. It is no \ncoincidence that these groups asked the committee to demand Judge \nPickering's unpublished opinions, then--surprise!--the committee \nannounces that it will compel Judge Pickering to produce all of his \nunpublished opinions.\n  For judges to go back and go through all their unpublished opinions, \nif they have been on the bench for very long, is extraordinary.\n  I do not recall another nominee who has been subjected to a \nproduction demand of such scope--except, of course, for Judge D. Brooks \nSmith, another Bush nominee whom the groups have targeted.\n  Let me read the text of the letter to Judge Smith. It simply say,\n\n       Copies of your unpublished opinions, not previously \n     produced to the committee, have been requested by Members. \n     Please contact our nominations clerk . . . to arrange \n     transmission of the materials. Thank you for your assistance \n     in this matter.\n\n  That is it. There is no explanation for why the committee is \ndemanding these unpublished opinions, and there was no consultation \nwith the Republicans about taking the drastic step of demanding these \nopinions. This letter, incidentally, was sent to Judge Smith after his \nconfirmation hearing, just as with Judge Pickering. There is nothing \nfair about subjecting nominees to fishing expeditions simply because \nthe liberal special interest groups do not like them. The committee's \ntreatment of Judge Pickering's nomination was not an example of the \ncommittee doing its job, as one of my colleagues described it last \nweek. Instead, it is an example of special interest groups pulling \nstrings. I am deeply concerned about what this means for the fairness \nwith which future judicial nominees will be treated--especially any \nSupreme Court justice that President Bush may have the opportunity to \nnominate.\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues have tried to minimize the effect of \ntheir party-line committee vote to defeat Judge Pickering's nomination \nby declaring that, last year, they held the first confirmation hearing \non a fifth circuit judge since 1994. While this is technically true, \nthere is an important fact they leave out: From 1994 to 1997 during the \nClinton administration--get this--no fifth circuit nominees were\n\n[[Page S2202]]\n\npending for the committee to act on. President Clinton did not nominate \nanother fifth circuit judge until 1997, and that nominee did not have \nhome State support due to lack of consultation from the White House.\n  And that was the problem. He was not renominated after the end of the \n105th Congress. The next fifth circuit judge was not nominated until \n1999.\n  So to say from 1999 they haven't had any work on that fifth circuit \njust shows the type of sophistry that is used. This one fifth circuit \njudge who was nominated in 1999, too, lacked home State support due to \nlack of consultation from the White House.\n  Finally a third Fifth Circuit nominee was nominated in 1999. So, in \nreality, only one of President Clinton's Fifth Circuit nominees after \n1999 could have possibly moved, and I should say that nominee was not \nnominated until the seventh year of the Clinton presidency.\n  Now, let's compare this record to the present Bush administration. \nThe Democrats have already killed one of President Bush's Fifth Circuit \nnominees, Judge Pickering, who enjoys the strong support of both of his \nhome State senators. If they are being guided by precedent, then my \nDemocratic colleagues have no excuses for refusing to move every other \nFifth Circuit Bush nominee who has home State support. One such \nnominee, Justice Priscilla Owen of Texas, has been pending in committee \nfor over 300 days now without so much as a hearing which brings me to \nanother point.\n  My Democratic colleagues have argued at length about how fairly they \nare treating President Bush's judicial nominees, especially his circuit \nnominees. In fact, last week one of my colleagues said on the floor, \n``We are trying to accord nominees whose paperwork is complete and \nwhose blue slips are returned both a hearing and a fair up or down \nvote.'' This colleague must have forgotten about the eight circuit \njudges whom President Bush nominated on May 9 of last year and who have \nbeen languishing in committee without so much as a hearing for over 300 \ndays. With one exception, the paperwork on all of these nominees has \nbeen complete for months. Each of these nominees has received a rating \nof well-qualified--the highest rating the ABA can give--or qualified \nfrom the ABA, which my Democratic colleagues have referred to as the \ngold standard in evaluating judicial nominees.\n  The rest of President Bush's circuit nominees have fared just as \npoorly.\n  As this chart shows, only 9 percent of his circuit nominees awaiting \na committee vote have had a hearing thus far. Nine percent are \nlanguishing in the committee--for over 300 days. This means that 91 \npercent of his circuit nominees, including 8 of his first 11 circuit \njudges nominated on May 9, have been languishing in committee for no \nreason, but that the liberal interest groups don't want them to move. \nThese are outside groups.\n  The failure of the committee to act on these circuit nominees is \nparticularly disturbing in light of the vacancy crisis in the circuit \ncourts.\n  As this chart illustrates, the number of vacancies in the circuit \ncourts is dramatically higher than it has been during the first 2 years \nof the most recent Presidential administrations. At the end of the \nfirst 2 years of the Herbert Walker Bush administration, there were \nonly 7 circuit court vacancies. At the end of the first 2 years of the \nfirst term of the Clinton administration, there were only 15 circuit \nvacancies. At the end of the first 2 years of the second term of the \nClinton administration, there were only 14 vacancies.\n  Incidentally, I chaired the Judiciary Committee during this time, and \nthere were fewer vacancies than there were when Democrats controlled \nthe Senate during the first 2 years of the first time of the Clinton \nadministration when the Democrats controlled the committee.\n  Now, let's look at the present administration. There are currently 31 \nvacancies in the circuit court of appeals. Is is a disaster. This is \nthe same exact number of vacancies in the circuit courts that existed \nwhen the Democrats took control of the Senate on June 5 of last year.\n  This does not represent progress. This does not represent fairness. \nThis does not show a good job being done by the Judiciary Committee. It \nrepresents stagnation. It is for this reason that I find it more than a \nlittle hard to swallow my colleagues' arguments that their pace of \njudicial confirmations is keeping up with the vacancy rate. The numbers \nsimply tell another story.\n  We are making absolutely no progress in addressing the vacancy crisis \nin the Federal judiciary. Even if you look beyond the circuit courts to \nthe full judiciary--and we will just put these numbers up here as shown \non the chart--these numbers are not much better.\n  The end-of-session vacancies during the first 2 years of Republican \ncontrol of the Senate during the Clinton administration never exceeded \nthe vacancies we now face. At the end of 1995--my first year of \nchairing the committee--there were 50 vacancies in the Federal \njudiciary. Only 13 of these vacancies were in the circuit courts--only \n13.\n  At the end of 1996--my second year of chairing the committee--there \nwere 63 vacancies in the Federal judiciary.\n  I might mention, when Senator Biden led the Democrats and chaired the \ncommittee--and I thought he did a great job--when he chaired the \ncommittee, in the same period, at the end of 1992, there were 97 \nvacancies. But there were only 63 vacancies at the end of my second \nyear. Only 18 of those were in the circuit courts. Now, that was too \nmany, I admit, but it is certainly not 31 as we have today.\n  But at the end of last session, there were 94 vacancies in the \nFederal judiciary. Now, admittedly, the Democrats did not have a full \nyear to take care of it, but, still, 94 vacancies is a high vacancy \ntotal at the end of the session.\n  Now we have 95 vacancies after almost a year, which is a dramatic \nincrease from the 67 vacancies that existed at the end of the 106th \nCongress. As we have seen, 31 of these vacancies are in the circuit \ncourts.\n  What does this mean? It means the Senate's pace under Democratic \ncontrol in confirming President Bush's judicial nominees is simply not \nkeeping up with the increasing vacancy rate, not even in accordance \nwith the precedence and practices of the committee.\n  I have heard a lot of comments about how they are going to treat \nRepublicans like we treated them, that they are going to treat \nRepublicans just as fairly as we treated them. My gosh, the record \nshows we are not being treated fairly at all. You might be able to find \nsome things to criticize in any Judiciary Committee chairman's tenure \nbecause of the difficulties in working with the other 99 people, but \nthe fact is, this isn't fair.\n  For anyone who doubts that the vacancy crisis represents a problem, \nlet me point out that the Sixth Circuit Court is presently functioning \nat 50-percent capacity--50 percent. That is a disaster. Eight of that \ncourt's 16 seats are vacant. President Bush nominated seven well-\nqualified individuals to fill the vacancies on that court.\n  Two of these nominees, Deborah Cook--a wonderful woman lawyer--and \nJeffrey Sutton--one of the finest appellate lawyers in the country--\nhave been pending since May 9 of last year. They were among the first \n11 judges that President Bush nominated. Yet they have languished in \ncommittee without so much as a hearing, while the Sixth Circuit \nfunctions at 50-percent capacity.\n  Although the Michigan Senators have blocked hearings for the three \nBush nominees from Michigan by refusing to return blue slips, the \npaperwork on the remaining four nominees is complete. Again, nothing \nstands between them and a confirmation hearing except my Democratic \ncolleagues.\n\n  Let me also say that I find it highly unusual that blue slips \nwithheld in one State should be used to denigrate or to hold up judges \nfrom another State. I do not think Senators should be given that kind \nof authority, but that is what is being done here.\n  Another appellate court that is in trouble is in the DC Circuit, the \nCircuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is missing \none-third of its judges. It has only 8 of its 12 seats filled. That is \none of the most important courts in our country. It hears cases that \nother circuits do not hear. It hears an awful lot of administrative law \ncases. It is a busy court. Yet we only have 8 of the 12 seats filled.\n  President Bush nominated two exceedingly well-qualified individuals \nto fill seats on the DC Circuit on May 9 of last year, better than 300 \ndays ago.\n\n[[Page S2203]]\n\n  Miguel Estrada, a Hispanic, who has a remarkable record, and has \nargued 15 cases in front of the Supreme Court of the United States, \ncould not even speak English when he came to this country, and is one \nof the most articulate, impressive, intelligent advocates in our \ncountry today--not even given a hearing. Well-qualified by the American \nBar Association.\n  John Roberts: I talked to one of the Supreme Court Justices just a \nshort while ago. He said he is one of the two top appellate lawyers in \nthis country today. He is not particularly an ideologue. This man is a \ngreat lawyer. He has Democrat and Republican support. So does Miguel \nEstrada, by the way.\n  They are among the most well-respected appellate lawyers in the \ncountry. And I should say that Miguel Estrada would be the first \nHispanic to ever serve on the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District \nof Columbia, to sit on this important court.\n  My friends on the other side talk a lot about diversity, but \napparently it is diversity only if the candidates agree with the \nextreme liberal views of the special interest groups in this town. And \nthey are in this town. They really do not represent the people at \nlarge--narrow interest groups. This troubles me. The Judiciary \nCommittee has not granted them a hearing, much less a vote.\n  If the DC Circuit and the Sixth Circuit are any indication, it \nappears the committee is doing what it can to avoid filling seats on \nthe courts that need judges the most.\n  Part of the problem is a reluctance by the committee to move more \nthan one circuit judge per hearing. In fact, I do not believe the \nDemocrats have moved more than one circuit judge per hearing during the \nentire time they have had control of the Senate.\n  When I was chairman, I had 10 hearings with more than one circuit \nnominee on the agenda. In fact, I had hearings with more than one \ncircuit nominee on the agenda in every session in which I was chairman \nexcept for the Presidential election years. That is the precedent and \nthe practice of the committee.\n  Let's stop making excuses. Let's confirm these judges. If we are \ngoing to get serious about filling circuit vacancies, then I encourage \nmy Democratic colleagues to move more than one circuit judge per \nhearing.\n  One of the more ludicrous charges I have heard is that \nthe Republicans did not confirm any judges while they held the majority \nin the Senate last year. Let me set the record straight on this. \nPresident Bush announced his first 11 judicial nominations on May 9. I \nscheduled a confirmation hearing on 3 of those judicial nominees--all \ncircuit court nominees--for May 23.\n\n  However, some Democratic members of the committee claimed to need \nmore time to assess the nominees. Out of an abundance of caution, a \nrecognition of their feelings, and in the interest of fairness, I \nagreed to cancel the hearing despite widespread speculation that the \nRepublicans' loss of the majority in the Senate was imminent. As we all \nknow, control of the Senate shifted to the Democrats shortly thereafter \non June 5.\n  So while the Republicans were ready to hold a hearing on 3 circuit \njudges within 2 weeks of their nomination in May, it took the Democrats \nuntil the end of August to hold confirmation hearings on 3 circuit \njudges. By the way, 2 of them were Democrats, so it is not hard to \nunderstand why they would want to get them through. And I wanted to get \nthem through, too. And I want to get them through before, at least one \nof them, now Judge Gregory.\n  I have to admit, when these special interest groups on our side came \nto me, some of the far right groups, I told them: Get lost. And I made \nsome real enemies in the process. But, by gosh, I wanted to do my job \nas Judiciary Committee chairman.\n  I know it is a difficult job. And I know my colleague has a very \ndifficult time with colleagues, with outside groups, with all kinds of \nproblems. I had the same problems. But sooner or later, we have to do \nsomething about these problems. I have also heard my Democratic \ncolleagues complain that I was unfair because almost 60 Clinton \nnominees never received a hearing or vote. I have two responses to this \ncharge.\n  Let me just go to this chart.\n  First, as the following chart shows, the Democrat who controlled the \nSenate during the first Bush administration left 59 judicial nominees \ntotal, circuit and district nominees, without a hearing or vote at the \nend of 4 years--59. And they are complaining? In contrast, only 53 \nClinton nominees were not confirmed over my 6 years as chairman. But \nthat was in 4 years that they left 59. Now, mine was 53. Yet my \nDemocratic colleagues claim that I was unfair to the Clinton nominees \ndespite the fact they left more Bush 1 nominees unconfirmed in an \nactual shorter period of time.\n  Second, many of the Clinton nominees who were not confirmed had good \nreasons for not moving. As I have mentioned, not including withdrawn \nnominees, there were only 53 Article III judicial nominees who were \nnominated by President Clinton during my 6 years as chairman who did \nnot get confirmed. Of those, nine were nominated too late in a Congress \nfor the committee to feasibly act on them or were lacking paperwork. \nThat leaves 44. Seventeen of those lacked home State support, which was \noften the result of a lack of consultation with home State senators. \nThere was no way to confirm those, no matter how much I would have \nliked to, without completely ignoring the Senatorial courtesy that we \nafford to home State Senators in the nominations process, as has always \nbeen the case. That leaves 27. of the original 53. One nominee was \ndefeated on the Senate floor, which leaves only 26 remaining nominees. \nOf those 26, some may have had other reasons for not moving that I \nsimply cannot comment on. So in all 6 years that I chaired the \ncommittee while President Clinton was in office, we are really only \ntalking about 26 nominees who were left.\n\n  Now I heard one of my Democratic colleagues on the floor last week \ncomparing their pace to mine in increments of months--9 months to 12 \nmonths, 9 months to 9 months, 3 months to 3 months, and so on. I must \nadmit that I had a tough time following his argument in light of the \nastronomical vacancy rate that we now face in the Federal judiciary. \nbut in terms of fairness, let me set forth what I consider to be the \nbottom line. President Clinton enjoyed an 85 percent confirmation rate \non the individuals he nominated. A total of 377 Clinton nominees sit on \nthe Federal bench today. That was with my help in every case.\n  This number is only 5 short of the all-time confirmation champion, \nPresident Reagan, who had 382 judges confirmed by the Senate. I believe \nPresident Clinton would actually have had more, had it not been for \nDemocratic holds in the Senate that I knew about at the end of that \nlast session. Keep in mind, President Clinton had 6 years of a \nRepublican Senate, the opposition party, yet had virtually the same \nnumber of people confirmed as the all-time champion, President Reagan, \nwho had 6 years of his own party in control of the Judiciary Committee \nin the Senate. It is astounding to hear some of these arguments against \nwhat we did.\n  Go over it again. President Clinton, with a 6-year opposition party, \nand me as chairman, had 377 judges confirmed in his 8 years, during 6 \nof which Republicans controlled the Senate. President Reagan, the all-\ntime champion, got 5 more, 382, and he had 6 years of a favorable party \nSenate.\n  I don't think there is much room to be complaining about what \nhappened during the Clinton years.\n  When President Bush's judicial confirmations start approaching these \nnumbers, then I may be ready to agree that the Democrats are treating \nPresident Bush's nominees fairly.\n  Let me add something more. If you look at this chart, it is pretty \nimportant because it shows that the total vacancies at the end of the \n102nd Congress were 95. But if you go to the pending nominees not \nconfirmed at the end of Bush 1, there were 11 circuit court nominees \nand 48 district court nominees, for a total of 59 circuit and district \ncourt nominees.\n  If we go to the end of President Clinton, it really tells the story.\n  In President Clinton's first 4 years, we had a total of 202 judges \nconfirmed. When the Democrats controlled the committee in 1993, there \nwere 112 vacancies at the end of the session. Mine was 54--53, \nactually. At the end of 1994, when they controlled the committee, there \nwere 63 vacancies. I remember\n\n[[Page S2204]]\n\nPresident Clinton saying that was a full judiciary. Senator Biden was \nthe chairman, and I agreed. Somewhere around 60 judges is basically a \nfull judiciary. There may be problems in certain areas, but basically \nthat is a full judiciary.\n  In 1995, the first year after we took over, there were 50 total \nvacancies left and only 13 circuit court nominees left. Keep in mind, \nwhen the Democrats controlled, on circuit court nominees, there were 20 \nat the end of 1993 and in 1994 there were 15. That is what you have to \ndo at the end of session--not just choose any 3 months you want to in \nany year. Let's talk in terms of fairness here and statistics.\n  Let's go down it again. President Clinton in 1993 nominated five to \nthe circuit court. President Bush has nominated 31--actually more than \nthat. He had 3 nominees confirmed, but there were 20 circuit court \nnominees at the end of that session. In 1994, he nominated 17, \nsubmitted 17; there were 16 who were confirmed. There were 15 left over \nat the end of 1994. The Democrats controlled the committee. In 1995, he \nnominated 16; there were 11 confirmed of the 16. That is a far better \nrecord than we are hearing about the complaints from the Democrats on \nwhat happened under my leadership. There were only 13 left, a 7.3-\npercent vacancy rate.\n  In 1996, I was chairman again. We only had four nominations. That is \nwhy none was confirmed. It was an election year. Eighteen were left \nover. If you stop and think about it, that is still 13 fewer than the \nvacancy rate right now, or the vacancy rate that existed last May 9, 31 \nvacancies.\n  In the district courts, if you want to go through it, in 1993 there \nwere 42 nominations submitted; 24 were confirmed. That is when the \nDemocrats controlled the committee. There were 92 vacancies at the end \nof the session.\n\n  In 1994, there were 77 nominations in the district court; 84 were \nconfirmed. And there were only 48 left at the end of that session. In \n1995, when I took over, there were 68 nominations; 45 were confirmed. \nAnd there were 37 vacancies. In 1996, there were 17 nominations \nsubmitted; 17 were confirmed. In that year, 45 at the end of that \nsession.\n  But if we go to circuit and district courts combined, in 1993, when \nthe Democrats controlled the Senate, there were 47 total nominations \nsubmitted. There were 27 that were confirmed when the Democrats \ncontrolled the committee and their own President was there. And there \nwere 112 vacancies at the end of that session. In 1994, there were 94 \ntotal nominations submitted; there were 100 nominations confirmed. And \nthere were only 63, which is still 10 higher than it was at the end of \nmy tenure, at the end of the session when President Clinton left \noffice.\n  In 1995, there were 84 nominations submitted; 56 were confirmed. And \nthere were 50 left over at that time. Then in 1996, there were 21 total \nnominations submitted; 17 confirmed. There were 63 left over.\n  As you can see, if we compare the statistics, the Democrats were not \nmistreated. They were treated fairly. Admittedly, it is a tough job \nbeing chairman of the Judiciary Committee. These are hot issues. There \nare always some people in the Senate, whether liberals or \nconservatives, who don't like certain judges. Let's face it. It is not \neasy to handle some of those problems. But I have to admit, the \nDemocrats have been treated very fairly. I would like to see us treated \njust as fairly as they were. With 95 vacancies existing today, it is \napparent that the job is not getting done.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to support the \namendment offered by the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott, our \ndistinguished Republican leader, that the Senate Judiciary Committee \nshall hold hearings on the nominees submitted by the President on May \n9, 2001, by May 9, 2002.\n  It is my view that this resolution is preeminently reasonable. \nSenator Daschle, the majority leader, has submitted a resolution in the \nnature of a first-degree amendment saying that the hearings should be \nconducted expeditiously.\n  It is my hope there will be a truce on the confirmation battles that \nhave been raging for a very long time--during most of the 22-year \ntenure I have had in the Senate, all of which has been on the Judiciary \nCommittee. We have seen that when there is a Democrat in the White \nHouse--for example, President Clinton--and Republicans controlled the \nSenate in 1995 through the balance of President Clinton's term--that \nthe same controversy arose. I have said publicly, and I repeat today, \nthat I believe my party was wrong in delaying the nominations of Judge \nPaez for the Ninth Circuit and Judge Berzon for the Ninth Circuit and \nJudge Gregory for the Fourth Circuit and the battle along party lines \nthat arose over the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant \nAttorney General for the Civil Rights Division.\n  Just as I thought Republicans were wrong in the confirmation process \nduring much of President Clinton's tenure, I think the Democrats are \nwrong on what is happening now with the slowness of the confirmation \nprocess.\n  It may be that, in the final year of a Presidential term, some \nmotivation would exist to delay the process so that if a President of \nthe other party is elected, there might be a different attitude on the \nnominations.\n  Certainly those considerations do not apply in a first year or in a \nsecond year. The individuals who were nominated by the President on May \n9 were very well qualified, I think extraordinarily well qualified, \nbeing the first batch submitted by the President.\n  It would be my hope that we could establish a protocol. I have \nprepared a resolution which would go beyond what Senator Lott has \ncalled for and would call for a timetable established by the chairman \nof the committee, in collaboration with the ranking member, to set a \nsequence for when a nominee for the district court, circuit court, or \nSupreme Court would have a hearing. Let that be established and let it \nbe followed regardless of who controls the White House and regardless \nof who controls the Senate.\n  Then a timetable ought to be established for a markup for action by \nthe committee in executive session, and a timetable should be \nestablished for reporting the nomination out to the floor.\n  There ought to be latitude and flexibility for that timetable to be \nchanged for cause where there is a need for a second hearing or where \nan additional investigation has to be undertaken. But there ought to be \na set schedule which would apply regardless of a Democrat making \nappointments to a Judiciary Committee controlled by Republicans or a \nPresident who is a Republican submitting nominations to the committee \ncontrolled by the Democrats. It seems to me that just makes fundamental \ngood sense.\n  If we established that protocol, it would stay in effect and we would \nend the political division which is not good for the reputation of the \nSenate, it is not good for the reputations of the Senators, and most \nimportantly, it is not good for the country.\n  The resolution I have prepared would further provide that where a \nvote occurs for a district court judge or court of appeals judge along \nparty lines, that nomination be submitted for action by the full \nSenate. The rationale behind that, simply stated, is if it is partisan \npolitics, then let the full Senate decide it.\n  We just went through a bloody battle, and I think a very unfortunate \nbattle, on Judge Pickering. I believe the\n\n[[Page S2205]]\n\nreal issue of Judge Pickering was notice to President Bush about the \njudicial philosophy of a nominee for the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, if and when a vacancy occurs.\n  I do not intend to reargue the Pickering matter, and I know the \ndistinguished Senator who is presiding, the Senator from North \nCarolina, has a different view of the matter, but Judge Pickering is a \nvery different man in 2002 than he was in the early 1970s when he was a \nState senator from Mississippi, when segregation was the norm. Judge \nPickering had a lot of support from people in his hometown of Laurel, \nMS, who are African Americans, who came in and urged his confirmation.\n  Judge Pickering is behind us. We ought to learn a lesson from Judge \nPickering.\n  There are six precedents which Senator Hatch has put into the Record \nwhere nominees turned down for district court or circuit court were \nconsidered by the full Senate. That was the practice when Judge Bork \nwas turned down by the Judiciary Committee on a 9-to-5 vote. He was \nthen considered by the full Senate and ultimately defeated 58 to 42, \nbut he was considered by the full Senate.\n  Justice Thomas had a tie vote in the Senate. We have not had any \nnominee in my tenure--perhaps no nominee in the history of the Court--\nmore controversial than Justice Thomas. But when the motion was made to \nsubmit Justice Thomas for consideration by the full Senate, it was \napproved 13 to 1.\n\n  My resolution further calls for Supreme Court nominees to be \nconsidered by the full Senate regardless of the committee vote, and I \nbelieve there has been an acknowledgment on all sides--more than a \nconsensus, a unanimous view--perhaps just a consensus, but the general \nview that a Supreme Court nominee ought to be submitted to the full \nSenate.\n  My resolution will also provide that the matter will be taken up by \nthe full Senate on a schedule to be established by the majority leader, \nin consultation with the minority leader.\n  We ought to get on with the business of confirmations. Senator Lott's \nproposal of a 1-year period I think is preeminently reasonable. One \nmight call it a statute of limitations in reverse. We lawyers believe \nin statutes of limitations.\n  Beyond Senator Lott's amendment, I believe there ought to be a \nprotocol which would establish timetables and a procedure for ending \nthis political gridlock, taking partisanship out of the judicial \nselection process so that the courts can take care of the business of \nthe country. There are many courts in a state of emergency with too few \njudges to handle the important litigation of America. I know that is \nsomething in which the Presiding Officer has a deep and abiding \ninterest, having spent so much of his life in the trial courts, and I \nspent a fair part of mine in the trial courts as well. In a sense, the \nSenate is something of a trial court as well. I hope we get the right \nverdict here.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from New York, my \nremarks are very brief and if he would not mind my going ahead, this is \nthe only opportunity I will have to make these remarks prior to the \nvote.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I never mind deferring to the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, especially when he is brief.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is a very good habit, and I hope the Senator from \nNew York will continue it.\n  Mr. President, I commend the former chairman of our committee, \nSenator Hatch, and Senator Specter for their observations about the \ndilemma in which we find ourselves. Senator Specter and Senator Hatch \nboth received a good deal of criticism from a number of Members on this \nside of the aisle for moving too many Democratic judges during the \nperiod when President Clinton was in the White House and the \nRepublicans were in the majority in the Senate. We should listen to \nthem when they engage in this debate.\n  Senator Specter, in particular, was very sympathetic to moving \nDemocratic nominees out of committee and has offered today to discuss a \nresolution he is going to submit that I think provides a solid \nbipartisan way to begin to resolve this dilemma in which we find \nourselves.\n  I say to Senator Leahy, the chairman of the committee, he has been \ntotally fair with us in Kentucky in dealing with our district judges. \nWe had three vacancies in the Eastern District, all of which have been \nfilled. So we certainly have no complaint on that score.\n  I do want to say something about the Sixth Circuit. The Sixth Circuit \nis made up of Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. It is currently \n50 percent vacant. It basically cannot function. It is not because \nPresident Bush has failed to act. He has nominated seven individuals \nfor those eight positions, and they have been nominated for quite some \ntime: John Rogers from my State was nominated 93 days ago; Henry Saad, \nSusan Neilsen, and David McKeague were nominated 134 days ago; Julia \nGibbons was nominated 164 days ago; and Jeffrey Sutton and Deborah Cook \nwere nominated an incredible 317 days ago with no hearings on any of \nthese nominees.\n  Finally, in terms of the Senate as an institution, we cannot function \nthis way. This is simply not acceptable. I think the voters have a \nright to expect us to do our work. If we are going to come anywhere \nclose to treating President Bush as President Clinton and President \nReagan were treated, we are going to have to start having hearings and \nvotes on nominees for these circuit court vacancies.\n  I know this is a difficult matter. I know it has become increasingly \npolitically charged in the years I have been in the Senate and that \nboth sides have contributed to it. If we are not going to stop that \nnow, then when? This is a good time to sit down in a bipartisan fashion \nand figure out how we can do what is in the best interest of the \ncountry because whether people on the other side like it or not, \nPresident Bush is there. He is going to be there for another 3 years \nfor sure. We need to deal with these vacancies at the circuit court \nlevel.\n  I am in strong support of the Lott resolution to ensure the fair \ntreatment of President Bush's judicial nominees.\n  As the resolution lays out, the situation with judicial vacancies has \ngotten remarkably worse since President Clinton left office. There were \n67 vacancies when President Clinton left office. This vacancy situation \nhas now jumped to 95 vacancies. Thus the percentage of vacancies has \nclimbed from 7.9 percent to 11 percent.\n  It is a sorry state indeed, when Federal judges are retiring at a \nfaster rate than we can replace them. This vacancy situation is \nparticularly acute on the circuit courts, where, as the resolution \nnotes, 31 of the 96 vacancies exist. This is an astounding 17.3 percent \nvacancy rates for the courts of appeals--almost one seat out of every \nfive being empty.\n  As the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee said, my own \ncircuit--the sixth--covering Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee, \nis the worse off of all the circuits. Fully one-half of the appellate \njudgeships on the sixth circuit are vacant. Think of that. Every other \nseat on the Federal circuit that hears appeals from my constituents is \nempty. That is alarming.\n  Now, my friend the chairman--and he is my friend--knows how warmly I \nfeel about him for his handling of the district court vacancies in my \nhome State.\n  But I must confess, I am at a loss, and am becoming increasingly \nexasperated, at the inability or outright refusal--at this point, I \ndon't know which--to confirm some judges to my home circuit.\n  Let me be clear. This is not the President's fault. He has nominated \nindividuals to fill seven of the eight seats on the sixth circuit. Yet \nnone--I repeat none--has even gotten so much as a hearing, even though \nall of the paperwork of these nominees is complete.\n  As I said, these individuals have been before the Senate for quite \nsome time:\n  John Rogers was nominated 93 days ago;\n  Henry Saad, Susan Neilson, and David McKeague were nominated 134 days \nago;\n  Julia Gibbons was nominated 164 days ago; and\n  Jeffrey Sutton and Deborah Cook were nominated an incredible 317 days \nago.\n\n[[Page S2206]]\n\n  Back home in Kentucky, if you don't do your job for 10 months, you \nare probably out looking for work. I think the American people ought to \nremember that come election time, when they are thinking about who \nshould run the Senate.\n  On behalf of my constituents, I urge the chairman to take at least \nsome action--some action--and try to get at least a few of these judges \nconfirmed before the end of the year.\n  To do that, we are going to have to pick up the pace considerably. We \nhear about how poorly President Clinton was treated--even though he got \nclose to 400 judges and finished in second place all time, only 5 \nbehind President Reagan.\n  But to equal the number of judges President Clinton got confirmed in \nhis first term, we're going to have to confirm 87 or so judges before \nthe end of the 107th Congress. And to reach that parity, we're going to \nhave to have hearings, markups, and votes on over four judges per week.\n  We can't just have a nomination hearing for a single circuit court \nnominee every other week. We can't have a confirmation hearing one \nweek--with maybe one circuit court nominee at best--and a markup the \nnext week. We need to get on a regular pace of having hearings, \nmarkups, and floor votes every week for a reasonable number of judges, \nincluding circuit judges.\n  In sum, because the vacancy situation is deteriorating by the day, I \nam compelled to urge the adoption of the Lott resolution.\n  I thank the Senator from New York for his indulgence in allowing me \nto go ahead of him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about judicial \nnominations and the pending amendment. Our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle made a lot of hay about our record of judicial nominations, \nbut the facts do not support the allegations.\n  First, under Chairman Leahy's leadership in the 9 months since the \nSenate's reorganization, and despite the disruptions caused by the \nattacks of September 11 and the anthrax in our offices, we have sent 42 \nnominees to be voted on. Yet our friends continue to argue we are not \nholding enough hearings. Forty-two nominees is a huge number.\n  I remember the hearing we had the day we were evacuated from the Hart \nBuilding and all of the office buildings. We had a hearing--that \nhappened to be the first one with Judge Pickering --in a cramped, \nlittle room in the Capitol. Senator Leahy came back once during recess \nto hold a hearing, I am told. This is clearly not the action of a group \ntrying to hold up judges.\n  In 1999 and 2000, by contrast, the Republican-controlled committee \nheld only seven hearings all year, and those were entire years, not the \nfew months we have had.\n  Second, our friends claim we are confirming too few judges. We have \nput 42 on the bench. That is more than were confirmed in the entire \nfirst year of the Clinton administration when the Democrats controlled \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  They argue we are stalling. But when one looks at comparable years, \nChairman Leahy's Judiciary Committee is well ahead of pace. So the \nclaims of stalling ring hollow when one looks at the facts.\n  Third, when we point to raw numbers, our colleagues change the \nargument and point to the percentage of seats that remain vacant. Well, \na problem cannot be created and then the complaint made that someone \nelse is not solving it fast enough. That is the height of unfairness. \nThat is the height of sophistry.\n  Our Republican friends controlled the Judiciary Committee during the \nlast 6 years of the Clinton administration, and during that time \nvacancies on the bench increased some 60 percent. All of a sudden we \nare concerned about vacancies. What happened in 1998 and 1999 and 2000? \nWe were not concerned with vacancies then--only now.\n  We are not going to play games and say what is good for the goose is \ngood for the gander. We are not suggesting two wrongs make a right by \nholding up judges the way it was done previously. Instead, we are going \nto decrease that, and we have gotten off to a good start.\n  Addressing the point my good friend from Kentucky made about the \nSixth Circuit, yes, there are many vacancies there, and that is because \nnominees who were put in by President Clinton, Helene White in \nparticular, were held up for very long periods of time.\n  Now, what is fair if you want to fill the vacancies? What is fair is \nnot for the President to just pick names and say, endorse these, but \nwhat is fair is for the President to sit down with all the Senators \nfrom the Sixth Circuit, not only the Senators from one party, and come \nto an agreement about who should be nominated. Maybe Helene White \nshould be nominated now, and then one of the President's selections. \nMaybe it should be people on whom both sides can agree.\n  So if there is real concern about filling the Sixth Circuit, I say to \nmy colleague from Kentucky--I wish he were still present--then consult \nall the Senators of that circuit and we can get judges done like that.\n\n  To say, after the other side held up judges whom President Clinton \nnominated, now we should just, without even aforethought, approve all \nthe judges President Bush nominates, when he does not consult with \nanyone from this party--and I say that as somebody who greatly respects \nthe President and gets along with him--does not make any sense at all. \nDo not make the argument about vacancies that you have created unless \nyou are prepared to make this a partnership to fill those vacancies.\n  That leads to my fourth point. Because so many Clinton nominees never \ngot hearings and never got voted on by the Republican-controlled \nSenate, the courts now more than ever hang in the balance. Some of the \nnominees have records that suggest extreme viewpoints. It is our \nobligation to examine the records closely before we act. The Senate is \nthe last stop before a lifetime appointment on the Federal bench, and \nso we cannot blindly confirm judges who are a threat of rolling back \nrights and protections through the courts not over the last 25 years \nbut over the last 70. Some of these judges want to go back to pre-New \nDeal: Reproductive freedoms, civil rights, the right to privacy, the \nright to organize, environmental protection, worker and consumer \nsafety.\n  In my State of New York, the administration has so far worked with us \nin good faith to select nominees who meet three requirements for \njudges, at least the three I have told them I care about: Excellence, \nmoderation, and diversity. Nominees who meet these criteria will win my \nswift support. For those nominees who raise a red flag, whose record \nsuggests a commitment to an extreme ideological agenda, we have to look \nat them closely.\n  These days, the Supreme Court is taking fewer than 100 cases a year. \nThat means these appellate court nominees particularly will have, for \nmost Americans, the last word on cases that are the most important \nmatters in their lives. We need to be sure the people to whom we give \nthis power for life are fair minded, moderate--I never like judges too \nfar left or too far right; they both become activists and try to change \nthe law way beyond what the legislature wants--and they have to be \nworthy of the privilege.\n  We have worked together with our Republican colleagues on several \nmatters since September 11, and by and large we have done well to keep \nthings bipartisan. Campaign finance reform yesterday was a huge hurdle \nfor us to clear. On election reform, I am optimistic we are very close \nto a bipartisan solution. The energy bill has a lot of amendments to \nwork through.\n  Again, in this body, whether you have 51 or 49, much cannot be \naccomplished unless we work in a bipartisan manner. On judicial \nnominees, why can we not do the same thing? Both sides ought to be \nworking together to correct imbalances in the court and keep the \njudiciary within the mainstream. We need nominees who are fair and open \nminded, not candidates who stick to an ideological agenda. The \nConstitution mandates this. It is not just the Senate consent; it is \nthe Senate gives advice and consent. As far as the advice part of that \nphrase goes, there has been very little advice sought of this \nbody. That is the reason we have such a deadlock.\n\n  I prefer judges who do not stick to an ideological agenda. I prefer \nour judges share views with mainstream America.\n\n[[Page S2207]]\n\n However, I have no problem in voting in favor of some very \nconservative nominees when there is some balance on the court; there is \nScalia on one side, maybe, and a Black or a Douglas on the other side. \nThat would make a great Supreme Court. The issues would be debated.\n  That is what President Clinton did, by and large. He nominated \nmoderates. We forget that. If you look at an unobjective scale and look \nat middle America, the nominees of President Bush are much further to \nthe right than President Clinton nominees to the left. Most of the \npeople he nominated were prosecutors, law firm members. It was not a \nphalanx of legal aide lawyers and people who would tend to be more \nliberal. Even the moderates toward the end of Clinton's terms did not \nget a hearing on the Fifth Circuit.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the good Senator for his presentation today, \nreviewing the historical background of the record of the committee, as \nthe Senator from Vermont, our chairman, Mr. Leahy has done--and he has \nbeen assaulted and attacked. Senator Schumer has also reviewed the \nunfairness of the treatment of individuals as a result of the \nRepublican activities.\n  I agree with the Senator from New York. We ought to understand what \nthe Constitution asks of us; that is, have shared power with the \nExecutive. We know this President has the primary responsibility, but \nit is a shared power. We ought to exercise it in a responsible way. I \nhope that will be the way in the future.\n  If there is any benefit that will come from this debate and \ndiscussion, perhaps it is that we will have a better understanding, as \nwill the American people, and we will move ahead in trying to get well-\nqualified people who deserve to be there.\n  I have a number of echoes that still ring in my mind about how people \nwere treated. Numbers do not always define how people were treated. I \nwas in the Senate when Ronnie White, who had been reported out of our \ncommittee, and on a Tuesday afternoon was going to be voted on at 2:15, \nthe Republican caucused on Ronnie White, and without any information to \nany of the members of the Judiciary Committee, came here, after \ndistorting and misrepresenting his position, and voted unanimously--\nevery single Republican--against him, without any notification, serious \ndistorting, and misrepresentation of his outstanding record as a judge.\n  Talk about fairness. This was after Senator Bond from Missouri had \nintroduced him to the Judiciary Committee recommending the Judiciary \nCommittee support him, and the Judiciary Committee did support him. But \nnot behind closed doors, with distortion and misrepresentation, in an \nattempt to humiliate him. Fairness goes there, too, does it not?\n\n  Also, I remember the case of Bill Lann Lee very clearly. There are \nmany Horatio Alger stories about the struggle of parents who have \nsacrificed in order to give the opportunity for education to their \nchildren. But they have a hard time mentioning the extraordinary \nsacrifice of the parents of Bill Lann Lee.\n  I remember the hearings on Bill Lann Lee. He had been an outstanding \ncivil rights leader. Individuals on the opposite side of his cases came \nin and testified about his fairness and how he committed to the \nJudiciary Committee that he was prepared to uphold the law. But not \naccording to the Judiciary Committee and to the majority of the \nJudiciary Committee. They refused to let him go ahead and get confirmed \nand let the President of the United States have his own person, his own \nman in this case, to be the head of the Civil Rights Division.\n  It is not just numbers; it is how people are treated. I would hope we \ncould get about the business in trying to find a way to work together. \nI was surprised--I don't know whether the Senator was surprised--to \nread in the newspaper, and I don't know if it is accurate, about how a \nprincipal Presidential adviser indicated they were prepared to take up \nwhat they consider a challenge by the Judiciary Committee and continue \nto nominate individuals who were going to be representative of a \nparticular philosophy.\n  If we are trying to talk about fairness, trying to talk about \nbalance, trying to talk about quality in the Federal judiciary, I don't \nknow if the Senator finds it perplexing we have representatives of the \nparty talking about fairness, and at the same time principal advisers \nof the President of the United States are evidently giving reassurances \nto, in this case the Washington Post, saying to individuals: Not to \nworry; the administration will continue to support very conservative \nnominees.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article from the Washington Post \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 20, 2002]\n\n        Rove to Group: Bush to Press for Conservative Judiciary\n\n                 (By Alan Cooperman and Amy Goldstein)\n\n       As the Senate Judiciary Committee was voting Thursday \n     evening to reject U.S. District Judge Charles W. Pickering \n     for an appellate court position, presidential adviser Karl \n     Rove was telling an influential Christian political action \n     group that President Bush would continue to nominate \n     conservatives as federal judges.\n       ``We're not going to have a pleasant day today [in the \n     Senate],'' Rove told the Family Research Council at the \n     Willard Hotel, according to a tape recording given to The \n     Washington Post by an attendee. ``. . . This is not about a \n     good man, Charles Pickering. This is about the future. This \n     is about the U.S. Supreme Court. And this is about sending \n     George W. Bush a message that `You send us somebody that is a \n     strong conservative, you're not going to get him.'\n       ``Guess what?'' Rove added. ``They sent the wrong message \n     to the wrong guy.''\n       In addition to sounding a defiant note on judicial \n     nominations, Rove's speech set out a broad agenda for \n     cooperation between the administration and the Christian \n     right.\n       ``There'll be some times you in this room and we over at \n     the White House will find ourselves in agreement, and \n     there'll be the occasion when we don't. But we will share a \n     heck of a lot more in common than we don't. And we'll win if \n     we work together far more often than the other side wants us \n     to,'' Rove told the group of about 250 Christian political \n     activists from around the country.\n       During the speech and subsequent question-and-answer \n     session, Rove promised that the white House would push \n     welfare reforms that encourage families and marriage.\n       He also said the administration would try to find ways to \n     support crisis pregnancy centers that counsel women against \n     abortion. And he predicted a battle in the Senate over \n     administration-backed proposals to ban human cloning. ``The \n     other side is winning the P.R. war'' to permit laboratory \n     cloning for medical research, he said.\n       Rove referred to the Senate's action on Pickering's \n     nomination as a ``judicial lynching'' and said the blocking \n     of such nominees ``needs to be the issue in every race around \n     the country for the United States Senate.''\n       Senator Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Judiciary \n     Committee, has denied that the panel is out to block Bush's \n     judicial selections, noting that it approved 42 nominees to \n     federal courts before it rejected Pickering.\n       Leahy also said the panel had conducted more hearings and \n     votes on federal judgeships since Democrats assumed a \n     majority in the Senate last year than the GOP-led Senate did \n     during the entire Clinton administration.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am interested in any reaction of the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for, as always, \nbeing right on target. The Senator makes two very good points that I \nshare.\n  No. 1, it seems we are supposed to remember history. The other side \nwould like us to forget about everything that happened in 1998, 1999, \nand 2000 and say: Forget all that; just go forward.\n  Unfortunately, we are left with the burden of going forward based on \nwhat happened in the past, based on the fact the bench was empty \nbecause there were certain people who did not meet certain criteria; \nbased on the fact, as the Senator from Massachusetts mentions, there \nwas not a process in certain instances--no fault of our good friend \nfrom Utah.\n  The case of Ronnie White was one of the more appalling cases I have \nwitnessed in my 22 years in the Congress, in the House and the Senate. \nIt seems there is a whole new standard. What is so ironic, the second \npoint the Senator from Massachusetts made, we could easily come to \nagreement if we work in a bipartisan way. Let's not fool anybody. We \nhave not been consulted. We have not been asked for advice. We have not \nbeen talked to about where judges should be. It is, instead: Here is \nthe group and you must rubberstamp them. That is not what the Founding \nFathers intended.\n\n[[Page S2208]]\n\n  Most Americans would agree the President and our colleagues from the \nother side would nominate judges to the right of the mainstream, and we \nmight like judges somewhat to the left of the mainstream. Doesn't it \nmake sense if we consulted we would come together in the middle? It \nseems to be the view of the other side, all of a sudden--not a \nconsistent view, not a view held for the last decade or two, but all of \na sudden--unless you find a judge who has engaged in some kind of \negregious conduct, you must approve them. I object to that and I thank \nthe Senator from Massachusetts for bringing this up.\n  It is perfectly fair to ask people about their judicial philosophy. \nThis is the third position of our government. It is as important as any \nof the others. We do not just rubberstamp people. The only time in our \nhistory when there has not been this kind of debate is when both sides \nwere intent on nominating moderate judges, such as in the Eisenhower \nadministration. But otherwise, in the late 1960s, early 1970s, there \nwere judges way to the left and people on the other side said bring it \nto the middle. That was fair. We are saying the same thing now.\n\n  I just ask my good friend from Massachusetts who has so much \nexperience, doesn't it seem logical that if we were consulted, we would \nnot get everything we wanted; if there was advice as well as consent, \nthat we would come up with moderate, mainstream judges--to the middle, \nthat we would move them quickly, that the process would be truly \nbipartisan, instead of the hard right talking to the far hard right and \ndeciding that is a compromise?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. We have seen examples \nwhere we have worked together. I can think of the area in which I have \nbeen most involved, working with the administration on education \nreform. We have seen other actions out here--the bioterrorism effort, \nand just recently working together in our committee--the Senator is a \nMember--on the whole reform of the immigration system. We have a strong \nbipartisan effort. We have lines of communication. We do not get \neverything we need, but that is the way it works.\n  I daresay our judiciary ought to be the No. 1 area where we are \nworking together because of the key aspect, the protection of the basic \nand fundamental liberties that are enshrined in the Constitution, \nultimately rests with the judiciary. That ought to be the prime example \nof working together. History has given us those examples.\n  What we find distressing is, now, the report of Mr. Rove to a group:\n\n       Bush to press for conservative judiciary.\n\n  It isn't we are going to be pressing for the best qualified members \nof the judiciary. It isn't going to be the ones who can serve the \npublic best. This is the kind of view that is evident within the \nadministration.\n  I regret that. I think the Senator has outlined, really, the way we \nshould proceed. I want to give him the assurance--I know the Senator \nfrom New York feels this way, and we see the Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from North Carolina, a member of the Judiciary Committee--we \nall want to try to get in the courts well-qualified individuals who \nhave a fundamental and core commitment to constitutional rights and \nliberties.\n  I thank the Senator and appreciate his comments.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  We really hope, on our side, we can work together. We do want to be \nbipartisan. I think every time the President has reached out his hand, \nwe have tried to move in the direction that brings us to the middle.\n  Somehow on judicial nominations it is different. I don't know why it \nis different. Maybe my good friend from Utah would recognize why it is \ndifferent. I don't know. But he must know that on the Judiciary it is.\n  I, for one, have no litmus test at all. As I mentioned, I am willing \nto see balance on the Court. That means some judges to the right and \nsome judges to the left and many in the middle; it is not all over to \none side.\n  President Bush told us he picked judges in the mold of Scalia and \nThomas. If you look at the nine members of the Supreme Court, those are \nthe two furthest to the right. One or two Scalias or Thomases, that is \none thing. A bench of nine of them, that is not what Americans wanted \nin the election of 2000. The electorate was moderate and voted towards \nthe middle. A bench filled with conservative judges is not what is in \nthe mainstream of this country. It is unacceptable.\n  I worry that the administration is willing to take casualties in this \nfight. They will send up waves of Scalias and Thomases. If one of them \ngets shot down, there will be another one. It is a small price to pay. \nThey still win and stack the courts. I, for one, don't believe that is \nthe way we should proceed.\n  Our country is divided ideologically. The mainstream is right in the \nmiddle, as it almost always is. There are periods when it is further to \nthe right or left--it is not right now. The Presidential election \nshowed that.\n  We had two presidential nominees, neither of whom was at the far end \nof their party--both probably in the middle of their parties--and the \nelection was as close as could be. The American people were not saying \ngive us people on the bench way over to the right--in the 10 percent \nmost conservative; they were saying move to the middle.\n\n  Again, there has been no consultation with us, no desire to meet us \npart of the way--as there is on education, and has to be on budget. \nRather, the Administration sends us wave after wave of people way over \nto the right.\n  It is not going to create harmony. It is not going to create comity. \nIt is not going to create a full bench. And it is not going to create a \nfair bench. It is going to give many of us no choice than to vote \n``no'' more often than we would like.\n  I was at the Supreme Court last week addressing the Judicial \nConference of the United States. I spoke to Justice Rehnquist. He was \nsitting next to me and to other Judges there. I stated my message, and \nI think it must be repeated.\n  Our courts are in danger of slipping out of balance. We are seeing \nconservative judicial activism erode Congress' power to enact laws that \nprotect the environment and women's rights and workers' rights, just to \nname a few. Like at almost no other time in our past, we are seeing a \nfinger on the scale that is subtly but surely altering this balance of \npower between Congress and the courts. It is not good for our \nGovernment, it is not good for the country, and it should stop.\n  Moderate nominees, who are among the best lawyers to the bar--the \nbest nominees the bar has to offer--are being confirmed rapidly. The \ncommittee has voted in favor of 42 of them in just 8 months. I can tell \nyou for me, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Courts, it is a heck of \na lot easier to rapidly confirm nominees when almost everyone agrees \nthat a nominee is legally excellent and ideologically moderate. When \nissues of diversity are properly accounted for, we move forward hand in \nhand together.\n  The debate in the Chamber doesn't do anything to solve the problem we \nall agree is facing our courts. I agree we have to do better. But doing \nbetter doesn't mean an administration that nominates without \nconsultation and thinks that our job should be just to rubberstamp \nthem, pass them through, or give them some kind of ethical check and \nnothing else. That is not how it is. That is not how it was. That is \nnot how it is going to be.\n  That leads to my final and fifth point. I think the rhetoric here \nsometimes gets out of hand. Each side has views that are firmly held. \nThat is why compromise in coming to the middle is important. But \nanytime that we on this side vote against a nominee the President has \nput forward, we are accused of playing politics, or even that we are \nnot voting for what we believe is right, but because some evil, \nmalicious groups out there are exerting too much pressure. Groups that \nsupport the nominees, the Christian Coalition, for instance, they are \ngreat. They are exercising their constitutional right. But a group like \nthe NAACP, that is against a nominee, is exerting too much pressure.\n  Come on, that is not where this debate ought to be.\n  How about this idea that we are holding up nominees because we have \nasked for unpublished opinions? For Judge Pickering, the vast majority \nof his\n\n[[Page S2209]]\n\nopinions, huge numbers, were unpublished.\n  Let's take it the other way. Let's say we would not have asked for \nhis opinions. Let's say we had not spent weeks reviewing them, as we \nshould do with a lifetime appointment to the court of appeals. Everyone \nin this Chamber knows what would have happened. We would have been \naccused of voting against the nominee without even reviewing his \nrecord.\n\n  To suggest there is something wrong with doing a thorough review of a \nnominee's record is to suggest that either we just rubberstamp \nconfirmations or simply make up our minds on the basis of politics and \nparty and not the record.\n  The irony is, of course, that some of my friends who are leveling \nthese complaints are the same folks who requested that Clinton nominees \nnot just go over their records, their judicial and legal records, but \nhow they voted as private citizens in statewide referenda. These are my \nsame colleagues who criticize us for saying ideology is relevant. I do \nnot get that.\n  They want us not to review all the opinions of a nominee, but when \nthe nominees were nominated before, they wanted even to know their \nprivate voting records.\n  Last summer, getting to my conclusion here, I called for us to be \nmore open and honest about how we handle judges. I said we should take \njudicial philosophy and ideology out from under the rug. I said we \nshould stop playing ``gotcha'' politics and start saying what we are \nreally thinking, so if one side is opposed to a judge but they don't \nwant to say they are opposed to his record, they don't go look and see \nwhat he did 30 years ago and look for some minor, certainly forgivable \ntransgression.\n  If ideology didn't matter, how come most of the votes on most of the \ncontroversial judges, where supposedly it was something somebody did 30 \nyears ago--sometimes it is all the Republicans who think that \ntransgression was terrible and that judge should be voted down, and the \nDemocrats think, oh, no, it is fine. Then the opposite occurs, and then \nthe Democrats say: Oh, that transgression is horrible.\n  If the votes were evenly scattered throughout our philosophical views \nand in our party, then fine. But they aren't. We know what is going on \nhere. We ought to do it out in the open.\n  I am proud to say that judicial philosophy and ideology will \ninfluence my vote. It is not a litmus test, but it certainly is part of \nnominating and considering a judge.\n  To do that, we have to investigate records and hold hearings where \ntough questions but fair questions are asked and where nominees have \nthe chance to tell their side of the story.\n  I chaired the first hearing on Judge Pickering. I was there for the \nsecond hearing. Every Senator had a chance to ask every question he or \nshe wanted. Judge Pickering was given every opportunity to answer those \nquestions. The process was fair, and the process worked.\n  I understand there is a lot of tension around here about that vote. I \nunderstand that some feelings were hurt. That doesn't make me happy. I \nwould like to be able to vote for every single judicial nominee who \ncomes before us. But we have an awesome responsibility here. We do the \nNation's work.\n  I couldn't be more proud to be a Member of this august body. I look \nat my friends, such as the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, \nand the senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, and the majority leader \nand minority leader. And I see the best the Nation has to offer--fine \nSenators, all of them. I see Senators who want to bring honor to this \ninstitution. As we go forward with these confirmation hearings, we need \nto do better ourselves to respect the traditions of this body.\n  It is my profound hope that we will continue to hold hearings, that \nwe will continue to be careful, that we will continue to fully review \nnominees' records, that we will continue being honest about why we are \nvoting the way we are voting, and also that we can dampen the rhetoric \nand respect the way each of us approaches these votes.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening to my colleague. It \nhas been very interesting to me. Of course, they brought up Ronnie \nWhite. Ronnie White was voted out of the committee. His nomination was \nat least brought to the floor where he had a vote. Both of his home-\nState Senators voted against him. Under those circumstances, it is \npretty hard to say that other Senators were acting improperly in \nsupporting the home-State Senators. I can tell you right now that when \ntwo Senators from any State fail to return a blue slip for a district \ncourt nominee, that is basically the end of that district court \nnominee. If they were split, that nominee might come to the floor. I do \nnot know if that is the position the current Judiciary Committee is \ntaking. But at least White had a vote.\n  Judge Pickering didn't even get that. I think the reason was that \nJudge Pickering would have been confirmed on the floor because he is a \nfine man. Everybody knows it.\n  To bring up Bill Lann Lee, who was not a lifetime appointment, seems \nto me goes a little bit far here. I like him. He is a good man. I would \nhave supported him for any other position. But he was a recess \nappointment. I predicted that one reason we couldn't support him was \nthat he said he was against race-based quotas. Yet his whole experience \nin California had been built upon bringing actions against \nmunicipalities and other bodies on behalf of the organization he \nrepresented. The municipality either had to spend millions of dollars \nin defending itself, even though they probably would have won in the \nend, or they would have to settle the case. And guess what? Race-based \nquotas would be imposed upon them.\n  So some of the defendants just settled the case to get rid of the \nextra expenses they did not want to go through. That is the way it is \ndone.\n  I predicted he would use the Civil Rights Division to do exactly \nthat. I think, of course, there was more than a better case that he \nwould do exactly what he did. That doesn't negate the fact that he is a \nterrific human being and somebody for whom I personally care. But we \nare talking about a volume of law.\n  Again, I come back to all the screaming and shouting about how badly \nClinton judges were treated. Reagan, the all-time champion with 382 \nconfirmed judges, had 6 years of a Republican Senate. Clinton had 5 \nfewer, 377 judges, and with 6 years of a Republican Senate, the \nopposition party.\n  Where is the argument? I have to say this: We never had 112 vacancies \nat the end of a session. We never had 95 vacancies at the end of the \nsession, which is where we are today--95 vacancies.\n  Let me go a little bit further. I truly do love the Senator from New \nYork. We all laughed in committee because he said he loved me and I \nsaid I loved him. He is a fine man, and he is a very good advocate. I \nrespect him. His argument is that we should go right to the middle and \nwe should just appoint moderates.\n  I have to tell you that if that had been the rule when President \nClinton was President, we wouldn't have many Clinton judges on the \nbench today. They weren't exactly moderates. Some were. Some in the \nBush administration--in fact, probably a majority will be moderate \nnominees.\n  To say that you can't have a liberal on the bench, or you can't have \na conservative on the bench, or someone in the mainstream just because \none side or the other doesn't want him or her, I think is wrong. \nAdmittedly, we have right-wing groups come in here and start demanding \nthat I stop all these judges. I told them to get lost. I would like to \nsee the Democrat side tell those liberal, left-wing groups to get \nlost--not that they cannot speak out in this country; of course, they \ncan. But when they start character assassinations as they did with \nJudge Pickering, I think they ought to be told to get lost. Whenever \nconservative groups did it, I told them to get lost.\n\n  The Senator from New York said the White House has not consulted with \nDemocrats about judicial nominees. But I can count on the fingers of \none hand the number of circuit court nominees of President Bush who do \nnot have blue slips supporting their nominee. This goes for numerous \nStates with Democrat and Republican Senators alike. Of course, Judge \nPickering had\n\n[[Page S2210]]\n\nthe support of his home-State Senators. There were no blue slips \nwithheld in that case. Both Senators wanted Judge Pickering. I think a \nmajority of the Senate wanted Judge Pickering.\n  I am not sure what kind of White House consultation my colleagues \nhave in mind. Surely they are not talking about veto power over all of \nPresident Bush's nominees regardless of whether they are from their own \nState. This would fly in the face of the committee blue slip process \nand precedents we have always had. But that seems to be what they are \nasking for.\n  If the White House doesn't come up and consult with Senators who are \nnot from the State that the nominees are coming from--are they are \nusing that as an excuse? The White House does have an obligation to \nconsult. I have told them they have to consult, and I expect them to. I \nknow Judge Gonzales and his team consult with Senators who have people \nfrom their States.\n  Are we going to go as far as Abner Mikva went? The former \ndistinguished judge on the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia recently wrote an article stating that he thought President \nBush should not nominate anyone to the Supreme Court because he really \ndoesn't have a mandate; he is not really the President of the United \nStates. That is like saying the Defense Department shouldn't really \noperate; that we should leave it to up to the Senate Committee on Armed \nServices to solve these problems. That is how ridiculous these \narguments get.\n  The fact of the matter is that liberal Presidents generally appoint \nmore liberal judges; conservative Presidents generally appoint more \nconservative judges.\n  I don't think you can categorize George Bush's judicial nominees as \npurely conservative. They have been in the middle of the mainstream. \nThat doesn't mean because some are conservative that they are outside \nof the mainstream. The mainstream includes from the left to the right--\nreasonable people who want to do what is right, who literally are \nwilling to abide by the law, and who deserve these positions.\n  The Republicans didn't take the position that we just have moderates \nin the Federal judiciary when President Clinton was President. Frankly, \nif we had taken that position, we would have been excoriated like you \ncouldn't believe here in the Chamber, or, in fact, anywhere.\n  The fact of the matter is that all we are asking is fairness. We have \n95 vacancies. Last May 9, we had 31 Federal Circuit Court of Appeals \nvacancies.\n  Today, we have 31 Federal circuit courts of appeals vacancies--a year \nlater. And we have 8 of the original 11 nominees still sitting in \ncommittee without a hearing, some of the finest nominees I have ever \nseen, none of whom would be categorized as far right, in my opinion, \nall of whom are in the mainstream, and all of whom have been approved \nby the ABA either with a ``qualified'' or a ``well qualified'' rating, \nand some of the most important nominees in history.\n  I am also compelled to respond to a severe mischaracterization that \nsome of my Democratic colleagues have perpetrated about judges. They \nhave repeated that they noticed their first confirmation hearing within \nminutes of reaching a reorganization resolution in July. While \ntechnically true, this declaration leaves out an important fact:\n  The Democrats took charge of the Senate on June 5 of last year, but \nfailed to hold any confirmation hearings during the entire month of \nJune.\n  There is simply no basis for asserting that the lack of an \norganizational resolution prevented the Judiciary Committee from \nholding confirmation hearings in June, which is precisely what my \ncolleagues have implied.\n  The lack of an organizational resolution did not stop other Senate \ncommittees from holding confirmation hearings in June. In fact, by my \ncount, 9 different Senate committees under Democratic control held 16 \nconfirmation hearings for 44 nominees during the month of June. One of \nthese committees--Veterans' Affairs--even held a markup on a pending \nnomination.\n  But in the same period of time, the Judiciary Committee did not hold \na single confirmation hearing for any judicial and executive branch \nnominees pending before us--despite the fact that some of those \nnominees had been waiting nearly 2 months.\n  What's more, the lack of an organizational resolution did not prevent \nthe Judiciary Committee from holding five hearings in 3 weeks on a \nvariety of other issues besides pending nominations. Between June 6 and \nJune 27, the committee held hearings on the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, charitable choice, and death penalty cases. There were \nalso subcommittee hearings on capital punishment and on injecting \npolitical ideology into the committee's process of reviewing judicial \nnominations.\n  Although several members were not technically on the committee until \nthe Senate reorganization was completed, there was no reason why \nSenators who were slated to become official members of the committee \nupon reorganization could not have been permitted to participate in any \nnomination hearings. This was successfully accomplished in the case of \nthe confirmation hearing of Attorney General Ashcroft, which was held \nwhen the Senate was similarly situated in January.\n  Instead, we lost the chance to move nominees in June, not because of \nnominations over reorganization, but because of the failure of the \nDemocratic leadership to schedule hearings.\n  So, I would hope we can get to confirming judges, rather than \noffering excuses for why they are not--and having 31 vacancies on the \ncircuits.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes to address \nsome of the comments that my democratic colleagues have made about \nJudge Pickering's nomination.\n  It is no secret that two very different pictures of Judge Pickering \nemerged from his confirmation battle. One picture was that of a man who \ntook courageous stands against racism at times when doing so was not \nmerely unpopular, but also when it put him and his family at great \npersonal risk. This man endured political and professional sacrifice to \nstand up for what he believed was right. And, in his more than a decade \non the federal bench, this man demonstrated an ability and willingness \nto follow the law even when he personally disagrees with it. This is \nthe picture of Charles Pickering that I know and the picture I am \nconvinced is accurate.\n  The other picture of Charles Pickering that emerged was far less \nflattering. But I am just as convinced that this picture was \ngroundless. It was the product of engineering by extreme left \nWashington special interest groups who are out of touch with the main \nstream and have a political axe to grind. Make no mistake about it--\nthese groups have their own political agenda, which is to paint \nPresident Bush's nominees as extremists and block them from the federal \nbench. These are the same groups who came out against General Ashcroft, \nJustice Rehnquist and even Justice David Souter, when he was nominated \nto the Supreme Court. They were all then, as they are now singing the \nparade of horribles.\n  The groups are committed to changing the ground rules for the \nconfirmation process. There is a new war over circuit nominees, and \nthey demand that the Democrats do whatever possible to stop or slow the \nconfirmation of these fine nominees. For them, the means justify the \nends at whatever the cost--including the gross distortion of a man's \nrecord and character.\n  The overwhelming bipartisan support we received for Judge Pickering's \nnomination from his home state of Mississippi speaks volumes about him. \nIt is very telling that those who know Judge Pickering best, including \nprominent members of the African-American community in Mississippi, \ncame out in droves to urge his confirmation. In contrast, those who \nmost vociferously opposed his confirmation do not know him, but rather \nspent the past 7 months combing through his record for reasons to \noppose him. They developed chain letters, mass faxes, and Washington \nposition papers. Why? In the words of the leader of one liberal \ninterest group, ``We think he (Judge Pickering) is an ideologue.''\n  It doesn't matter to these groups that Judge Pickering had the \nqualifications, the capacity, the integrity, and the temperament to \nserve on the federal circuit court bench. He is a judge that would have \nfollowed the law and left the politics to the people on the circuit \ncourt, just as he has on the district court. But I know that is not\n\n[[Page S2211]]\n\nwhat the groups want. They want activists on the bench that support \ntheir political views regardless of the law. That is wrong. What \nmatters to them is that Judge Pickering did not meet their litmus test \nof supporting the right causes, regardless of his demonstrated \ncommitment to following the law.\n  Although I am deeply troubled by the smear campaign that was waged \nagainst Judge Pickering, I am convinced that the accurate picture of \nJudge Pickering was the one of a man who was committed to upholding the \nlaw and who would have been a sterling addition to the Fifth Circuit. I \nregret that the inaccurate and unfair portrait painted by people whose \npurpose is to obscure the truth rather than to reveal it persuaded my \nDemocratic colleagues to oppose his nomination.\n  Of course, the defeat of Judge Pickering's nomination is significant \nfor other reasons as well. He represents the first judicial nominee \ndefeated in committee in over a decade--in fact, since the Democrats \nlast controlled the committee.\n  When the Republicans were in charge of the Judiciary Committee during \n6 years of the Clinton administration, we did not defeat a single \nnominee in committee. In fact, the only Clinton nominee who was \ndefeated--and who, incidentally, lacked the support of his home state \nsenators--was nevertheless granted a floor vote.\n  I find it ironic that a number of my Democratic colleagues actively \nlobbied to get floor votes for Clinton nominees, yet they now have \ndenied a floor vote for Judge Pickering, who has the support of both of \nhis home state Senators and who would very likely be confirmed if his \nnomination received a floor vote.\n  And let me talk about Judge Pickering's record. We have talked about \nideology. The key here is that a nominee's personal or political \nopinion on social issues is irrelevant when it comes to the \nconfirmation process. The real question is whether the nominee can \nfollow the law.\n  Last Thursday, we demonstrated that Judge Pickering has shown in his \nnearly 12 years on the federal district court bench his ability and \nwillingness to follow the law.\n  He has handled an estimated 4,000 to 4,500 cases, but he has been \nreversed only 26 times. This is a reversal rate of less than 1 percent. \nHis reversal rate is better than the average for district court judges \nboth nationwide and in the Fifth Circuit. This is a record to be proud \nof--not a reason to vote against him.\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues have complained that Judge Pickering \nwas reversed on well-settled principles of law in 15 cases where he was \nreversed by the Fifth Circuit in unpublished opinions. This argument is \nnonsense. Circuit courts reserve publication for the most significant \nopinions. Reversal by unpublished opinion means that the district judge \nmade a run-of-the-mill mistake. In other words, nobody's perfect--not \neven federal judges. They do get reversed on occasion. The bottom line \nis that there is simply nothing remarkable about Judge Pickering's 26 \nreversals.\n  I suspect that many of my colleagues' misperceptions about Judge \nPickering's record as a district judge stem from the gross distortion \nof that record by the liberal special interest groups. For example, one \noften-cited area of concern is Judge Pickering's record on Voting \nRights Act cases. But the bottom line here is that Judge Pickering has \ndecided a total of four such cases. The only one that was appealed \ninvolved issues pertaining solely to attorney's fees. None of the other \nthree cases--Fairley, Bryant, and Morgan--was appealed, a step that one \ncan reasonably expect a party to take if it is dissatisfied with the \ncourt's ruling. Moreover, the plaintiffs in the Fairley case--including \nKen Fairley, former head of the Forrest County NAACP--have written a \nletter to the committee in support of Judge Pickering's nomination.\n\n  Another case my colleagues have complained about is the Swan case. \nBut there, Judge Pickering was rightly concerned that Swan's co-\ndefendants--one of whom had a history of racial animus and had fired a \ngun into the victims' home--got off with a relative slap on the wrist \nwhile Swan faced seven years' incarceration. As one legal ethics expert \nnoted, ``Judge Pickering was clearly concerned that no rational basis \nhad been demonstrated for the widely disparate sentencing \nrecommendations in Swan. Without such a basis, justice does not appear \nto be unbiased and non-prejudiced.''\n  Judge Pickering's qualifications are also reflected in his ABA \nrating, which some Members of the Committee have referred to as the \ngold standard in evaluating judicial nominees. The ABA, of course, \nrated Judge Pickering well qualified for the Fifth Circuit.\n  I also find it ironic that many of the complaints that Judge \nPickering's opponents have lodged against him pertain to events that \noccurred before he became a federal district court judge--a position \nfor which he was unanimously confirmed by both this committee and the \nfull Senate.\n  In any event, I fear that the smear campaign we saw waged against \nJudge Pickering was only a warm-up battle for the ideological war the \nliberal interest groups are prepared to wage against any Supreme Court \nnominee that President Bush has the opportunity to appoint.\n  I stood up to conservative special interest groups who tried to \ninfluence the committee while I was chairman, and I will continue to \nstand up to liberal special interest groups who seek to defeat \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees now. I urge my Democratic colleagues \nto join me in this effort.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee for yielding some time to me. I think the \npoints he makes are well taken.\n  I would like to get back to the basic resolution that is before us. \nIt is a very simple resolution that says that we should at least have \nhearings in the Judiciary Committee on the nominees for the circuit \ncourts that have been pending the longest, since May 9 of last year, \nthat we should at least have a hearing on those nominees before the 1-\nyear anniversary of their nomination.\n  That is eminently reasonable. I suspect that all 100 of us will vote \nfor that sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  That is going to, then, require us to do some things to ensure that \nthose hearings, in fact, can be held. I can think of no reason why \nanyone would oppose the scheduling of hearings on these eight \ndistinguished nominees a year after their nomination.\n  But I think the comments, primarily of the Senator from New York, \nhave really put into perspective what this debate is all about. He has \nmade three basic points, all of which are departures from past \nprecedent. The reason this is important is because it provides the \nreasons why many Members on the other side of the aisle have supported \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee in not holding hearings, in not \nvoting on nominees, and in not allowing the full Senate, as a result, \nto vote on nominees to the circuit courts of appeals.\n  One cannot argue about the qualifications of these nominees.\n  So there have been three reasons posited by the Senator from New York \nas to why it is fair not to hold hearings and not to have votes on \nthese nominees of the President for the circuit courts.\n  The first reason is, as Senator Hatch pointed out, totally \nunprecedented. It is the notion that somehow or other the President has \nto consult with all of the Senators from the circuit before nominating \nsomeone to that circuit court of appeals.\n  It has been traditional for the President to consult with the \nSenators from the State from which the nominee comes but not all of the \nother States. There are 13 States in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nwhere Arizona is. I was never consulted by President Clinton on any of \nthe nominees from California or Oregon or Washington or Nevada. And I \nwould not have felt the right to be consulted.\n  The only one I asked to be consulted on was the nominee from Arizona. \nPresident Clinton did consult with me on that individual, and we \nreached an agreement on a nominee he nominated. I supported that \nperson, a Democrat, appointed by President Clinton, whom I think is one \nof the finest members of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. But I \nwould have been shocked if he called\n\n[[Page S2212]]\n\nme and said: Jon, what do you think about this candidate from \nWashington State? That has never been the case.\n  So for one of the Senators from New York to stand here and say that \nwe are not going to move forward on these nominees until the President \nbegins consulting with all of the Senators from the circuit is wrong. \nIt is an abuse of power. It is not the way it has been done in the \npast, and it should not provide an excuse for us to withhold action on \nthese nominees.\n  Second, the Senator from New York has suggested that this is really \nabout politics, that the President's nominees are too ideologically \nconservative. The Senator from New York said President Clinton \nnominated all moderates. Well, that will be news to some of my \nconservative friends who did not view all of President Clinton's \nnominees as all that moderate. Some were; some were not. I supported \nsome; I did not support others.\n\n  I guess I will not read the names here, but I look at the Ninth \nCircuit nominees and all of the ones who were confirmed since I have \nbeen in the Senate--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13--13 \ncircuit court judges confirmed. Some of those were liberals. And I \nsupported some of those liberals, others I did not. That is all right. \nPresident Clinton got elected President; I did not.\n  Well, President Bush got elected President. And I don't think the \ndefinition of ``mainstream'' by the Senator from New York is a better \ndefinition than the definition of the President of the United States, \nGeorge Bush, in terms of the qualifications of judges to represent this \ncountry.\n  I know my view of the political spectrum and that of the Senator from \nNew York are very different. What he would call moderate I would \nprobably call something else, and vice versa. So we are on a slippery \nslope if Senators begin to define the terms of a President's nominees \nwith respect to their politics on an ideological spectrum and maintain \nthat they have the right to withhold action on those nominees if they \ndo not fall within what a particular Senator characterizes as \n``mainstream.''\n  The Senator from New York said many of President Bush's nominees \n``suggest extreme ideological agendas.'' All right, here is my \nchallenge to that Senator or any other Senator:\n  What is it about John G. Roberts of Maryland, who was nominated on \nMay 9, 2001, by President Bush, to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, \nthat suggests an extreme ideological agenda?\n  What is it about Miguel A. Estrada of Virginia, who was nominated on \nMay 9, 2001, by President Bush, to serve on the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals, that suggests an extreme ideological agenda?\n  What is it about Michael W. McConnell of Utah, who was nominated to \nthe Tenth Circuit on May 9, 2001, by President Bush that suggests an \nextreme ideological agenda?\n  What is it about Jeffrey S. Sutton of Ohio, who was nominated to the \nSixth Circuit on May 9, 2001, by President Bush that suggests an \nextreme ideological agenda?\n  What is it about Deborah Cook of Ohio, nominated to the Sixth Circuit \non May 9, 2001, by President Bush that suggests an extreme ideological \nagenda?\n  Or what is it about Priscilla Richman Owen of Texas, nominated to the \nFifth Circuit on May 9, 2001, or Dennis Shedd of South Carolina or \nTerrence Boyle of North Carolina--both nominated to the Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals on May 9, 2001--that suggests an extreme ideological \nagenda such that they are so disqualified that we should not even hold \na hearing on their nominations?\n  There is an element of comity that this body owes to the President of \nthe United States when he nominates people to the circuit courts of \nappeals to represent the people of this country. Comity at least \nrequires that we have a hearing on these nominees within a decent \nperiod of time. Certainly, no one can argue that letting them sit for \nover a year is not plenty long enough to analyze everything there is to \nanalyze about them, and then to begin the process for their \nconfirmation.\n  So I suggest that when the Senator from New York or my other \ncolleagues on the other side say that a nominee has to pass an \nideological test in their eyes or they are not even going to give them \na hearing, it is time for the people of this country, and it is time \nfor the news media of this country to rise up and say: That is wrong, \nand you cannot fulfill your responsibilities of providing advice and \nconsent under the Constitution to the President if you are not willing \nto even consider the nominees of the President by holding a hearing a \nyear after they have been nominated.\n  I think when those on the other side say this isn't about \nretribution, and then immediately begin citing all of the statistics \nabout how they believe some of President Clinton's nominees were \ntreated unfairly, it is about retribution. In effect, they have made it \nabout retribution and politics. You have to either be a moderate in \ntheir eyes or they have to finally feel good about getting even to such \nan extent that somehow or other the scales are balanced now, they have \ngotten their pound of flesh, they have withheld action on a sufficient \nnumber of nominees that now they are willing to move forward.\n  I can't ascribe that motive to any of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle. It would be so outrageous to contemplate. But that \nappears to at least have crept into the rhetoric of some when their \nprimary point about not holding hearings on President Bush's nominees \nis that they think some of Clinton's nominees were treated unfairly.\n  Just how many circuit court nominees of President Clinton were \ntreated unfairly in this manner? How many do we have to withhold from \nPresident Bush before the scales are balanced? And in any event, are \nany of them willing to stand up and say that is a justification for not \neven holding a hearing on President Bush's nominees? If so, I would \nlike for them to come forward and do that.\n  Let me conclude by making this point as clearly as I can: We will \nhave before us this afternoon a resolution that simply says we should \nhold a hearing in the Judiciary Committee on the eight circuit court \nnominees of President Bush by May 9, 2002, before the 1-year \nanniversary of their nomination. In other words, wait a year and then \nat least have a hearing on these eight nominees. Is that too much to \nask? I hope my colleagues will recognize that some of them have gone \ntoo far in attacking the President's nominees on ideological grounds \nand attacking his nominees on the basis that President Clinton was \ntreated unfairly and, as a result, there is a justification for \ntreating President Bush's nominees unfairly as well.\n  I hope that is not the basis for inaction, and I hope the circuit \ncourt nominees will be treated just as fairly as the district court \nnominees have been treated and that we can get a hearing on them and \nthen eventually bring them to the floor for a vote.\n  The American people deserve no less. President Bush deserves no less. \nAnd frankly, justice in the United States requires that much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for his \ncomments. I echo those remarks, particularly in regard to the litmus \ntest our colleague from New York was talking about. That is not the way \nwe have confirmed judges in the last 20 years I have been here. I hope \nwe are not going to come up with ideological litmus tests. If that is \nthe case, we are changing the entire confirmation process.\n  I hope my colleagues will step back and think: We may have a change \nin leadership in the Senate. Are we going to change the policies of \nconfirmation of judges as dramatically as proposed by the Senator from \nNew York? I hope not. It would be a serious mistake.\n  We need to change and improve the way we handle judicial nominations, \nparticularly circuit court nominations. I compliment Senator Leahy, who \nhas moved through several district court nominations. President Bush \nhas nominated 62 for the district court. We have confirmed 35. That is \n56 percent of President Bush's district court nominations. We have been \nmoving through on those fairly quickly. I extend my compliments. We \nhave made good progress.\n  The real problem has been on circuit court nominations. For whatever \nreason, the Senate has not worked there. The Judiciary Committee has \nnot worked. We have confirmed 7 out of 29.\n\n[[Page S2213]]\n\n Unfortunately, Judge Pickering was defeated last week. So we have now \ndealt with 8 out of 29. Twenty-four percent of President Bush's circuit \ncourt nominees have been confirmed. That means three-fourths have not \nbeen confirmed. In fact, most of those individuals have not even had a \nhearing.\n  Eight individuals who were nominated in May of last year have not \neven had a hearing. They are outstanding individuals, as you may see \nwhile I talk about some of their qualifications. My point is, we should \ntreat judges fairly, whether Democrats are in control of the Senate or \nRepublicans are in control and whether a Democrat or Republican is in \nthe White House.\n\n  I looked back at the last three Presidents. On circuit court \nnominees, Ronald Reagan had 95 percent of his circuit court nominees \nconfirmed in his first 2 years, 19 out of 20. President Bush had 22 out \nof 23 confirmed; again, 95 percent. President Clinton, 19 out of 22 \ncircuit court nominees were confirmed in his first 2 years. But yet \nPresident Bush to date only has 7 out of 29. A majority of the \nremaining, 20 in fact, have not even had a hearing. That is not right. \nMany of those individuals were nominated almost a year ago. There is no \ngood reason they have not had a hearing.\n  We need to move forward. Some of these individuals are as well-\nqualified as anybody you will find anywhere in the country. To think \nthey were nominated in May of last year and haven't even scheduled a \nhearing makes you wonder what is going on. It is not like we haven't \ntried. I know every Republican Senator has written a letter to Senator \nDaschle and Senator Leahy saying: We want hearings on some of these \nindividuals. But we haven't been successful. I think we need to treat \nthese nominees fairly, regardless of who is in power, Democrats or \nRepublicans, regardless of who is in the White House. I am embarrassed \nfor the Senate when we have something such as this, only 7 out of 29, \nand 20 of 29 haven't even had a hearing. That is not right.\n  You have individuals such as John Roberts who is nominated for the \ncircuit court of appeals for the District of Columbia. He graduated \nfrom Harvard College, summa cum laude, in 1976; received his law degree \nmagna cum laude in 1979 from Harvard Law School. He is managing editor \nof the Harvard Law Review. He has presented arguments before the U.S. \nSupreme Court 35 times. An individual in the private sector has argued \nbefore the Supreme Court 35 times. He is nominated to be on the \ndistrict court for the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. I think he is \nentitled to a hearing. He is a well-qualified attorney. We have \nDemocrats and Republicans alike testifying he would be an outstanding \ncircuit court judge.\n  Miguel Estrada, also nominated to be on the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals. He is a partner in the DC law office of Gibson, Dunn. He has \nargued 15 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. It just so happens he \nhas a very interesting personal history. He emigrated from Honduras. He \ngot his JD degree magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, and he is \nalso editor of the Harvard Law Review. He has a bachelor's degree magna \ncum laude, Phi Beta Kappa from Columbia College in New York.\n  These two individuals, two of the most accomplished nominees anywhere \nin the country, have yet to have a hearing. Yet they were nominated in \nMay.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee has told me on a couple of \noccasions we will have a hearing for Miguel Estrada. We are still \nwaiting. I think we have waited long enough.\n  I could go through each of these individuals. Terrence Boyle, I \nremember him when he worked in the Senate. He presently is chief judge \nof the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. \nHe has achieved an outstanding record in that. I had hoped we would \nhave a hearing for Judge Boyle.\n  Michael McConnell, nominated for the U.S. District Court of Appeals \nfor the Tenth Circuit, he happens to be a presidential professor at the \nUniversity of Utah College of Law and is supported by my friend and \ncolleague, former chairman of the Judiciary Committee. This fact alone \nsays he ought to have a hearing.\n\n  What happened to the tradition in the Senate where we respect \nindividual Senators, members of the committee and members of \nleadership? I am still aghast at what happened last week. I cannot \nimagine what we did last week. Never before in my tenure in the Senate \nwould we defeat a Republican leader's nominee. We wouldn't defeat a \nDemocratic leader's nominee. It is just not done. We wouldn't defeat \nthe nominee of the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee or even \nhold them up because of tradition, the fact that we want to work \ntogether.\n  I haven't seen the respect in this institution, and that disappoints \nme. We have to have respect for individual Members. We haven't shown \nthat respect, certainly when it comes to circuit court nominees.\n  I could go on. There are eight outstanding individuals. President \nBush is to be complimented on nominating several superb individuals. \nThese people are well accomplished leaders in the legal profession. \nThey deserve a hearing.\n  One is Priscilla Owen, nominated for the Fifth Circuit. She has \nworked in Texas. She got her B.A. cum laude from Baylor University and \ngraduated cum laude from Baylor Law School in 1977. I could go on and \non.\n  Mr. President, these individuals, men and women, minorities, are \nentitled to have a hearing. There are two resolutions that we have--The \nRepublican resolution says they shall have a hearing by May--in other \nwords, within a year of being nominated. The Democrat resolution says \nthey will be handled expeditiously. I urge my colleagues to support \nboth of them, and I hope they will be handled expeditiously and I hope \nall will have hearings by May.\n  Let's treat these outstanding individuals like the Presidential \nnominees they are, with the respect of the office of the President in \nmaking these nominations. These individuals I have alluded to are to \nthe circuit court. Some people have acted like this is district court \nin my State and the tradition of the Senate is I have a veto over \nanybody in the circuit court. That is not the tradition of the Senate. \nIt is that individual Senators have a great deal of influence and \nadvice and consent for nominations in their own State for district \ncourt, but not circuit court. Circuit court applies to many States.\n  I am embarrassed for the Senate for the fact that we have 8 vacancies \non the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals--8 out of 16. Half of the court \nis vacant because 1 or 2 Senators are not happy about something that \nhappened maybe years ago, so we are going to penalize all the States \nthat are involved in the Sixth Circuit. That is wrong. We are holding \nup 7 nominees right now, who have yet to have a hearing, who have been \nnominated by President Bush to fill vacancies in the Sixth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n\n  That is wrong. It is wrong for the President and wrong for the system \nof justice. So it needs to be remedied. I urge my colleagues, before \npeople start--the press has been asking me what kind of retribution \nthere is going to be. I don't want that ``that is the way you treated \nour judge, so we are going to treat your judge that way.'' I don't want \nto play that game. I want to treat nominees with respect and do it \nwhether we are in the majority in the Senate or in the minority, or \nwhether the President is in my party or not. I want to treat these \nnominees with respect and give them the courtesy of a hearing, without \nundue delay, and maintain the tradition of the Senate, where each \nPresident has been getting 90-some percent of their nominees.\n  Granted, I understand the statistics game. Well, in President \nClinton's last year, he didn't get very many. The tradition of the \nSenate is that nominees are not usually considered in great numbers in \nthe last year of their term. Then if they are reelected, they get more. \nBut for President Clinton, we confirmed 377 of his judges, second only \nto Ronald Reagan, for whom we confirmed 382 judges. So both of them got \na lot of judges confirmed. Those are lifetime appointments. That is \npretty good. President Clinton got 129 in his first 2 years and almost \n250 in his last several years.\n  Now, both had a lot of judges confirmed. If you look at Bill Clinton, \nhe got 90 percent of his judges in the first 2 years, including 2 \nSupreme Court nominees. President Bush 1 got 93 percent of his \nconfirmed in his first 2\n\n[[Page S2214]]\n\nyears, and Ronald Reagan got 98 percent of his judges confirmed in the \nfirst 2 years.\n  The tradition of the Senate is that we do confirm circuit and \ndistrict judges pretty rapidly in a President's first 2 or 3 years--\nmaybe not quite so fast in the fourth year. Fair enough. This President \nhasn't been treated fairly, in my opinion, when it comes to circuit \ncourt nominees. I urge colleagues, instead of playing retribution and \nlooking back at President Clinton's last year, let's do this right and \ntreat everybody with respect--individual Senators as well as the \nnominees. I think if we do so, the Senate will be elevated. I think the \ntreatment of some of these judges, including Judge Pickering, the \nSenate was not elevated; I think it was demeaning to the Senate. And \nthe way we have treated these 20 circuit court nominees has been \ndemeaning to the Senate. I hate to see that happen to a person who \nserved in this institution and loves it.\n  One of the most important things we can do in the Senate is the \nconfirmation of lifetime appointments to the Federal bench. We need to \ndo it right and this year, at least on the circuit court nominees, we \nhave not been doing it right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. About 2 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have two others who need to speak also. Can the Senator \ndo with 3 minutes?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I certainly can.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is not as if I would not have a lot \nto say about this subject, having observed it closely for a number of \nyears. Let me say one thing about the complaint --and this is very \nimportant--that President Clinton's nominees were not fairly treated: \nPresident Clinton had 377 judges confirmed. He had one judge voted down \nby the Senate--only one judge voted down. When he left office, there \nwere 41 judges not yet confirmed who had been nominated. There were 41 \nleft pending.\n  When former President Bush left office in 1991, he had 54 judges \npending and not confirmed. There were 54 when he left office. When \nPresident Clinton left office, he had only 41, and only one of his \nnominees had been voted down by this Senate. The reason he was treated \nfairly is because the chairman of the Judiciary Committee at that time, \nOrrin Hatch, treated his nominees fairly. He moved those nominees \nforward. I voted for 95-plus percent of them. There were many liberals \nin that group. Very few of the nominees were held up.\n  There is a tradition here--the blue slip policy--that if a home State \nSenator objects to a nominee, they can hold him up. That is respected. \nThe Democrats now come in and say this is a bad policy and they want to \nfix it. No, they want to give even more power. They are proposing \nregulations that would give a historic increase in the power of one \nSenator to block nominees.\n  We have a situation in which we are now in a crisis. There are 100 \nvacancies in the Federal court. Seventeen of the Federal circuit court \nvacancies have been declared judicial emergencies by the Administrative \nOffice of the Courts. Fifty percent of the seats on the Sixth Circuit, \n8 out of 16, are vacant. Of the seven nominees, none have had a \nhearing.\n  In January of 1998, when there were 82 Federal vacancies, the now \nchairman of the committee, Senator Leahy, stated:\n  Any week in which the Senate does not confirm three judges, the \nSenate is failing to address the vacancy crisis. There were 82; there \nare 100 now. Since January of 2000, President Bush has only had 7 of 29 \ncircuit court nominations he submitted confirmed. One of those \nconfirmed was in the first batch he sent up, and an excellent group \nthey were. There was a nomination of President Clinton that had not \nbeen confirmed, an African American.\n  President Bush resubmitted his name in a historic effort to reach \nbipartisanship here in the Senate. He has been a fair President. He \nsubmitted judges of utmost quality. If we need to improve the process, \nwe need to look no further than asking how Senator Hatch conducted the \ncommittee when he was chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is up.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time remains with the majority on \nthis amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 30 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. And how much time remains for the minority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask my friend from Utah, are there \nspeakers on his side who wish to be heard?\n  Mr. HATCH. I know Senator Hutchison wishes to speak, and I also \nbelieve Senator Brownback.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator know how much time they wish?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I may have up to 5 minutes or 3 \nminutes, if that is more helpful.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of Senator Leahy, I will be happy to extend the \nSenator from Texas 6 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am very grateful for the graciousness of the assistant \nmajority leader. If we can have 5 minutes for the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas, I think those are the last two. I presume the leader may \nwant to say a word or two.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Leahy, I extend 5 \nminutes to the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 6 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank Senator \nLeahy and Senator Reid for allowing me to speak. I did not know the \ntime had expired. I very much want to make a statement on behalf of \nPriscilla Owen, the supreme court justice from Texas.\n  I rise in support of Senator Lott's amendment calling on the \nJudiciary Committee to hold hearings on the U.S. circuit courts of \nappeals nominees who have been in the committee since May 9 of last \nyear.\n  In fact, 7 of the President's 30 circuit court judges have been \nconfirmed. We will have a judicial emergency across our Nation if the \nSenate continues to delay the confirmation of these fine men and women.\n  I was concerned when I saw the Wall Street Journal report last Friday \nthat some Members of the Senate may target the nomination of Justice \nPriscilla Owen to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In \nfact, the Committee on the Judiciary in the Senate should take swift \naction on her nomination, particularly in light of the fact that Judge \nOwen was among the group of original 11 judicial nominees announced by \nPresident Bush on May 9 of last year.\n  Justice Owen's stellar academic achievements and professional \nexperience are remarkable. She earned a cum laude bachelor of arts \ndegree from Baylor University. She graduated cum laude from Baylor Law \nSchool in 1977. When she took the Texas bar exam, which is one of the \nhardest bar exams in the Nation, she came in first. She earned the very \nhighest score on the Texas bar exam that year.\n  Prior to her election to the Texas Supreme Court in 1994, she was a \npartner in the Texas law firm of Andrews & Kurth, where she practiced \ncommercial litigation for 17 years.\n\n  Justice Owen has delivered exemplary service on the Texas Supreme \nCourt, as affirmed by receiving positive endorsements from every major \nnewspaper in Texas during her successful reelection bid in 2000.\n  Justice Owen enjoys bipartisan support, and the American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has \nunanimously voted Justice Owen well qualified.\n  Filling judicial vacancies is a critical duty of the Senate. I hope \nwe will be\n\n[[Page S2215]]\n\nable to move forward. I have asked the Judiciary Committee to let us \nconfirm three of the four U.S. attorneys for the State of Texas. The \nState of Texas has four judicial districts. One of our U.S. attorneys \nhas been confirmed, but three U.S. attorneys remain unconfirmed. So we \nhave appointed leaders in those offices where we really need to have \npermanent leaders, at least a permanent leader during this term, who \nwill be able to lead the office and organize it and make sure we are \nhiring and staffing the offices in these important districts.\n  One of those has the largest caseload in the United States, the \nSouthern District of Texas. We need to have the prosecutors on board. \nWe need to make sure the U.S. attorney who is going to run the office \nis setting the priorities for those offices. We know that our border \ndistricts, both the Western and Southern Districts, are the busiest \ndistricts in America.\n  I ask that our U.S. attorneys in three of the four Texas districts be \nconfirmed immediately. I had hoped we would do it before the recess \nbecause these three people are waiting and ready to go. All three of \nthem are in Government now. They are not in private practice that has \nto be tied up. They are assistant U.S. attorneys and one is a \nmagistrate. They could make the moves swiftly and begin to lead these \noffices.\n  I ask the Judiciary Committee, with all due respect, to please \nexpedite these nominees for U.S. attorney, particularly with Justice \nPriscilla Owen, who is a personal friend of mine, who I know to be of \nthe very highest caliber. Having been appointed May 9, 2001, and not \nyet having a hearing I think is a pretty difficult situation. She is so \nwell regarded by everyone who has appeared before her in court or has \npracticed law with her.\n  I ask that we have a fair hearing on Justice Owen and that we be able \nto go forward with our three U.S. attorneys and Justice Priscilla Owen \non an expedited basis.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I love reading Lewis Carroll. I remember \nLewis Carroll and ``Alice in Wonderland.'' When I hear the descriptions \nof history today and listen to some of the discussion in the Senate, it \nbrings me back to when I was a child. I extend my appreciation to my \ncolleagues on the other side for livening our more serious times with a \nlittle bit of fiction.\n  They talk about how terrible it is we have some people--actually \nseveral of whom do not have blue slips--who have been here for several \nmonths and we have not had a hearing even though they know some of the \nblue slips are not in. We will be, as we go along, scheduling hearings, \nas compared to people who did have blue slips in when the Republicans \nwere in charge. I think of Helene White. She waited 1,454 days. I do \nnot recall a single Member of the Republican Party saying should she \nnot at least have a hearing; even if we vote her down, should she not \nat least have a hearing. She did not even have a hearing or a vote in \nthe committee; 1,454 days, not a word.\n  We have seen the crocodile tears today. Even though we are moving \nmuch faster than the Republicans ever did when there was a Democratic \nPresident, we see these crocodile tears for people who have been \nwaiting a month or 2 months or even 3 months. No recognition of course \nthat for some of that time the Republicans held the Senate majority and \nfor some of that time they delayed the reorganization of the Senate and \nno recognition of the numbers of vacancies and problems they left for \nus to try to remedy. But 1,454 days?\n  I look at the other qualified nominees we had to wait for. There was \nanother one, Fifth Circuit. H. Alston Johnson waited 602 days, no \nhearing. There was James Duffy, Ninth Circuit, 546 days, no hearing. \nAnd Kathleen McCree Lewis, extraordinarily competent attorney, daughter \nof one of the most respected solicitors general ever in this country, \nshe waited 455 days and never received a hearing. There was Kent Markus \nof the Sixth Circuit who waited 309 days under the Republicans and \nnever got a hearing. And Robert Cindrich of the Third Circuit who never \nreceived a hearing in over 300 days.\n  Then there were the nominations that were held up without a hearing \nsuch as Judge James Beaty who waited 1,033 days, no hearing. James \nWynn, Fourth Circuit, 497 days, no hearing. Enrique Moreno, Fifth \nCircuit, waited 455 days, never got a hearing. Jorge Rangel, the Fifth \nCircuit, 454 days, never received a hearing.\n  Allen Snyder, the D.C. Circuit; now I will give them credit, he \nwaited 449 days and finally did get a hearing. Of course, they never \nbrought it to a vote in the committee, but he did receive a hearing. He \nand Bonnie Campbell, the former Iowa Attorney General had hearings but \nnever were on the Committee agenda for a vote.\n  So as I say, I enjoy fiction as much as the next person. I heard a \ngreat deal of it, along with the crocodile tears. It did enliven an \notherwise slow-moving day.\n  On the one hand I know there are a number of Republicans who do want \njudicial nominees to go forward. I have had a dozen or more Republican \nSenators come to me and explain the situation they had in their State \nor their circuit with a judge they needed at home. I think in virtually \nevery one of those cases, certainly in most of them, within a very few \nweeks, we had the hearings on those judges. They are all Republicans. \nWe held hearings on them. They cooperated in bringing them forward. We \nput them on the Committee agenda and we voted them out, put them on the \nExecutive Calendar and the Senate confirmed them and every single \nDemocrat voted for them--over 40 judges. They voted for them, and they \ngot through.\n  I remember shortly after the shift in majority last summer when we \nhad nominations pending. We came to the August recess. Normally what we \ndo by unanimous consent is keep the nominations here. The Republican \nleader said and objected and by Senate rule then all had to go back to \nthe White House. Although we tried to keep them here, he objected. I \nwas put in a bind and had no nominees whatever pending, even though I \nstill held 2 days of hearings in the August recess in anticipation of \nthe names coming back.\n  I got criticized by the Republicans for holding hearings during the \nAugust recess. Members get criticized for not holding hearings \nimmediately; Members get criticized for holding hearings. One \nRepublican--one Republican--showed up for 1 day of the 2-day hearings \non President Bush's nominees and we got the nominees through.\n  I am looking forward to see where we are by July 10 of this year. \nThat will be 1 year to the day from the time I had a fully organized \ncommittee and could start hearings. We held a hearing on judicial \nnominees, including a court of appeals nominee the very next day on \nJuly 11.\n  Incidentally, instead of going--as my friends on the Republican \nside--month after month after month after month after month after month \nwithout even holding a hearing on President Clinton's nominees, within \n10 minutes of the time the Senate adopted a resolution reorganizing, I \nnoticed the first set of hearings. They were on the calendar within a \nfew weeks thereafter, notwithstanding the fact that up until July there \nwas not a single hearing on any judge.\n  Democrats were not in charge from the end of January until June and \ninto July. It was July when we took over a committees and had assigned \nmembers. The Republicans while in charge did not hold a single hearing. \nTen minutes after the Senate reorganized, we started the process to \nhold hearings.\n  I mentioned what happened in the past not to say this should be tit \nfor tat, by any means. I don't believe in that. The Republicans for 6 \nyears under President Clinton were delaying, stopping hearings and not \neven allowing nominees to have hearings and not allowing them to have \nvotes in the committee. And I knew if they had a vote in Committee they \ncould be voted down and that would have been the end of it. If they \nvote them up, they come to the floor. That has been the precedent and \npractice of the Committee. My concern\n\n[[Page S2216]]\n\nwas that they would not even give the nominees hearings, scores of \nnominees.\n  Sadly, we did have one judge who they voted through the committee \ntwice, and then on a party-line vote voted him down on the floor, \nincluding Senators who voted for him in the committee who then voted \nhim down on the floor. That was done without warning, without notice \nand on the first party-line vote on the Senate floor to defeat a \njudicial nominee I can remember. Even with the other controversial \nnominations of the last several years, such as the nomination of Judge \nBork to the Supreme Court, some Democrats voted for him and some \nRepublicans against.\n  I do not believe in tit for tat and have not engaged in pay back. I \nhave been here 27 years, several times in the majority and several \ntimes in the minority. I believe we should go forward. That is why I \nhave been moving much faster on judges than the Republicans ever did \nfor President Clinton.\n  I intend to continue to move faster. We set up a process. When we \nhave a hearing, we have at least one court of appeals judge, something \nnot consistently done during the time the Republicans were in charge. I \nintend to do that.\n\n  They can try to change what the record is. They can try to change the \nhistory.\n  I am stating what I intend to do. We are moving to hold more hearings \nthan they did. We are moving faster on confirmations than the \nRepublicans ever did for President Clinton. I am not going to put us \nback to the kind of thing they did to President Clinton. Ultimately, it \ndamages the independence of the Judiciary.\n  However, I would like to see at least a modicum of cooperation from \nthe White House. If they send up judges from a circuit or State where \nthey have not sought any consensus from the Senators from that State, \nof course they will have difficulty. I have been here with six \nPresidents from both parties. Every one of those Presidents consulted \nwith Senators from the State where the judges came from. That does not \nmean Senators can nominate the judges; the President nominates judges. \nBut they sought consensus first. When they did this, they always went \nthrough.\n  I have already voted for some 40 conservative Republican nominees as \njudges from President Bush. I have voted for more than 120 of the \nPresident's executive branch nominees in the Judiciary Committee, \nranging from U.S. attorneys to senior Justice Department officials. I \nassume the judicial nominations that we have considered were \nRepublicans, and I assume conservative Republicans; I voted for all but \none of them so far.\n  However, there has to be consensus. And people that are not \nideologues; people who will enforce and apply the laws and not try to \nremake them, and people who will instill fairness in their courtrooms \nand those nominees I have always supported, not people who will \nlegislate and make laws--that is our job. We may do it poorly, but that \nis our job.\n  This year we were talking about cooperation. Senator Grassley is one \nof the most respected members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, former \nchairman of the Finance Committee. I served with him both on the \nJudiciary Committee and the Agriculture Committee for a quarter of a \ncentury. He asked if we could proceed with Judge Melloy of Iowa to the \nEighth Circuit. In the past, Republicans had held up judges from Iowa. \nI thought Senator Grassley made a good case. I told him I would \nproceed, as soon as we came back in session this year. And I did.\n  We have also held hearings this year on Judge Pickering and Judge \nSmith at the request of Senators Lott and Specter. Senator Enzi asked \nfor a hearing on Terrence O'Brien of Wyoming to the Tenth Circuit. We \nmoved as quickly as we could and held his hearing this week. So the \nfour Court of Appeals nominees on whom we have had hearings this year \nwere each at the request of a Republican Senator.\n  Of the 48 judicial nominations on which we have had hearings --for \nthose who think this is partisan--25 came from States with no Democrats \nin the Senate and 12 came from States with one Republican Senator. So \n37 of the 48 nominees were basically from Republican States. We moved \nforward. That is the bipartisanship I want. By the way, the other 11 \nare not all from States with two Democratic Senators. Far from it. The \nremaining 11 include four nominees to federal courts in the District of \nColumbia and among them was the former Republican Chief Counsel of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee for Senator Hatch.\n  It is difficult and takes a certain amount of time to do this, but \nSenators often ask to move right away on a nomination, and I try to be \naccommodating. But when Senators then come on the floor and say we are \nnot moving fast enough on somebody else well, we can only do so many.\n\n  Only 1 of over 160 nominees before the Judiciary Committee over the \nlast nine months has been voted down. When people ask: Why aren't we \nmoving faster and doing more? Part of the answer is that it took 4 days \nover several weeks to have hearings and a vote on that one \ncontroversial nominee. In those 4 days, let alone the hours and hours \nand days of preparation, we could have gotten a dozen judges through. I \ndare say that we will spend more time in the debate this afternoon than \nwe have debating the 14 judges confirmed so far this year.\n  I inherited a vast number of judicial vacancies, including \nlongstanding problems, especially political problems. I am doing my \nbest to change that. I am doing my best to move forward.\n  I urged that we get rid of the secret holds and make blue slips \npublic. And now we finally have. Republicans did not do that when they \nwere in the majority. I have urged the Rules Committee to take the \nposition, if the Democrats are in majority next year, to divide the \nbudget 50/50. I have had Republicans chair portions of hearings this \nyear and have reported bills introduced by Republican Senators. These \nthings did not occur in the recent past.\n  If we stop the partisanship and the confrontational tactics of last \nyear and this last week and if we show cooperation, if the White House \ngot involved and did those things, we could speed this up. Consult and \nwork with Senators--we will go forward faster.\n  The President, for whom I have great respect, has had an enormous \namount on his plate since September 11. I understand. However, there \nare some, unfortunately, who advise him who come with the idea they can \nonly have judges they have signed off on by particular special interest \ngroups. Then there will be a confrontational battle. It should not be \nthat way.\n  Check how it was done under the last six Presidents with whom I have \nserved. Find out how it was done. It was done by trying to work \ntogether. If we do that, maybe things were work more smoothly. Instead, \nthe President's key political adviser in the White House appeared \nbefore an ideological advocacy group last week and committed--actually, \nrecommitted--the administration to selecting judicial nominees to \nreflect a hard right ideology, an ends-oriented judicial \nphilosophy. That is unfortunate. Can you imagine if Bill Clinton had \ngone before a group and said: I am only going to select judicial \nnominees to reflect a hard left ideology, and an ends-oriented judicial \nphilosophy? You thought some had to wait 1,000 days to even have a \nhearing or were denied a hearing--can you imagine what would have \nhappened if the Clinton administration had done that? It is wrong when \nthe Bush administration does that.\n\n  All that says is, if that person is confirmed and if you are a \nlitigant before that judge, basically what the President's political \nadviser was saying is, unless you reflect a hard right ideology and an \nends-oriented judicial philosophy, forget about coming before this \njudge because you are not going to have fair treatment.\n  People ask me if I have a litmus test. I sure do. My litmus test has \nbeen the same with the six Presidents with whom I served, and I voted \nagainst Democratic nominees when I believed they didn't follow this \nlitmus test. That is, if somebody comes before that judge, whether they \nare conservative, liberal, rich, poor, white, black, Republican, \nDemocrat, north, south, wherever they are from, plaintiff or \ndefendant--they can look at that judge and say: Whatever happens in \nthis case, I know I have had a fair judge. That is my one litmus test.\n  When the Presidential adviser actually goes before a political \nadvocacy\n\n[[Page S2217]]\n\ngroup and says we are not going to do that, we have to have nominees \nwho reflect a hard right ideology and an ends-oriented judicial \nphilosophy, that is wrong. That is wrong.\n  Actually, what that tells me is that rather than succumb to a notion \nof advice and rubberstamp, we had better do what the Constitution says, \nadvice and consent, and go through the process carefully.\n  I say, again, we are scheduling hearings on judicial nominations and \nhave continued to schedule hearings in spite of the unfair criticism \nbecause I do want to get through as many good judges as possible and \nfill as many of the vacancies I inherited as fast as possible. I will \nconsider a number of factors: Consensus of support for the nominee, the \nneeds of the court for which he was nominated, and the interests of the \nhome State Senators.\n  I have served with 270 Senators, I believe, since I have been here. I \nhave found more and more how important it is to rely on the views of \nhome State Senators, Republican and Democratic alike.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains to the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator from Vermont has \napproximately 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have tried, again, to include at hearings judges \nSenators have asked for in both parties, including the court of appeals \nnominees, including hearings this year. I attempted to comply with the \nrequests of Senators Grassley, Lott, Specter, and Enzi. We did that.\n  One was voted down. I know the Republican leader, who has been my \nfriend for years, was disappointed at the committee vote on the \nnomination of Judge Charles Pickering. He argued strongly for the \njudge, as he should. The Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, argued \nstrongly for him and gave an excellent argument for him before the \ncommittee, as did the Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine.\n  I tried to afford Judge Pickering--who, incidentally, still has a \nlifetime tenure as a Federal judge--every courtesy. I extended the \ntime. I had a second hearing. I extended the time for the vote. I was \nwilling to do all that.\n  But I still have to decide how I vote. I remember for a Democratic \nPresident and a nominee he very much wanted, I voted against him for \nsome of the same reasons, the exact same reasons, in fact, that I voted \nagainst Judge Pickering. He was voted down in the committee--just as \nJudge Pickering was, and that was the end of it.\n  I do not want to go back to the situation where almost a third of \nPresident Clinton's court of appeals nominees waited more than 300 days \nfrom nomination to confirmation, an average of 441 days for these \nindividuals; nearly a quarter waited more than a year, 20 percent \nwaited more than 500 days, 6 waited more than 700 days, 2 waited more \nthan 1,000 days, and one waited more than 4 years--if they got hearings \nat all.\n  Judge Helene White of Michigan waited more than 4 years. She never \ngot a hearing. In fact, 56 percent of President Clinton's circuit court \nnominees in the last Congress, nominated or renominated in 1999-2000, \nwere not acted upon by the Judiciary Committee. I am trying to repair \nthat damage.\n  That is why we are moving forward--we are moving forward as quickly \nas we can, and I will continue to do that.\n  No matter what is said on the other side, no matter how much things \nare taken out of context, no matter how much fiction we hear on the \nfloor from that side, I will move them forward.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont controls \napproximately 4 minutes 50 seconds. The time of the Senator from Utah \nhas expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand some of my time has already been given to the \nRepublican side previously; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes has been offered to the Senator \nfrom Kansas, Mr. Brownback.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I believe we also gave time to the Senator from Texas, did \nwe not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. She has already consumed that time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I tried to help, just to be fair. Let me say this, in the \nremaining 3 minutes.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. We are moving far more rapidly than \nthe Republicans did when they were in charge and President Clinton was \nPresident.\n  We have had a lot that has gone on in the past few months. I have not \nused the events and aftermath of September 11 as an excuse but have \ninstead continued to hold hearings and votes on judicial nominees. Some \nof the Republican special interest groups pooh-pooh the fact that we \neven would refer to the events of September 11. They allow it as a \njustification for many things and an excuse for everybody else but not \nfor the Judiciary Committee. Well, we have not made excuses. Instead, \nwe build a good record.\n\n  We actually had to put together an antiterrorism bill during that \ntime, which we did, one which the President certainly felt good about. \nHe praised me and Senator Hatch for our work on that.\n  We had to do that. We had this building that we are in right now \nemptied because of an anthrax scare. Most of our staffs, Republican and \nDemocratic, are in the Dirksen and Hart Buildings. That was vacated for \na period of time because of anthrax. The Hart Building was vacated for \na very considerable period of time.\n  I was one of those who received an anthrax letter designed to kill \nme, as was Senator Daschle. Me and my staff--it turns out there was \nenough anthrax to kill an awful lot more people than that. So this has \nnot been a usual year.\n  But as I pointed out in the charts earlier, in the 9 months the \nDemocrats have controlled this committee, we have done more than during \nany comparable period during the time when the Republicans controlled \nthe committee.\n  I am assuming--and I pray--this country will not face something \nsimilar to September 11 again. I assume and I pray that our Capitol \nwill not face something like that again.\n  I take a moment to applaud the brave men and women of our Capitol \nPolice and the work of our Secretary of the Senate and Sergeant at Arms \nin protecting us up here.\n  I have talked with the White House about one simple procedure they \ncould do without giving up any of their rights or any of their \nprivileges. One simple procedure they could do, which would take 4 or 5 \nweeks off many judicial nominations. They could potentially be able to \ngo to hearing 4, 5, or 6 weeks faster if the White House would simply \nspeeding up the process of getting all the paperwork and the reviews \ndone and getting them up here.\n  Those are things that can be done.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this has been a good debate. I might ask \nthe Senate to pass a resolution that just said very simply the \nDemocratic majority will be required to go at the same pace that the \nRepublican majority did under President Clinton. But I have a feeling, \nif we did that, President Bush would be very upset because I have a \nfeeling he does not want us to go back to the procedures used when his \nparty controlled the Senate. We will not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to take 4 minutes \nof the leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am going to object. I will tell you why. \nWe have given more than that amount of time. If somebody had told me \nthey wanted to, I would have given time from my own time. We have \nalready given the time.\n  Mr. HATCH. How about 2 minutes of leader's time? Would you be \ngracious enough for that?\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the leader wants to, of course, I will yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Vermont object?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me rephrase my question. As ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, I am\n\n[[Page S2218]]\n\nasking my colleague to consent to 2 minutes of the leader's time to be \nused by me. I don't think he would be totally displeased with what I \nhave to say.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would I then have 2 minutes available to me if I wish to \nuse it?\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree to that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I personally thank the distinguished \nchairman the Judiciary Committee for doing the job he is doing on \ndistrict court nominees. The problem here is not just reporting \nnominees--although we think more should be approved--it is 31 circuit \ncourt vacancies. A number of them are judicial emergencies, as defined \nby the Administrative Office of the Courts.\n  But I have listened to my colleague's comments about holding hearings \nwhen Senators have asked him to do so. I have been patient for many \nmonths, but I do believe I have to say this today. I am Ranking Member \nof the Judiciary Committee. It was just there 2 days ago when one of my \njudges was given a hearing, Professor Paul Cassell. His nomination had \nbeen pending since June of last year. I don't understand waiting this \nlong. And the second judge nominated for a spot in my home state of \nUtah, Michael McConnell, has not had a hearing even though I have been \npromised one. I have requested at least 15 times for these two to get \nhearings, to be marked up in committee, and to be brought to the floor. \nMichael McConnell's nomination probably enjoys the widest and most \nvociferous support of legal scholars from all across the political \nspectrum--Democrats and Republicans of any currently pending nominee.\n  I would like to have the courtesy extended to me that I extended to \nthe distinguished Chairman when he was the Ranking Member. I believe it \nis time for me to raise this issue because I have been very upset that \nthis hasn't happened.\n  Last, but not least, keep in mind--everybody listening to this \ndebate--that the Senate confirmed 377 Clinton judges, which is only 5 \nfewer than the all-time champion, Ronald Reagan, who got 382 judges \nconfirmed. And both had 6 years of a Republican Senate--which was the \nopposite party for President Clinton and the allied party for President \nReagan. Both got essentially the same number of judges. In fact, \nClinton would have had more had it not been for Democratic holds and \nobjections.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I said earlier, we will continue to move \nat a faster pace on the nominees for President Bush than the \nRepublicans ever did with nominees of President Clinton. I will \ncontinue to move at a faster pace for them. I will continue to try to \novercome the objections to hearings on Senator Hatch's nominees, and we \nwill have a hearing.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3040 offered by Senator Reid of Nevada.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont asked for the yeas \nand nays.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President, until \nthe minority leader arrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has to determine if there is a \nsufficient second for the yeas and nays.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hatch for trying to put in \nthe quorum so I would have an opportunity to make some very brief \nremarks. I hope everybody understands that was what was going on--to \ngive me a chance to be here and just wrap up some of what needs to be \npointed out again before we get to a vote.\n  We have a real problem in the Senate. I think it could be a growing \nproblem. We are very concerned about the nominees who are being moved \nand those who are not being moved; and, more specifically, the fact \nthat the first eight circuit court judges have not been moved, have not \nbeen voted on, and, in fact, have not even had a hearing. I believe \nthat is accurate. The first eight, to go back to May 9, 2001, an \noutstanding group of nominees, men and women and minorities, have not \nhad any opportunity to make their case, to be voted on in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, and be voted on in this Chamber.\n  That is what our resolution says. That is all it says. This is not a \nquantum leap, saying you have to have a hearing, you have to vote, you \nhave to bring it to the floor, and you have to get it done. But it does \nsay that in the interest of administration of justice, the Judiciary \nCommittee shall hold hearings at least on the nominees submitted by the \nPresident on May 9, 2001, by May 9, 2002.\n  That seems like a very small step, to move toward some progress being \nmade and helping to begin to cure some very frayed feelings about the \nway the Judiciary Committee acted with regard to Judge Pickering. But \nmoving beyond that and moving into the broader sense, one judge will \nnot this session make. But this pattern is a major problem.\n  Conversely, the other resolution just says that the Judiciary \nCommittee should move forward expeditiously on these nominees. Goodness \ngracious, that is not saying very much, it doesn't appear to me. I hope \nthey will be moving forward expeditiously.\n  But what does it mean? Does it mean they are going to get a hearing? \nDoes it mean it is going to get some actual result? No.\n  That is basically the difference. One resolution says that these \noutstanding nominees--I will not list their names because I am sure \nthey have been talked about individually and collectively--should at \nleast have a hearing by May 9. The other resolution says it should be \nconsidered expeditiously.\n  The point is, though, to highlight this issue, this will not be the \nlast resolution in this area, unless we begin to see some fair \nprogress. There will be others. And they perhaps will be more pointed.\n  But it goes to the much bigger question of how we are going to go \nthrough the rest of this session, how these nominees are going to be \ntreated, and, as a matter of fact, how we are going to act on \nlegislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote on both sides of the aisle for the \nresolution that would lead to results and that is the one that calls \nfor hearings by the specified date of May 9, 2002.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I can certainly appreciate the \nfrustration expressed by some of our colleagues. We have been there. We \nknow how frustrating it is to have judges who are not given the time \nand attention, and the fair consideration they deserve. Because we have \nexperienced that all too often while we were in the minority.\n  What we have attempted to do is respond to that frustration by doing \nwhat we have said we were going to do from the very beginning, that we \nwere going to treat judges fairly, we were going to try to do as much \nas we could to move them quickly. And we believe we have done that.\n  I do not recall a time when our Republican colleagues ever agreed to \nhold at least one hearing on a circuit court judge with every group of \ndistrict court judges receiving hearings. But that is exactly what our \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee has committed to do.\n  I will look at the numbers, and we can compare statistics all day \nlong, but all one has to do is look at the bottom line. We have \nexceeded their record in many ways. In 9 months, we have confirmed more \njudges than the Republicans confirmed in President Reagan's first \nyear--12 months. We have confirmed more circuit court judges already \nthis year than Republicans did in\n\n[[Page S2219]]\n\n1996 when they confirmed zero circuit court judges. But we can compare \nthese back and forth. What I am simply prepared to do today--as you \nhave heard Senator Leahy and members of our committee say on so many \noccasions--is to say, we are going to deal with these judges fairly and \nexpeditiously. I think our record shows that.\n  I thank Senator Leahy for his leadership, for the commitment he has \nmade, and for the diligence he has shown in getting us to this point.\n  Forty-two judges have been confirmed; 7 circuit court judges have \nalready been confirmed. What Senator Leahy and the Judiciary Committee \nare now saying is, we will improve upon that in the coming weeks and \nmonths. When you look at what we will have been able to do by the end \nof this session, I think everyone will be able to say, without \nequivocation: You have done a good job.\n  That is what we are committing to do. That is what our resolution \nsays. That is why I believe, very strongly, that supporting the \nDemocratic resolution is, again, supporting the clear intent of our \ncaucus and of this Senate that these nominees are going to get fair \ntreatment. We are determined to do that. And we will demonstrate that \nwith each passing week.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 3040\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3040. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, we are currently consulting about the \nremainder of the day. It is fair to say Senators should expect \nadditional rollcall votes. We are hoping we might reach an agreement \nprocedurally on how to make additional progress on the bill during the \nremaining hours of today. At this point we cannot say with any \nconfidence what tomorrow holds. It depends, in part, on what the \nschedule will be for the remainder of the day. We are working to \narrange for additional votes and consideration of additional \namendments. We will propound that request as soon as it becomes \navailable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2219-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2219-S2220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PROVISION FOR CONDITIONAL RECESS OR ADJOURNMENT OF CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, at the end of the last session of Congress \nthe Finance Committee reported three critical pieces of international \ntrade legislation to the Senate calendar: An expansion of the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Act, an extension of fast track trade negotiating \nauthority, and an expansion of the Andean Trade Benefits program.\n  Each of these bills is time-sensitive and I believe that the Senate \nshould take action on them as soon as possible. The Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Act, or TAA, first established in 1962, is the program that \naddresses the needs of workers and firms that are adversely impacted by \ntrade.\n  The Senate Finance Committee bill expands TAA coverage to new groups \nof workers, including farmers and secondary workers; provides training \nand healthcare benefits to recipients; and experiments with a new \nconcept of wage insurance, which aims to move the unemployed back into \nthe labor force as quickly as possible.\n  Unfortunately, TAA was allowed to expire at the end of the last \nCongress. We need to not only extend TAA, but complete the expansion as \nsoon as it is practical.\n  Although States have cooperated with the efforts of the Department of \nLabor to keep the program in operation, this stopgap cannot continue \nindefinitely. Congress must ensure that this critical safety net for \nworking Americans is in place.\n  The extension of fast-track trade negotiating authority--sometimes \ncalled trade promotion authority--is also pending on the Senate \ncalendar.\n  This measure is controversial, but Senator Grassley and I were able \nto arrive at a bipartisan bill to extend fast track. And the bill \npassed the Finance Committee 18-3 with the support of both the majority \nleader and the minority leader.\n  This extension may not be as urgent as the extension of TAA, but many \nimportant international trade negotiations both bilaterally and \nmultilaterally are pending or underway. This bill allows Congress to \ndirect these negotiations and allows the President to credibly \nnegotiate with our trading partners. It is time for Congress to extend \nfast track.\n  The Senate Finance Committee also reported an extension of the Andean \nTrade Promotion Act or ATPA. This measure has been actively supported \nby many Senators, including Senator Bob Graham and the distinguished \nmajority leader.\n  The legislation aims to shore up support among U.S. allies in the \ncritical Andean region and provide an alternative to the illegal drug \ntrade to citizens in the region.\n  In addition, another critical international trade program, the \nGeneralized System of Preferences, which provides important benefits to \nmany developing countries, also expired at the end of the last \nCongress. This program should also be extended for some reasonable \nperiod of time, in my opinion, several years.\n  I have discussed with the majority leader and many of my colleagues \ncombining all of these bills into a single vehicle, winning Senate \npassage for the legislation, and quickly moving to gain support for the \nlegislation in the other body in the hopes that these measures might be \nsigned into law as soon as possible.\n  The combined trade legislation has some detractors, but each \ncomponent of the proposed trade legislation has bipartisan support. \nEach piece serves an important public policy purpose. And each piece is \ntimely, if not overdue.\n  I know that the Senate calendar is crowded, but I would like to urge \nthe majority leader and the minority leader to work with Senator \nGrassley and myself to find time to take this legislation up shortly \nafter the Senate returns from the coming recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Commerce, Science and Transportation, I would like to discuss an \nissue I have discussed before, an issue that was addressed by the \nadministration's proposal in the 2003 budget to delay the auction dates \nfor spectrum being used by broadcasters.\n  In 1997, Congress ventured down a path that we hoped would lead to a \nrevolution for the American consumer--digital television. Congress took \naction to support the transition to digital television, specifically \nhigh definition digital television, because of its potential to give \nAmericans sharp movie-quality pictures and CD-quality sound, and took \nthe extraordinary step of giving the broadcast industry a huge amount \nof spectrum for free--a $70 billion gift.\n  During consideration of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, broadcasters \ntouted DTV technology as a competitive necessity that would preserve \nfree over-the-air television in the new digital millennium. They sought \nlegislation intended to speed and facilitate a transition from analog \nto digital television broadcasting. Their requests for special \ntreatment were fulfilled.\n  At the time, the Wall Street Journal described Congress' action as a \n``planned multibillion dollar handout for wealthy TV-station owners.'' \nWhile other industries must purchase their spectrum in competitive \nauctions, in the case of digital TV, Congress decided to give away the \nspectrum. At the same time, Congress also decided that broadcasters \ncould keep their old analog spectrum until 2006, or until 85 percent of \nTV homes in a market could receive digital signals.\n  During the debate on the Balanced Budget Act, I expressed my serious \nreservations with the spectrum provision. At the time I stated:\n\n     . . . when it comes to the bill's provisions on the analog \n     turnback date, I fear that we have inadvisedly undercut the \n     value this spectrum might otherwise bring at auction by \n     including a waiver standard in this bill that unnecessarily \n     signals to bidders in 2002 that the spectrum they're bidding \n     on may not become available on any definitive date.\n\n  I was not alone in my concern. In October 2000, the New York Times \nwrote:\n\n     By giving the new spectrum away instead of auctioning it off \n     to the highest bidders, Congress deprived the Treasury, and \n     thus taxpayers, of tens of billions of dollars. The giveaway \n     also kept the new spectrum out of the hands of bidders eager \n     to sell digital services. The new spectrum went instead to \n     incumbent broadcasters, who have dawdled.\n\n  Moreover, if the broadcasters begin to use their digital spectrum \nprimarily to broadcast multiple channels of standard definition, \nperhaps on a subscription basis, I believe that they will never \nrelinquish the spectrum. This scenario was never mentioned by the \nbroadcasters while they were lobbying Congress for the free spectrum \nthey eventually received.\n  In 1997, Congress mandated that future FCC spectrum licensing should \nbe performed through auctions, ensuring that the spectrum is allocated \nto parties that value most highly the opportunity to provide wireless \nproducts and services, and that compensate the public for the use of \nits resources. Yet, at the same time, Congress gave away billions of \ndollars in public assets at the broadcasters' urging and on the promise \nthat the public would get it back, and get superior, free over-the-air \nservice in the bargain. As the President's budget acknowledges, \nhowever, this is not happening.\n  The administration is also proposing that beginning in 2007, the \nbroadcasters would be assessed a $500 million annual lease fee for \ntheir use of the analog spectrum. If they return their analog spectrum \nby the 2006 deadline, they will be exempt from the fee. While this \nproposal has merits and may be justified, I believe that in all \nlikelihood, the broadcasters will never pay. Be assured that a few \nyears from now, the NAB will be marching up to Capitol Hill asking \nCongress for more time to complete the DTV transition.\n  We should not let this happen. I believe that Congress must address \nthis issue legislatively to protect the American taxpayer and ensure \nthat the DTV transition will become a reality. Congress devoted \nvaluable public assets to\n\n[[Page S2221]]\n\nthe DTV transition and ultimately has the responsibility for finding \nresponsible solutions. The proposal before the FCC that enables \nbroadcasters to further capitalize on the spectrum give-away by \nallowing the broadcasters to negotiate to vacate the spectrum by 2006 \nfor a price, is not, I note, a responsible solution.\n  In closing, I would like to read a quote from an article that \nappeared in Business Week last year.\n\n       Congress should also make broadcasters pay for their \n     valuable real estate by attaching a price tag to the spectrum \n     they now occupy. When they approached Congress hat-in-hand, \n     broadcasters promised something they have yet to deliver. Now \n     that this has become abundantly clear, they shouldn't get a \n     free ride on taxpayers' backs. What they should do is fork \n     over the going rate for whatever airspace they occupy. That's \n     what cellphone companies are doing.\n\n  It has been almost 5 years since the spectrum giveaway and the \ntransition to digital television has barely materialized. The American \ntaxpayers first lost the auction value of the spectrum. Now, they have \nno real certainty of what they're likely to get in return, or when they \nare likely to get it. The situation is a mess, characterized by more \nfinger pointing than progress. Regardless of who is to blame, this much \nis clear: By 2006, this country will not have the transmission \nfacilities, the digital content, nor the reception equipment necessary \nto ensure that 85 percent of the population will be able to receive \ndigital television.\n  In fact, recent statistics show that consumers have yet to embrace \ndigital television. The Consumer Electronics Association reports that \n1.4 million DTV sets were sold last year, of which 97,000 were \nintegrated units containing digital tuners. However, we received \ntestimony before the Senate Commerce Committee last year that over 33 \nmillion analog sets had been sold in 2000 alone. While DTV sales have \nbeen increasing each year, an overwhelming majority of Americans are \nstill purchasing analog sets.\n  Given the uncertainty surrounding the return of the spectrum \ncurrently occupied by broadcasters, the administration has proposed \nshifting the auction for TV channels 60-69 from the elapsed 2000 \ndeadline to 2004. Additionally, the proposal would shift the auction of \nTV channels 52-59 from 2002 to 2006. According to OMB projections, \nshifting the auctions to later dates would increase expected revenues \nby $6.7 billion. The administration has concluded that if legislative \naction is not taken to shift the auction dates, potential auction \nparticipants may hesitate to bid for this spectrum without certainty of \nwhen the broadcasters may actually vacate it.\n  At the same time, however, even if we act to change the dates, I also \nbelieve that years from now Congress is likely to again find itself \nattempting to shift the auction dates because the broadcasters will \nstill occupy the spectrum. I hold this view because last year, the \nCommerce Committee held hearings on the transition to digital \ntelevision. During that hearing I asked the National Association of \nBroadcasters, NAB, whether or not they believed they were going to \nreach 85 percent of the homes in America by 2006. The NAB's response, \n``Originally, the expectations and the projections that [we] looked at, \nwas for that transition to take as long as possibly 2015.''\n  I believe that there's not a snowball's chance in Gila Bend, AZ, that \nthe broadcasters will vacate this spectrum by 2006, or that, despite my \nbest efforts, that broadcasters will be penalized for squatting, as the \nPresident has proposed, if they occupy this spectrum after 2006. Some \nbroadcasters have suggested that they may use their digital spectrum to \nmulticast standard definition signals and provide other ``ancillary'' \nservices, competing against companies and technologies that had to pay \nfor the spectrum they use. I worry that if broadcasters provide \n``ancillary'' services using the spectrum they received for free, they \nwill have a distinct competitive advantage over wireless companies who \npay the public for the use of its spectrum.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2221-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2221-S2222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL LABORATORIES PARTNERSHIP IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3049 to Amendment No. 3016\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr.President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n            (Purpose: To clarify the definition of biomass)\n\n       On page 6, strike line 9 and all that follows through line \n     15 and insert the following:\n       ``The term `biomass' means any organic material that is \n     available on a renewable or recurring basis, including \n     dedicated energy crops, trees grown for energy production, \n     wood waste and wood residues, plants (including aquatic \n     plants, grasses, and agricultural crops), residues, fibers, \n     animal wastes and other organic waste materials, and fats and \n     oils, except that with respect to material removed from \n     National Forest System lands the term includes only organic \n     material from--\n       ``(A) thinnings from trees that are less than 12 inches in \n     diameter;\n       ``(B) slash;\n       ``(C) brush; and\n       ``(D) mill residues.''.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment that \nwould modify the definition of biomass from national forests by \nclarifying that biomass may come from slash, brush, or mill residue \nfrom any size tree that may be harvested, as well as from thinning \ntrees that are less than 12 inches in diameter.\n  The Bingaman amendment defines the term ``biomass'' on national \nforest lands as only that material generated from tree commercial \nthinning or slash or brush.\n  Our respective staffs have worked out language that is acceptable to \nthe managers. I appreciate his staff's cooperation in addressing these \nconcerns.\n  Both Senator Murkowski and I have been concerned that mill residue, \nslash and brush from normal harvest activities did not qualify under \nthe construct of Bingaman amendment No. 3016.\n  I have also expressed concern about smaller logs that are sold as \ncommercial timber that could be utilized as biomass in some market \nconditions but would not qualify under Bingaman amendment No. 3016.\n  This amendment I am now offering addresses all of our concerns.\n  We have 39 million acres of national forest land at high risk of \ncatastrophic fire. We have an additional 24 million acres that have \nsuffered insect and disease attacks making them highly susceptible to \nfire as well.\n  There are over 49.5 million acres of trees in the 9- to 12-inch \ndiameter class that need to be thinned to reduce the risk of \ncatastrophic fires and to allow those trees to grow to full and \nproductive maturity.\n  I am pleased that we have addressed the fundamental problems that \ncause so many of my constituents concern. I have several biomass co-gen \noperations in my State that are fed largely from hog fuel off the \npublic lands--the national forest land.\n  I think this clarifies the issue. I thank the chairman for his \ncooperation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this does clarify the intent on both \nsides. I think this additional definitional language is useful. We have \nno objection to the amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bingaman for his \ncooperation.\n  I want to make sure that we all understand some of the terminology \nused, and the words ``hog fuel.'' I know what it is. It is the waste.\n\n[[Page S2222]]\n\n  The significant aspects of recognizing the way this portion of the \nBingaman amendment bill was originally stated is that it would have \nexcluded waste from public land--namely, the national forests--unless \nit is specifically identified as slashings, second growth, and so \nforth.\n  It would very narrowly bring into question the residue associated \nwith milling of timber and timber products from national forests as to \nwhether or not that waste could be used in biomass.\n  For example, in my State of Alaska, it would exclude the development \nof any biomass as an alternative because we don't have, for all \npractical purposes, anything other than public land.\n  That is why it is so important that this change be made. I want to \nmake sure that in the language the intention is, if you have a tree \nthat comes off public land that has rot in it that would be basically \ndetermined not to be sufficient for milling--and, in the terminology, \nthis would be a mill residue--indeed that would be included in the \ndefinition of what would be allowed.\n  Clearly, no one takes prime, quality timber and uses it for biomass. \nIt has a higher value. So there is a check and balance in it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If the Senator will yield, he makes an important point. In \ncommercial logging operations that are qualified under the U.S. Forest \nService--the legitimate timber sales--some of those logs, once cut, and \nbeyond the 12-inch diameter size that get to the mill, that are \ndeteriorating or have, as you call it, the rot of the center and cannot \nbe milled, put on a mill head rig and moved, fall apart, I think that \nis residue by anyone's definition when it is determined, at least in \nthe mill yard, that no commercial value can come from it. Clearly, I \nthink that falls under that definition. But I appreciate the Senator \nmentioning it.\n  What we are doing, along with passing legislation, is establishing, \nby the record of the floor, what is the intent of Congress. And I think \nthat is the intent of this legislation.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I certainly agree with that. I appreciate the \ncolloquy. I think this is good utilization in the sense of biomass. But \nI would like to remind my colleagues that biomass just does not create \nenergy. Somebody has to burn it. When you burn it, you generate \nemissions. And when you generate emissions, obviously, you have a \ntradeoff.\n  I am pleased the amendment will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3049) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I understand it, we are working on an \narrangement that will accommodate further progress on this part of the \nenergy bill. I appreciate the cooperation of all those involved.\n  I want to take a moment to talk about a strong interest I have--and I \nknow it is shared by the Presiding Officer and many other of our \ncolleagues--in trade promotion authority, trade adjustment assistance, \nand the Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act. We will be dealing with \nall three of those issues in the next work period. I reemphasize the \nimportance that I, as one Senator, put on getting that package passed \nduring that time.\n  I think we all saw yesterday that the January trade deficit swelled \nto $28.5 billion. That is a 15 percent increase over December and \nsharply higher than the consensus forecast. That alone caused some \nanalysts to lower their projections for first quarter growth by a full \npercentage point.\n  That set of numbers indicates pretty clearly how important trade is \nto the American economy, and it graphically demonstrates why we need to \nprovide trade promotion authority.\n  Today, nearly one in every 10 U.S. jobs--an estimated 12 million \njobs--is directly linked to the export of U.S. goods and services. \nThese are good jobs that pay 13-18 percent more than the national \naverage.\n  The benefits are even more pronounced in agriculture. Since passage \nof NAFTA in 1993, U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico have doubled.\n  Agricultural exports today account for one in every three U.S. acres \nplanted; nearly 25 percent of gross cash sales in agriculture; and more \nthan three-quarters of a million U.S. jobs.\n  The U.S. Trade Representative's office estimates that the average \nAmerican family of four saves between $1,260 and $2,040 a year as a \nresult of the two major trade agreements we entered into in the 1990s--\nNAFTA and the Uruguay Round.\n  And in my view, the benefits of trade today are even greater for the \nUnited States because no Nation in the world is better positioned to \nthrive in a global, information-based economy.\n  Expanding trade also offers national security and foreign policy \nbenefits because trade opens more than new markets. When it is done \ncorrectly, it opens the way for democratic reforms. It also increases \nunderstanding and interdependence among nations, and raises the cost of \nconflict.\n  Senators Baucus and Grassley deserve great credit for getting a \nbipartisan TPA proposal out of the Finance Committee with an \noverwhelming vote of support--18 to 3.\n  Their proposal not only gives the President that authority he needs \nto negotiate good trade agreements for the United States. It also \naddresses critical labor and environmental concerns. Under their \nproposal, labor and environmental concerns are central issues, not side \nissues.\n  The fundamental reality is that expanded trade raises living \nstandards generally, but some people lose. That is inevitable.\n  Last year, we passed an important education reform bill. We agreed \nthen that we would ``leave no child behind.'' Now we need to make sure \nwe leave no worker behind. And that's why the package will include \nexpanded trade adjustment assistance\n  This is not a partisan idea. It's an American idea.\n  It was also the one clear area of agreement among the recommendations \nof the bipartisan U.S. Trade Deficit Review Commission, which was \nestablished by Congress in 1998.\n  Among the key members of the commission were President Bush's trade \nrepresentative, Robert Zoellick; Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld; and \nGeorge Becker, the former president of the United Steelworkers.\n  Nor is trade adjustment assistance a new idea. It has been part of \nAmerican trade policy for 40 years.\n  The current program, however, covers too few people. And it does not \naddress some of the most serious problems displaced workers have in \nfinding productive new employment.\n  I commend Senators Baucus and Bingaman for their leadership in \nputting together a proposal that corrects both of those shortcomings.\n  I also thank Senator Snowe, who has been working closely with us on \nthis effort.\n  We already have 47 cosponsors.\n  There are some reasons why we need a new, expanded program of trade \nadjustment assistance. I want to cite a few.\n  Today, if your employer's plant moves to Mexico, you are eligible for \na year of additional unemployment benefits, plus education and \ntraining. But if your plant moves to Brazil--or any other nation \nbesides Mexico--you get none of these benefits.\n  The new proposal says that no matter where your company moves, you \nget help.\n  Today, workers whose company moves to another country are eligible \nfor trade adjustment assistance. But let's say your employer provides \nparts to another company, and that company moves to another country. If \nyou lose your job in that case, you are not eligible for assistance.\n\n[[Page S2223]]\n\n  The new proposal makes sure these ``secondary workers'' get help, \ntoo.\n  For the first time, the new proposal also includes farmers.\n  As a general matter, expanded trade will provide billions and \nbillions of dollars in economic growth for the United States.\n  Certainly, we can dedicate a small fraction of this gain to those \nAmericans who are harmed. It is the right thing to do. Frankly, it will \nbe impossible to build a broad consensus for expanded trade unless we \ndo it right.\n  We should help American workers learn the new skills they need to \nearn a living. We should help them maintain health insurance while \nthey're unemployed--and help protect against wage loss when they become \nre-employed.\n  I also want to reaffirm my strong support for the Andean Trade \nPreference Expansion Act.\n  Again, I wish we could have passed it quickly, this week, as I had \noriginally hoped. But I am confident we can pass it in a relatively \nshort period of time after we return.\n  Congress first passed the Andean Trade Preferences Act 10 years ago \nas a comprehensive effort to defeat narco-trafficking and reduce the \nflow of cocaine into the United States.\n  The program allows the President to provide reduced-duty or duty-free \ntreatment for most imports from Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador, and Peru.\n  The goal is simple: to provide farmers in a region that produces 100 \npercent of the cocaine consumed in the United States with viable \neconomic alternatives to the production of coca.\n  The program works.\n  In the last decade, our Andean neighbors have made significant \neconomic gains, and trade between the United States and the region has \nincreased dramatically.\n  According to the International Trade Commission, between 1991 and \n1999, two-way trade between the United States and Andean nations nearly \ndoubled, and U.S. exports to the region grew by 65 percent.\n  The ITC also reports that ATPA has contributed significantly to the \ndiversification of the region's exports.\n  In addition, the program has served as a catalyst for resolving \nregional conflicts, pushing the members of the Andean community--\nparticularly Peru and Ecuador--to work toward resolution of long-\nstanding disagreements that have undercut efforts at regional \ndevelopment.\n  ATPA is doing, in other words, precisely what it was intended to do. \nSo there is every reason to extend it on its own merits.\n  But in addition, the bill we passed last year to expand U.S. trade \nwith Caribbean countries has had the unintended effect of putting the \nAndean nations at a competitive disadvantage with other nations in the \nregion.\n  The development and stability of the Andean region is as much in our \ninterest as it is in theirs.\n  The package we will consider when we return will renew ATPA and, at \nthe same time, level the playing field between Andean nations and their \nCaribbean neighbors.\n  I thank Senator Graham of Florida for his leadership in putting \ntogether the proposal and again Chairman Baucus for putting the entire \ntrade package together.\n  The word ``trade'' has its roots in an old Middle English word \nmeaning ``path,'' which is connected to the word ``tread'' to move \nforward.\n  The trade package we will consider when we return will enable us to \nmove forward in this new global economy in a way that strengthens our \nnational security and the economic security of American businesses and \nfamilies. We look forward to a good and vigorous debate when we return.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wanted to speak very briefly in \nagreement with the majority leader about his comments on both trade \npromotion authority and trade adjustment assistance. I think the two \nclearly have to go together and quickly. There are a great many workers \nin this country who are getting inadequate benefits. Many are getting \nno benefits because we have not modernized our Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program.\n  We have a good proposal to modernize that program which we passed out \nof the Finance Committee, and I think it is very important that we \nbring that up on the Senate floor after we return and pass that as \nquickly as possible. I know that is intended to pass in tandem with the \ntrade promotion authority.\n  The administration is anxious to see that pass. I think if there are \ndisagreements about the trade adjustment assistance proposals that we \nhave reported out of the Finance Committee, we need to have early \nnegotiations to resolve this.\n  I know the administration has expressed concerns. To my knowledge, we \nhave not had any real counterproposals that could be seriously \nconsidered. So I hope that will get done in the next couple of weeks \nbefore we return, and I hope we will be in a position to pass a new, \nimproved set of provisions regarding trade adjustment assistance. I \nthink that is a real priority. I was pleased we were able to move ahead \nin the Finance Committee. I think it is very important to move ahead on \nthe floor as well.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader for his \ncomments on the trade legislation package that we will be considering \nsoon. Clearly, this legislation is extremely important to the economic \nwelfare of the country and I look forward to helping him get it passed. \nIn particular, I want to get trade adjustment assistance legislation to \nthe floor so we can begin to help American workers and communities in a \nmore effective way.\n  I have heard a lot of criticism lately about the trade adjustment \nassistance bill especially concerning its linkage to fast-track \nlegislation but I have to agree with the majority leader that I see \nfast-track and trade adjustment assistance to be complementary. Fast-\ntrack will allow the creation of free-trade agreements that will \nprovide broad collective benefits to Americans, but it will also result \nin negative impacts on American workers and communities.\n  From where I sit, we should not pass legislation that will negatively \nimpact American workers without expanding and enhancing the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program. We need strong protections in place for \nAmerican workers and their communities. We need a safety net that keeps \nthese workers competitive and their communities strong. The Bush \nadministration has stated as much many times, most recently in their \ntrade policy agenda that came out this week.\n  My colleagues know that trade adjustment assistance has never been \nabout ideologies or political parties. It has always had bi-partisan \nsupport. If my colleagues look at the number of people in their state \nthat have used trade adjustment assistance over the years, or are using \nit now, they will admit the program is about helping people and \ncommunities get back on their feet. I am prepared to negotiate on the \noutstanding issues, and I am convinced that common ground can be found \nrather easily on the core components of the bill.\n  I thank the distinguished majority leader for his continued efforts \nto bring this legislation to the floor in a timely fashion, I want to \nthank Senator Baucus for his continued efforts to emphasize the \nimportance of trade adjustment assistance, and I look forward to \nworking with both of my colleagues in the future to ensure we pass this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2223-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2223-S2230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL LABORATORIES PARTNERSHIP IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001--continued\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To increase the transfer capability of electric energy \n      transmission systems through participant-funded investment)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. _. PARTICIPANT-FUNDED INVESTMENT.\n\n       Section 205 of the Federal Power Act is amended by \n     inserting after subsection (h) the following:\n       ``(i) Transmission expansion costs.--\n       ``(1) Rates for transmission expansion.--\n       Upon the request of a Regional Transmission Organization, \n     or any transmission entity operating within an RTO that is \n     authorized by the Commission, the Commission shall authorize \n     the recovery of costs on a participant-funding basis of \n     transmission facilities that increase the transfer capability \n     of the transmission system.

Mr. President, many years ago Arnold Glasow said that \n``all some folks want is their fair share--and yours.''\n  Today, I rise to offer an amendment that provides for true fairness \nin electricity pricing and in doing so paves the way for much needed \ntransmission expansion at a national level.\n  Over the past 10 years demand for electricity has increased 17 \npercent while transmission investment during the same period has \ncontinuously declined about 45 percent.\n  What is even more troubling is that current demand for electricity is \nprojected to increase by 25 percent over the next 10 years with only a \nmodest increase in transmission capacity of 4 percent. With projected \ndemand exceeding projected additional capacity five times over, \nproblems seem imminent.\n  It is no surprise to this Senator that in recent years electricity \nshortages due to transmission constraints have plagued the country from \none coast to another and various points in between. Unless we deviate \nimmediately from the past ways of doing business, our economy will be \nheld hostage to transmission constraints with rolling blackouts \nbecoming the norm rather than the exception.\n  Our existing electrical transmission system was designed to serve \nlocal customers from utility-owned generation on a State-by-State \nbasis. However, in recent years more and more ``merchant generation'' \noperated by independent companies have begun to connect to the \nelectrical grid in order to transmit electricity to local as well as \nout-of-region customers.\n  Though this increased generation added much needed competition, it \nbegan to strain the current transmission system. The pricing mechanism \nat the wholesale level still employs the old socialized rate method of \ncontinuously increasing the rates for local customers even though most \nof the beneficiaries are out-of-region customers. This antiquated \npricing method has dampened the push to enhance transmission capacity \nin energy producing States as State regulators are reluctant to pass \nexcessive transmission cost off to local customers who are not \nbenefitting from the electricity. Meanwhile energy dependent regions of \nthe country are denied cheap and reliable electricity.\n  Electricity price spikes in the Midwest during the summer of 1998 \nwere caused in part by transmission constraints limiting the ability of \nthe region to import electricity from other regions of the country. In \nthe summer of 2000, transmission constraints limited the ability to \nsell low-cost power from the Midwest to the South during a period of \npeak demand, resulting in higher prices for customers. Recent blackouts \nin northern California were the result of transmission constraints in \nsouthern California due to California's Path 15 transmission route. The \neast coast has also suffered from transmission constraints and price \nspikes in recent years.\n  Surely, there must be a more equitable way to allocate cost while \nsimultaneously enhancing our transmission capacity. It is not fair to \nexpect customers in energy generating States to keep paying for \ntransmission expansion when this increased transmission is primarily \nbeing developed for out-of-region use. In addition, the lack of \ntransmission capacity under this archaic pricing method continues to \ndeny customers in energy importing States the benefit of cheaper \nelectricity from other regions of the country.\n  The best policy for efficient competitive wholesale power markets is \n``participant-funded'' expansion. In this system, market participants \n``fund'' expansions to the transmission network in return for the \ntransmission rights created by the expansion investment. This approach \ngives proper economic incentive for new generator location and \ntransmission expansion decisions.\n  In the new world, the numbers and volumes of interstate transactions \nare large and growing every day. In my home State of Louisiana, there \nare enough new merchant generation plants planned to almost double the \namount of generation in the State today.\n  Those who favor socializing these costs may argue that ``rolled in \npricing is ok because transmission is such a small part of a consumer's \ntotal bill.'' This was true in the past but not anymore. If we must \nbuild enough transmission to export just a portion of this new \ngeneration--10,000 megawatts--the estimated cost would be $2 billion to \n$4 billion. Louisiana's share of this cost would be $90 to $180 million \nper year, and impose a retail rate increase of 5 to 11 percent. All \nwith no significant benefit to local customers.\n  The opponents of this amendment argue that transmission upgrades may \nbe more expensive than the delivered power is worth. If it is too \nexpensive to build facilities to move the power, then the plant is \nbeing built in the wrong place. No one should bear these costs, least \nof all local consumers.\n  The developers need to take these costs into account when they site \ntheir plants--just like they consider gas costs, water costs, and \nenvironmental\n\n[[Page S2225]]\n\npermits. The participant funding concept is not new--this concept has \nbeen successfully implemented in the natural gas industry through \nincremental pricing. As a result of incremental pricing in the natural \ngas industry, proposed annual additions in 2002 to natural gas pipeline \ncapacity has increased by nearly 100 percent relative to 1999.\n\n  The opponents of this legislation want the risk and consequences of \nbad siting decisions to be socialized, so that all the ``little guys'' \nwill pick up the tab. In contrast, participant funding gives proper \nprice signals for new generator location, and it assures an \neconomically efficient level of grid expansion.\n  I realize this amendment is generating quite a bit of discussion; \nhowever, electricity transmission policy is not a popularity contest, \nit is about making tough but fair decisions. The electricity debate \nreminds me of something that Mark Twain once said: ``Whenever you find \nyourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and \nreflect.''\n  I therefore ask my fellow colleagues to pause for a moment and \nreflect over the content of this amendment, what it has meant to the \nnatural gas industry and what it will mean for our economic prosperity \nin the future. Let's work together in an equitable manner toward \nbuilding efficient and reliable electrical highways by adopting this \namendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I ask unanimous consent that my \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMurkowski be recognized to offer a second-degree amendment to the \nBingaman amendment relating to grandfathering; that there be 1 hour \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form, with no amendment in \norder thereto prior to a vote in relation to the amendment; that upon \nthe use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelation to the amendment; that if the Murkowski amendment is defeated, \nit be in order for Senator Collins to offer an amendment relating to \nrenewables with 20 minutes for debate prior to a vote in relation to \nthat amendment, with the time equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form; that the Collins amendment be considered following \nconsideration of the Kyl amendment, which is a second-degree amendment \nrelating to ``opt out,'' on which there will be 20 minutes for debate \nprior to a vote in relation to the amendment, with the time equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form; that upon disposition of the \namendments covered under this agreement, the Senate proceed to vote on \nthe Bingaman amendment, as amended, if amended, without any intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is a possibility of four votes \ntonight. The two managers are aware of this. They are going to do the \nbest they can. Everybody should be aware, these are complicated issues \nand pay attention to this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3052 to Amendment No. 3016\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3052 to amendment No. 3016.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n           (Purpose: To protect State portfolio requirements)\n\n       On page 6, on line 6, strike ``mix.'' and insert ``mix. The \n     provisions of this section shall not apply to any retail \n     electric supplier in any State that adopts or has adopted a \n     renewable energy portfolio program.''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the amendment I have proposed would \nexempt the retail electric suppliers in any State that has a renewable \nenergy portfolio requirement.\n  What we have behind us is a chart that I think fairly identifies the \nissue. This chart shows States where renewable portfolio standards \nwould be preempted by a Federal mandate. In other words, by this \ncurrent proposal in the underlying Bingaman amendment, all States would \nbe mandated for a renewable contribution of about 10 percent, without \nexception.\n  What does this do? We have 14 States that already have initiated \nrenewable mandates because they believed it was in the best interest of \ntheir State. We have seven other States--these are the orange States--\nthat are in the process of considering renewable portfolio standards. \nWhat are those States? We have Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. \nWe have Hawaii, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada. Then, of course, we have \nMinnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin. We have the west coast.\n  The point is, 14 States have a program now. Again, they are Arizona, \nConnecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, \nNevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. \nThen there are seven States shown on the chart which are considering a \nprogram: California, Maryland, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oregon, \nWashington, Vermont.\n  What does this really mean? This means the renewable mandate, the \nBingaman amendment, would preempt those 14 States and the other 7 \nStates identified with a program which would basically disallow them \nfrom going forward. They would not have a choice; they would be \nmandated.\n  Most, if not all, of these States' programs, in my opinion, are \ninconsistent with the renewable mandate in the Bingaman amendment. \nThese 14 existing State programs were created on one simple premise--\nand I would encourage Members who are watching and staffs to recognize \nthis--that purpose was to match the State's needs and to take into \naccount local circumstances.\n\n  Each State is different. Each State has an opportunity to consider \nprograms that match their needs and match their levels of capability. \nSome States may be able to achieve more in the area of renewability. Is \nit their business to necessarily sell credits?\n  What we are trying to do is encourage across the board greater \nutilization of renewables. What is wrong with a voluntary system? \nFourteen existing State programs were created to match their State \nneeds and to take into account local circumstances.\n  As we know, some States are richer than others in wind energy \nsources. Some States are richer in geothermal. Other States have the \npotential of biomass. Some States have the potential of hydro. States \nhave tailored their renewable programs, through their own initiative, \nto match their local resources with their local needs.\n  We are going to take that away because we are coming down, as the \nBingaman amendment indicates, with a one-size-fits-all Federal program. \nIn other words, it is not good enough for the States to address their \nresponsibility and seek within the State's initiative how to reach a \nrenewable mandate.\n  It applies the same to Maine as it does in Texas, and clearly the \nStates are different. They are in different climate locales. They are \nin different parts of the country. I do not have to explain the \ndifferences. But this would mandate one size fits all.\n  The amendment exempts retail electric suppliers in any State that \nadopts or has adopted a renewable energy program. So it exempts retail \nelectric suppliers in any State that has adopted a renewable energy \nprogram. This allows existing State programs to continue, and it allows \nStates to adopt a program in the future. That is the purpose of our \namendment.\n  Now, if a State fails to act, then it will be subject to the \nrequirements of the Bingaman amendment. So you are forcing a mandate, \nin a sense, that if they do not take the initiative and act themselves, \nthen they fall under the Bingaman amendment, which is a mandate.\n  This allows for the existing 14 States, it allows for the 7 that are \nin the process of considering it, and then it gives the others an \noption to initiate a renewable program, but if they do not, they fall \nunder the mandate.\n\n[[Page S2226]]\n\n  It seems to me if we value States rights, if we recognize one size \ndoes not fit all, there is certainly justification for consideration of \nthe merits of a State initiating a program that it sees fit in relation \nto the conscious effort to try to encourage more renewables, but where \na State moves forward, this amendment allows that State effort to \ncontinue. It seems to me this is a practical, realistic, sensible \napproach that gives the States an opportunity to address their \nresponsibility towards encouraging renewables by their own initiative, \nwhich the 14 States clearly have done, and 7 others are in the process \nof initiating that action.\n  I encourage Members to reflect on the value of State rights and on \nthe value of this particular effort not only working but the States \ninitiating an action to address a need and fill it.\n  Before we get carried away in the debate, again I want to recognize \nsomething I think has been overlooked rather dramatically, and that is \nthere is a cost associated with renewables. We went into that a little \nbit in the debate over the Kyl amendment. But if we take a hypothetical \nutility, let us say, that generates a billion kilowatt hours and there \nis the 10-percent mandate on renewable portfolio standards, that is 100 \nmillion kilowatt hours of renewable energy, times 3 cents per kilowatt, \nwhich is about the--well, the average price is generally considered \nroughly 3 cents--that is $3 million for renewable credits. Now that is \na cost that is going to be passed on to the ratepayer--$3 million for \nrequiring a 10-percent mandate.\n\n  Let's look at a typical utility. Let's look at Wisconsin Electric: \nRetail sales over the year 2000, about 3,173,000,000 kilowatt hours, \ntimes a 10-percent renewable portfolio standard; that is 317,331,000 \nkilowatt hours of renewables. That is what they are going to have to \nget into Wisconsin, times 3 cents per kilowatt hour; that is $9.5 \nmillion, the cost of renewable credits that is going to be passed on to \nthe ratepayer in Wisconsin.\n  The current wholesale price, as I have indicated, is roughly 3 cents \nper kilowatt hour. So make no mistake about it, not only have we \nalready mandated an increase to the utility consumers in this country \nby the 10-percent mandate that prevailed when the Kyl amendment failed \nbut now we are mandating one size fits all. We are taking a relatively \norderly program that the States initiated, where 14 States actually \nhave renewable programs and 7 States are looking at those programs and \nsaying, everybody is going to have a renewable program that meets the \n10-percent standard set in the underlying bill. It does not allow the \nStates that are not addressing it an alternative other than than a \nmandate of 10 percent.\n  As a consequence, I don't think this is the best way to legislate a \nportfolio renewable standard by the theory of one size fits all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment the Senator from Alaska has offered. The amendment \nessentially guts the renewable portfolio standard contained in the \namendment I proposed. The amendment I proposed has a provision called \nState savings clause that reads:\n\n       This section does not preclude a State from requiring \n     additional renewable energy generation in that State or from \n     specifying technology mix.\n\n  Any State that wants to step up and do something more, or specify the \ntechnology mix appropriate for their State, is encouraged. It is not \ndiscouraged. It will control.\n  That is not what the amendment of the Senator is proposing.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Could I ask a question?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am curious. In the statement of the Senator from New \nMexico that a State could go beyond, is the Senator suggesting it would \ngo beyond the 10-percent norm? They could do anything above it but have \nto meet the 10 percent?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In response to my colleague, that is exactly right. \nThey can do anything in addition in the way of requiring renewable \nenergy generation and they can specify any technology mix they want. \nThere is nothing in the Federal law restricting a State in this regard.\n  If I may continue.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I don't want to interrupt.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. You are interrupting, but go right ahead.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If a State were 5 percent, it would be mandated to go \n10 percent. If another State were 12, it could set anything it wanted; \nis that correct?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The Senator is correct in that a renewable portfolio \nstandard that is not as effective as the one we are proposing would not \nmeet the Federal standard and would not be adequate. The Federal \nstandard would still prevail.\n  I point out what the amendment of the Senator says:\n\n       The provisions of this section--\n\n  That would be this renewable portfolio standard we had the vote on \nearlier with the Kyl amendment----\n\n     shall not apply to any retail electric supplier in any State \n     that adopts or has adopted a renewable portfolio energy \n     program.\n\n  He then cites a variety of States that are on the chart that have \nadopted these renewable energy portfolio programs. He has included New \nMexico on the chart. We have no renewable energy portfolio program in \nour State. We adopted one and suspended it for 6 years, but it is on \nthe chart as a State qualifying to be exempt from the Federal program. \nHe has included Illinois. I have a description that says on June 22, \n2001, Illinois Governor George Ryan signed legislation creating the \nIllinois Resource Development and Energy Security Act. The legislation \nstates, as an explicit goal, at least 5 percent of the State's energy \nproduction and use derive from renewable forms of energy by 2015 and 15 \npercent from renewable sources of energy by 2020.\n  However, it does not include an implementation schedule. There is \nnothing in the Illinois-passed law that will actually get them to the \nstated goal. They have adopted a renewable portfolio program under the \ndefinition of his amendment, but it has no teeth.\n\n  The summary on the Nebraska program he cites says in April of 1998 \nthe Lincoln Electric System created a wind power green pricing program \ncalled the Lincoln Electric System Renewable Energy Program. It is a \ngreen pricing program and does not require them to make available \nrenewable power in any way. It says they should give an option when \npeople pay their bill for so-called green pricing.\n  The point is, if we want to have a national program to deal with the \nnational electric grid we have talked about for several weeks, and we \nwant to move this country in the direction of using renewable energy to \na greater extent than in the past, we have to go ahead and maintain \nthis renewable portfolio standard we proposed in the bill.\n  To say any State that wants to can adopt something, set a goal or put \nin a program, suspend it for 6 years, as in New Mexico, and thereby \nsatisfy that State from being out from under the requirements of the \nlaw, totally guts the effect of the law. This is essentially another \nvote like the vote we had with the Kyl amendment. The Kyl amendment \nsaid renewable power shall be made available to customers to the extent \nit is available.\n  This amendment says States will comply with the renewable portfolio \nstandard in this bill, except to the extent they determine to do \nsomething else.\n  We cannot let them off the hook on that basis. Either we favor a \nrenewable portfolio standard--and I believe a majority of the Senate \ndoes; that is what the Kyl vote was an indication of; the majority of \nthe Senate believes we should require this modest commitment to \nrenewable energy--either we do that or we do not.\n  To say any State that adopts anything that they call a renewable \nportfolio program is out from under any requirement clearly guts the \neffort we are making. I strongly oppose the amendment and hope we \ndefeat the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from New \nMexico pointing out the status in his particular State. I wonder if \nIllinois and New Mexico suspended their programs,\n\n[[Page S2227]]\n\nI wonder if they did so primarily because they thought suspension was \nnot in the best interests of the consumers in their State. I don't know \nthe reason. I certainly look forward to an explanation from my friend \nfrom New Mexico if, indeed, there is one relative to why the State of \nNew Mexico saw fit to suspend it.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am glad to respond.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In the case of New Mexico, the renewable portfolio was \nincluded in a much larger deregulation proposal the State adopted \nbefore the difficulties in California. Once the difficulties in \nCalifornia became evident with supplies of electricity there, our \nlegislature got concerned and essentially put on hold and suspended any \neffect of the entire statute until the year 2006, when they said they \nwould look at it again.\n  The renewable portfolio standard, which obviously is not in any way \nrelated to the issue of deregulation that they were struggling with in \nCalifornia, was a casualty of the concern. I am not disagreeing with \nthe decision of our legislature to put off the deregulation, but I \nthink they made an error in putting off the effort to move toward a \nrenewable portfolio standard. Clearly, though, they are counted in what \nthe Senator has in mind in his amendment as having a program in New \nMexico, even though it is suspended until the year 2006.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am happy to respond. I will not speak \nwith the expertise that obviously my friend has from his own State, but \nit is appropriate to recognize they have not initiated an action in the \nsense of most of the other 14 States. The Senator from New Mexico \nindicates Illinois and Nebraska. I cannot speak for Nebraska, \nobviously; the occupant of the chair can. Clearly, there are some \nStates out of the 14 that have initiated the program on their own. That \nis great. That should be encouraged. Texas is certainly one.\n  There may be a misunderstanding between the Senator from New Mexico \nand myself as to what happens under the current legislation with our \namendment if it prevails relative to the States that are blank on the \nchart.\n  The blank States are the ones in white. They have to comply with the \n10 percent that is in the Bingaman bill. They have to mandate, if you \nwill, that they come up with 10 percent. So they are not left out. This \nis not a gutting, by any means, of the crux of Senator Bingaman's \npoint.\n  We are saying all the rest of those States, more than half the States \nin the Nation that have not initiated a renewable program, have to do \nit. They are going to be mandated under the 10-percent mandate. So do \nnot be misled, as I think a reference was made, that somehow we are \ngutting this provision because we are not. Those States would be \nmandated in. But they would also be given an opportunity to come up, as \nthe States in green and the States in red are, with what they believe \nis a reasonable, attainable renewable mandate.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I want to make one more point before I respond to my \nfriend from New Mexico.\n  A State with a 10-percent mandate, they say, on hydro, would now have \nto also meet an additional 10 percent--OK? An additional 10 percent, \nwith something new: solar, wind--whatever, under the Federal mandate.\n  I think the States ought to take a look at this. The Federal \nGovernment is dictating a 10-percent fuel mix, regardless of your State \nprogram.\n  I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me ask this of my friend: The way I \nread his amendment, it says any State--this provision does not apply to \nany retail electric supplier in any State that adopts or has adopted a \nrenewable portfolio, energy portfolio program.\n  Am I correct that a State that is one of the white States on this \nmap, that they do not have a program right now--if they decide to adopt \na program which says instead of going to 10 percent, we will go to one-\ntenth of 1 percent by the year 2020--that certainly is a renewable \nportfolio program in every sense of the word--they would be out from \nany other requirements because they will have adopted a program, a \nrenewable portfolio program under his amendment and, therefore, our \neffort to move them in any meaningful way to use renewable power would \nbe thwarted? Would he agree with that?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond, I think we have to make a general \nacknowledgment that States are responsible. Their utility commissions \nare responsible. Their ratepayers are responsible. They are going to \nrespond as they see fit to the needs of their people as opposed to what \nthe Senator from New Mexico is proposing as a mandate--everything is \nequal.\n  It is not equal. It is not equal in my State. It is not equal in \nHawaii. We are not even connected to the continental United States. Yet \nthere is a mandate here. Hawaii has to come across the same way as \nAlaska, the same way as Iowa.\n  I think to suggest that a State would be irresponsible is selling \nshort the American citizen.\n  People are concerned about energy sources. They are concerned about \npollution. I do not think any State is going to stand by for \nirresponsible actions, or a percentage that would suggest an \nunrealistic contribution to renewables.\n  Who are we to stand here and simply mandate that everybody has to be \nthe same? What we have recognized is realistic. We said all those \nStates in white--how many of them are left? Probably 35. They will be \nmandated under the bill of the Senator from New Mexico, 10 percent. \nThey are uniform. We are giving them a chance to initiate an \ninitiative based on their own recognition of what is responsible, what \nis attainable, what is available.\n\n  We have a terrible inconsistency. Some States have the convenience--\nand it is very convenient--of the renewable hydro. But under this \nproposal, a State with a 20 percent mandate based on hydro would now \nhave to also meet an additional 10 percent with solar or wind, under \nthe Federal mandate. The Federal Government is dictating a 10-percent \nfuel mix, regardless of the State program. This is ignoring the State \nprogram.\n  The Senator from New Mexico says it is OK if you go above a mandate \nwith your State program--that's OK.\n  It is one size fits all, 10 percent, make no mistake about it.\n  This one says, if you are a white State, you can initiate a program \nthat meets your needs and makes a contribution. I think that is \nresponsible legislation. I do not think it is gutting the renewable \npackage because if a State doesn't want to do it, it is going to be \nforced to do it. But the States that have initiated a program, let's \nhonor that.\n  There is nothing magic about 10 percent. Where did they get 10 \npercent? Why isn't it 8 or 9? Why isn't it 11?\n  We said it is 10 percent, that is why it is 10 percent. Some States \nare saying it should be 6 percent. It should be 5 percent. Some States \ndo better than 10 percent. Some States have hydro. Yet we are not \nrecognizing hydro in this.\n  I suggest Members think a little bit about this. They are going to \nhave to go home and face not only the ratepayers, they are going to \nhave to face their utility commissioners and people are going to say: \nSo one size fits all? You made a mandate in Washington. You are going \nto take away the initiative of our own program.\n  The suggestion that States would act irresponsibly I find \nunacceptable. If utility commissioners and those responsible for \ndecisions act irresponsibly, they are voted out by the local process.\n  What does Maine have? Maine has 30 percent renewables. They have \nhydro. What about that which comes in from Canada? You can buy power \nfrom Canada. I assume we can buy credits from Canada as well. I think \nwe have addressed some in the technical amendments, that we address the \nissue of buying credits outside the United States?\n  My friend from New Mexico has indicated we are going to, I think, \nagree to prohibit purchase of credits, say, from the Chinese, who are \nbuilding the Three Gorges Dam, or the Canadians. These, in my opinion, \nare significant aspects that have been overlooked in this bill. The \nreason they were overlooked is we have not had an opportunity to go \nthrough the committee\n\n[[Page S2228]]\n\nprocess because, as you know, this bill came directly to the floor.\n  So do not be misled that somehow we are getting the renewable \nprogram. Everybody gets it, under my amendment--everybody. The existing \nStates have to maintain it, whatever they believe is their level. The \nStates in red that are generating an interest in it are going to have \nto, and the rest of them, if they do not do anything, are going to have \nto come under Senator Bingaman's mandate.\n  In my State we have a long winter. In some areas it is pretty hard to \nget running water, so hydro doesn't necessarily carry it. We dare not \ntread on ANWR around here because that is sacred.\n  Nevertheless, we have a situation that I hope Members and staff will \nrecognize. This is not by any means gutting. This is a responsible \neffort to address, if you will, the initiatives of States to set their \nown level.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the two sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes, the Senator from New Mexico, 23 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak for just a few minutes on \nthis issue. I don't believe I will need a full 22 minutes. Let me put \nit in context.\n  The reason we believe it is important to include in this legislation \na renewable portfolio standard is that we believe it is important that \nthe Nation have a diverse group of sources--a diverse supply for its \nenergy needs. We are headed in the future to a situation where that \ndiversity is not present to the extent it should be.\n  I have shown this chart many times. We spent nearly a week on the Kyl \namendment. This is essentially the same issue coming back in another \nform. Let me show the chart again.\n  You can see that in the year 2000 we are providing about 69 percent \nof our total energy needs from two sources; that is, from coal and \nnatural gas. A lot of new generation is under construction around the \ncountry. We have a lot of new generation that is expected and planned \nfor, and 95 percent of that new electric generation that is currently \nplanned is planned to be gas fired. It is going to be using more \nnatural gas. We have a problem with that in that today we are not \nproducing as much natural gas as we are consuming. The disparity \nbetween what we are producing and what we are consuming is going to \ngrow. It is continuing to grow.\n  We are saying let us hedge our bets as a nation. Let us try to \nencourage utilities to develop some renewable energy sources. We give \nthem a wide variety that they can pursue. But do something in this \nregard. We are saying in the amendment I have at the desk, try to do 1 \npercent in the year 2005. That is what we have in the bill. Try to do \n1.6 percent in the year 2006. We have very small increments after that.\n  The whole idea is that by the year 2020 we would try to do 10 percent \nof their total generation from one or more of these various sources.\n  We specifically provide in the legislation that it is up to the \nStates to decide the right mix. It is up to the individual utility. The \nindividual utility can decide what the right mix is. We are not trying \nin any way to dictate that.\n  There are some States that have stepped up and are doing something \nuseful. Texas is the most successful. They have a very credible \nprogram. Then-Governor Bush--President Bush now--signed that into law. \nIt has moved that State very significantly towards the use of renewable \nresources. I think they are being held up as a model by many experts \nfor what we ought to see around the country.\n  We are not saying everyone has to do as much as Texas. We are saying \nlet us do as much as we have in this amendment.\n  We have all sorts of flexibility about how they get from here to \nthere. There are some States that produce more than the 10 percent from \nrenewable resources. There are States that have adopted programs that \nwill get them to a higher level than the 10 percent. More power to \nthem. We do not do anything to discourage that. We want to discourage \nthe opportunity for States to essentially give this lip service and not \nreally do anything.\n  We want to encourage the opportunity for States to do as Illinois has \ndone. Illinois has a great goal. They say: We want to be at 5 percent. \nWe want to be at 15 percent. That is wonderful. But they do not have \nany teeth in their bill.\n  New Mexico has a good goal. I cannot recall exactly what the goal is. \nBut we just suspended the goal until the year 2006 because of other \nconsiderations that had nothing to do with the renewable portfolio \nstandard issue.\n  The majority of the Senate favors having a renewable portfolio \nstandard. Let us do it. Let us keep this provision in the law.\n  The Senator's amendment would, in my strong opinion, gut the \nrenewable portfolio standard. It says if you have adopted any other \nprogram that you can call a renewable energy portfolio program, it \ndoesn't matter how much teeth there is in it, or standard. If you \nadopted anything, you are exempt. If you haven't adopted anything, then \nyou need to adopt something in order to be exempt. We are not telling \nyou what it has to be. We are just saying it has so be something. If \nyou adopt anything, you are exempt.\n  That is a gutting of the provision, in my opinion. Clearly, that is \nnot what I believe the majority of the Senate wants to do.\n  I strongly oppose the amendment by the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish the occupant of the chair, the \nformer Governor, could join us in this debate. He may have some \nopinion.\n  I remind my colleagues that ordinarily we do not practice dentistry \nhere, and the reference to teeth in the bill may have an application. \nBut I have to go back to my firm belief in the government being closest \nto the people as usually the government that is most responsive.\n  I fail to acknowledge that if we don't adopt this mandate, we are \nsomehow being irresponsible. I think the way we have crafted this \nsecond degree is, again, not by any means an opportunity for the States \nto opt out. On the other hand, if they don't develop a program, they \nare going to be mandated in. Let there be no mistake about it. All \nthose States on the chart in white are going to be mandated to meet the \n10-percent renewable requirement.\n  Talk about teeth in the bill. I think those are teeth. They are \nsaying if the States don't take the initiative to do it, you are going \nto have to do it.\n  The Senator from New Mexico says the majority wants a renewable \nmandate. Every State in the Union is going to be affected and, in \neffect, mandated because those in the white will have to come up with a \nprogram. Those in the red and green are already initiating programs.\n  I think the generalization of my friend from New Mexico is a little \nmisleading. All States are going to be mandated in one form or another, \neither by the fact that they don't have a program or the fact that they \ndo have one. If they want to drop this program, such as the State of \nNew Mexico did, they are going to be mandated into a program--a 10-\npercent mandate.\n  I hope I am making myself clear. Some are going to be left out of \nthis. Everybody is going to have to have a renewable program. The only \ndifference is, under my proposal the States affected clearly would have \nsome flexibility.\n  If it is up to the States to decide what the renewable mix should \nbe--I say if it is up to those States--why not let them choose the \nlevel of their renewable?\n  Does the Senate believe it knows better than the States to do what is \ncost effective and appropriate given the States' renewable resources?\n  As I have said, the Midwest has wind. The East may have biomass. The \nSouthwest may have solar and geothermal. Different levels are cost \neffective.\n  As we practice dentistry around here, and recognize that the \nallegation has been made that there is no teeth in this, there is teeth \nin my proposal. There is plenty of teeth in it. Nobody has opted out. \nWhat I think we have in this proposal is some false teeth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I inquire, does the Senator have about \n1 minute I could take?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes are remaining.\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to take 1 minute.\n\n[[Page S2229]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Go ahead and take 2.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I support the amendment of the Senator from Alaska. \nClearly, those States that have moved forward with the program for \nrenewable resources to generate electricity have made a determination \nover a period of time about what they can best do in their particular \nStates and what is in the best interest of their consumers.\n  It seems to me, since they have taken the trouble to do that, and \nthey have done a lot of work on it, that it would be wrong for us--at \nleast premature for us--to come in as the Federal Government and say: \nNo. No. We know what is best for you. Even though we have not had any \nhearings, we have not had any markup in the committee, we are doing \nthis all on the floor of the Senate, we instinctively know what is best \nfor your State. That is really a supreme arrogance, even for the U.S. \nSenate.\n  So what the Senator from Alaska is saying is, look, for those States \nthat have already chosen to do this, let them run their programs the \nway they want to, and even for those States that chose to do so in the \nfuture.\n  This really satisfies the argument that those on the other side have \nmade that we need to do something--they use the words--``to encourage'' \nStates to use renewables. A mandate is a lot more than an \nencouragement, but be that as it may, for those that have already \nchosen to do it, they have been encouraged. Let's recognize that and \nacknowledge their programs and accept them as they are. And, perhaps, \nfor the rest of the States, our mandatory program will encourage them \nas well. They, then, should be allowed to move forward with the \nprograms as they see fit.\n  So given the fact the Kyl amendment was defeated before--and I accept \nthat--it seems to me this is a very good compromise, in effect, that \nrecognizes what the other side wants: to make the States have some kind \nof a program, but it also provides them flexibility in recognition of \nthe unique circumstances of their individual States.\n  I think it is a good compromise. I think the Senator from Alaska \nshould be complimented for it. I certainly support his amendment and \nhope others will as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. All of that is in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am informed that Senator Jeffords \nwants to speak in opposition. I also want to speak for another couple \nminutes, but I would like to do that after him. I would have to suggest \nthe absence of a quorum at this time in order to preserve his right to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We have had a few requests for time from Senators who \nwould like to catch airplanes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I assume time runs against me during the quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time would run against the Senator.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me be very brief. I will speak for a \ncouple minutes and then yield back the remainder of our time. I am \ninformed Senator Jeffords will not be arriving in time to speak prior \nto this vote.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge Senators to oppose this Murkowski \namendment. It does, in my strong opinion, gut the underlying provision \nwhich we have been debating now for the last several days.\n  The renewable portfolio standard that we have in the amendment I have \nsent to the desk requires certain things from utility companies over \nthe next 18 years, between now and the year 2020. We all understand \nthat.\n  What the Murkowski amendment says is that any utility located in any \nState that has something else in the way of a renewable portfolio \nprogram, no matter how weak it is, is exempt from the Federal \nrequirement. It also says that if you are in a State that does not have \nanything, the State can adopt anything, no matter how weak. And then \nutilities in that State are also exempt. So it is very clear that his \namendment does eliminate any meaningful mandate on utilities anywhere \nin the country.\n  I strongly urge Senators to oppose the Murkowski amendment. It would \ngut our renewable portfolio provision. For that reason, I think it \nshould be defeated.\n  Mr. President, I know of nobody else on our side who wishes to speak \nin opposition. So I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3052. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi), the \nSenator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Spector), the Senator from Alaska (Mr. \nStevens), and the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Thurmond), are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 39, nays 57, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 58 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--39\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--57\n\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Enzi\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n  The amendment (No. 3052) was rejected.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I see several of the interested parties are \nhere, and I do want to propound unanimous consent requests on a couple \nof issues.\n  I had hoped we would be able to reach agreement to move on the debt \nceiling before the Senate went out of session. It appears that we are \nnot going to be able to do that. I think we should.\n  Also, I had the impression we were going to try to do the Andean \ntrade bill before we left. The President is on his way to Mexico, and \nhe is going to Peru. The Andean countries feel very strongly about this \nissue and have said it is not only a trade issue, but has become a very \nserious political issue.\n  I would like for us to do these two things, and I will propound \nunanimous consent requests on both. Is there a preference as to which \none I do first? I will propound the Andean request first.\n\n[[Page S2230]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2223-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2223-S2230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL LABORATORIES PARTNERSHIP IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001--continued\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

PARTICIPANT-FUNDED INVESTMENT.\n\n       Section 205 of the Federal Power Act is amended by \n     inserting after subsection (h) the following:\n       ``(i) Transmission expansion costs.--\n       ``(1) Rates for transmission expansion.--\n       Upon the request of a Regional Transmission Organization, \n     or any transmission entity operating within an RTO that is \n     authorized by the Commission, the Commission shall authorize \n     the recovery of costs on a participant-funding basis of \n     transmission facilities that increase the transfer capability \n     of the transmission system. The Commission shall not \n     authorize the recovery of costs in rates on a rolled-in basis \n     for such transmission facilities unless the Commission finds \n     that, based upon substantial evidence--\n       ``(A) the transmission investment is identified and \n     incorporated in the regional transmission plan of a FERC \n     approved regional transmission organization;\n       ``(B) participant funding for the investment is not \n     feasible because the beneficiaries of the investment cannot \n     be identified; and\n       ``(C) the transmission investment is necessary to maintain \n     reliability of the transmission grid within the area covered \n     by the regional transmission organization.\n       ``(2) Participant-funding.--The term `participant-funding' \n     means an investment in the transmission system of a regional \n     transmission organization or any Commission authorized entity \n     operating with the RTO that--\n       ``(A) increases the transfer capability of the transmission \n     system; and\n       ``(B) is paid for by an entity that, in return for payment, \n     receives the tradable transmission rights created by the \n     investment.\n       ``(3) Tradable transmission right.--The term `tradable \n     transmission right' means the right of the holder of such \n     right to avoid payment of, or have rebated, transmission \n     congestion charges on the transmission system of a regional \n     transmission organization, or the right to use a specified \n     capacity of such transmission system without payment of \n     transmission congestion charges.\n       ``(4) Regional transmission organization facilitation.--\n       ``(A) In general.--To encourage the regional transmission \n     organization or any Commission-authorized transmission entity \n     operating within the RTO to identify participant-funded \n     investment, the Commission shall allow a regional \n     transmission organization or any entity constructing a \n     participant funded project within the RTO to--\n       ``(i) receive a share of the value of the tradable \n     transmission rights created by the participant-funded \n     expansion; or\n       ``(ii) receive a development fee.''.\n\n  Mrs. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, many years ago Arnold Glasow said that \n``all some folks want is their fair share--and yours.''\n  Today, I rise to offer an amendment that provides for true fairness \nin electricity pricing and in doing so paves the way for much needed \ntransmission expansion at a national level.\n  Over the past 10 years demand for electricity has increased 17 \npercent while transmission investment during the same period has \ncontinuously declined about 45 percent.\n  What is even more troubling is that current demand for electricity is \nprojected to increase by 25 percent over the next 10 years with only a \nmodest increase in transmission capacity of 4 percent. With projected \ndemand exceeding projected additional capacity five times over, \nproblems seem imminent.\n  It is no surprise to this Senator that in recent years electricity \nshortages due to transmission constraints have plagued the country from \none coast to another and various points in between. Unless we deviate \nimmediately from the past ways of doing business, our economy will be \nheld hostage to transmission constraints with rolling blackouts \nbecoming the norm rather than the exception.\n  Our existing electrical transmission system was designed to serve \nlocal customers from utility-owned generation on a State-by-State \nbasis. However, in recent years more and more ``merchant generation'' \noperated by independent companies have begun to connect to the \nelectrical grid in order to transmit electricity to local as well as \nout-of-region customers.\n  Though this increased generation added much needed competition, it \nbegan to strain the current transmission system. The pricing mechanism \nat the wholesale level still employs the old socialized rate method of \ncontinuously increasing the rates for local customers even though most \nof the beneficiaries are out-of-region customers. This antiquated \npricing method has dampened the push to enhance transmission capacity \nin energy producing States as State regulators are reluctant to pass \nexcessive transmission cost off to local customers who are not \nbenefitting from the electricity. Meanwhile energy dependent regions of \nthe country are denied cheap and reliable electricity.\n  Electricity price spikes in the Midwest during the summer of 1998 \nwere caused in part by transmission constraints limiting the ability of \nthe region to import electricity from other regions of the country. In \nthe summer of 2000, transmission constraints limited the ability to \nsell low-cost power from the Midwest to the South during a period of \npeak demand, resulting in higher prices for customers. Recent blackouts \nin northern California were the result of transmission constraints in \nsouthern California due to California's Path 15 transmission route. The \neast coast has also suffered from transmission constraints and price \nspikes in recent years.\n  Surely, there must be a more equitable way to allocate cost while \nsimultaneously enhancing our transmission capacity. It is not fair to \nexpect customers in energy generating States to keep paying for \ntransmission expansion when this increased transmission is primarily \nbeing developed for out-of-region use. In addition, the lack of \ntransmission capacity under this archaic pricing method continues to \ndeny customers in energy importing States the benefit of cheaper \nelectricity from other regions of the country.\n  The best policy for efficient competitive wholesale power markets is \n``participant-funded'' expansion. In this system, market participants \n``fund'' expansions to the transmission network in return for the \ntransmission rights created by the expansion investment. This approach \ngives proper economic incentive for new generator location and \ntransmission expansion decisions.\n  In the new world, the numbers and volumes of interstate transactions \nare large and growing every day. In my home State of Louisiana, there \nare enough new merchant generation plants planned to almost double the \namount of generation in the State today.\n  Those who favor socializing these costs may argue that ``rolled in \npricing is ok because transmission is such a small part of a consumer's \ntotal bill.'' This was true in the past but not anymore. If we must \nbuild enough transmission to export just a portion of this new \ngeneration--10,000 megawatts--the estimated cost would be $2 billion to \n$4 billion. Louisiana's share of this cost would be $90 to $180 million \nper year, and impose a retail rate increase of 5 to 11 percent. All \nwith no significant benefit to local customers.\n  The opponents of this amendment argue that transmission upgrades may \nbe more expensive than the delivered power is worth. If it is too \nexpensive to build facilities to move the power, then the plant is \nbeing built in the wrong place. No one should bear these costs, least \nof all local consumers.\n  The developers need to take these costs into account when they site \ntheir plants--just like they consider gas costs, water costs, and \nenvironmental\n\n[[Page S2225]]\n\npermits. The participant funding concept is not new--this concept has \nbeen successfully implemented in the natural gas industry through \nincremental pricing. As a result of incremental pricing in the natural \ngas industry, proposed annual additions in 2002 to natural gas pipeline \ncapacity has increased by nearly 100 percent relative to 1999.\n\n  The opponents of this legislation want the risk and consequences of \nbad siting decisions to be socialized, so that all the ``little guys'' \nwill pick up the tab. In contrast, participant funding gives proper \nprice signals for new generator location, and it assures an \neconomically efficient level of grid expansion.\n  I realize this amendment is generating quite a bit of discussion; \nhowever, electricity transmission policy is not a popularity contest, \nit is about making tough but fair decisions. The electricity debate \nreminds me of something that Mark Twain once said: ``Whenever you find \nyourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and \nreflect.''\n  I therefore ask my fellow colleagues to pause for a moment and \nreflect over the content of this amendment, what it has meant to the \nnatural gas industry and what it will mean for our economic prosperity \nin the future. Let's work together in an equitable manner toward \nbuilding efficient and reliable electrical highways by adopting this \namendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I ask unanimous consent that my \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMurkowski be recognized to offer a second-degree amendment to the \nBingaman amendment relating to grandfathering; that there be 1 hour \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form, with no amendment in \norder thereto prior to a vote in relation to the amendment; that upon \nthe use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote in \nrelation to the amendment; that if the Murkowski amendment is defeated, \nit be in order for Senator Collins to offer an amendment relating to \nrenewables with 20 minutes for debate prior to a vote in relation to \nthat amendment, with the time equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form; that the Collins amendment be considered following \nconsideration of the Kyl amendment, which is a second-degree amendment \nrelating to ``opt out,'' on which there will be 20 minutes for debate \nprior to a vote in relation to the amendment, with the time equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form; that upon disposition of the \namendments covered under this agreement, the Senate proceed to vote on \nthe Bingaman amendment, as amended, if amended, without any intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is a possibility of four votes \ntonight. The two managers are aware of this. They are going to do the \nbest they can. Everybody should be aware, these are complicated issues \nand pay attention to this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3052 to Amendment No. 3016\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3052 to amendment No. 3016.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n           (Purpose: To protect State portfolio requirements)\n\n       On page 6, on line 6, strike ``mix.'' and insert ``mix. The \n     provisions of this section shall not apply to any retail \n     electric supplier in any State that adopts or has adopted a \n     renewable energy portfolio program.''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the amendment I have proposed would \nexempt the retail electric suppliers in any State that has a renewable \nenergy portfolio requirement.\n  What we have behind us is a chart that I think fairly identifies the \nissue. This chart shows States where renewable portfolio standards \nwould be preempted by a Federal mandate. In other words, by this \ncurrent proposal in the underlying Bingaman amendment, all States would \nbe mandated for a renewable contribution of about 10 percent, without \nexception.\n  What does this do? We have 14 States that already have initiated \nrenewable mandates because they believed it was in the best interest of \ntheir State. We have seven other States--these are the orange States--\nthat are in the process of considering renewable portfolio standards. \nWhat are those States? We have Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. \nWe have Hawaii, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada. Then, of course, we have \nMinnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin. We have the west coast.\n  The point is, 14 States have a program now. Again, they are Arizona, \nConnecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, \nNevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin. \nThen there are seven States shown on the chart which are considering a \nprogram: California, Maryland, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oregon, \nWashington, Vermont.\n  What does this really mean? This means the renewable mandate, the \nBingaman amendment, would preempt those 14 States and the other 7 \nStates identified with a program which would basically disallow them \nfrom going forward. They would not have a choice; they would be \nmandated.\n  Most, if not all, of these States' programs, in my opinion, are \ninconsistent with the renewable mandate in the Bingaman amendment. \nThese 14 existing State programs were created on one simple premise--\nand I would encourage Members who are watching and staffs to recognize \nthis--that purpose was to match the State's needs and to take into \naccount local circumstances.\n\n  Each State is different. Each State has an opportunity to consider \nprograms that match their needs and match their levels of capability. \nSome States may be able to achieve more in the area of renewability. Is \nit their business to necessarily sell credits?\n  What we are trying to do is encourage across the board greater \nutilization of renewables. What is wrong with a voluntary system? \nFourteen existing State programs were created to match their State \nneeds and to take into account local circumstances.\n  As we know, some States are richer than others in wind energy \nsources. Some States are richer in geothermal. Other States have the \npotential of biomass. Some States have the potential of hydro. States \nhave tailored their renewable programs, through their own initiative, \nto match their local resources with their local needs.\n  We are going to take that away because we are coming down, as the \nBingaman amendment indicates, with a one-size-fits-all Federal program. \nIn other words, it is not good enough for the States to address their \nresponsibility and seek within the State's initiative how to reach a \nrenewable mandate.\n  It applies the same to Maine as it does in Texas, and clearly the \nStates are different. They are in different climate locales. They are \nin different parts of the country. I do not have to explain the \ndifferences. But this would mandate one size fits all.\n  The amendment exempts retail electric suppliers in any State that \nadopts or has adopted a renewable energy program. So it exempts retail \nelectric suppliers in any State that has adopted a renewable energy \nprogram. This allows existing State programs to continue, and it allows \nStates to adopt a program in the future. That is the purpose of our \namendment.\n  Now, if a State fails to act, then it will be subject to the \nrequirements of the Bingaman amendment. So you are forcing a mandate, \nin a sense, that if they do not take the initiative and act themselves, \nthen they fall under the Bingaman amendment, which is a mandate.\n  This allows for the existing 14 States, it allows for the 7 that are \nin the process of considering it, and then it gives the others an \noption to initiate a renewable program, but if they do not, they fall \nunder the mandate.\n\n[[Page S2226]]\n\n  It seems to me if we value States rights, if we recognize one size \ndoes not fit all, there is certainly justification for consideration of \nthe merits of a State initiating a program that it sees fit in relation \nto the conscious effort to try to encourage more renewables, but where \na State moves forward, this amendment allows that State effort to \ncontinue. It seems to me this is a practical, realistic, sensible \napproach that gives the States an opportunity to address their \nresponsibility towards encouraging renewables by their own initiative, \nwhich the 14 States clearly have done, and 7 others are in the process \nof initiating that action.\n  I encourage Members to reflect on the value of State rights and on \nthe value of this particular effort not only working but the States \ninitiating an action to address a need and fill it.\n  Before we get carried away in the debate, again I want to recognize \nsomething I think has been overlooked rather dramatically, and that is \nthere is a cost associated with renewables. We went into that a little \nbit in the debate over the Kyl amendment. But if we take a hypothetical \nutility, let us say, that generates a billion kilowatt hours and there \nis the 10-percent mandate on renewable portfolio standards, that is 100 \nmillion kilowatt hours of renewable energy, times 3 cents per kilowatt, \nwhich is about the--well, the average price is generally considered \nroughly 3 cents--that is $3 million for renewable credits. Now that is \na cost that is going to be passed on to the ratepayer--$3 million for \nrequiring a 10-percent mandate.\n\n  Let's look at a typical utility. Let's look at Wisconsin Electric: \nRetail sales over the year 2000, about 3,173,000,000 kilowatt hours, \ntimes a 10-percent renewable portfolio standard; that is 317,331,000 \nkilowatt hours of renewables. That is what they are going to have to \nget into Wisconsin, times 3 cents per kilowatt hour; that is $9.5 \nmillion, the cost of renewable credits that is going to be passed on to \nthe ratepayer in Wisconsin.\n  The current wholesale price, as I have indicated, is roughly 3 cents \nper kilowatt hour. So make no mistake about it, not only have we \nalready mandated an increase to the utility consumers in this country \nby the 10-percent mandate that prevailed when the Kyl amendment failed \nbut now we are mandating one size fits all. We are taking a relatively \norderly program that the States initiated, where 14 States actually \nhave renewable programs and 7 States are looking at those programs and \nsaying, everybody is going to have a renewable program that meets the \n10-percent standard set in the underlying bill. It does not allow the \nStates that are not addressing it an alternative other than than a \nmandate of 10 percent.\n  As a consequence, I don't think this is the best way to legislate a \nportfolio renewable standard by the theory of one size fits all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment the Senator from Alaska has offered. The amendment \nessentially guts the renewable portfolio standard contained in the \namendment I proposed. The amendment I proposed has a provision called \nState savings clause that reads:\n\n       This section does not preclude a State from requiring \n     additional renewable energy generation in that State or from \n     specifying technology mix.\n\n  Any State that wants to step up and do something more, or specify the \ntechnology mix appropriate for their State, is encouraged. It is not \ndiscouraged. It will control.\n  That is not what the amendment of the Senator is proposing.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Could I ask a question?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am curious. In the statement of the Senator from New \nMexico that a State could go beyond, is the Senator suggesting it would \ngo beyond the 10-percent norm? They could do anything above it but have \nto meet the 10 percent?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In response to my colleague, that is exactly right. \nThey can do anything in addition in the way of requiring renewable \nenergy generation and they can specify any technology mix they want. \nThere is nothing in the Federal law restricting a State in this regard.\n  If I may continue.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I don't want to interrupt.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. You are interrupting, but go right ahead.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If a State were 5 percent, it would be mandated to go \n10 percent. If another State were 12, it could set anything it wanted; \nis that correct?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The Senator is correct in that a renewable portfolio \nstandard that is not as effective as the one we are proposing would not \nmeet the Federal standard and would not be adequate. The Federal \nstandard would still prevail.\n  I point out what the amendment of the Senator says:\n\n       The provisions of this section--\n\n  That would be this renewable portfolio standard we had the vote on \nearlier with the Kyl amendment----\n\n     shall not apply to any retail electric supplier in any State \n     that adopts or has adopted a renewable portfolio energy \n     program.\n\n  He then cites a variety of States that are on the chart that have \nadopted these renewable energy portfolio programs. He has included New \nMexico on the chart. We have no renewable energy portfolio program in \nour State. We adopted one and suspended it for 6 years, but it is on \nthe chart as a State qualifying to be exempt from the Federal program. \nHe has included Illinois. I have a description that says on June 22, \n2001, Illinois Governor George Ryan signed legislation creating the \nIllinois Resource Development and Energy Security Act. The legislation \nstates, as an explicit goal, at least 5 percent of the State's energy \nproduction and use derive from renewable forms of energy by 2015 and 15 \npercent from renewable sources of energy by 2020.\n  However, it does not include an implementation schedule. There is \nnothing in the Illinois-passed law that will actually get them to the \nstated goal. They have adopted a renewable portfolio program under the \ndefinition of his amendment, but it has no teeth.\n\n  The summary on the Nebraska program he cites says in April of 1998 \nthe Lincoln Electric System created a wind power green pricing program \ncalled the Lincoln Electric System Renewable Energy Program. It is a \ngreen pricing program and does not require them to make available \nrenewable power in any way. It says they should give an option when \npeople pay their bill for so-called green pricing.\n  The point is, if we want to have a national program to deal with the \nnational electric grid we have talked about for several weeks, and we \nwant to move this country in the direction of using renewable energy to \na greater extent than in the past, we have to go ahead and maintain \nthis renewable portfolio standard we proposed in the bill.\n  To say any State that wants to can adopt something, set a goal or put \nin a program, suspend it for 6 years, as in New Mexico, and thereby \nsatisfy that State from being out from under the requirements of the \nlaw, totally guts the effect of the law. This is essentially another \nvote like the vote we had with the Kyl amendment. The Kyl amendment \nsaid renewable power shall be made available to customers to the extent \nit is available.\n  This amendment says States will comply with the renewable portfolio \nstandard in this bill, except to the extent they determine to do \nsomething else.\n  We cannot let them off the hook on that basis. Either we favor a \nrenewable portfolio standard--and I believe a majority of the Senate \ndoes; that is what the Kyl vote was an indication of; the majority of \nthe Senate believes we should require this modest commitment to \nrenewable energy--either we do that or we do not.\n  To say any State that adopts anything that they call a renewable \nportfolio program is out from under any requirement clearly guts the \neffort we are making. I strongly oppose the amendment and hope we \ndefeat the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from New \nMexico pointing out the status in his particular State. I wonder if \nIllinois and New Mexico suspended their programs,\n\n[[Page S2227]]\n\nI wonder if they did so primarily because they thought suspension was \nnot in the best interests of the consumers in their State. I don't know \nthe reason. I certainly look forward to an explanation from my friend \nfrom New Mexico if, indeed, there is one relative to why the State of \nNew Mexico saw fit to suspend it.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am glad to respond.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In the case of New Mexico, the renewable portfolio was \nincluded in a much larger deregulation proposal the State adopted \nbefore the difficulties in California. Once the difficulties in \nCalifornia became evident with supplies of electricity there, our \nlegislature got concerned and essentially put on hold and suspended any \neffect of the entire statute until the year 2006, when they said they \nwould look at it again.\n  The renewable portfolio standard, which obviously is not in any way \nrelated to the issue of deregulation that they were struggling with in \nCalifornia, was a casualty of the concern. I am not disagreeing with \nthe decision of our legislature to put off the deregulation, but I \nthink they made an error in putting off the effort to move toward a \nrenewable portfolio standard. Clearly, though, they are counted in what \nthe Senator has in mind in his amendment as having a program in New \nMexico, even though it is suspended until the year 2006.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am happy to respond. I will not speak \nwith the expertise that obviously my friend has from his own State, but \nit is appropriate to recognize they have not initiated an action in the \nsense of most of the other 14 States. The Senator from New Mexico \nindicates Illinois and Nebraska. I cannot speak for Nebraska, \nobviously; the occupant of the chair can. Clearly, there are some \nStates out of the 14 that have initiated the program on their own. That \nis great. That should be encouraged. Texas is certainly one.\n  There may be a misunderstanding between the Senator from New Mexico \nand myself as to what happens under the current legislation with our \namendment if it prevails relative to the States that are blank on the \nchart.\n  The blank States are the ones in white. They have to comply with the \n10 percent that is in the Bingaman bill. They have to mandate, if you \nwill, that they come up with 10 percent. So they are not left out. This \nis not a gutting, by any means, of the crux of Senator Bingaman's \npoint.\n  We are saying all the rest of those States, more than half the States \nin the Nation that have not initiated a renewable program, have to do \nit. They are going to be mandated under the 10-percent mandate. So do \nnot be misled, as I think a reference was made, that somehow we are \ngutting this provision because we are not. Those States would be \nmandated in. But they would also be given an opportunity to come up, as \nthe States in green and the States in red are, with what they believe \nis a reasonable, attainable renewable mandate.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I want to make one more point before I respond to my \nfriend from New Mexico.\n  A State with a 10-percent mandate, they say, on hydro, would now have \nto also meet an additional 10 percent--OK? An additional 10 percent, \nwith something new: solar, wind--whatever, under the Federal mandate.\n  I think the States ought to take a look at this. The Federal \nGovernment is dictating a 10-percent fuel mix, regardless of your State \nprogram.\n  I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me ask this of my friend: The way I \nread his amendment, it says any State--this provision does not apply to \nany retail electric supplier in any State that adopts or has adopted a \nrenewable portfolio, energy portfolio program.\n  Am I correct that a State that is one of the white States on this \nmap, that they do not have a program right now--if they decide to adopt \na program which says instead of going to 10 percent, we will go to one-\ntenth of 1 percent by the year 2020--that certainly is a renewable \nportfolio program in every sense of the word--they would be out from \nany other requirements because they will have adopted a program, a \nrenewable portfolio program under his amendment and, therefore, our \neffort to move them in any meaningful way to use renewable power would \nbe thwarted? Would he agree with that?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond, I think we have to make a general \nacknowledgment that States are responsible. Their utility commissions \nare responsible. Their ratepayers are responsible. They are going to \nrespond as they see fit to the needs of their people as opposed to what \nthe Senator from New Mexico is proposing as a mandate--everything is \nequal.\n  It is not equal. It is not equal in my State. It is not equal in \nHawaii. We are not even connected to the continental United States. Yet \nthere is a mandate here. Hawaii has to come across the same way as \nAlaska, the same way as Iowa.\n  I think to suggest that a State would be irresponsible is selling \nshort the American citizen.\n  People are concerned about energy sources. They are concerned about \npollution. I do not think any State is going to stand by for \nirresponsible actions, or a percentage that would suggest an \nunrealistic contribution to renewables.\n  Who are we to stand here and simply mandate that everybody has to be \nthe same? What we have recognized is realistic. We said all those \nStates in white--how many of them are left? Probably 35. They will be \nmandated under the bill of the Senator from New Mexico, 10 percent. \nThey are uniform. We are giving them a chance to initiate an \ninitiative based on their own recognition of what is responsible, what \nis attainable, what is available.\n\n  We have a terrible inconsistency. Some States have the convenience--\nand it is very convenient--of the renewable hydro. But under this \nproposal, a State with a 20 percent mandate based on hydro would now \nhave to also meet an additional 10 percent with solar or wind, under \nthe Federal mandate. The Federal Government is dictating a 10-percent \nfuel mix, regardless of the State program. This is ignoring the State \nprogram.\n  The Senator from New Mexico says it is OK if you go above a mandate \nwith your State program--that's OK.\n  It is one size fits all, 10 percent, make no mistake about it.\n  This one says, if you are a white State, you can initiate a program \nthat meets your needs and makes a contribution. I think that is \nresponsible legislation. I do not think it is gutting the renewable \npackage because if a State doesn't want to do it, it is going to be \nforced to do it. But the States that have initiated a program, let's \nhonor that.\n  There is nothing magic about 10 percent. Where did they get 10 \npercent? Why isn't it 8 or 9? Why isn't it 11?\n  We said it is 10 percent, that is why it is 10 percent. Some States \nare saying it should be 6 percent. It should be 5 percent. Some States \ndo better than 10 percent. Some States have hydro. Yet we are not \nrecognizing hydro in this.\n  I suggest Members think a little bit about this. They are going to \nhave to go home and face not only the ratepayers, they are going to \nhave to face their utility commissioners and people are going to say: \nSo one size fits all? You made a mandate in Washington. You are going \nto take away the initiative of our own program.\n  The suggestion that States would act irresponsibly I find \nunacceptable. If utility commissioners and those responsible for \ndecisions act irresponsibly, they are voted out by the local process.\n  What does Maine have? Maine has 30 percent renewables. They have \nhydro. What about that which comes in from Canada? You can buy power \nfrom Canada. I assume we can buy credits from Canada as well. I think \nwe have addressed some in the technical amendments, that we address the \nissue of buying credits outside the United States?\n  My friend from New Mexico has indicated we are going to, I think, \nagree to prohibit purchase of credits, say, from the Chinese, who are \nbuilding the Three Gorges Dam, or the Canadians. These, in my opinion, \nare significant aspects that have been overlooked in this bill. The \nreason they were overlooked is we have not had an opportunity to go \nthrough the committee\n\n[[Page S2228]]\n\nprocess because, as you know, this bill came directly to the floor.\n  So do not be misled that somehow we are getting the renewable \nprogram. Everybody gets it, under my amendment--everybody. The existing \nStates have to maintain it, whatever they believe is their level. The \nStates in red that are generating an interest in it are going to have \nto, and the rest of them, if they do not do anything, are going to have \nto come under Senator Bingaman's mandate.\n  In my State we have a long winter. In some areas it is pretty hard to \nget running water, so hydro doesn't necessarily carry it. We dare not \ntread on ANWR around here because that is sacred.\n  Nevertheless, we have a situation that I hope Members and staff will \nrecognize. This is not by any means gutting. This is a responsible \neffort to address, if you will, the initiatives of States to set their \nown level.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the two sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes, the Senator from New Mexico, 23 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak for just a few minutes on \nthis issue. I don't believe I will need a full 22 minutes. Let me put \nit in context.\n  The reason we believe it is important to include in this legislation \na renewable portfolio standard is that we believe it is important that \nthe Nation have a diverse group of sources--a diverse supply for its \nenergy needs. We are headed in the future to a situation where that \ndiversity is not present to the extent it should be.\n  I have shown this chart many times. We spent nearly a week on the Kyl \namendment. This is essentially the same issue coming back in another \nform. Let me show the chart again.\n  You can see that in the year 2000 we are providing about 69 percent \nof our total energy needs from two sources; that is, from coal and \nnatural gas. A lot of new generation is under construction around the \ncountry. We have a lot of new generation that is expected and planned \nfor, and 95 percent of that new electric generation that is currently \nplanned is planned to be gas fired. It is going to be using more \nnatural gas. We have a problem with that in that today we are not \nproducing as much natural gas as we are consuming. The disparity \nbetween what we are producing and what we are consuming is going to \ngrow. It is continuing to grow.\n  We are saying let us hedge our bets as a nation. Let us try to \nencourage utilities to develop some renewable energy sources. We give \nthem a wide variety that they can pursue. But do something in this \nregard. We are saying in the amendment I have at the desk, try to do 1 \npercent in the year 2005. That is what we have in the bill. Try to do \n1.6 percent in the year 2006. We have very small increments after that.\n  The whole idea is that by the year 2020 we would try to do 10 percent \nof their total generation from one or more of these various sources.\n  We specifically provide in the legislation that it is up to the \nStates to decide the right mix. It is up to the individual utility. The \nindividual utility can decide what the right mix is. We are not trying \nin any way to dictate that.\n  There are some States that have stepped up and are doing something \nuseful. Texas is the most successful. They have a very credible \nprogram. Then-Governor Bush--President Bush now--signed that into law. \nIt has moved that State very significantly towards the use of renewable \nresources. I think they are being held up as a model by many experts \nfor what we ought to see around the country.\n  We are not saying everyone has to do as much as Texas. We are saying \nlet us do as much as we have in this amendment.\n  We have all sorts of flexibility about how they get from here to \nthere. There are some States that produce more than the 10 percent from \nrenewable resources. There are States that have adopted programs that \nwill get them to a higher level than the 10 percent. More power to \nthem. We do not do anything to discourage that. We want to discourage \nthe opportunity for States to essentially give this lip service and not \nreally do anything.\n  We want to encourage the opportunity for States to do as Illinois has \ndone. Illinois has a great goal. They say: We want to be at 5 percent. \nWe want to be at 15 percent. That is wonderful. But they do not have \nany teeth in their bill.\n  New Mexico has a good goal. I cannot recall exactly what the goal is. \nBut we just suspended the goal until the year 2006 because of other \nconsiderations that had nothing to do with the renewable portfolio \nstandard issue.\n  The majority of the Senate favors having a renewable portfolio \nstandard. Let us do it. Let us keep this provision in the law.\n  The Senator's amendment would, in my strong opinion, gut the \nrenewable portfolio standard. It says if you have adopted any other \nprogram that you can call a renewable energy portfolio program, it \ndoesn't matter how much teeth there is in it, or standard. If you \nadopted anything, you are exempt. If you haven't adopted anything, then \nyou need to adopt something in order to be exempt. We are not telling \nyou what it has to be. We are just saying it has so be something. If \nyou adopt anything, you are exempt.\n  That is a gutting of the provision, in my opinion. Clearly, that is \nnot what I believe the majority of the Senate wants to do.\n  I strongly oppose the amendment by the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish the occupant of the chair, the \nformer Governor, could join us in this debate. He may have some \nopinion.\n  I remind my colleagues that ordinarily we do not practice dentistry \nhere, and the reference to teeth in the bill may have an application. \nBut I have to go back to my firm belief in the government being closest \nto the people as usually the government that is most responsive.\n  I fail to acknowledge that if we don't adopt this mandate, we are \nsomehow being irresponsible. I think the way we have crafted this \nsecond degree is, again, not by any means an opportunity for the States \nto opt out. On the other hand, if they don't develop a program, they \nare going to be mandated in. Let there be no mistake about it. All \nthose States on the chart in white are going to be mandated to meet the \n10-percent renewable requirement.\n  Talk about teeth in the bill. I think those are teeth. They are \nsaying if the States don't take the initiative to do it, you are going \nto have to do it.\n  The Senator from New Mexico says the majority wants a renewable \nmandate. Every State in the Union is going to be affected and, in \neffect, mandated because those in the white will have to come up with a \nprogram. Those in the red and green are already initiating programs.\n  I think the generalization of my friend from New Mexico is a little \nmisleading. All States are going to be mandated in one form or another, \neither by the fact that they don't have a program or the fact that they \ndo have one. If they want to drop this program, such as the State of \nNew Mexico did, they are going to be mandated into a program--a 10-\npercent mandate.\n  I hope I am making myself clear. Some are going to be left out of \nthis. Everybody is going to have to have a renewable program. The only \ndifference is, under my proposal the States affected clearly would have \nsome flexibility.\n  If it is up to the States to decide what the renewable mix should \nbe--I say if it is up to those States--why not let them choose the \nlevel of their renewable?\n  Does the Senate believe it knows better than the States to do what is \ncost effective and appropriate given the States' renewable resources?\n  As I have said, the Midwest has wind. The East may have biomass. The \nSouthwest may have solar and geothermal. Different levels are cost \neffective.\n  As we practice dentistry around here, and recognize that the \nallegation has been made that there is no teeth in this, there is teeth \nin my proposal. There is plenty of teeth in it. Nobody has opted out. \nWhat I think we have in this proposal is some false teeth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I inquire, does the Senator have about \n1 minute I could take?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes are remaining.\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to take 1 minute.\n\n[[Page S2229]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Go ahead and take 2.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I support the amendment of the Senator from Alaska. \nClearly, those States that have moved forward with the program for \nrenewable resources to generate electricity have made a determination \nover a period of time about what they can best do in their particular \nStates and what is in the best interest of their consumers.\n  It seems to me, since they have taken the trouble to do that, and \nthey have done a lot of work on it, that it would be wrong for us--at \nleast premature for us--to come in as the Federal Government and say: \nNo. No. We know what is best for you. Even though we have not had any \nhearings, we have not had any markup in the committee, we are doing \nthis all on the floor of the Senate, we instinctively know what is best \nfor your State. That is really a supreme arrogance, even for the U.S. \nSenate.\n  So what the Senator from Alaska is saying is, look, for those States \nthat have already chosen to do this, let them run their programs the \nway they want to, and even for those States that chose to do so in the \nfuture.\n  This really satisfies the argument that those on the other side have \nmade that we need to do something--they use the words--``to encourage'' \nStates to use renewables. A mandate is a lot more than an \nencouragement, but be that as it may, for those that have already \nchosen to do it, they have been encouraged. Let's recognize that and \nacknowledge their programs and accept them as they are. And, perhaps, \nfor the rest of the States, our mandatory program will encourage them \nas well. They, then, should be allowed to move forward with the \nprograms as they see fit.\n  So given the fact the Kyl amendment was defeated before--and I accept \nthat--it seems to me this is a very good compromise, in effect, that \nrecognizes what the other side wants: to make the States have some kind \nof a program, but it also provides them flexibility in recognition of \nthe unique circumstances of their individual States.\n  I think it is a good compromise. I think the Senator from Alaska \nshould be complimented for it. I certainly support his amendment and \nhope others will as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. All of that is in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am informed that Senator Jeffords \nwants to speak in opposition. I also want to speak for another couple \nminutes, but I would like to do that after him. I would have to suggest \nthe absence of a quorum at this time in order to preserve his right to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We have had a few requests for time from Senators who \nwould like to catch airplanes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I assume time runs against me during the quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time would run against the Senator.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me be very brief. I will speak for a \ncouple minutes and then yield back the remainder of our time. I am \ninformed Senator Jeffords will not be arriving in time to speak prior \nto this vote.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge Senators to oppose this Murkowski \namendment. It does, in my strong opinion, gut the underlying provision \nwhich we have been debating now for the last several days.\n  The renewable portfolio standard that we have in the amendment I have \nsent to the desk requires certain things from utility companies over \nthe next 18 years, between now and the year 2020. We all understand \nthat.\n  What the Murkowski amendment says is that any utility located in any \nState that has something else in the way of a renewable portfolio \nprogram, no matter how weak it is, is exempt from the Federal \nrequirement. It also says that if you are in a State that does not have \nanything, the State can adopt anything, no matter how weak. And then \nutilities in that State are also exempt. So it is very clear that his \namendment does eliminate any meaningful mandate on utilities anywhere \nin the country.\n  I strongly urge Senators to oppose the Murkowski amendment. It would \ngut our renewable portfolio provision. For that reason, I think it \nshould be defeated.\n  Mr. President, I know of nobody else on our side who wishes to speak \nin opposition. So I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3052. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi), the \nSenator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Spector), the Senator from Alaska (Mr. \nStevens), and the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Thurmond), are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 39, nays 57, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 58 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--39\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--57\n\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Enzi\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n  The amendment (No. 3052) was rejected.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I see several of the interested parties are \nhere, and I do want to propound unanimous consent requests on a couple \nof issues.\n  I had hoped we would be able to reach agreement to move on the debt \nceiling before the Senate went out of session. It appears that we are \nnot going to be able to do that. I think we should.\n  Also, I had the impression we were going to try to do the Andean \ntrade bill before we left. The President is on his way to Mexico, and \nhe is going to Peru. The Andean countries feel very strongly about this \nissue and have said it is not only a trade issue, but has become a very \nserious political issue.\n  I would like for us to do these two things, and I will propound \nunanimous consent requests on both. Is there a preference as to which \none I do first? I will propound the Andean request first.\n\n[[Page S2230]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2230-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2230-S2231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS--H.R. 3009, S. 517 and H.R. 6\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 295, H.R. 3009, the Andean \ntrade legislation; further, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, with \nthe motion to reconsider laid upon the table; finally, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference \nwith the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the \npart of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I object.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. The majority leader is recognized under a reservation?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator from South Carolina \nwithhold?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to point out that Senator Lott and \nI have talked about this matter on a number of occasions. I share his \nstrong desire to complete our work on Andean trade. We will do so.\n\n  I have also indicated a desire, and I know it is a desire held on \nboth sides of the aisle, to finish the energy bill. It would be my hope \nwe could move to many of these other pressing legislative priorities as \nsoon as we finish energy.\n  We had agreed to take up and finish our energy responsibilities, and \nthat is what we are doing. We have been on the bill now for 13 days, as \nmy colleagues will note. There is one item that may keep us from \nreaching some agreement in the near future, and that is the ANWR \namendment. We have been attempting to get some understanding about how \nwe might resolve the issue relating to ANWR. So I ask unanimous consent \nthat on Monday, April 8, at 2 p.m., the Senate resume consideration of \nS. 517; that Senator Murkowski be immediately recognized to offer his \namendment relating to ANWR; that the amendment be debated Monday and \nTuesday; and that the Senate file cloture on his amendment Monday; that \nif cloture is not invoked on the amendment, then the amendment would be \nwithdrawn and no further amendments relating to drilling in ANWR be in \norder.\n  If the Republican leader could agree to this, then I think we would \nbe in a position to move very quickly, as soon as we finish our work on \nANWR and on energy, on this and other matters.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object to that additional request, \nthe request would not include the UC with regard to Andean trade; it \nwould be strictly with regard to ANWR?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. This would allow us to complete our work on ANWR and on \nenergy so we could move to not only Andean trade but TPA and border \nsecurity as well.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me assure Senator Daschle, under my reservation, I \nwould like for us to get a vote on ANWR included in the energy bill and \nmove to completion of the energy bill as soon as possible thereafter, \ntoo. Beyond that, I have urged the manager of this legislation, on our \nside of the aisle, to move to the ANWR issue as early as possible when \nwe come back. I hope that would be, hopefully, even Tuesday, but of \ncourse we will have to dispose of a couple of pending issues because we \ndo not want that to still be pending at the end of the week. We would \nlike to finish the energy bill the week we come back because I know we \nneed to go to the budget resolution and the trade bill.\n  My encouragement to the managers is we do ANWR earlier in the week so \nwe can then do the tax provision which, I presume, would be last, and \nwe would be prepared to go to the final passage of the bill.\n  At this time I object to that addition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. I objected to the request with regard to ANWR.\n  Now, did Senator Graham want to speak on the Andean trade issue, or \nwill he speak on it after the reservations?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. After the objection.\n  Mr. LOTT. After the objection?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. LOTT. That would be fine.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator from South Carolina objects?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I do.\n  Mr. LOTT. I want to make sure. There are others who might object as \ndid the Senator from South Carolina so the record is complete.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the minority leader's efforts \nto get unanimous consent to consider the Andean Trade Preference Act, \nwhich I consider to be a matter of not only urgency but also a matter \nof national moral responsibility for the United States.\n  For 10 years, we had a special relationship between this country and \nfour countries in Latin America: Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and, primarily \nbecause of its size, Colombia. All of those countries now are in \nvarious forms of threat to their sovereignty, to their democracy, and \nto their economic well-being.\n  The United States, at this time of need, I believe, is morally \nobligated to reach out to our good neighbors in the hemisphere through \nthe adoption of this legislation, which would essentially extend what \nwe have done for 10 years, a very successful relationship on both \nsides, and modernize and bring it up to the same standards we have \nalready provided to the countries of the Caribbean Basin.\n  Since we are not going to be dealing with this issue tonight, I hope \nwe will make a commitment that early after we return on April 8 we will \ngive attention to this matter so we can send the strongest possible \nsignal to these beleaguered countries that we understand their need and \nthat we want to be a partner in their resolution.\n  I urge our leadership to give priority attention to this issue at the \nearliest possible time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, right to the point on Andean trade, we \nhave supported it and we have indicated, of course, to the \nadministration we would go along with an extension. However, we have \ngiven at the office, as the saying goes. I have lost 50,900 textile \njobs since NAFTA, and I am wondering about these people talking of \nmorality, if they would be glad to accept my amendment to include \nBrazil and orange juice. Wouldn't that be immoral?\n  I have another moral for a motion on the Andean pact, and that is to \nget a little beef and wheat to Argentina; they are in desperate \ncircumstances. Morally, under the good neighbor policy of Franklin D. \nRoosevelt, we Democrats ought to be morally committed to beef and wheat \nto Argentina.\n  We have all kinds of amendments we can present. My point is, this \ncountry has lost its manufacturing capacity. That goes right to the \nheart of the economy and the recovery from the recession. Under the \nMarshall plan, yes, we sent over our technology and expertise. It \nworked. Capitalism conquered communism. However, there comes a time to \nface reality and that is that there is no such thing as free trade. We \nhave the enemy within--the Business Roundtable. Boy, I have gotten \nawards from them. But what has happened over the years is they have \nmoved their production.\n  I would like to print in the Record about Jack Welch squeezing the \nlemon. He said on December 6, 2000, the year before last, squeeze the \nlemon. He said General Electric was not going to serve or contract with \nany supplier that didn't move to Mexico.\n  So we have an affirmative action plan to get the jobs. Then comes \nfree trade, promotes jobs.\n  The gentleman Welch is squeezing something else. That is not a \nproblem. I don't think we are going to handle that tonight.\n  Let's now get on with what we are morally committed to on the idea of \ntrade. I am morally committed to the economic strength of this country.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I do not relish questioning legislation \nthat the President and the distinguished Republican leader are seeking \nto move through the Senate, but I feel obliged to make sure that the \nRecord reflects that I am genuinely opposed to the request to move to \nthe Andean trade bill because I am committed to standing up for the men \nand women from North Carolina who earn their living in the textile \nindustry.\n\n[[Page S2231]]\n\n  Time and again, these good citizens have been asked to sacrifice \ntheir livelihoods for the sake of textile trade liberalization. In \n2001, the textile and apparel sector lost almost 141,000 domestic jobs. \nIn North Carolina alone, more than 20,000 jobs were lost last year. The \nsteady erosion of the manufacturing base in North Carolina is creating \na genuine crisis, both for the men and women who are out of work, and \nthe communities which depend on a healthy domestic textile industry.\n  The so-called Andean Trade Preferences Act proposes to unilaterally \nallow duty-free imports of apparel products from the Andean region. \nThis legislation will exacerbate the problems facing our communities \nrather than assisting our industries and workers.\n  Mr. President, with all respect, I do not believe the Senate should \nproceed to the Andean trade bill, and I, therefore, feel obliged to \noppose the leader's request.\n  Mr. LOTT. One other issue. I really am bothered by the fact we are \ngoing to be leaving town and have not extended the debt ceiling. The \nTreasury Department has indicated they may or likely will have to take \naction around April 1 to deal with the fact that the debt ceiling may \nhave been reached, and that they would do a number of things, as other \nadministrations have done, possibly even dip into the pension fund to \ncarry us over.\n  Senator Daschle and I talked about the need to move this before we \nleft, to move it clean and move it for a year, but we have not been \nable to get that cleared. I think the Senate would look much better, \nand it would have been a wise thing for us to do to move the debt \nceiling extension.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 168, H.R. 6, and that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken; further I ask that the text of a Senate \nbill which is at the desk, which is in the debt limit extension, be \ninserted in lieu thereof; further I ask that the bill be read a third \ntime and passed, with a motion to reconsider laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, with regard to the last request and the \nobjection, I want to indicate that I, too, would have objected. \nCongress has had a long tradition of linking the budget process reform \nto increases in the statutory limit on Government debt. Obviously, no \none knows this better than the Senator from Texas when in 1985 Congress \nenacted the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law as an amendment to the debt limit \nbill, and in 1987, after the Supreme Court ruled the first Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings law unconstitutional, then Congress added the \nreaffirmation of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law to the debt limit. Then \nin 1990, Congress enacted the Budget Enforcement Act in the same \nlegislation with an increase in the debt limit.\n  There is a logical link between the debt limit issue and controlling \nof deficits. I think the Senate should only vote to raise the debt \nlimit if it is linked with reforms to prevent the need for future debt \nlimit increases, and I hope that when we return to this issue there is \nan opportunity for an amendment with a limited time agreement so we can \nperhaps address this important matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I hope everybody realizes this was an \nexercise without any real value because the House went out last night. \nEven if we had passed it tonight, there is no prospect for the House to \ntake this legislation up until after they come back in 2 weeks. We have \nbeen waiting for the House to give us some indication as to the size of \nthe debt limit increase they support and some understanding of what \nthey will do. We have yet to hear what the House plans are with regard \nto the debt limit.\n  The last I heard is they were having some difficulty in reaching \nagreement, and because they have not reached an agreement, they do not \nhave the votes to increase the debt under any conditions at this point. \nThere is some indication now they are planning to offer the debt limit \nincrease as an amendment to the supplemental, but the supplemental has \nyet to be presented to the Congress. So we do not have a supplemental. \nWe do not have any indication from the House as to what their \nintentions are with regard to the size or the timeframe within which \nthe debt will be considered and extended. So even if we did take up the \ndebt limit tonight, as I wish we could do as well, unfortunately we are \nstill going to have to wait until after the House acts on the \nlegislation for us to be able to complete our work.\n  So I do hope when we come back we can work in a bipartisan manner and \nsend clean legislation either to the House or wait for the House to \nsend similar legislation to us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2231-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2231-S2239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL LABORATORIES PARTNERSHIP IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3057 To Amendment No. 3016\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk numbered \n3057.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3057.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 9 after line 7 insert:\n       ``(n) Protection of Consumers.--Upon certification by the \n     Governor of a State to the Secretary of Energy that the \n     application of the Federal renewable portfolio standard would \n     adversely affect consumers in such State, the requirements of \n     this section shall not apply to retail electric sellers in \n     such State. Such suspension shall continue until \n     certification by the Governor of the State to the Secretary \n     of Energy that consumers in such State would no longer be \n     adversely affected by the application of the provisions of \n     this section.''\n\n  Mr. KYL. I will take a couple of minutes to explain this amendment. \nIt is very straightforward. Since we have been through the debate, we \ndo not have to have a great deal more. We have tried twice, once myself \nand once Senator Murkowski, to give the States more authority to deal \nwith the problem of renewable energy. Both of our amendments have been \nrejected. We accept that.\n  This amendment is one last attempt to preserve some semblance of \nability by the States to protect their electric consumers in the event \nthe costs of this Federal mandate program should be too great and \nallows, therefore, the Governor to opt out or waive the provisions of \nthe program in that one eventuality.\n  From the Energy Information Administration of the Department of \nEnergy, we have an account of every single utility in the country in \nevery single State, by State, showing exactly what this Federal mandate \nin the Bingaman provision is expected to cost retail consumers. It \naverages around a 4-, 5-, 6-percent per year increase, but it varies \nfrom region to region and utility to utility.\n  The point is, when customers begin to feel the pinch of the Federal \nmandate in the Bingaman amendment, they will ask you or your Governors \nis there anything they can do. My amendment says, yes, the Governor \nwould have the ability in that event to waive the provisions of the \nFederal mandate, if he finds those provisions are adversely affecting \nthe retail customers of the State.\n  These figures may not be accurate. If that is the case, fine. But if \nthese figures are accurate, I suspect your constituents, your voters, \nyour retail electric customers, are going to want some relief.\n  This is the last liferaft, folks. We have been defeated on everything \nelse. This is at least a liferaft that provides some ability of the \nprogram to be waived so it would not adversely affect them. I ask my \ncolleagues to consider not the utilities in your State; what we are \nsaying is, if it should transpire that the Bingaman amendment adversely \naffects people, shouldn't we have some kind of escape valve, some \nability for\n\n[[Page S2232]]\n\nthe Governor to say: We are going to opt out until the situation \ntranspires in a better way for the people of our State, for our \nelectric customers. That is what this amendment does. I hope my \ncolleagues will support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question of the \nSenator from Arizona on the renewable energy matter. I was looking at \nthe information he has provide and saw that under the Bingaman \nprovision electricity bills in Virginia would increase by 5.5 percent \non average--some, for example at Virginia Power, would go up by 4.8 \npercent.\n  Having served previously as Governor of Virginia, we would take a \nbunch of businesspeople up to New York City. We called it a report to \ntop management. We talked about the attributes of coming to Virginia \nand locating businesses in our State. We talked about taxes, right-to-\nwork laws, and regulations. But a key factor was the cost of \nelectricity. Virginia's electricity costs are generally lower than \nthose of the national average.\n  A Governor heads up economic development efforts. Do I understand \nyour amendment correctly that a Governor who knows how to attract more \njobs into a State, as that usually is a priority for a Governor, if he \nor she saw this was harmful for creating jobs in his or her State, \ncould waive out of this Federal mandate if it was harming the \ncompetitiveness of the State and businesses?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the only way a Governor could waive the \nprovisions with respect to his State would be if he found that the \nrenewable portfolio standard would adversely affect consumers in his \nState. So he would have to find it is adversely affecting the retail \nelectric consumers in his State for him to be able to waive the \nmandated provisions of the Bingaman proposal.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Senator.\n  In view of this, we ought to trust the people in the States. The \nGovernors can determine whether this is adversely affecting their \nconsumers and the ability of their citizens to get good jobs. The \ndefinition of consumers is not restricted just to individuals. They are \nalso business enterprises. We ought to trust the people in the States \nwho have the same concerns as everyone in this body to make this \ndetermination as to how it may affect their respective States.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent Senator Helms be listed as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes and there are 4 \nminutes on the side of the opponent.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, one would hope we would not have to \ncontinue with the barrage of amendments that attempt to deprive the \nAmerican public access for increased renewable resources. Make no \nmistake, the American public has made it very clear they support \nrenewable energy. Poll after poll indicates the overwhelming majority \nof Americans support requiring utilities to produce electricity from \nrenewable energy resources.\n  Americans want clean energy. They want technology that leaves the air \nclean, that does not contribute to lung cancer, that does not sicken \ntheir children. They want to diversify or domestically produce energy \nto buffer against price instability, and to lessen the vulnerability of \nour energy infrastructure through terrorist attack.\n  But we have yet another amendment that would weaken efforts to \nencourage production of renewable energy. This amendment allows a State \nto opt out of the energy program at any time the Governors certify it \nwould adversely affect the consumers of the State. Clearly, this is no \nstandard at all.\n  First, a certification that something ``may adversely affect'' \nconsumers is pretty close to being as loose a statutory requirement as \nanyone can craft. The obvious effect is to allow States to opt out, \nleaving a piecemeal and unpredictable program.\n\n  As I said before, one of the overarching benefits of the Federal \nrenewable energy standard is that it encourages regional generation and \ndistribution of renewable energy. State provisions often limit credit \nto renewable energy generated within the States. A Federal standard \nencourages utilities to meet these renewable energy requirements by \npurchasing and selling renewable energy beyond State boundaries.\n  This recognizes a reality that our electricity generation is in fact \nregional in nature, with customers in California using energy provided \nfrom New Mexico, and a variety of New England States receiving their \npower from New York. Exempting States on a piecemeal basis serves to \nsignificantly weaken the regional application of a nationwide standard. \nA national standard must be uniformly applied to be effective.\n  When the American public says they want laws supporting renewable \nenergy, they do not mean sham laws that, on their face, are going to do \nnothing.\n  We have already spoken at length about all the reasons we need it. We \nhave mentioned the health benefits, et cetera, so I am not going to \nspend any more time doing that, other than to say this amendment should \nbe defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me speak briefly, and I will yield the remainder of \nmy time, and I hope the Senator from Arizona will as well.\n  This will be the third time we have had essentially the same vote: \nThe Kyl amendment earlier this morning, and then the vote we just had \non the Murkowski amendment, and now this one. This amendment says that \nalthough we have a renewable portfolio standard, the majority of the \nSenate has agreed that makes sense, any Governor who doesn't agree with \nit can take his State out. He can sign a certification saying in his \nopinion----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The point I was making is this amendment would \nessentially give Governors the option of taking their State out of this \nprogram by signing a certification to the effect that in their opinion \nthis adversely affects folks in their State.\n  The reality is the majority of the Senate has expressed their view. \nThe majority of the Senate has indicated they believe putting a \nreasonable renewable portfolio standard in the law makes sense and this \nproposal does that in a gradual, moderate way.\n  I think it would be a terrible mistake for us at this point to \ntotally gut that provision, as the Kyl amendment would do. Anyone who \nvoted against the Kyl amendment earlier today should oppose this \namendment as well. Anyone who voted against the Murkowski amendment \njust now should vote against this amendment as well.\n  I am advised there may be others wishing to speak, so I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have had several of my colleagues say \ndon't worry, this is a green vote; it will be dropped in conference.\n  Let me tell you what we have done here. We have excluded the right of \nStates to have a choice. We have mandated that one size fits all.\n  As this chart shows, under the previous vote we just completed, we \nwere going to give recognition to the States that addressed the \ninitiative of coming up with renewables. But what we were going to do \nwas force the others that had not to perform under the 10-percent \nmandate.\n  The idea of the Senator from Arizona, to give the Governor some \ndiscretion, I think is responsible legislation. Why should we sit here \nand mandate that one size fits all? The States know what is best for \nthem, and we should concur with that and recognize, indeed, that they \nhave their own best interests at heart and they are responsible people. \nThey are elected just as we are.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I was struck in listening to our dear \ncolleague from Vermont tell us about how many people are for this \nrenewable energy and what a strong base of support there is for it. I \nguess the logical question is: If everybody is for it, why are\n\n[[Page S2233]]\n\nwe making them do it? If everybody is for it, why would any Governor \nopt his State out when he has to stand for re-election?\n  The problem is, not everybody is for it and the costs may be--in some \nStates and under some circumstances--prohibitive. So I urge people, \ntake into account that things in your State may align in such a way \nthat you would want the option, under those circumstances, to opt out. \nOn that basis, I urge people to please vote for the Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, all time has expired \non the Republican side. I think we are prepared to yield back the \nremainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will say, this will be the final vote for tonight. \nThere will not be any votes tomorrow. But I do hope we can come back in \n2 weeks, and we are all going to help finish this bill on time; right? \nThe week we get back.\n  With that understanding, there will be no votes tomorrow, and the \nfirst vote will be on Tuesday, the second day of the week we come back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let no one say the final action before the recess is not \nbipartisan.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. We yield our time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3057.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3058 To Amendment No. 3016\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent, I believe \nthe Senator from Maine now is in order to offer her amendment which is \nan agreed-to amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from \nMaine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Snowe, I \nsend an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins], for herself and Ms. \n     Snowe, proposes an amendment numbered 3058 to amendment No. \n     3016.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To clarify the definition of ``repowering or cofiring \n                              increment'')\n\n       On page 8, line 15, delete the period and \n     add ``, or the additional generation above the average \n     generation in the three years preceding the date of enactment \n     of this section, to expand electricity production at a \n     facility used to generate electric energy from a renewable \n     energy resource or to cofire biomass that was placed in \n     service before the date of enactment of this section.''\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment that \nrecognizes the value of America's existing renewable energy resources. \nThe Bingaman amendment does not give credit to existing renewable \nenergy facilities. I believe a facility should receive credit at least \nfor new renewable energy generation that is higher than the facility's \naverage generation over the previous three years. My amendment would \nallow existing facilities to receive credit for increased generation of \nrenewable energy.\n  I support increasing our use of renewable energy. I believe it is \nimportant that any comprehensive energy legislation significantly boost \nthe use of electricity produced from clean resources such as biomass, \nwind, geothermal, and solar energy. I support a significant renewable \nportfolio standard, which requires electricity suppliers to sell \nelectricity that has a minimum amount of renewable energy.\n  Promoting our renewable energy resources will help diversify our \nenergy supplies, increase our energy security, and reduce pollution. It \nwill move us one step closer to a cleaner energy future that reduces \nour reliance on fossil fuels.\n  States are leading the way in demonstrating the benefits of clean \nenergy standards. Twelve States, including Arizona, Connecticut, Iowa, \nMaine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, \nPennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin, have already adopted a renewable \nportfolio standard. A national RPS will complement and enhance the \ngroundbreaking efforts by these states and will provide particular \nbenefits to hard-pressed agricultural and rural areas. Perhaps most \nimportant, a national RPS would create a new and vibrant national \nmarket across all states, and help to maintain America's international \nleadership in these energy technologies of the future.\n  I commend the efforts to develop renewable energy in my home State of \nMaine. Maine has been a leader in developing renewable energy. In fact, \nMaine has enacted a state-wide renewable portfolio standard of 30 \npercent. No other State has adopted as high a standard as Maine.\n  Even though I am emphatically in favor of increasing renewable energy \nproduction, we must do so in a fair and equitable way. The proposal \nbefore us, offered by my friend from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, \nunfairly discriminates against existing renewable energy resources. \nUnfortunately, the Senator from New Mexico has drafted legislation that \ndoes not properly give credit to existing renewable energy production.\n  Why should we discriminate against States which have been proactive \nand invested heavily in renewable energy? I know my home State of \nMaine, as well as California and a number of other States, have \ninvested huge resources into developing our renewable energy resources. \nThese States have developed new technologies and set an example for \nother States to follow. Let's not penalize those States which have \nworked to develop our renewable energy industry from the ground up.\n  Ideally, every existing renewable energy resource should receive full \ncredit. I would like to see existing renewable energy resources receive \n100% credit. Doing so would help bring our total renewable energy \ngeneration to a higher level at less cost. Under the Bingaman approach, \nexisting renewable energy resources will find themselves in an unfair \ncompetitive environment with new renewable energy\n\n[[Page S2234]]\n\nsources. Existing renewable energy facilities will shut down, and new \nones will be built next door. That is a poor use of resources. It will \ncost more money and raise electricity prices. Wouldn't it be better if \nStates could form partnerships with each other to develop renewable \nenergy resources in the most cost efficient manner possible? Surely we \nshould allow States which don't have a lot of existing renewable \nresources to save money by buying inexpensive, existing credits from \nother States.\n  I am offering this amendment that would provide at least partial \nrecognition of those hard working Americans who have built our existing \nrenewable energy resources. I would like to see all existing renewable \nenergy resources included in this standard. However, my amendment does \nnot go that far in an attempt to accommodate Senator Bingaman.\n  My amendment merely says that increased output at existing renewable \nenergy facilities should be counted. If an existing renewable energy \nfacility were to increase its renewable energy output by 50%, then \nunder my amendment that facility would receive credit for that 50% \nincrease. Thus, consistent with the interest of Senator Bingaman's \nproposal, my amendment only gives credit to new renewable energy \nproduction.\n  Those who have developed America's existing renewable energy \nresources should have their efforts recognized. At a minimum, I hope my \ncolleagues will at least join me in giving these hard working Americans \nwho have led the way on renewables partial credit. I ask my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this amendment.\n  To reiterate, my amendment merely says that increased output at an \nexisting renewable energy facility should be counted under this bill. \nIf an existing renewable energy facility were to increase its renewable \nenergy output by 50 percent, then under my amendment that facility \nwould receive credit for that 50-percent increase. Thus, I believe it \nis consistent with the intent of Senator Bingaman's proposal in that it \ngives credit to expand renewable energy production.\n  I ask for consideration of the amendment, and I thank both Senator \nBingaman and Senator Murkowski for their assistance in this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment is acceptable on this \nside.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is cleared on this side, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 3058. Without objection, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3058) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3016, As Amended\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I believe the next item under the \nunanimous consent agreement is a vote on the Bingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 3016, as amended. Without objection, the \namendment, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3016), as amended, was agreed to.\n\n\n                Vitiation of Action--Amendment No. 2996\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, last week the Senate adopted an \namendment by Senators Murkowski and Daschle relating to rural and \nremote community grants. There were a number of inadvertent errors in \nthe amendment as adopted. Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent that the \nadoption of amendment No. 2996 be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n    Amendments Nos. 3059 through 3069 En Bloc To Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, you have at the desk 11 amendments. I \nask for their immediate consideration en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, amendment No. 3069 incorporates all of \nthe changes Senator Bingaman and I have worked out with the State of \nAlaska, the Alaska Legislature, the pipeline companies, the North Slope \noil and gas producers, and northern Alaska petroleum explorers.\n  One might imagine with the diversity of interests represented by this \ngroup of participants, there was not always unanimous agreement on each \npoint.\n  But at the end of the day, I believe what is contained in this \nsubstitute amendment is a fair compromise between often divergent \npoints of view.\n  I want to thank Senator Bingaman and his staff for all of the hard \nwork they invested in working with me to craft this challenging \namendment.\n  Although Alaska North Slope gas has been available for over 30 years, \ndevelopment and commercialization has not been possible due to lack of \nlocal market and lack of transportation to commercial markets.\n  The cost and risk associated with building a project of the magnitude \nwe are speaking was just too daunting.\n  All of you are aware of last year's efforts on the part of Exxon/\nMobil, Phillips, and British Petroleum to evaluate the commercial \nviability of transporting Alaska gas to markets in the lower 48.\n  At the completion of their economic evaluation they determined that \nthe project was ``not'' economically viable at this time.\n  This negative economic determination set the stage for Congress's \ninvolvement in the Alaska gas debate.\n  A way needed to be found to reduce both the cost and the risk \nassociated with the construction of this $20 billion project.\n  As you may know Senator Daschle and Bingaman introduced their energy \nbill last December--language was contained in that bill to assist in \nconstructing the Alaska Gas Transportation Project.\n  While that language was a good start, it did not address all of the \nproblems that needed to be resolved in order to achieve the goal of \ncost and risk reduction.\n  It also failed to address issues of significant concern to the people \nof Alaska.\n  For the past several months Senator Bingaman and I have been engaged \nin discussions with all the interested parties in an attempt to come up \nwith language that would remove as many barriers as possible standing \nin the way of constructing this project.\n  The amendment that Senator Bingaman and I are offering today \naccomplishes this goal.\n  I believe both the interest of Alaska and the nation are well served \nby the language we have crafted.\n  It protects Alaska's interests by: prohibiting the ``Over-the-Top'' \nroute thus keeping construction and operational jobs in Alaska ``and'' \nalong with providing Alaskans with the opportunity to heat their homes \nand develop a gas based industry in our State; making it clear that \nAlaskans have full regulatory authority over gas coming off the \nmainline in our State; providing the opportunity for newly discovered \nAlaska gas to find its way to markets in the south; making special \nprovisions for the transport of Alaska royalty gas to markets in \nAlaska; and setting up a $20 million dollar program to train Alaskans \nin the skills they will need to compete successfully for the high \npaying jobs created by the construction and operation of the Alaska Gas \nTransportation System.\n  The national interest is protected by significantly reducing the risk \nassociated with construction of a system that will provide the nation \nwith a secure, abundant, and domestically produced supply of gas that \nwill last well into the middle of the century.\n  The national interest is served by: providing gasline builders with \ntwo separate and updated authorities to permit the project; providing \nexpedited judicial review of legal challenges that might otherwise slow \ndown the project; and creating a project coordinator to make sure that \nthe scores of State and Federal agencies permitting the project are \nworking together and not creating artificial bureaucratic barriers that \nwill slow or halt the construction process.\n  I firmly believe that the language contained in this amendment will \ngo a long way towards reducing both the cost and the risk associated \nwith the construction of the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System.\n  A system that will serve the special interests of Alaska and the \nNation for decades to come.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, these 11 amendments have been cleared on \nboth sides. I urge their adoption en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Amendment No. 3023, which is an amendment by \nSenator Lincoln related to the biodiesel credit, is cleared, and I urge \nthat we go ahead and proceed with it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 3023.\n  The amendment (No. 3023) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3041\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 3041 be voted on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 3041.\n  The amendment (No. 3041) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, that completes the items we intended to \ncomplete today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Florida for how \nmuch time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Two minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. For not to exceed 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3070 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to offer an amendment and ask that \nit be laid aside for consideration after we return.\n  This amendment will add to the list of items which are acceptable as \nrenewable energy municipal solid waste. When we return, I will make a \nmore extended statement. In a State such as mine, the options for \ndealing with solid waste are essentially two: One is to bury it in a \nlandfill; two is to incinerate it. Of those two, clearly, the \nincineration is a more benign impact on our environment. Given the high \nwater table we have, land disposal of the solid waste creates serious \nissues of water quality. In my opinion, we should allow, as we have \nallowed this afternoon through the amendment of Senator Craig, expanded \nuse of biomass, and now Senator Collins extended use of hydropower, we \nshould recognize the fact that both in terms of environment and energy, \nallowing solid waste to energy to be one of the allowable renewable \nenergy sources is in the national interest.\n\n[[Page S2236]]\n\n  I offer this amendment. I ask that it be set aside and look forward \nto a fuller discussion when we return.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3070.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, does the Senator from Alaska wish to be \nyielded to?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me thank my good friend, the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia. I appreciate the opportunity to respond very briefly \nwith a statement.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. About 40 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator for \nwhatever time he may consume, up to 2 minutes, without losing my right \nto the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the President pro tempore for \nhis generosity.\n  Mr. President, I will file an amendment, but I shall not bring it up \nat this time. This amendment would require the cessation of importing \noil from Iraq, which is currently at 1.2 million barrels a day, until \nsuch time as the President certifies that Iraq, one, allows U.S. \ninspectors access to suspected sites for the development of weapons of \nmass destruction; and, two, ceases to cheat the U.N. oil program by \nsmuggling oil out through third countries.\n  It will be my intention to bring this amendment up upon our return \nfrom the recess.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3042\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFLLER. Mr. President, I am proud to submit today, along with \nmy colleague Senator Carnahan, amendment No. 3042 to provide tax \nincentives to promote the use of a new type of energy-efficient \ntechnology for beverage vending machines. The Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil estimates that, when fully implemented, this new technology \ncould reduce national energy use by up to 6 billion kilowatt hours, \nkWh, per year. This translates to an annual electricity savings of $600 \nmillion, by encouraging the sale of new energy-efficient vending \nmachines for bottled and canned beverages.\n  Our amendment provides a $75 tax credit for the purchase of each \nqualifying energy-efficient vending machine. This incentive is \nnecessary because vending machines are purchased by bottlers and other \nbeverage machine operators and placed at third party locations to \nbenefit consumers, but the types of machines purchased are not decided \nby the organization that pays the electricity bill. Unlike most \nproducts, the benefit of a vending machine's reduced energy consumption \nis captured by the third party location not by the machine's purchaser. \nTherefore, there is currently no economic incentive for machine \noperators to purchase energy efficient vending machines, many of which \nhave useful lives of ten to twenty years.\n  For instance, colleges all across the country have beverage vending \nmachines for the students to use. A soft drink bottler purchases these \nmachines from a manufacturer, and places them in student unions at \nuniversities, such as Wheeling Jesuit in Wheeling, WV. Wheeling Jesuit \nand other customers of the bottler have no control over what kind of \nmachines are purchased. Because Wheeling Jesuit, and not the vending \nmachine operator, pays the electric bill, the vending machine operator \nhas no incentive to save Wheeling Jesuit money with more energy-\nefficient machines that would cut down on the college's electricity \nbills. This amendment would change all of that, because the vending \nmachine operators would receive the tax credit for their purchases. The \nnew energy efficient machines will save the typical site owner $200 a \nyear and more than $2,000 over the life of the machine.\n  Technology is now available to reduce the energy consumption of \nrefrigerated bottled and canned vending machines by as much as 50 \npercent. One of the manufacturers using this technology to make energy-\nefficient vending machines has operations in my home State of West \nVirginia, in the small town of Kearneysville. This energy-saving \ntechnology has been recognized by the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, and will be recognized next week at the Environmental \nProtection Agency's Energy Star Awards. This tax incentive will make it \neasier for bottlers do to the right thing, environmentally, while \nbenefiting forward-looking manufacturers like the one producing these \nenergy-efficient machines in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia.\n  Without this incentive, the likely result is that bottlers will take \nadvantage of this improved technology much more slowly, and energy will \ncontinue to be needlessly wasted.\n  Each new energy-efficient machine would save more than 2,000 kWh per \nyear over its less-efficient predecessor. With approximately 225,000 \nnew vending machines purchased every year the energy savings potential \nis enormous. Once all machines are switched to the more energy \nefficient models, our Nation can save six billion kWh per year. That is \nenough energy to power approximately 600,000 U.S. households for an \nentire year.\n  Another feature of this tax credit is that it will provide a \nsubstantial energy savings to our nation without burdening the average \nAmerican. Citizens will not even know the vending machines are energy-\nefficient. There will be no change to the temperature of the beverages \nor the outward appearance of the machines. The tax incentive will tend \nto keep the price of the beverage where it is today.\n  This amendment provides a boon to energy savings at little cost. This \namendment will provide an energy savings of approximately three to one \nover the cost of the tax incentive. Not only does this amendment make \ngood sense for energy efficiency; it makes good economic sense, too.\n  Every small step we take toward reducing our nation's total energy \nconsumption contributes to a more prosperous economy and a brighter \nfuture for ourselves and our children. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3043\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am committed to helping craft \nnational energy legislation that takes energy production and \nconservation, balanced with environmental concerns and economic issues, \ninto consideration. Today, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senator \nAllen, Senator Specter, and Senator Warner, in submitting amendment No. \n3043 to the Senate energy bill to create an important tax incentive \nthat I believe will encourage the recycling of coal combustion waste \nmaterials produced in the process of reducing sulfur emission in coal-\nfired electric utility boilers.\n  Currently in the United States, many coal-fired power plants are \nequipped with sulfur dioxide scrubbers, the purpose of which is to \nsignificantly reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide released into the \nair. In the process of cleaning the air, these scrubbers produce more \nthan 20 million tons of coal combustion waste or sludge per year. \nStabilization of the sludge increases the waste materials to over 40 \nmillion tons per year, and this amount is expected to more than double \nas the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 continue to phase in. At this \ntime, less than 20 percent of this waste material is recycled. In fact, \nthe balance of the sludge is disposed of in landfills at a cost to \nelectric utilities of as much as $40 per ton, depending upon the \nlocale. I am concerned that, as landfills become full, and new \nlandfills become more difficult to site, the costs to utilities, and \nultimately to electric consumers, will continue to escalate.\n  A tax credit is needed to encourage utilities that are controlling \ntheir sulfur dioxide emissions to recycle the waste material their \nscrubbers\n\n[[Page S2237]]\n\nproduce. By helping to alleviate and perhaps eliminate the cost of \ndisposing of the waste products generated by using important emission \ncontrol systems, we can realize the multiple environmental benefits: \nCleaner air and less combustion waste being landfilled.\n  There are basically two types of scrubbing, or emission control \nsystems, currently in use. One produces a wet sludge and the other a \ndry sludge. Wet sludge is more difficult and costly to treat. \nAccordingly, the proposed credit is $6 for each ``wet ton'' and $4 for \neach ``dry ton'' recycled by a third party. The credit will have a 10-\nyear limit and includes strict requirements to determine that the \nsludge has actually been ``recycled'' and that a value-added product, \nwith genuine marketplace appeal, is created.\n  The tax credits will stimulate the development of new technologies to \nrecycle the sludge and encourage existing technologies to enhance their \nrecycling efforts. The 10-year life of this credit will provide \nsufficient time to aid the start-up of new companies and technologies \nand the further development of existing technologies; thereafter these \nrecycling efforts should be self-supporting. The cost of these credits \nis less than $75 million over the next 10 years and could, in part, be \noffset by taxes generated by new businesses as well as the savings to \nthe economy through reduced energy costs.\n  I remain committed to promoting the use of coal as a primary energy \nsource for this nation, and I wholeheartedly embrace tax incentives for \nthe installation of clean coal technologies. I believe this credit to \nencourage combustion waste recycling efforts is an important addition \nto our energy policy. It will support economic development and protect \nthe environment. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3044\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators Ben Nelson and Chuck Hagel, in submitting amendment No. 3044 \naddressing energy metering at consumers' homes and the availability of \nreliable energy usage data for consumers to use in making energy \nconsumption decisions. The amendment we are submitting is very \nstraightforward, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Under the Energy Tax Incentives Act a tax credit and accelerated \ndepreciation is established for the benefit of electric and gas \nsuppliers that install energy meters that provide consumers with real-\ntime information about the amount of energy they are consuming and the \ncost of that energy. This provision was passed by the Senate Finance \nCommittee, and will become a part of the bill now under consideration.\n  The intent of these provisions is to promote energy conservation by \nallowing consumers to monitor, in real time, their energy use and its \ncost. By providing consumers with access to current energy use and cost \ninformation, consumers will be better able to change their usage \npatterns, thereby conserving energy and saving money in the process. \nThe one problem my cosponsors and I see with this provision is that it \nis limited to only one or two specific metering technologies, and I \nstrongly believe there are other very cost effective and beneficial \nmetering technologies, collectively referred to as ``time of use'' \ntechnology that would similarly allow consumers to better conserve \nenergy.\n  Our amendment would simply expand the availability of this tax \nprovision to include those suppliers who provide consumers with time of \nuse metering technology. One of these time of use technologies is \nmanufactured by a company doing business in Scott Depot, WV. I have not \nbrought this amendment to the floor of the United States Senate solely \nbecause it may benefit a business in my home State. I have brought this \namendment to the floor because I believe it will enhance the \neffectiveness of the underlying bill by giving consumers and their \nutilities a number of options for conserving energy through the \nauditing of their energy use.\n  By using time of use technology, consumers could easily and \nconveniently determine how much energy they consumed during different \ntimes of the day and the specific costs associated with their use \nduring each time period. Consumers would have access to time of use \ninformation for pre-selected time segments of each day. Each selected \ntime period would have the exact price of the energy consumed.\n  For example, a consumer in New Manchester, WV, using this technology \ncould determine how much energy was used between 6-7 p.m. each night. \nBy knowing this information, this consumer would be able to change his \nor her energy-use habits during specific time periods, or as an overall \npolicy. If helpful, consumers could also easily be provided with \nhistoric time of use information so they could compare their current \nuse and costs with their past use to see the extent they have been \nconserving energy and saving money. I believe this type of metering \ntechnology would be particularly beneficial to many consumers in West \nVirginia.\n  This is a good amendment, and I think that it improves the energy \nefficiency provisions of the underlying bill, without favoring one \ntechnology over another.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3045\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, amendment No. 3045 is very simple but \nit could make a life or death difference to miners who work in one of \nthe most dangerous occupations in America.\n  This amendment would require the Secretary of Labor, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of Energy, to review current staffing levels of mine \ninspectors, and considering current needs and expected retirements, to \nhire and train as many new mine inspectors as are needed to maintain \nproper safety in coal mines. The Secretary is to maintain the number of \nmine inspectors at a level no lower than current levels. When filing \nthese positions, my amendment encourages the Secretary of Labor to give \nconsideration to experienced miners or mine engineers.\n  Coal miners are dying in alarming numbers in accidents that might be \nprevented if more mine inspectors were on the job. Coal mine fatalities \nincreased in 2001 for the third year in a row. Forty-two miners died in \nmine accidents in the United States. Forty-two miners lost their lives. \nThis is the most since 1995.\n  Already in 2002, eight miners have died in American coal mines. \nImproved technology is increasing the productivity of our mines. We \nshould also be seeing improvements in mine safety, not a rising death \ntoll.\n  Two of the miners who have died this year were West Virginians. On \nJanuary 2nd, a 44-year-old miner with 23 years of experience was \nfatally injured when unsupported roof rock measuring seven feet by five \nfeet fell on him in the Justice #1 mine in Boone County, WV.\n  Just over a month later, on February 20th a 53-year-old miner at the \nRadar Run #2 mine in Greenbrier County was crushed by loose rock, some \nas large as 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 10 feet thick.\n  These deaths are tragedies for the families and friends of the miners \nwho died. If these accidents could have been prevented, it is \nunforgivable. Our industry and Federal mine safety system are supposed \nto protect miners to the maximum extent possible. The sheer number of \nmine deaths tells me that we are not doing enough to ensure miners' \nsafety.\n  I am proud that West Virginia produces much of the coal that powers \nthe national economy. Over 50 percent of our electricity comes from \ncoal. But in producing this fuel, year in and year out, too many West \nVirginia miners become casualties.\n  Twelve of the 42 miners lost in coal mines in the United States last \nyear were West Virginians. Nine West Virginians, died in both 1999 and \n2000. Since 1992, 114 of the 406 American miners who have died in mine \naccidents have been West Virginians. This is unacceptable. We must do a \nbetter job of preventing these accidents, with the goal of eliminating \nthem altogether.\n  West Virginia miners are not the only ones dying in coal mines. Last \nSeptember 23rd, two explosions in the Jim Walter #5 mine in Brookwood, \nAL, took the lives of 13 coal miners, in the single largest coal mine \ndisaster in the United States since 1984. Twelve of these miners had \nrushed into the mine to save trapped co-workers. That kind of heroism \nis frequently found in the history of coal mining. We need to make it \nless necessary.\n  Anyone who has gone down into a mine knows that accidents happen. \nThis amendment will cut down on preventable accidents.\n\n[[Page S2238]]\n\n  Retirements will reduce the current number of mine inspectors by 25 \npercent in the next five years. Despite this trend, and the number of \nmine fatalities, the President's fiscal year 2003 budget request cuts \nthe Mine Safety and Health Administration budget by $4 million.\n  The premise is not that more money will necessarily solve the \nproblem. The premise is this: The energy bill properly sees coal as a \nvital part of the nation's energy mix. The amendment intends to make \nsure that the hardworking men and women who bring that coal out of the \nground are not doing so at an unacceptable risk to their lives.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3072\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, amendment No. 3072 to the energy bill to \nestablish a Consumer Energy Commission. This amendment is simple, yet \nit has the potential to significantly benefit American families and \nbusinesses. It should garner widespread support.\n  Like many of my colleagues in the Senate, I am pleased that we have \nturned to debate on an energy bill to address our nation's energy \nchallenges. This debate marks the first time Congress has \ncomprehensively considered energy policy since 1992. As we consider the \nmany facets of this important topic, we must remember what has happened \nwith energy in our country during the past decade.\n  One word you will often hear to describe energy during the past \ndecade, especially in the last few years, is ``crisis.'' The California \nelectricity experience has been cast in terms of a crisis, and many \nhave pointed to Enron as an indication of problems in our energy \npolicy. While we may disagree with the extent of the energy crisis, as \nwell as ways to address it, I think we can all agree that one energy \nchallenge our nation faces is consumer price spikes.\n  Let us take the example of gasoline. We all know that prices have \nsignificantly fluctuated at the pump. The Administration's energy \npolicy indeed cites ``dramatic increases in gasoline prices'' as one of \nthe challenges we face. The Consumer Federation of America and Public \nCitizen have also called attention to energy price spikes, explaining \nthat American consumers spent roughly $40 billion more on gasoline in \n2000 than in 1999. In the spring of 2000, the cost of gasoline in \nChicago shot up to $2.13 per gallon, well-above the unusually high \nnational average of $1.67 per gallon at the time.\n  Yet gasoline is not the only energy product for which consumers have \nhad to pay dramatically fluctuating costs in recent years. Residential \nheating oil, residential natural gas, commercial natural gas, \nindustrial natural gas, and motor gasoline, have all had fluctuating \nprices over the past 15 years.\n  If we break down these numbers month-by-month, you can see incredible \nprice spikes. In just a matter of one month, the national average price \nof gasoline jumped by 20 cents per gallon, residential heating oil rose \nby 10 cents per gallon, and residential natural gas leapt by 50 cents \nper thousand cubic feet.\n  In some areas of the country and sectors of the economy, price spikes \nwere greater and had drastic impacts. Home heating and cooling bills \ncrippled family budgets in the Midwest and Northeast. Farmers and \nindustries dependent on natural gas for the production of fertilizer \nand other chemical products suffered economically.\n  To address the chronic national problem of significant energy price \nfluctuations, I am offering an amendment to the energy bill that would \nestablish a Consumer Energy Commission. This 11-member Commission would \nbring together bi-partisanly appointed representatives from consumer \ngroups, energy industries, and energy- and trade-related agencies, to \nstudy the causes of energy price spikes and make recommendations on how \nto avert them.\n  It is true that the Federal Trade Commission recently studied \ngasoline price spikes in the Midwest. Indeed, several studies have \ninvestigated potential abuses of market power in the energy industry. \nOther studies have looked at the long-range supply and demand \nprojections for energy products. But previous studies have tended to \nfocus on a small set of issues, and on the perspective of industry or \ngovernment. I think the best approach is not to look at these issues \nnarrowly, but rather to consider the big picture. Most importantly, we \nneed to give consumers a voice.\n  When consumers go to pay their grocery bills, or their tuition bills, \nor even their residential electricity bills in most states, and when \nbusinesses go to pay for raw materials, prices are rather predictable. \nBut when they go to pay for their heating and cooling, natural gas, or \ngasoline, families and businesses face the frustrating reality of wild \nprice swings. We need to bring consumers to the table with \nrepresentatives of the energy industry and government, in order to \nstudy price spikes. We need these groups to work collectively, and to \nconsider a range of the possible causes of energy price spikes. We need \nthem to look at both the supply and demand sides, including such \npotential causes as maintenance of inventory, delivery of supply, \nconsumption behaviors, implementation of efficiency technologies, and \nexport-import patterns.\n  After the Consumer Energy Commission has studied energy price spikes \ncomprehensively, its charge will be to develop options for how to avert \nor mitigate price spikes. These recommendations can range from \nlegislative and administrative actions to voluntary industry and \nconsumer actions that can help protect consumers from the fluctuating \ncosts of energy products.\n  This Commission will be well-balanced, not only to reflect all groups \nwith a stake in energy price spikes, but also to reflect both political \nparties. No commission has ever before brought together such a diverse \ngroup to study such a complex problem in a holistic manner. No \ncommission has ever promised to see things from the perception of \nconsumers: families and businesses that routinely face energy price \nspikes. The Consumer Energy Commission is long overdue, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3074\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, amendment No. 3074 would establish a \nConserve by Bike Pilot Program in the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, as well as fund a research initiative on the potential \nenergy savings of replacing car trips with bike trips. This program \nwould fund 10 projects throughout the country, using education and \nmarketing to convert car trips to bike trips. The research would \ndocument the energy conservation, air quality improvement, and public \nhealth benefits caused by increased bike trips. The goal is to conserve \nenergy resources used in the transportation sector by turning some of \nour gas guzzling miles into bike rides.\n  There is no single solution for our Nation's energy challenges. Every \npossible approach must be considered in order to solve our energy \nproblems. Something as simple as traveling by bike instead of car can \nplay an important role in reducing our dependence on foreign oil. \nEnergy conservation does not have to be difficult: it can be as \neconomical, healthy, and environmentally friendly as a bike ride.\n  It would be unrealistic to expect Americans to make a substantial \nincrease in the number of trips they make by bicycle. But even a tiny \npercentage of bike trips replacing our shorter cars trips could make a \nsignificant difference in oil and gas consumption.\n  Right now, less than one trip in one hundred, .88 percent, is by \nbicycle. If we can raise our level of cycling just a tiny bit: to one \nand a half trips per hundred, which is less than a bike trip every 2 \nweeks for the average person, we would save over 462 million gallons of \ngasoline in a year, worth over $721 million. That's one day a year we \nwon't need to import any foreign oil.\n  In addition to conserving our energy, an increased number of bike \ntrips can improve our air quality. Significant declines in vehicle \nemissions would follow from increased bike trips. A study in New York \nCity showed that bicycling spares the city almost 6,000 tons of carbon \nmonoxide each year. A reduced number of trips made by cars would \nincrease this number and help to clean our nation's air.\n  The Federal Highway Administration estimates that 60 percent of all \nautomobile trips are under five miles in length. And these short trips \ntypically emit more pollutants because cars during these trips run on \ncold engines. Engines running cold produce five times\n\n[[Page S2239]]\n\nthe carbon monoxide and twice the hydrocarbon emissions per mile as \nengines running hot. These cold engine trips could most easily be \nreplaced by bike rides.\n  Americans would experience additional advantages from increased bike \nusage. The decreased number of cars on our nation's highways would help \nreduce traffic and parking congestion. Congestion costs have reached as \nhigh as $100 billion annually according to the Federal Highway \nAdministration. A reduction in cars on the roads will decrease the high \ncosts associated with congestion.\n  The ``Conserve by Bike'' amendment will also improve public health. \nThe exercise from more frequent bike trips would help improve our \nphysical well-being. Biking has proven to be effective in the \nprevention of heart disease, our nation's number one killer. And, \nbiking has also shown to help individuals in the correction of health-\nimpairing behaviors like smoking and alcohol abuse.\n  The ``Conserve by Bike'' amendment will help America take a simple \nbut meaningful step in energy conservation. It will help fund 10 pilot \nprojects that will use education and marketing to facilitate the \nconversion of car trips to bike trips, and document the energy savings \nfrom these trips. These projects will facilitate partnerships among \nthose in the transportation, energy, environment, public health, \neducation, and law enforcement sectors. There is a requirement for a \nlocal match in funding, so that these projects can continue after the \nfederal resources are exhausted.\n  In addition, this amendment will fund a research initiative with the \nNational Academy of Sciences. The study will examine such factors as \nweather, land use and traffic patterns, bicycle facility \ninfrastructure, to identify what trips Americans could reasonably take \nby bike. It will also illustrate the benefits of converting bike trips \nto car trips, and explore ways that we can encourage Americans to pedal \nrather than gas guzzle.\n  It is imperative that Americans are fully informed of the entire \nrange of benefits from biking in terms of energy conservation, air \nquality, and public health. We also need to provide the best resources \nin bike safety and convenience.\n  We have been spending a modest amount of federal, state and local \nfunds on bicycle facilities since 1991. This amendment will leverage \nthose investments and help people take advantage of the energy \nconservation choices they have in getting around their communities. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Iowa in \nthe Chamber. Does he wish to have the floor?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. For about 6 minutes. Would that be possible?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my patience is becoming greatly strained, \nbut I will yield to the Senator.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to the Senator from Iowa for \nnot to exceed 10 minutes, without my losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Earlier today, unanimous consent was requested on the \npart of Senator Lott that the Andean pact come before the Senate. That \nrequest was not granted. So I rise to express my regret of that \nhappening and to express my support for the fact that the Andean Trade \nPreferences Act legislation should be on the floor and should have been \nconsidered by now. I am concerned if the Senate doesn't act early on \nthe Andean trade bill, that America's continued leadership in the \ninternational arena of trade will be severely impaired.\n  Specifically, I fear our failure to approve this legislation in a \ntimely manner will undermine our ability to constructively engage with \nour Latin American neighbors at a time when many of them face enormous \neconomic and political challenges.\n  Today, President Bush leaves on an important mission to Latin \nAmerica. Just on Saturday, he will visit Peru, one of the Andean \nnations, where he will meet with four Andean leaders. President Bush's \ntrip builds on a long tradition of promoting vigorous United States \nengagement with Latin America that started as far back as President \nKennedy's Alliance for Progress in the 1960s.\n  As did President Kennedy, President Bush has a vision for Latin \nAmerica. The President wants to tell our Andean neighbors--Peru, \nColombia, Bolivia, and Ecuador--that the United States wants to be \ntheir hemispheric partner in peace. He wants to tell them that trade \nand prosperity go hand in hand.\n  President Bush wants to make the case that the benefits of trade are \nnot just for rich countries like the United States; they are also for \ncountries that aspire to become rich countries; for countries that want \nbetter, more secure lives for their citizens; for countries that want \nbetter health care, better education, and better futures for their \nchildren.\n\n  President Bush wants to encourage our Andean neighbors to use trade \nto promote economic development through a diversified export base as an \nalternative to the allure of the drug trade.\n  When President Kennedy unveiled his Alliance for Progress in 1961, he \nsaid if we were bold and determined enough, our efforts to reach out to \nLatin America could mark the beginning of a new era in the American \nexperience. This is just as true today as it was way back in 1961.\n  Through the Andean pact, and complimentary trade initiatives such as \nthe Free Trade Area of the Americas, we can achieve a new era of \nhemispheric economic cooperation that benefits everybody--not just \nthese four countries, not just the United States, but it has a benefit \nway beyond that.\n  The Andean nations know trade, not aid, is the best way to overcome \nthe fragmentation of Latin American economies, and to build the self-\nsustaining growth that nourishes democratic institutions.\n  But because the Andean trade bill still languishes in the Senate--\nalong with another important bill, trade promotion authority, another \nvitally important trade bill as well--the President's trip will not be \nas effective as it could have been if the Senate had acted. Obviously, \nwe should expect our President to be successful and want him to be \nsuccessful.\n  For a long time, we had a tradition in this country that politics \nstops at the water's edge. Unfortunately, that is not as true now as it \nonce was. A lot of trade and foreign policy issues get entangled with \nour domestic partisan politics. I very much regret this development \nbecause it is very harmful to the U.S. leadership in any subject but \nparticularly in the area of trade. It is harmful to the enhanced \nprospects for prosperity and peace that we are trying to promote around \nthe world, and commercialization is a very useful tool in promoting \nworld trade.\n  Mr. President, the other day, the lead editorial of the Washington \nPost addressed the issue of the Senate majority leader's failure to \nbring up the Andean trade pact. I would like to read a portion of that \neditorial, which appeared March 19 in the Washington Post:\n  The Senate's failure to help the four Andean states--Colombia, Peru, \nEcuador and Bolivia--is particularly egregious. A package of trade \nconcessions has passed through committee and commands an overwhelming \nmajority of the full chamber. . . . Only a handful of Senators opposes \nthe package. But the Senate leadership has failed to bring it to the \nfloor, making it likely that Mr. Bush will arrive in Peru empty-handed \n. . . at a time when American leadership in Latin America is being \nquestioned, the least the Senate could do is to pass a trade measure \nthat almost nobody opposes.\n  As is clear from my point of view, the time to act was months ago. \nBut it is never too late to do the right thing. We had that opportunity \ntoday and it failed. So I urge my colleagues to, just as soon as we get \nback from the Easter recess, put not only the Andean pact but other \ntrade issues very high on the agenda and get them passed and help us to \nhelp these Andean nations, which\n\n[[Page S2240]]\n\nare so poor and need our help. Trade is one way to get them the \nnecessary help and develop a good economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, after a mild and dry winter full of false \nstarts, of periods of almost summery weather followed by cold and \nblustery winds, spring is truly here--here in all of its glory. In that \nsubtle change, the gradual brightening of days and warming of the \nearth, most of us can sense our mood shifting. Our hearts are \ngladdened, our spirits are raised, our optimism is buoyed up by more \nthan the improving economic forecasts. As we cast off the last days of \nwinter and welcome in the spring, we shed our weary spirits along with \nour heavy coats. Spring is here. Here it is. How sweet it is--spring. \nOur hearts echo the deep joy of Samuel Pepys' song, the poet Robert \nBrowning's ode to spring:\n\n       The year's at the spring\n       And the day's at the morn;\n       Morning's at seven;\n       The hillside's dew-pearled;\n\n       The lark's on the wing;\n       The snail's on the thorn;\n       God's in his Heaven--\n       All's right with the world!\n  The pansies that bloomed all winter on sheltered porches in bright \ndefiance of the calendar are in their glory, joined by crocuses and \nnodding daffodils bursting through the cold earth. Lilac bushes are \nbudding, promising sweet scents to come, and the gray and gnarled \nbranches of old pear and apple trees are bursting forth in showy, snowy \nblossoms. Gregarious robins have returned, massed on warming lawns \nlistening intently for industrious earthworms engaged in their \nsubterranean tilling. Bluebirds flit and swoop among the still bare \nbranches and the goldfinches, busy at the backyard feeders, are \nbrightening their coloring in preparation for springtime courtship.\n  Color is washing over the land. Redbud trees add rosy tints to gray \nwoodlands while cheerful daffodils and forsythia bushes sparkle amid \ndrab lawns and gardens. If winter brings to mind the talents of artists \nin charcoal sketches or the great etchers with their mastery of pattern \nand shading in the bold geometry of bare branches carved against \na snowy ground, spring calls for watercolorists and sketchers in \npastels with bright translucent colors that capture the fragile \nclearness of the springtime sunshine. Summer and fall may belong to the \noil painters with their deep saturated colors and massing of light and \nshade, but it takes a swift hand and brush to pin down the quicksilver \nmoods of springtime.\n\n  Under foot, the cold ground yields to springtime loam begging for the \ngardener's spade. Dry stalks blush with the green glow of new growth \nthat springtime's new calves tentatively nibble. The cattle are happy \nfor the fresh grass after a long autumn and winter eating hay. I know \nthat farmers in West Virginia are hoping for good spring rains to \nreplenish the water supplies and encourage a good growth of hay after \nlast year's dry spells. Pastures have been cropped close and hay \nsupplies are dwindling since the autumn drought sent pasture grass into \nan early dormancy. We need rain--soft rain.\n  Rain in the springtime is a lovely thing, gentle and welcome, unlike \nrain in other seasons. In summer, thunderstorms are violent, dramatic \nevents, noisy and flooding, leaving streets steaming. In autumn, the \nrain can become monotonous, day after dreary day of steady sodden \ndownpour filling the gutters with matted, decaying leaves. And in \nwinter, cold, stinging sleet makes travel on dark roads and slick \nsidewalks treacherous. But in the spring, the rain is misty and \ncompanionable as my little dog Billy and I conduct our inspection tours \nof flower beds, the turf soft beneath our feet. Flower petals gain an \nadded brightness from their raindrop ornaments. Spiderwebs become tiny \ncrystal chandeliers draped with tiny drops in a soft and misty rain. \nAnd after the rain, there are rainbows shimmering like dreams overhead.\n\n     I asked the robin, as he sprang,\n     What made his breast so round and red;\n     Twas looking at the sun, he said.\n     I asked the violets, sweet and blue,\n     Sparkling in the morning dew,\n     Whence came their colors, then so shy;\n     They answered, ``looking to the sky'';\n     I saw the roses, one by one,\n     Unfold their petals to the sun,\n     I asked them what made their tints so bright,\n     And they answered, ``looking to the sky'';\n     I asked the thrush, whose silvery note\n     Came like a song from angel's throat,\n     Why he sang in the twilight dim;\n     He answered, ``looking up at Him.''\n\n  In springtime, at Eastertide, as we celebrate the great awakening of \nlife reborn, one only has to look outside to appreciate the Creator's \nhandiwork. The earth is His page, the seasons His poetry writ fresh for \nus each morning.\n\n     Welcome, yellow buttercups!\n     Welcome, daisies white!\n     Ye are in my spirit\n     Visioned, a delight!\n     Coming ere the spring-time,\n     Of sunny hours to tell,\n     Speaking to our hearts of Him\n     Who doeth all things well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 46 years ago the South Dakota Democratic \nParty was hardly more than George McGovern, George Cunningham, and a \nbeat up old station wagon. I was eight. Little did I know I would one \nday owe a career to those two men and that car.\n  One of those men is now world-famous, his name a synonym for \npolitical courage and common decency. The other, George Cunningham, is \nunknown to most.\n  But George Cunningham is known to me.\n  I know him as the man who flew quietly to South Dakota to rescue a \npolitical newborn from a life-threatening recount in 1978. I know him \nfor his wise counsel during a testing challenge from Congressman Clint \nRoberts, and through the other muddles of my political adolescence. I \nknow George as the man from whom my own George Cunningham, Pete \nStavrianos, says he learned both his trade and his passion for that \ntrade. And I know George Cunningham as the diabolical practical joker \nwhose powers to disarm and confuse with his wit remain to this day the \nmost powerful antidote to self-importance I have ever witnessed.\n  ``GVC,'' as he was known to those familiar with his smoking IBM \nSelectric, is a man who has never taken himself too seriously, but has \nalways fiercely insisted his lifetime profession be taken seriously.\n  I will never forget hearing about George Cunningham telling a \nreporter who asked about his polls during his campaign against Larry \nPressler that his numbers were, ``in the toilet.'' The stunned newsman \nhad expected a deer in the headlights lie from a scared politician \nfacing defeat. What he got was an honest admission from a strong man \nwho was still teaching, even through his hurt, how to laugh honestly in \nthe face of adversity, and in so doing, respect what one was about.\n  What George Vinton Cunningham was about, and what he is still about, \nis service to the public.\n  From his first campaign with George McGovern while still a law \nstudent at USD, through his service to Governor Herseth in 1959, his 20 \nyears beside George McGovern in Washington, his return to his hometown \nof Watertown, SD, as a candidate for U.S. Senate, and his tenure as \nlawyer and party activist, George Cunningham has taught us all what it \nmeans to serve.\n  Cunningham is a short, non-descript man who, while chief of staff to \na candidate for President of the United States, used to send friends \nunflattering pictures of himself in safari garb holding a rifle in one \nhand and his\n\n[[Page S2241]]\n\ntrademark pipe in the other. I always thought it was to remind folks \nyou didn't have to be Redford handsome or Kennedy strong to go after \nbig game.\n  What you do have to be, though, is committed to the idea that we are \nput here for something more than just serving ourselves.\n  I like to think I am committed to that idea. I hope when I am through \nI will be judged to have been half as committed to it as one of the \nbiggest little men I have been privileged to know, George Cunningham.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2241-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS IN UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

A recent \nCommission briefing on the parliamentary elections brought together \nexperts to assess the conduct of the campaign. High level visits to \nUkraine have underscored the importance the United States attaches to \nthese elections in the run up to presidential elections scheduled for \n2004.\n  As of today, with less than two weeks left before the elections, it \nremains an open question as to whether the elections will be a step \nforward for Ukraine. Despite considerable international attention, \nthere are credible reports of various abuses and violations of the \nelection law, including candidates refused access to media, the \nunlawful use of public funds and facilities, and government pressure on \ncertain political parties, candidates and media outlets, and a pro-\ngovernment bias in the public media.\n  Ukraine's success as an independent, democratic, economically \nsuccessful state is vital to stability and security and Europe, and \nUkraine has, over the last decade, enjoyed a strong relationship with \nthe United States. This positive relationship, however, has been \nincreasingly tested in the last few years because of pervasive levels \nof corruption in Ukraine and the still-unresolved case of murdered \ninvestigative journalist Georgiy Gongadze and other issues which call \ninto question the Ukrainian authorities' commitment to the rule of law \nand respect of human rights.\n  Ukraine enjoys goodwill in the United States Senate and remains one \nof our largest recipients of U.S. assistance in the world. These \nelections are an important indication of the Ukrainian authorities' \ncommitment to consolidate democracy and to demonstrate a serious intent \nregarding integration into the Euro-Atlantic community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2241-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2241-S2243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NEXT STEPS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV/AIDS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, by now I hope that all of my colleagues are \naware of the extent of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The spread of the disease \nis of grave humanitarian and security concern to the United States.\n  Last year alone, 3 million people died as a result of the disease. I \nhave yet to see a study or data which suggests that the number will not \nincrease in 2002.\n  In January of 2000 the National Intelligence Council released a \nNational Intelligence Estimate entitled ``The Global Infectious Disease \nThreat and its Implications for the United States.'' The report stated \nthat ``the severe social and economic impact of infectious diseases, \nparticularly HIV/AIDS, and the infiltration of these diseases into the \nruling political and military elites and middle classes of developing \ncountries are likely to intensify the struggle for political power to \ncontrol scarce state resources. This will hamper the development of a \ncivil society and other underpinnings of democracy and will increase \npressure on democratic transitions in regions such as the FSU [former \nSoviet Union] and Sub-Saharan Africa where the infectious disease \nburden will add to economic misery and political polarization.''\n  On February 13 of this year I chaired a hearing on the future of \nAmerica's bilateral and multilateral response to the epidemic. What I \nlearned was both encouraging and discouraging. First, the bad news. The \ndisease continues to spread. Last year, five million people were \ninfected with HIV/AIDS, bringing the total number of people with the \ndisease to 40 million. There are more AIDS orphans than ever before, \nover 10.4 million, and that number is expected to more than double in \nthe next 8 years as more and more adults fall ill and die.\n  In some parts of the world, women are becoming infected at rates \ncomparable to men. This change in the infection pattern is tragic not \nonly because the increase is a reflection of women and girls' inability \nto say no, in many instances, to unwanted sexual advances, but also \nbecause the more women who are infected, the greater the number of \nbabies there are who are liable to contract HIV during birth or from \ndrinking their infected mother's breast milk.\n  The good news is that the international community is beginning not \nonly to recognize the need for more action, it is beginning to take \nmore action. We are beginning to go beyond rhetoric towards concrete \nsteps. We have established Global Funds for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and \nMalaria. The U.S. Government has increased the amount of spending on \nbilateral programs. The problem is that we have not yet gone far \nenough. Despite our efforts to date, the problem continues to grow.\n  There are no easy solutions. I will not stand here and say that I \nhave a magic formula for stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS. We must \nrecognize, however, that while the problem is not going away any time \nsoon, there are some steps we can take immediately and in the long-term \nthat will help mitigate the effects of the disease and eventually stop \nit in its tracks.\n  A serious commitment is required. A lot of times when we talk about \ncommitment in this chamber we are talking about 6 to 18 months. I am \ntalking about a commitment of years. Not 2 years. Not 3 years. Start \nthinking in terms of a decade or more. According to the UN, studies of \nmiddle and low-income countries where interventions have slowed the \nspread of the disease, we need to spend $7 to $10 billion annually on \ntreatment, care and support in the developing world for the next 10 \nyears if we are to change current trends.\n  The UN estimates that if we are going to bring HIV infection rates \ndown, by the year 2005 the international community is going to have to \nscale up spending to $9.2 billion. That money does not include funds \nfor improving the health and education infrastructure in developing \ncountries. It only covers prevention care and support programs. 2001 \nexpenditures, according to this same report were only $1.8 billion.\n  We have a long way to go. And we will have to readjust our mind-sets \nsuch that we are prepared to stay the course financially for a long \ntime to come, or nothing we do is going to have a lasting impact.\n  So what is to be done if we are willing to adopt such an approach?\n  The ultimate solution to this problem is the development of a \nvaccine. Scientists are working on one, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, director \nof the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the \nNational Institutes of Health was quoted in the Los Angeles Times on \nMarch 16 as saying\n\n[[Page S2242]]\n\nthat this could take at least ten more years. In the meantime, we have \ngot to undertake action to bring the infection rate down as far as \npossible, and to care for those who have contracted the disease.\n  Part of the problem we are having in stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS \nis the basic barrier of underdevelopment. One of the things that has \nfacilitated the spread of the disease in developing nations has been \nlack of infrastructure, mainly in the communication, education and \nhealth sectors. People in remote villages in a poor country do not have \nthe luxury of picking up a local paper or watching the local news on \ntheir televisions. There is no easy way to spread the word about the \nHIV/AIDS. If there are schools, they are irregularly attended, which \nblocks another avenue of informing people about the disease.\n  Health in poor countries are deplorable. Helping countries improve \nbasic health services will go a long way towards addressing HIV/AIDS. \nThis includes training medical personnel, building and or repairing \nclinics and providing medical supplies and equipment. The benefits of \nimproved health infrastructure are enormous. HIV/AIDS is not the only \ndisease affecting poor countries. By improving health infrastructure, \nwe improve the level of access to basic health care for other diseases \nsuch as tuberculosis and malaria. And devoting more resources to \nimproving the health sector has the advantage of laying down the \ngroundwork for AIDS treatment activities.\n  Addressing educational needs and health infrastructure are two long-\nterm investments that the United States, in conjunction with our \ninternational partners need to make. This disease is going to be around \nfor a long time. Especially if we fail to act.\n  What should we do in the short term to address the global epidemic? \nThere are several things that we can do immediately to enhance our \nresponse.\n  First, we should strengthen coordination of U.S. agencies so that we \nare dealing with the problem in the most efficient way. The President \nhas taken some steps to address it, naming Secretary of State Colin \nPowell and Tommy Thompson, Secretary of Health and Human Services, as \nco-chairs of a Cabinet-level task force on the global HIV/AIDS threat. \nI do not believe, however that this really solves the problem.\n  Developing an integrated U.S. response to the global AIDS epidemic \nwill require more time and energy than two Cabinet-level Secretaries \ncan devote to it. We need someone working full time on integrating the \ngreat work that different U.S. agencies are doing. He or she must have \nthe authority to develop a U.S. policy response that is informed by all \nU.S. government agencies spending money on HIV/AIDS. This person should \nbe accountable for the implementation of the strategy, and required to \nreport on the implementation of the consolidated U.S. strategy on a \nyearly basis.\n  The coordinator must have the authority to bring the point people on \nHIV/AIDS programs in all the different agencies to one table and have \nthem figure out what tasks their respective agencies should be \nundertaking based on areas of comparative advantage and expertise. \nFinally, the coordinator needs the authority to eliminate overlaps \nwhere possible, identify gaps and decisively settle turf disputes among \nagencies about areas of responsibility.\n  The second step to enhancing the U.S. response is beginning the \nprocess of providing deeper levels of debt relief to poor nations. It \nmay take a while for countries to realize these savings, but we have \ngot to begin negotiations for an enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor \nCountries Initiative right away. We must make sure that countries where \nthere is a severe HIV/AIDS emergency and which are at or beyond a \ndecision point in the HIPC process are paying no more than 5 percent \ntheir fiscal revenue in debt servicing. Countries where there is no \nhealth emergency should be paying no more than 10 percent of fiscal \nrevenue in debt servicing.\n  Why enhance debt relief? Because all the early indicators are that \ndebt relief works. According to the World Bank, Burkina Faso, Uganda, \nand Malawi are all using debt relief saving to fight HIV/AIDS. Now is \nnot the time to be come complacent, but to make a bold move forward, to \ncapitalize on this success by taking debt relief one step farther.\n  Part and parcel with enhanced debt relief should be the provision of \ntechnical assistance to countries, to ensure that an adequate amount of \ndebt relief savings are devoted to programs to combat HIV/AIDS.\n  We must expand the provision of crucial interventions such as \nvoluntary testing and counseling if we are to enhance the U.S. response \nto HIV/AIDS. Voluntary testing and counseling is a cornerstone of \nintervention. One particular study conducted in three African countries \nshowed that given the opportunity for such testing, 60 percent of \nadults would take advantage. It also showed that only 15 percent of \nthose same people had access to this service. Think about it. Fifteen \npercent of those who wanted to know if they had HIV/AIDS were able to \nget an answer.\n  The importance of voluntary testing and counseling cannot be \noverstated. Once people find out whether or not they are infected with \nHIV, they are able to make decisions about behavior change that can \nsave their lives and the lives of their partners, spouses and children. \nIt is crucial that we provide the funds to training more counselors, \nand deliver more rapid test kits to areas of need so that those who \nwant testing and counseling can obtain it.\n  In addition to the above activities, I encourage the administration \nto expand its efforts to help developing nations craft and implement \nnational blood transfusion policies including policies to prevent HIV \ninfection through blood transfusions. Such programs are especially \nneeded in Africa. Some people might contend that this should be a \nrelatively low priority as the HIV infection rate from blood \ntransfusion is only 5 percent. I would argue that we have to do \neverything we can to address the spread of the disease, and that this \nis an intervention that is straightforward, and that has benefits that \nextend beyond combating HIV/AIDS.\n  At the Foreign Relations Committee hearing on HIV/AIDS on February \n13, USAID Administrator Natsios indicated that to the best of his \nknowledge less than fifty percent of African countries have developed a \nnational blood transfusion policy and less than one third of African \ncountries have a system in place to limit HIV transmission through \nblood transfusions. Here in America we have virtually eliminated the \nthreat of contacting HIV/AIDS through blood transfusion by adopting \nscreening and evaluation policies.\n  We have the expertise to see that health care workers in Africa and \nelsewhere are properly trained in appropriate clinical use of blood \ntransfusions and in proper transfusions techniques. We can teach best \npractices for testing. We can show countries how to recruit and retain \nnon-remunerated blood donors from uninfected portions of the population \nso that a safe, tested bloods supply is available. Last year in Africa, \n3.4 million people were infected with HIV. If there had been national \nsystems to monitor, manage and test the blood guppy for HIV, perhaps as \nmany as 170,000 of those people might be HIV free today.\n  Another way to strengthen U.S. response is to expand programs that \nspecifically focus on women and girls. Due to biological vulnerability, \nand economic and social pressures, women and girls in Africa are far \nmore likely to contract HIV than boys and men the same age. According \nto UNAIDS, girls age 15 to 19 are almost eight times more likely to be \ninfected with HIV/AIDS than their male counterparts. Women aged 20 to \n24 were 3 times more likely to be HIV-positive chant their male peers.\n  There is no easy way to counteract this phenomenon, but there are a \nnumber of steps which can be taken. In the long term, social and \ncultural norms must be changed to increase the economic and social \nindependence of women. It is easier for a woman to reject unwanted \nsexual advances if she is able to provide materially for herself and \nher children. Men must be educated as to the dangers of unprotected \nextramarital sex. In addition, we must emphasize education programs. It \nis imperative that young people know how to prevent the spread of HIV/\nAIDS. There are solutions which we must work on with renewed vigor.\n  Right now, today, we must channel more resources towards research \ninto\n\n[[Page S2243]]\n\nfemale controlled and initiated methods of prevention such as the \nfemale condom and microbicides.\n  A usable microbicide must be developed so that women, with or without \nthe consent of a partner, can protect themselves from HIV/AIDS. We are \nat least five years away from the availability of a first generation \nproduct. Not only must we see that one is developed, we must make sure \nthat it is usable and made available in developing countries, that \nwomen are informed about its availability, and that they are instructed \nin its use.\n  We should put more money into increasing the availability of the \nfemale condom, and continuing to refine the product. The female condom \nis not a miracle solution. Critics contend that women cannot use them \nwithout the knowledge of their partners, therefore it is redundant to \nmake them available when the male condom is so readily available. What \nI would say is that if we are willing to make the choice available to \nmen to use protection, we should be willing to give women a choice \nabout protecting themselves as well.\n  Right now part of the reason that female condoms are not available is \nprice. A bulk purchase would serve to lower the cost to the consumer. \nAnother problem is information. We must teach people about the female \ncondom's existence, and show people how to use it.\n  The female condom is the only female initiated method of prevention \navailable right now to women living in societies where their ability to \nmake choices about when and with whom they are physically intimate are \nin some cases limited, and in other cases non-existent. Since the \nbeginning of the epidemic, 10 million women have died of HIV/AIDS, over \na million of them in the past year. Women are becoming increasingly \naffected. We must use every means we have to reverse these trends.\n  I would also submit that it is important that the United States give \ngenerously to the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The \nU.S. must consistently show leadership in our donations. In May of last \nyear, the President pledged $200 million in seed money for the fund. \nOther nations followed suit. None of them pledged more than the United \nStates. The UK, Japan, and Italy all pledged $200 million. This is a \nperfect example of the fact that where the U.S. leads, others will \nfollow. There are now almost $2 billion in pledges for the fund; $800 \nmillion is expected to be available this year. The call for proposals \nwent out in January, and the first grants are expected to be made in \nApril.\n  While I in no way fault the President for his initial pledge, I can't \nhelp but wonder how much money would have been donated to the Global \nFund this past year if America's contribution had been $500 million \ninstead of $200 million.\n  The Global Fund is a welcome addition to the fight against HIV/AIDS, \nbut it must be just that--an addition. Contributions must not take the \nplace of bilateral programs.\n  Finally, I submit that the job of defeating HIV/AIDS is too big for \nthe United States to handle alone. We need the help of the \ninternational community. I cannot state this in strong enough terms. We \nmust encourage other donors to do their share to help halt the \nepidemic. The U.S. Government provides nearly 50 percent of HIV/AIDS \nassistance funds. This is 4 times as much as the next donor. It is \nimperative that other donors be full partners in this fight both in \ntheir bilateral programs and their pledges to the Global Fund. We \ncannot win this war without their help.\n  The steps I have outlined above are just that. None of what I have \ntalked about is a prescription for a solution to the AIDS epidemic. \nMost of it is not new. I simply stand here before you today to point \nout that despite our best efforts the virus is marching on. However the \nsituation is not hopeless by any means. The United States has been an \ninnovator, devising effective programs to mitigate and reverse the \nglobal spread of AIDS. We cannot stop.\n  I hope that Congress and the Administration can work together to \nreinvigorate and enhance current efforts to stem the tide of HIV/AIDS \ninfection and care for and support those with the disease. Failure to \ndo so will mean the death of an entire generation of people. That is \nmuch too steep a price to pay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2243-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern and \ndismay at the news of yet another suicide bombing in Jerusalem. My \nthoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families.\n  Israel, a democratic state and a staunch friend and ally of the \nUnited States, has a simple desire that all sovereign nations share: \nthat it may live in peace within secure and stable borders, free from \nthe terror and senseless acts of violence.\n  I condemn this terrorism and those who carry it out. How many more \ninnocent lives must be lost before Chairman Arafat takes decisive and \nconcerted action to reign in the terrorists and put an end to their \nbrutal campaign? He made a commitment at Oslo to settle the differences \nbetween Palestinians and Israelis peacefully and he must live up to \nthat pledge.\n  I am pleased that President Bush has sent General Zinni back to the \nMiddle East to broker a cease-fire and get both sides to adhere to the \nTenet Plan. To put it mildly, he has a long road ahead of him and there \nis a lot of work to be done.\n  Three articles discuss the situation in the Middle East: one by \nWashington Times columnist Mona Charon, another by Libby Werthan from \nthe Nashville Jewish paper, the Observer, and finally an article by \nNaomi Regan called ``Living in Parallel Universe.''\n  Each article in its own way describes some of the pain, anguish, and \ndespair that Israelis feel over the continuing acts of violence and the \ncollapse of the peace process. I urge my colleagues to read these \narticles and take their message to heart. Israel wants peace. Israel \nneeds peace. Israel deserves peace.\n  I hope the day will come when I will not have to come to the Senate \nfloor to condemn yet another bombing. Enough is enough. I urge General \nZinni and the administration to do all that they can to help bring \nabout an end the violence and the resumption of peace talks.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the articles I cited.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Augusta Chronicle, March 9, 2002]\n\n                    Flawed Saudi Peace Plan Exposed\n\n                            (By Mona Charen)\n\n       Imagine for a moment that all reporting about the U.S. war \n     on terrorism was presented without reference to Sept. 11. \n     American attacks from the air using B-52s and F-16s against \n     fighters armed with small weapons would seem quite \n     disproportionate. Our stated intention to kill as many \n     members of al Qaida as possible might be condemned, by our \n     own Department of State, as ``excessive'' and ``contributing \n     to the cycle of violence.''\n       But U.S. actions are never presented that way, because \n     everyone acknowledges that we have the perfect right to \n     defend ourselves against those who have done us grave harm. \n     Nor are we asked to sit by and wait for our enemies to do us \n     even more catastrophic damage if they get the chance. But \n     when it comes to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, the \n     context is removed. Bleeding Israel is daily exhorted to stop \n     contributing the cycle of violence. Her teen-agers are blown \n     to bits at discotheques. Her babies are approached outside a \n     synagogue by a suicide bomber who\n\n[[Page S2244]]\n\n     waits until he is next to the strollers before blowing \n     himself apart. Her adolescent boys who wander off in the \n     desert and get lost are torn to pieces. And all of this is \n     applauded and celebrated by Yasser Arafat and most of the \n     Arab governments in the region.\n       Some Arabs (those among the minority who acknowledge that \n     Arabs are responsible) condemned the bombing of the World \n     Trade Center. But not a single Islamic scholar or cleric has \n     condemned the systemic policy of blowing up Israeli \n     civilians. Israelis are demoralized and terrified. \n     Restaurants and shops are nearly empty. And, alone among \n     nations apparently, Israel is not permitted to engage in \n     simple self-defense.\n       Nearly every dispatch from the Middle East lacks basic \n     context. Here are some of the facts to keep in mind when \n     reading these flawed reports.\n       The PLO was not formed in order to secure a Palestinian \n     state on the West Bank and Gaza. It was created in 1964, when \n     both territories were under Arab sovereignty. Jordan and \n     Egypt did not create a state for the Palestinians because \n     they preferred to keep the refugees angry and homeless.\n       It is not ``Palestinian land.'' There has never been an \n     independent Palestinian state on the land between the \n     Mediterranean and the Jordan River. The area--which always \n     contained Arabs and Jews--was under Ottoman control for \n     several hundred years until World War I, then British control \n     under the League of Nations Mandate and finally under United \n     Nations control.\n       The United Nations approved a partition plan in 1947 that \n     would have created two states, on Jewish and one Arab. The \n     Jews accepted this arrangement. The Arabs refused. Five Arab \n     armies invaded the new state of Israel. In the ensuing war, \n     thousands of refugees fled. Jews fled Arab nations for \n     Israel, and Arabs fled Israel for Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon. \n     The Jewish refugees became full citizens of Israel. the \n     Palestinian refugees became pawns. Israel came into \n     possession of the West Bank and Gaza only because she was \n     attacked again by five Arab armies in 1967.\n       If the Palestinians are fighting for a state on the West \n     Bank and Gaza, why do their maps show Palestine as filling \n     the entire territory that is now Israel? Why do they marinate \n     their people in Hitlerian anti-Semitism and anti-Anercianism? \n     Further, why--when Ehud Barak offered just such a state, or \n     95 percent of it--did Arafat walk away and start this latest \n     round of violence? Palestinian spokesman say it wasn't \n     everything they wanted. But if they truly want a separate \n     state on so-called ``occupied territory,'' why did Barak's \n     offer not form the basis for further talks?\n       The Palestinians are said to be chafing under the \n     ``occupation.'' But in obedience to the Oslo process, Israel \n     has given administrative authority over 98 percent of the \n     Palestinians in the disputed territories to Arafat. Israel \n     has further permitted the Palestinian Authority to arm 40,000 \n     ``police.''\n       If the Saudi ``peace plan'' were serious--and not an \n     attempt to divert attention from the Saudi role in Sept. 11 \n     and its sponsorship of Islamic extremism worldwide--why \n     didn't Saudi Arabia offer it before?\n       Why is it impossible for the Palestinian Authority to give \n     Israel what Sharon has demanded--just three days of respite \n     from terror attacks?\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Living in a Parallel Universe\n\n                            (By Naomi Ragen)\n\n       As an Israeli, I don't always feel I'm living in the same \n     universe as the rest of the world. We seem to be in parallel \n     universes.\n       In my universe, Yasir Arafat has violated the Geneva \n     Convention on Human Rights--which calls the murder of \n     noncombatants a crime against humanity--in 11,326 terrorist \n     attacks over the last 18 months that has left hundreds of \n     Israelis dead and thousands injured. In my universe, that \n     makes him a war criminal.\n       But in the parallel universe, it makes him a great freedom \n     fighter who deserves visits from diplomats, sympathy, and the \n     offer to head his own state where he can conceivably continue \n     his activities with a formal cache of even more deadly \n     weapons. In the parallel universe, the people who think this \n     way consider themselves liberals and humanists.\n       In my universe, Saudi Arabia, is a totalitarian state which \n     cuts off the limbs of thieves and stones women suspected of \n     adultery, and drowns young daughters in swimming pools to \n     preserve family honor. In my universe, it is a place where \n     women are nonpersons who cannot work, or drive, or go out \n     unaccompanied by men. In my universe, its exhibited medieval \n     antisemitism: In Saudi Arabias government daily, Al-Riyadh, \n     columnist Dr. Umayma Ahmad Al-Jalahma of King Faysal \n     University in Al-Dammam, wrote on 13/3/02 that the special \n     ingredient in Jewish Purim holiday cake is human blood from \n     non-Jewish youth.\n       In the parallel universe, this same Saudi Arabia has \n     suggested that Israel withdraw to its 67 borders for more \n     empty promises of peace and this is considered a serious \n     peace initiative which is soberly discussed by reporters, \n     politicians, talk show hosts, and editorial writers.\n       In my universe, following ten years of talking peace, \n     signing agreements in which the Palestinians agreed to \n     renounce the use of terror in exchange for Israel turning \n     over 95% of the West Bank and all of Gaza to Yasir Arafats \n     Palestinian Authority, giving the Authority millions of \n     dollars and thousands of guns to control the terrorists, \n     Israelis were rewarded by having their children blown up in \n     pizza parlors, discos, bar mitzvahs, and cafes; being shot in \n     their cars, having rockets destroy their homes and watching \n     Palestinians, who were our peace partners, celebrate these \n     deaths in their streets. In my universe, after wringing its \n     hands, and risking our lives, and making useless appeals to \n     Arafat to reign in his terrorists, our government finally \n     sent in soldiers to gather up the weapons. These terrorists, \n     who are ready to make ``brave'' forays into Israel in order \n     to shoot nine month-old babies and grandmothers, engaged in a \n     short gun battle until forced to surrender when confronted by \n     armed combatants.\n       In the parallel universe, Israelis are condemned for \n     ``humiliating'' Palestinians, and calls go out for \n     international observers to protect Palestinians.\n       In my universe, the United States, which has always seen \n     itself as Israel's greatest ally, and which has itself \n     suffered thousands of casualties from terrorist attacks by \n     Muslim extremists, calls on Yasir Arafat to stop the terror \n     on Israelis, and is ignored.\n       In the parallel universe, Israel's greatest ally reacts by \n     calling for the establishment of a Palestinian State, in \n     which Mr. Arafat, like any other head of State, can establish \n     his own army, airforce, and police force and import unlimited \n     amounts of arms. Where he can continue his present \n     educational system, encouraging toddlers to view themselves \n     as future Shahids, where present educational system, \n     encouraging toddlers to view themselves as future Shahids; \n     where his television and radio broadcasts can continue to \n     show blood libels, and revel in nonstop incitement. Where \n     instead of terrorist attacks, he can prepare himself to \n     launch all-out war.\n       I invite all those who are convinced they know what Israel \n     should do, to visit my universe before giving advice.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Observer (the Nashville Jewish paper)]\n\n                           (By Libby Werthan)\n\n       Last night as I lay in my comfortable bed in my lovely home \n     planning a pleasant night's sleep I could hear the guns in \n     Gilo. And I couldn't sleep; not because I was fearful for my \n     safety but because I couldn't help but think of all those \n     people living in Gilo (two neighborhoods away from us) and \n     how terrified they must be--especially the children. Thank G-\n     d only three people were injured but fifty-two apartments \n     were damaged by terrorist machine gun fire.\n       I would like to try to convey to you what life is like here \n     right now. I have told you long before that I thought the \n     Peace Process was just that a process that it wouldn't lead \n     to peace. And unfortunately, it has turned out that way. At \n     best, it was a holding period, a badly needed respite. In the \n     years following Oslo, we had a kind of freedom--a green \n     light, if you will; we could travel almost anywhere, enjoy \n     the country in relative safety.\n       After Arafat rejected the best deal he would ever get and \n     the Peace process came to a halt we found ourselves under \n     constant attack--suicide bombers (whom one expert said was a \n     misnomer, that they should be called Islamakazes), mortar \n     attacks knifings, murders and drive-by shootings. Every \n     morning, we open our newspapers and tally up how many people \n     were killed (about 350 to date) and how many more people were \n     permanently damaged--losing limbs, being burned so badly that \n     they will never leave home, seeing loved ones murdered--they \n     are their families will never be the same. I am talking about \n     thousands of people in the last 16 months, mostly children \n     and young people under the age of thirty.\n       What happened in America on 9/11 was horrifying. Over 3000 \n     people lost their lives in the World Trade Center. America \n     has a population of 278 million. Israel has a population of 6 \n     million. If you were to compare deaths per capita, Israel has \n     experienced almost 5 World Trade Centers in the last year and \n     a half. And that's only the deaths not the thousands \n     permanently injured. The majority have been civilians going \n     about their lives--mostly women and children. It's pretty \n     devastating when you think about it. You can imagine what \n     this has done to the psyche of our country.\n       But what I find even more incredible is the response of \n     Israel to this assault. The Israeli Army, has the power and \n     ability to go in and take over the whole Palestinian entity \n     in a matter of days. But they haven't done it. Instead they \n     have targeted the ringleaders, the bomb makers and their \n     installations (and been criticized for it). They have \n     isolated Arafat, the Father of Terrorism, (and been \n     criticized for it). They have bombed the installations of the \n     Palestinian Authority but not without first telling them that \n     they are going to do it. So when they do bomb buildings, they \n     are empty. They make every attempt to avoid injuring any \n     civilians. When the army entered the two refugee camps (which \n     by the way are so vicious and independent that the \n     Palestinian police won't enter them), they gave the civilians \n     three hours to leave the camp to get out of harm's way. In \n     view of the horrors perpetrated against us ours is the most \n     measured of responses. And yet the media doesn't report it \n     that way--they can't if they want to continue to have access \n     to the Palestinians. So they talk about Israel's heavy-\n     handedness, they talk about occupation, when 98% of the \n     territories are under Palestinian control, they highlight the \n     Palestinian deaths and over look many of ours. The media, \n     when being even-handed, will interview both a Palestinian and \n     an Israeli. But the Israelis they\n\n[[Page S2245]]\n\n     pick are either to the far Left or the far Right and are \n     clearly not representative of main stream Israel. Last week \n     they ran a story about a Palestinian women coming into Israel \n     to give birth and being wounded in the shoulder when her car \n     ran a roadblock. The don't follow it up with the fact that \n     she was taken quickly taken to hospital where she gave birth \n     to a healthy baby and recovered from her wound. Nor do they \n     tell you that the very next day a pregnant Israeli woman was \n     ambushed on the highway and shot in the abdomen as a gift to \n     the Palestinian woman. We go after those who are killing us. \n     We do not respond by targeting civilians.\n       I said earlier that for ten years we had a green light. We \n     no longer have that green light. It has been replaced by a \n     flashing yellow light. We still live our normal lives--go to \n     work--go to the mall--go to the movies--make gourmet \n     dinners--have weddings and bar mizvahs--work out--plant \n     gardens--go to lectures, concerts, and plays--all the normal \n     things one does. Except that flashing yellow light makes us \n     more aware of where we are and who's around us. When we hear \n     more than one siren, as we did last night, we run and turn on \n     the news--another suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowded \n     religious neighborhood. When we hear an explosion, it could \n     be something on a construction site or a car backfire, but we \n     think bomb. You might expect us to go around with long faces \n     and sometimes we do, but mostly not. Nevertheless we are \n     always hurting inside. We know so many are grieving. We see \n     the pictures of the beautiful young people who have been \n     killed and our hearts are breaking. The hardest part for me \n     and, I think, others is that there is no end in sight. How \n     long can this go on? What will happen next?\n       The talk is always, let's achieve calm let's get back to \n     the negotiating table. But with whom are we going to \n     negotiate? Arafat? Arafat, the inventor of terrorism; the \n     consummate liar! A man who prays for the peace of the brave \n     on the New York Times Op Ed page and at the very same time \n     shouts Jihad, a million martyrs on to Jerusalem to his own \n     people in Arabic. A man who has not only abused the \n     opportunity offered him for peace but has brutally abused his \n     own people by manipulation and lies. he is every bit as \n     vicious as Ben Laden. Would America negotiate with Ben Laden? \n     With whom then are we going to negotiate? And if we do find \n     someone how meaningful will a signed piece of paper be? There \n     are three generations of Palestinians here who have learned \n     to hate Jews from birth; who's greatest mitzvah is to kill a \n     Jew. How can that change with a piece of paper?\n       We are at a terrible impasse her. How do we protect \n     ourselves and at the same time create a Palestinian entity \n     that is self-sufficient and independent of us. This is it. \n     This is what every Israeli wants.\n       And what about you? Where do you fit into this Jewish world \n     of ours? I have told you about Israel, but what about \n     Argentina where over half of the Jews there are not living \n     under the poverty line, or France where Jews are experiencing \n     a huge upsurge of anti-Semitism.\n       And what about America? I don't know that much about \n     America; but what I do know disturbs me. I hear very little \n     raised in the way of protests against the biased media and \n     little rallying in support of Israel coming from the Jewish \n     communities in America. What I do know is that the Arab \n     propaganda is so strong and effective in the US that on the \n     college campuses your children and grandchildren have never \n     been more distanced from Israel and are in fact ashamed of \n     her. American Jewish visitors are so few here that we can \n     practically thank each one personally for coming. Our hotels \n     and restaurants are closing. Our tour guides and bus \n     companies are out of work.\n       Where are you when we need you? Are you writing to the \n     Congress to thank them for their support? Are you writing to \n     the President? What about letters to the editor? Are you \n     countering Palestinian propaganda on the college campuses? \n     Are you writing to CNN and NPR when their reporting is \n     clearly biased? Are you letting people here know that you \n     care? Have you contributed to a victim relief fund? What's \n     happening, folks?\n       When I was in America last month, I saw a lot of hand \n     wringing and got a lot of sympathetic comments. Mostly, \n     people wanted to know why I didn't come back and live there.\n       And what did I answer? I told them that we have had the \n     most fabulous twelve years of our lives here. Grant you the \n     last months have been painful. But when I think about why I \n     am here, what is boils down to is that living her is the most \n     important statement that I can make with my life.\n       Since I began this letter, the situation has become \n     increasing worse. While we apprehend and thwart countless \n     attackers, we cannot catch them all. Some slip through. On \n     Thursday, I sent Moshe down to the grocery (here the grocery \n     is so close you can walk) to pick up a few things I had \n     forgotten. When he arrived, the whole areas had been blocked \n     off, all traffic stopped. And police everywhere. Just minutes \n     before, a suicide bomber had entered a very popular outdoor \n     cafe but had been noticed by a customer who alerted a waiter \n     and together they pushed him out of the cafe and at the same \n     time ripped out the wires of the bomb--and saved the lives of \n     scores of people. These were just ordinary people, but they \n     performed an extraordinary task. On Friday the cafe was again \n     packed. Saturday night a bomber entering another packed cafe \n     in the center of town was not detected in time--13 were \n     killed and over 50 wounded.\n       In about an hour, Moshe and I and many of our neighbors are \n     going to take a walk in the Jerusalem Peace Forest--a part of \n     the Promenade that looks out over Jerusalem. Perhaps you have \n     been there. It is a popular tourist spot. Some weeks ago in \n     this place, a young Israeli college student, a girl, was \n     attacked by a gang of Arab teenagers and stabbed to death. \n     Our walk is symbolic. It's our way of saying you can't take \n     our favorite places away from us. We won't give in to your \n     terror.\n       I could tell you many, many stories but I think you get the \n     picture. This is a war that is difficult to win; if you \n     defeat your enemy, you wind up with a captive hostile \n     population and territories that you must occupy; if you make \n     an accommodation with the enemy, it won't assure you of \n     safety or that attitudes will change. It will only put you in \n     an even less secure situation.\n       If you believe in prayer, please pray for us. Both the \n     Israeli and the Palestinian populations are victimized. We \n     are going through a living Hell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2245-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2245-S2247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NEXT STEPS IN U.S. POLICY TOWARD IRAN\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a very thoughtful speech by my colleague, Mr. \nBiden, on U.S. policy toward Iran, which he delivered before the \nAmerican-Iranian Council on March 13, 2002.\n  Mr. Biden offers a realistic assessment of the challenges of dealing \nwith a divided government in Iran, where an unelected, ``hardcore \nclique'' holds the key levers of power and thwarts the democratic will \nof the vast majority of Iranians.\n  More significantly, he lists five specific steps that the United \nStates can take to increase Iran's international linkages and reach out \nto those in Iran who take risks to bring about change and reform. Mr. \nBiden's speech has touched off a spirited debate in Iran about how to \nrespond to his initiative.\n  Like my colleague from Delaware, I do not believe that our many \ndifferences with the Islamic Republic of Iran should close off \nopportunities to influence Iranian behavior and work together \nconstructively when we may share common interests, such as in \nAfghanistan; assisting with and re-locating refugees displaced by the \nAfghan war; controlling the international narcotics trade; and, \nperhaps, regarding the future of Iraq.\n  Our policies must also assist those in Iran advocating reform and \nchange in the Iranian government. Supporting Iranian admittance to the \nWorld Trade Organization, for example, would strengthen the hands of \nreformers in the Iranian parliament and elsewhere who seek to undertake \nthe structural economic reforms that, over time, could lead to more \nopen political and economic systems for the Iranian people.\n  I strongly support Mr. Biden's recommendations, including his \ninvitation to meet with members of the Iranian parliament. I encourage \nmy colleagues in the Senate to read Mr. Biden's speech when considering \nnext steps in U.S. policy toward Iran.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Biden's speech be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRemarks by Joseph R. Biden, Jr.--``Prospects for Progress: America and \n                           Iran After 9-11''\n\n       It is an honor to be invited to speak before such a \n     distinguished gathering.\n       The number of accomplished individuals in the audience \n     today is a testament to the extraordinary achievements of the \n     thriving Iranian-American community. You have enriched the \n     United States with your many talents, and your cultural \n     traditions have strengthened the diversity of our country.\n       You also have a critical role to play in serving as a \n     bridge between Iran and the United States.\n       Today, I would like to share with you my views on United \n     States policy toward Iran and the kind of relationship I \n     believe Iran and the United States should have. To save you \n     the suspense, the short answer is--a much better relationship \n     than we currently enjoy.\n       I say this for one simple reason--I believe that an \n     improved relationship with Iran is in the naked self-interest \n     of the United States of America.\n       Iran sits in the geo-political heart of a region that has \n     long been important to our security concerns.\n       On its Eastern frontier sits a newly-liberated Afghanistan \n     where the military mission is far from over. Farther East is \n     a nuclear-armed Pakistan that just a short while ago\n\n[[Page S2246]]\n\n     stood on the precipice of a potentially devastating conflict \n     with its arch-rival India.\n       To the West is a recalcitrant Iraq, with a dangerous leader \n     who Iranians grew to know all too well during the long and \n     bloody Iran-Iraq war. To the North are the undemocratic, \n     potentially energy-rich states of Central Asia and the \n     conflict-ridden Caucasus.\n       To the South are several American allies that sit atop the \n     largest known oil reserves on the face of the earth.\n       So it is not an understatement to say that the direction \n     Iran takes in the coming years will have a significant impact \n     upon American strategic interests in this region.\n       Clearly, we cannot speak of Iran's direction without \n     addressing its internal political dynamics. Since President \n     Khatami's election in 1997, Iran has been embroiled in a \n     gradually escalating power struggle that the outside world \n     has watched with considerable interest.\n       While elections haven't been perfect, the Iranian people \n     have made clear in four separate ballots over four years that \n     they are demanding fundamental change.\n       The result of these elections has been the creation of a \n     divided government. An elected branch consisting of the \n     parliament and the Presidency that, by definition, is more in \n     touch with the will of the people.\n       Juxtaposed to that is an appointed branch which holds many \n     of the key levers of power including the judiciary, security \n     organizations, and other bodies populated by those whose \n     vision largely revolves around the perpetuation of their own \n     authority.\n       It is this hardcore clique which refuses to give way to the \n     will of the people. Over the past few years they have \n     thwarted the goals of Iranian reformers. They've arrested \n     journalists. They've imprisoned close allies of the \n     President, and often resorted to violence.\n       They've harassed and persecuted minorities in Iran--Jews \n     and the Baha'i.\n       They direct policies that pose a threat to our interests. \n     Not the least of which is that Iran continues to support \n     terrorism and the escalation of violence in the Middle East.\n       Its recent involvement with the Karine-A arms smuggling \n     incident is a reminder of the policies that Iran must abandon \n     if there is to be a true rapprochement. And many questions \n     remain unanswered about the role played by some Iranians in \n     the Khobar Towers attack that left 19 US servicemen dead.\n       But shortly after September 11, ordinary Iranians held a \n     spontaneous candlelight vigil in Tehran in solidarity with \n     the victims. Yet some of Iran's leaders don't appear to \n     understand how drastically the world has changed after \n     September 11.\n       Their continuing support for groups such as Islamic Jihad \n     puts them on the wrong side of the new fault-line separating \n     civilization and those who seek chaos. As you all know, Iran \n     is continuing an aggressive drive to develop weapons of mass \n     destruction and long-range missile systems. In these efforts, \n     it receives considerable foreign assistance, especially from \n     Russia.\n       While support for terrorism appears to be directed by those \n     in the hard-line branch of the government, the support for \n     Iran's missile and nuclear weapons programs is more broad-\n     based.\n       The reason is a combination of three main factors: first, \n     fears over Iraq and to a far lesser degree, Pakistan. Second, \n     the belief that nuclear weapons will enhance Iran's stature. \n     Finally, we cannot dismiss the fact that some elements within \n     the government see a potential blackmail value in the \n     acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and long-range \n     missile capability.\n       Whatever the motivation, the United States must place the \n     highest priority on preventing Iran from gaining such \n     dangerous and destabilizing capabilities. There are a number \n     of options for doing so.\n       We cannot simply dismiss Iran's security concerns. They've \n     been the victims of chemical weapons attacks by Iraq. But the \n     neighborhood has the potential to change for the better.\n       Already, the Taliban menace no longer threatens Iran. Next \n     door, Pakistan's President is reigning in religious \n     extremism.\n       And I believe that the U.S. will ultimately have to \n     facilitate a regime-change in Iraq.\n       These three developments alone would dramatically alter \n     Iran's security environment for the better.\n       We must also be willing to hold discussions with Iran to \n     develop creative solutions as we did in North Korea. And we \n     must step up our efforts to end support by Russian entities \n     for Iranian nuclear and missile efforts. In my view, this \n     hasn't received enough attention over the past year.\n       Clearly, although we must combat the spread of weapons of \n     mass destruction to any country, the threat from Iran is not \n     simply a function of capability, but of intention as well.\n       If Iran evolves in a more democratic direction and the \n     U.S.-Iranian relationship improves, then the threat it poses \n     certainly will be reduced.\n       This, then, raises the question of the ongoing power \n     struggle underway in Iran.\n       The United States is not in a position to have a major \n     impact on this struggle. Nor should we intervene in any \n     direct way.\n       We should be mindful of the painful history between our two \n     countries, which includes reported CIA support for a coup in \n     1953. And it still resonates with many Iranians, and it \n     should counsel us to be extra-cautious.\n       Nonetheless, we should be clear about where we stand. We \n     are squarely with the Iranian people in their desire for a \n     democratic government and a democratic society.\n       Iran has a disproportionately young population. Half of its \n     people were born after the Revolution.\n       These young people and many of their parents and \n     grandparents have grown wary of Iran's isolation.\n       They want Iran to take its rightful place in the \n     international community and to embrace a rapidly-changing \n     world. They want the same kinds of social, political, and \n     economic freedoms that others enjoy. And they deserve to have \n     these aspirations fulfilled. As I said, we should have a \n     better relationship with Iran. Unfortunately, that is not for \n     us to decide. And it is unlikely to come about absent a \n     change in the attitude or composition of the present Iranian \n     regime.\n       While the Bush Administration continues the policy of its \n     predecessors by seeking dialogue with Iran, some in Tehran \n     have a different view.\n       Part of the government clearly wants to talk to us and has \n     talked to us over Afghanistan for example. But hard-liners \n     regard us as a useful bogeyman to continue to stir up the \n     passions of their most zealous and ardent stalwarts.\n       So the question is what can we do from the outside to help \n     the Iranian people realize their aspirations.\n       In my judgment, we must direct our policies in a way that \n     they do not rest on the principle of reciprocity.\n       In other words, we should assume that the continuing power \n     struggle will prevent Iran from responding to any particular \n     American gestures. And take steps that are carefully \n     calibrated with the aim of assisting those who seek change \n     within Iran.\n       How do we do it? First, we must recognize that the most \n     entrenched elements in Iran seek to perpetuate Iran's \n     isolation through confrontation with the outside world.\n       Those who seek change want to increase Iran's international \n     linkages.\n       Let me outline five specific steps the United States can \n     take.\n       First, the Bush Administration should issue a general \n     license to permit American non-governmental organizations to \n     financially support a broad range of civil society, cultural, \n     human rights, and democracy-building activities in Iran. Such \n     funding is currently banned by Executive Order.\n       It is unfortunate that it is our own government, not hard-\n     line clerics in Tehran, that have prevented practitioners of \n     democracy in America from aiding their struggling \n     counterparts in Iran.\n       Second, we should continue to work with Iran on matters of \n     mutual interest as we did on Afghanistan.\n       It is true that some hard-line elements in Iran are clearly \n     interested in stirring up trouble in Afghanistan, but the \n     story that many don't know is that Iran and the United States \n     coordinated their efforts on Afghanistan closely over the \n     past several months.\n       The dialogue on Afghanistan should serve as a model and \n     should be extended to other areas of mutual interest, like \n     the future of Iraq another topic for discussion and \n     cooperation.\n       Third, the United States should acquiesce to Iran's bid to \n     begin accession talks to the World Trade Organization. The \n     process of accession would take several years, but Iran would \n     have to make structural changes that would increase \n     transparency and undermine the key power bases of the hard-\n     liners.\n       Fourth, we should be willing to indirectly assist Iran on \n     refugee and narcotics matters. Iran has a huge population of \n     Afghan and Iraqi refugees. American non-governmental \n     organizations that assist refugees are willing to help and \n     should be supported in their efforts by our government.\n       Likewise, Iran has paid a heavy price in blood and treasure \n     in battling narcotics traffickers on its eastern frontier. \n     Iran has asked the international community for help and it \n     makes sense to assist them through the United Nations.\n       Fifth, we should continue to encourage citizen exchanges. A \n     track-two circuit has developed in recent years and it is \n     important to keep it going. Organizations such as the \n     American Iranian Council, the Open Society Institute, and the \n     Nixon Center have played a critical role, and I applaud them.\n       I also applaud the President for his view that there should \n     be a direct dialogue with Iran. In that regard, let me also \n     extend an invitation in my capacity as Chairman of the \n     Foreign Relations Committee. I am prepared to receive members \n     of the Iranian Majlis whenever its members would like to \n     visit. If Iranian parliamentarians believe that's too \n     sensitive, I'm prepared to meet them elsewhere.\n       Without speaking for any of my colleagues, I am confident \n     that many of them would join in such an historic meeting. \n     Indeed, some--including my friend Senator Arlen Specter--did \n     participate in an earlier brief encounter at the Metropolitan \n     Museum of Art organized by the American Iranian Council.\n       We should be under no illusions that these steps will by \n     themselves have a decisive impact. The direction that Iran \n     takes the form of government it chooses are ultimately \n     matters for the Iranian people to settle.\n       As we all know, Nowruz marks the start of Spring. Let us \n     hope that in this season of renewal that Iranians and \n     Americans can find a way to build on shared interests and \n     work constructively to overcome their differences peacefully.\n       I pledge to do my part and I know that all of you will lend \n     your energies to this critical effort.\n\n[[Page S2247]]\n\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2247-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COMMEMORATING 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF GIRL SCOUTS OF THE USA\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to express my sincere \ncongratulations to the Girl Scouts of the USA as it celebrates its 90th \nanniversary. Founded on March 12, 1912, in Savannah, GA, the \norganization has grown to 3.7 million girls and women in the United \nStates and a total of 8.5 million people in 140 countries.\n  The longevity and strength of Girl Scouts is a testament to the \ncommitment of its members and volunteers to uphold the highest \nstandards of leadership, social conscience, and civic duty. I thank the \nthousands of adult volunteers who devote their time and resources to \nthis worthy cause.\n  I also wish to extend my commendation to Ms. Gladys A. Brandt, a \nHawaii resident who is being honored as one of the first-ever National \nWomen of Distinction by the Girl Scouts of the USA. This award was \ncreated in conjunction with the Girl Scouts' 90th anniversary \ncelebration, and it pays tribute to women who have demonstrated \noutstanding service to girl scouting. Hawaii is truly proud of Ms. \nBrandt and grateful for her diligence in educating and serving young \npeople.\n  Once again, I express my best wishes to Girl Scouts of the USA for \ncontinued success, and I encourage the members of this organization to \nalways live up to the Girl Scout Promise and Girl Scout Law in every \nfacet of their lives.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Girl \nScouts of the USA, this month celebrating 90 years of building \ncharacter and enhancing the life skills of our Nation's young women. \nThe contributions and achievements of this outstanding organization \nhave endured for nine decades, helping girls to grow up courageous and \nstrong. I would like to praise the work of the Girl Scouts, and in \nparticular recognize the Girl Scouts of Alabama, who number almost \n45,000 girls and women.\n  Established on March 12, 1912, the Girl Scouts are based on the noble \nbelief that all young women should be given the opportunity to develop \nphysically, mentally and spiritually. Their founder, Juliette Gordon \nLow, convened that first meeting with just 18 girls from Savannah, GA. \nToday her vision continues with a national membership of 3.8 million, \nmaking the Girl Scouts the largest organization for girls in the world. \nOver the years the Girl Scouts have remained true to their founding \nprinciples, and still abide by the Girl Scout Promise and Law, just as \nthey did in 1912. These principles emphasize honor, accountability, \ncourage, respect, God and country and are valuable lessons for our \nyoung women to incorporate into their lives.\n  Girl Scouting has had a tremendous impact on the evolving role that \nwomen have played in our country over the past ninety years. The \nleadership qualities, self confidence and creative thinking that the \nGirl Scouts teach are all qualities essential in good citizens and \ngreat leaders. Indeed, two-thirds of female doctors, lawyers, \neducators, community leaders and even women members of Congress were \nonce Girl Scouts. It is a true testament to the Girl Scouts that many \nof these women believe that Girl Scouting has had a positive impact on \ntheir lives.\n  The Alabama Girl Scouts are celebrating their 90th anniversary by \nhelping to promote literacy with their ``Books for Alabama Kids'' \nproject. The seven Girl Scout councils in Alabama have been collecting \nchildren's books over the past 6 months to be donated to schools in the \ncounties in which they were collected. Tomorrow the books will be \npresented on the Capitol steps in Montgomery. I would like to commend \nthe Alabama Girl Scouts for their community service and dedication to \npromoting literacy in the state.\n  I would like to acknowledge the nine decades of excellence of the \nGirl Scouts. We have seen tremendous changes in our country over the \nyears, and they should be proud to have adapted and flourished. It \ndemonstrates that building character and preparing for the future are \nqualities that never go out of style.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that \nI rise today to recognize the Girl Scouts for their service to our \ncountry over the last 90 years. This anniversary marks the day Juliette \nGordon Low assembled 18 girls from Savannah, GA, for the Girl Scouts' \nfirst meeting, and celebrates the many wonderful moments this \norganization has enjoyed while growing to its current size of 3.8 \nmillion members.\n  Their mission to help all girls grow strong provides not just \ninspiration and guidance to those within their ranks, but serves as an \nexample for all the nation's young women. Through service to society \nand the development of values, self-confidence and integrity, the Girl \nScouts of the USA are an inspiration to our Nation's youth, and are \ninstrumental in creating the next generation of good citizens and great \nleaders.\n  I am proud that Congress last week honored the Girl Scouts \naccomplishments with the passage of a resolution marking March 10 \nthrough March 16, 2002 as ``National Girl Scout Week,'' and I look \nforward to future opportunities to celebrate this organization's \ncommitment and contribution to our Nation's young women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2247-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO SECOND LIEUTENANT MAURICE W.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the sacrifice of \ntwo American patriots who will be interred tomorrow at Arlington \nNational Cemetery. Second Lieutenant Maurice W. Harper, United States \nArmy Air Corps, a native of Birmingham in the great State of Alabama, \nand Lieutenant Colonel Earle Aber, United States Army Air Corps, of \nWisconsin, gave their lives in defense of this Nation and freedom on \nMarch 4, 1945 when the B-17G bomber they were flying was shot down \nwhile returning from a mission over Holland.\n  Over half a century later, the crash site was located and 2nd Lt. \nHarper's remains, along with the remains of his pilot, Lieutenant \nColonel Earle Aber, were recovered in September, 1999 and identified by \nthe Army Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii. Their aircraft \nwas severely damaged after it was mistakenly hit by British anti-\naircraft guns which were firing at retreating German bombers over the \nEnglish coastline. Lt. Col. Aber ordered the crew to bail-out while he \nand 2nd Lt. Harper struggled at the controls of their damaged aircraft. \nTheir selfless actions allowed the other nine members of their crew to \nbail-out from the aircraft and survive the mission. There was not \nenough time, however, for these two brave airmen to escape and they \nperished when the aircraft crashed into the River Stour near Ramsey, \nEngland. The remains of both of these fine young men, that could be \nidentified, were returned to their families. Unfortunately, not all of \nthe remains could be positively identified. The co-mingled remains of \nthese two fine Americans, still together after 57 years, will be laid \nto rest together at Arlington National Cemetery on March 22, 2002.\n  I would also like to take this time to thank the professionals at the \nArmy's Central Identification Laboratory in Hawaii who continue their \nlabors to identify the remains of our fallen sons and daughters and \nreturn them to their loved ones.\n  These two fine gentlemen, members of the ``greatest generation,'' \ndeserve the gratitude of this great Nation. I know the Members of the \nSenate will join me in honoring the sacrifices of these two brave men \nand expressing our deepest condolences and heartfelt thanks to their \nfamilies as they lay their loved ones to rest tomorrow in the hallowed \nground at Arlington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2247-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2247-S2250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        STAYING THE COURSE IN AFGHANISTAN: THE NEED FOR SECURITY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, about 2 months ago I spent half a week in \nthe Afghan capital city of Kabul, and virtually every conversation I \nhad during my time there revolved around a single question: Would \nAmerica stay the course?\n  After all our successful military actions, after all our promises on \nreconstruction, after all our commitments to prevent Afghanistan from \nrelapsing into chaos and warlordism, would we really have the stomach \nto get the job done?\n\n[[Page S2248]]\n\n  Whether I was talking to refugees living in bestial squalor, or to \nChairman Karzai in a palace where the electricity barely functione;\n  Whether I was talking to NATO soldiers in the international security \nforce, to representatives of the U.N. and international humanitarian \ngroups, or to our own American servicemen and servicewomen so valiantly \nrisking their lives for a just cause; whoever I was talking to, the \nquestions remained basically the same: Would we have the steadiness, \ndetermination, and commitment to remain engaged? Would we demonstrate \nthe leadership necessary to keep the international coalition together? \nWould we maintain our resolve for the long haul, once the immediate \nbattles had been won and our nation's attention had started to turn \naway from this remote and forbidding part of the world?\n  I will tell you now what I told them then: We can, we must, and we \nwill.\n  Let me take a few minutes to explain what I mean, and how I see our \nrole in Afghanistan over months and, yes, the years to come. But first, \nI suggest that we all remember just why we sent troops to Afghanistan \nin the first place. I can sum it up in three syllables: 9-1-1.\n  Our rationale for entering the fray was very simple: Our Nation had \ncome under attack, the most horrific single attack we had ever \nexperienced in all our history, and the de facto rulers of Afghanistan \nwere actively sheltering the terrorists who orchestrated this deed. We \ngave the Taliban every opportunity to surrender Usama bin Laden and his \nband of thugs, but the Taliban chose instead to link themselves ever \nmore closely to al Qaeda.\n  The decision to go to war is never easy, but in this case it was \ninevitable. The decision was made for us, as I and the rest of the \nMembers here were assembling for morning business on a Tuesday in \nSeptember.\n  Our troops have done a truly outstanding job fighting this war, as \nthe recent battle in Shahi-kot demonstrates, the Taliban and al Qaeda \nare scattered and on the run.\n  But we always knew that this would be the easy part. As President \nBush, Secretary Powell, and Secretary Rumsfeld have correctly noted, \nour war on terror will be a long one, and we can't expect our early \nvictories to be the final word.\n  Let's remember that in 1979, it took the Soviet forces no more than \n10 days to establish control over every major population center in \nAfghanistan. The really tough part, we knew from the beginning, \nwouldn't be ousting the Taliban and al Qaeda--the tough part would be \nmaking sure that they stayed ousted.\n  That is why we have no choice but to stay the course. If Afghanistan \nreturns to a state of lawlessness and disorder, two things are pretty \nmuch certain to happen.\n  First, the Taliban, or some new and equally brutal group, will \nestablish control over all or part of the country, and they will \nprovide safe haven to any terrorists, drug-traffickers and violent \ninsurgents willing to pay their price;\n  Second, these terrorists will once again use Afghanistan as a base to \nlaunch attacks on the United States to destabilize regimes all around \nthe world.\n  If we don't do the job right, mark my words: U.S. troops will be \nright back in Afghanistan a year or two down the line, only this time, \nwe will be doing the fighting all by ourselves.\n  Let us think about that for a moment. The victories we've seen over \nthe past 5 months have been American victories--but they are not only \nAmerican victories. At every step along the way, we have relied on our \nAfghan allies for the bulk of the troops on the ground.\n  Whether we're talking about battles for Kabul or Kandahar, for Mazar-\ne Sharif or Tora Bora, the pattern has generally been hundreds of \nAmerican troops spearheading thousands of Afghan fighters.\n  This pattern is far from perfect--as the porousness of our cordon at \nTora Bora and, most recently, Shahi-kot demonstrate, sometimes Afghan \ntroops are no substitute for U.S. infantrymen.\n  But without our Afghan allies, imperfect as they have sometimes been, \nwe would not have been able to achieve our impressive victories in \nanything like the time-frame we have achieved them.\n  And that point is vital to our future strategy: As many people in \nKabul told me, from Chairman Karzai right on down to mud-on-the-boots \nG.I.s patrolling the airbase at Bagram, we have only got one chance to \ndo it right.\n  As I was constantly reminded, the U.S. pulled out of Afghanistan \nabruptly in 1989, just as soon as our short-term objectives had been \nmet. If we do so again, I was told time after time, then we had better \nnot expect any Afghans to fight on our side when a new nest of \nterrorists requires military action in the future.\n  The stakes, in short, could not be higher. Some people are of the \nopinion that we can pull out relatively soon, that any future military \naction would be as ``easy'' as the present one.\n  ``We've got the most powerful military out there,'' they say, ``we \ndon't need the help of unreliable Afghan and incompetent Europeans--we \ncan go it alone.'' To anyone who labors under this delusion, I say, \ntake a trip to Afghanistan.\n  Go there, talk to the people, have a look at the terrain. Anybody who \ndoes, I suggest, will return firmly convinced that we must stay the \ncourse. We have got to do the job right this time--because it may be \nthe last chance we get.\n  So what does ``doing the job right'' entail? There are several parts \nto the equation--economic reconstruction, building political \ninstitutions, clearing minefields, creating the educational, medical, \nand other infrastructure necessary for long-term self-sufficiency.\n  But none of these elements are possible without security on the \nground. That's the central piece of the puzzle. If we establish \nsecurity, all else can follow--and without it, nothing else can grow.\n  For the long term, according to the plans of the U.S. administration \nand the U.N. organizers, Afghanistan's internal and external security \nwill be provided by a national army and police force.\n  This is the right way to go, and I fully support all the efforts \ncurrently under way to create these institutions. But you can't create \nthem overnight. It takes time to recruit, train, equip, and solidify a \ntruly capable, professionalized force.\n  In Kabul I received an extensive briefing from Maj. Gen. McColl, the \nBritish commander of the International Security force authorized by the \nU.N. to maintain order in the capital.\n  Gen. McColl's planners has worked up a detailed strategy for creating \nan Afghan army and taking at least the heavy weaponry away from local \nwarlords. Even to create a bare-bones force of a few brigades, he \nfound, would take up to 2 years.\n  So what happens in the meantime? What is happening right now? I am \nafraid the answer isn't very encouraging. In the meantime--right now--\nAfghanistan is not-so-slowly falling back into chaos.\n  The interim government of Hamid Karzai exerts very little control \nover most of the country: In Herat, Gen. Ismail Khan rules as a semi-\nindependent baron--and entertains emissaries from Iran, who are anxious \nto expand their sphere of influence.\n  In Mazar-e Sharif, the brutal warlord Gen. Abdurrashid Dostum has \npicked up where he left off when he was ousted by the Taliban--and his \nrecord suggests that he will take his current duties as Deputy Defense \nMinister no more seriously than his past promises to virtually every \nparty in the conflict.\n  In Kabul itself, Defense Minister Fahim maintains the fiction that \nhis own militia, basically the Northern Alliance troops, is serving as \na nonpartisan national army.\n  It is clear to all observers, however, that these soldiers owe their \nallegiance to Fahim and various sub-commanders--and not to the legally-\nconstituted civil authority.\n  In the Pasthun areas, a wide array of local warlords play all sides \nagainst every other--accepting money and arms from the U.S. and the \nTaliban alike, even attempting to use American air power to settle \ntheir own petty feuds.\n  There have even been credible reports of various warlords falsely \nidentifying their local rivals as al Qaeda in order to call in American \nairstrikes--putting U.S. servicemen in harm's way to advance their own \nsordid objectives.\n  Meanwhile, Afghanistan's predatory neighbors sit on the sidelines--\nbut not\n\n[[Page S2249]]\n\nfor long. Afghanistan's bloody civil war has long been fueled by arms, \nmoney, and recruits drawn from the surrounding nations.\n  The neighboring meddlers include Iran, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and \nRussia, but a variety of other nations slightly further afield have got \ninto the game at one time or another. Each has attempted to reshape \nAfghan politics for its own narrow interests--to the detriment of the \npeople, and the instability of the region.\n  All have basically kept their hands off while U.S. troops have ruled \nthe roost. But the moment the last troop transport takes off, expect \nthe jockeying to begin all over.\n  Ever had a neighbor who pops in to borrow a cup of sugar and invites \nhimself to dinner? Maybe a distant relative who stops by to say \n``hello,'' and never seems to leave? Well, the Afghans know how it \nfeels.\n  They have had to suffer with unwelcome houseguests for thirty years. \nAnd they know that as soon as the door is open--as soon as the American \ntroops leave--all of these unsavory interlopers will come flocking \nback.\n  So what's the solution? How do we--together with the rest of the \nworld community--provide Afghanistan with a year or two of breathing \nroom to let it build up a national army and police force of its own? \nThere are basically two possible paths.\n  Have American troops continue to serve as the de facto security \nforce, or get the international community to share our burden.\n  Fortunately, a mechanism exists to make this second option a \nreality--it's the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF for \nshort, and it can save us from the necessity of being Afghanistan's \nonly policeman.\n  Right now, ISAF is strictly limited by its U.N. mandate. Its 5,000 \ntroops are confined to Kabul, and even there they have to tread \ngingerly. The unit is currently under the command of the British, but \nthe Brits plan to transfer command as soon as April.\n  The entire mandate ends in June--precisely when its continuing \npresence is most needed to safeguard the Loya Jirga, or Great Council \nto be convened as the next step in the process of political rebuilding.\n  So here, in a nutshell, is what we have to do.\n  First, this international security force must be extended from Kabul \nto several key sites throughout the country.\n  It should be expanded to Mazar, Kandahar, and perhaps other cities \nsuch as Jalalabad or Gardez. Such an expansion would entail an increase \nin troop strength from the current 5,000. Some sources say 25,000 \ntroops would be needed, others say the mission could be accomplished \nwith a more modest increase.\n  I will not presume to venture an opinion on the precise number, I \nwill just say that we should make sure the military planners have as \nmany troops as they deem necessary to do the job right.\n  This expansion should not and will not interfere with ongoing U.S. \noperations against Taliban and al-Quida remnants.\n  Currently, the ISAF commander is subordinate in theater to the U.S. \ncommander, and there has been no question of ISAF troops encroaching on \nAmerican operations. Quite the opposite--ISAF troops are a force \nmultiplier, and free up American assets that would otherwise have to be \nused to guard and protect bases at transport hubs such as Bagram.\n  Second, the mandate of the international security force must be \nextended for 2 years. This would provide sufficient time for the \ncreation of an indigenous Afghan army and police force, and insure a \nsmooth transition to the new Afghan government.\n  Third, the international security force must be given robust rules of \nengagement, and all the equipment, airlift, and intelligence necessary \nto accomplish its mission.\n  Let's make no mistake here--the troops on the ground are not and must \nnot be blue-helmeted peacekeepers. These are, and must be, peacemakers. \nWe need rough, tough, combat-ready forces, with the ability to take \nnames and impose order.\n  Fourth, the U.S. must be fully engaged as the mission's guarantor of \nlast resort. That does not necessarily mean we have send U.S. troops, \nalthough we shouldn't rule it out off the bat.\n  What it does mean, however, is that we commit ourselves to insuring \nthe mission's success.\n  Maybe we can achieve this goal by providing airlift, intelligence, \nfunding, and diplomatic support.\n  Maybe we also have to provide the promise of troops extraction, air \ncombat assets, and the ultimate ace-in-the-hole of sending the cavalry \nto the rescue if things get too hot.\n  But, one way or another, this is a goal we must achieve--not merely \nfor the sake of Afghanistan, but for the national security interest of \nthe United States.\n  When I go around the country talking about the need for a robust \nsecurity force, with the U.S. providing the ultimate guarantee of \nsuccess, I'm often asked whether that's an implicit call for the \nparticipation of American ground troops. It is a fair question, but \nit's putting the cart before the horse.\n  I would prefer it if we could accomplish our mission without \ndeploying a single U.S. soldier.\n  I would prefer it if other nations could do the job without our \ntroops on the ground. And maybe they can.\n  But my past experience, both in the Balkans and elsewhere, leads me \nto doubt that this will be possible.\n  First, there aren't a whole lot of countries out there with the \nmilitary assets--both human and technological--necessary to get the job \ndone right.\n  Other countries may be able to provide the bulk of the force, but the \npresence of even relatively small numbers of American troops can mean \nthe difference between success and failure.\n  Look at our battlefield results in Afghanistan--the military \neffectiveness of our Afghan allies has been increased exponentially by \nthe presence very small numbers of U.S. Special Operations Forces.\n  These troops not only brought in the heavy artillery, by calling in \nand targeting airstrikes, they stiffened the spine of the brave, but \noften young, inexperienced, and poorly trained, Afghan fighters.\n  Second, and just as important, is the political side of the equation. \nWithout U.S. boots on the ground, the commitment of other nations often \nstarts to falter.\n  As Maj. Gen. McColl, the British commander of ISAF, said to me in \nKabul, ``Once you Americans pull your troops out of Afghanistan, how \nlong do you think my Parliament will authorize the deployment of \nBritish soldiers?''\n  Let me be clear: I'm not advocating any specific deployment of \nAmerican troops. The specifics of any troop deployment is a decision \nbest left to the President, based on a military assessment of what is \nneeded to get the mission accomplished.\n  My point is merely that we have a mission to accomplish in \nAfghanistan, and IF the deployment of American troops as part of an \ninternational force is deemed necessary, we should certainly step up to \nthe plate.\n  Perhaps we'll be able to continue the status quo--to have U.S. troops \ncurrently serving in Operation Enduring Freedom serve as the de facto \nback-up squad for ISAF troops.\n  Some voices decry using American troops as ``policemen,'' and urge \nthat peace operations be left to other nations. But every big-city \npolice force needs a SWAT team to handle the real bad characters. \nPerhaps the U.S. can serve as the SWAT team for an expanded U.N.-\nmandated security force.\n  But we shouldn't be afraid to have our troops integrated to an \ninternational force of peacemakers in Afghanistan. Our experience in \nthe Balkans shows that we can work with our NATO allies, and other \ncountries, to make such forces the instrument of U.S. policy.\n  And, as a survey of top brass recently released by the ``Peace \nThrough Law Education Fund'' argues, such operations can be a huge \nbenefit to American military and political objectives.\n  Not all of the generals quoted in the report will agree with all of \nits recommendations, and the survey was undertaken prior to the \ncampaign in Afghanistan. The opinions expressed related to peace \noperations in general, not to ISAF in particular.\n\n[[Page S2250]]\n\n  But I think the most valuable part of the report is the wide \nselection of direct quotes from some of our most respected military \ncommanders.\n  I would like to share a few of these observations--all of them made \nby American commanders with far more military expertise than I would \never claim to possess.\n  Taken together, they make what I believe is a convincing case for \nAmerican leadership on--and, if necessary, participation in--a \nsignificantly beefed-up international peacemaking force to be deployed \nat various sites throughout Afghanistan.\n  On American involvement in multinational peace operations:\n\n       The nation that has the most influence . . . has to play a \n     number of roles. Peacekeeping, peacemaking or peace \n     enforcement is one of those roles. To walk away from those \n     responsibilities, in my judgement, is to invite questioning \n     of your overall leadership character.

The training that the young NCO and younger officer \n     gets is far superior to what he or she would be getting if \n     they were in Germany--because they are dealing with real \n     world problems, 24 hours a day . . . That's what being a \n     troop leader is all about.

He notes \nthat when troops who have served in peace operations are put back in \nthe regular training cycle, they have no troubling picking up where \nthey left off.\n  The words of these American soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines say \nit far better than I can. The military and strategic objectives of the \nUnited States are often best served by American troops participating in \nmultinational peace operations.\n  I am not saying we should send U.S. soldiers on such missions merely \nfor their training or diplomatic value. I AM saying that we should \nrecognize the pro's as well as the con's of U.S. involvement in peace \noperations.\n  Yes, there are dangers--as President Bush has said, the war against \nterror will be long, and there will be casualties in the months and \nyears ahead. But the dangers of abdication of our responsibilities is \nfar greater than the dangers of leadership.\n  We must stay the course in Afghanistan--the whole world is watching. \nFriends and enemies alike want to know whether we'll follow through in \nAfghanistan, and if we fail to follow through here, how can we ever \nconvince them that we'll follow through in Yemen, the Philippines, or \nIndonesia--let alone in Iraq.\n  But that is the topic for another day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2250-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2250-S2251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TAKING CARE OF OUR NATION'S VETERANS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, over the last few weeks, I have had the \nhonor of meeting with a number of veterans, both here in Washington and \nin South Dakota. Every time I meet with them, I am reminded of the \ntremendous sacrifices they have made on behalf of our country. We owe \neach of them a debt of gratitude that can never be fully repaid.\n  One of the things we must do for our veterans is honor our past \npromises. For decades, the men and women who joined the military were \npromised educational benefits and lifetime health care for themselves \nand their families. Those commitments have too often not been kept, and \nI am concerned this is starting to threaten our national security. \nVeterans are our Nation's most effective recruiters. However, \ninadequate education benefits and poor health care options make it \ndifficult for these men and women to encourage the younger generation \nto join today's voluntary service.\n  In my meetings with veterans, the issue of greatest concern is health \ncare. They want assurances that they will be able to access quality \ncare. Unfortunately, years of inadequate funding for veterans health \ncare has pushed the VA health system to the brink of crisis, and the \nquality of care is starting to suffer. Let me be clear, this has \nnothing to do with the men and women who work in the VA health system. \nThey are dedicated professionals who care about the veterans they \nserve, but they are being asked to do too much with too few resources.\n  Veterans were very optimistic when the President mentioned his \ncommitment to veterans health care in the State of the Union address in \nJanuary. At first glance, it looked as though the President's budget \nhad made a significant effort to fix the mounting funding problems at \nthe VA. But after budget gimmicks, such as $800 million that was \nincluded for the first time in the VA budget for federal employees' \nretirements, the amount of funding that the President has recommended \nfor veterans health care falls far short of the promised $2.2 billion \nincrease. Instead, it is only about $1.4 billion more than last year.\n  I am pleased that the Senate Budget Committee, of which I am a \nmember, has recently approved a budget resolution that will provide \n$1.2 billion more than was requested by the Bush administration for VA \nhealth care and $2.6 billion more than was approved in fiscal year \n2002. I am hopeful that this level of funding will go a long way toward \naddressing the critical funding needs in VA health care.\n  While there is good news about the health care budget, I am concerned \nabout a provision in the President's budget that would establish a \n$1,500 deductible for Category 7 veterans. Under this new policy, a \nveteran would be forced to pay for 45 percent of his or her medical \ncare, up to a limit of $1,500 per year. The VA estimates that 121,000 \nveterans will choose not to be treated at the VA next year if the \nproposal becomes law. This would include several thousand in South \nDakota. I know this is an attempt to ask veterans who make more money \nto contribute more to their own health care. However, the way in which \nthe VA determines Category 7 status is unfair, particularly to many \nveterans in South Dakota. Category 7 veterans are those who lack a \ndisability related to their military\n\n[[Page S2251]]\n\nservice or whose income is higher than the current VA eligibility \nstandards. The current income standard is $24,000 annually for a \nsingle, or $28,000 for a couple, and applies to 40 percent of the \nveterans in South Dakota. Assets, such as land, are included in the \ncalculation of income. This is a concern for many farmers and ranchers \nin my state who may own land worth a considerable amount, but whose \nactual yearly income is well below the VA threshold. The \nadministration's proposal to impose a $1,500 co-pay on all Category 7 \nveterans would be particularly onerous on these veterans.\n\n  I would also like to note the concern some veterans have raised about \na new VA regulation that increases the price of prescription drugs from \n$2 to $7 a month. Seven dollars a month for a prescription is still \nrelatively inexpensive, and given the lack of prescription benefits \nunder Medicare, many older veterans still benefit greatly from this VA \nservice. However, when you look at longer waits for appointments, cuts \nin VA services, and the proposed $1,500 co-pay for Category 7 veterans, \nthis increase in prescription costs is seen as yet another example of \nthe erosion of veterans benefits.\n  One of the positive steps in VA health care has been the shift away \nfrom a health system based on lengthy, in-patient hospital stays, to a \nsystem focused on preventative, outpatient care. This shift has vastly \nimproved patient care. It has also proven to be popular with veterans, \nas demonstrated by the large numbers currently utilizing the Community \nBased Outpatient Clinics, CBOCs. These community based clinics are \nparticularly important in rural States like South Dakota. By placing \nclinics in local communities, we increase access to care by cutting \ndown the amount of time a veteran must spend travelling. Greater access \nto nearby care means veterans are likely to seek medical attention \nbefore an illness becomes a major health problem.\n  This new access to clinics was threatened in South Dakota when \nbudgetary constraints prompted the VA to put a moratorium on enrollment \nin CBOCs in Aberdeen, Rapid City, and Pierre. This caused concern among \nveterans in the areas around the clinics who were told their only \noption for health care was a multiple hour drive away. After working \nclosely with the VA, the enrollment caps appear to have been lifted. I \nwill continue to monitor this situation and will work with Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs Anthony Principi to ensure all eligible veterans \ncontinue to have access to these clinics.\n  I believe we in the Senate should commit to making this the year we \nfinally address the issue of concurrent receipt of military retirement \nbenefits. Under current law, military retirees cannot receive both full \nmilitary retirement pay and full VA disability compensation. Instead, \nretirement payments are reduced by the amount received in disability \ncompensation. Changing the law to allow for concurrent receipt of \nbenefits is an issue of basic fairness because both military retirement \npay and VA disability compensation are earned benefits. Retirement pay \ncomes after at least 20 years of dedicated service in the Armed Forces \nand VA disability is earned as a result of injury during time of \nservice.\n\n  I have been working with South Dakota veterans and my colleagues in \nthe Senate for several years to fix this problem. Last year, the Senate \nadopted an amendment to both the fiscal year 2002 budget resolution and \nto the fiscal year 2002 Defense authorization bill to include funding \nto correct this problem. Unfortunately, despite strong support in the \nSenate, the language to allow concurrent receipt was removed from last \nyear's budget resolution during the conference with the House of \nRepresentatives. In the Defense authorization bill, Congress agreed to \nallow concurrent receipt, but only if the administration included \nauthorizing legislation as a part of the fiscal year 2003 budget \nrequest.\n  I was very disappointed to discover that the President's fiscal year \n2003 budget request did not include provisions for concurrent receipt. \nI recently sent a letter to the President expressing my regret at his \ndecision not to address concurrent receipt and asking him to work with \nCongress to address this urgent matter. I am very pleased that the \nSenate version of the fiscal year 2003 budget resolution includes a \nprovision to phase in full concurrent receipt for veterans who are 60-\n100 percent disabled as a result of their military service. This is \nonly a first step, but a positive step. At a time in which we are \nasking more and more from the men and women serving in the military, we \nshould be looking for ways to encourage them to make a career in the \nmilitary by improving benefits and assuring them they will be taken \ncare of in retirement.\n  Another priority for me is improving educational benefits for \nveterans. Unfortunately, the current GI bill fails to keep pace with \nthe rising costs of higher education. Less than one-half of the men and \nwomen who contribute $1,200 of their pay to qualify for the GI bill \nactually use these benefits. Last year, I joined Senator Susan Collins \nin introducing legislation to bring the GI bill into the 21st century \nby creating a benchmark level of education benefits that automatically \ncovers inflation to meet the increasing costs of higher education. Our \nconcept is a very simple one; at the very least, GI bill benefits \nshould be equal to the average cost of a commuter student attending a \n4-year university. The Montgomery GI bill has been one of the most \neffective tools in recruiting and retaining the best and the brightest \nin the military. It has also been a critical component in the \ntransition of veterans to civilian life. It is imperative that the \nSenate passes this legislation this session.\n  I am also pleased to be a sponsor of two other very important bills \nthat will honor the commitments we have made to our veterans.\n  S. 1644, The Veterans Memorial Preservation and Recognition Act, will \nprotect all veterans memorials on public property by extending current \ncriminal penalties for destruction of property to any statue, plaque, \nor monument commemorating veterans. The bill also creates a restoration \nfund--to which individuals or organization can contribute--to repair \nand maintain our Nation's veterans memorials. Finally, the bill \nauthorizes States to place supplemental guide signs for veterans \ncemeteries on Federal-aid highways.\n  I am also an original cosponsor of S. 2003, the Veterans Benefits and \nPensions Protection Act. This bill will help protect veterans from \nunscrupulous predatory lending. The VA currently prohibits the direct \nsale of veterans pension or disability benefits. However, certain \ncompanies are exploiting a loophole in the law that allows them to \nenter into contracts with veterans to offer them ``instant cash'' in \nexchange for future benefit payments. In essence, a veteran agrees to \nsign away his or her benefits for a selected amount of time, and in \nexchange, the company agrees to pay the veteran a lump some of money. \nFrequently, this ranges from only 30 to 40 cents on the dollar. The \nveteran is then required to open a joint bank account with the company \nin which the benefits are directly deposited and the company makes the \nwithdrawal. Veterans are often also required to take out life \ninsurance, payable to the company, or use their homes as collateral.\n  S. 2003 will close this loophole and authorize education programs to \ninform veterans about the danger of this scam. The bill has been \nendorsed by the Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, Vietnam Veterans of America, and AMVETS.\n  Mr. President, there are few things more important than those who \nserve our country in the Armed Forces. As a nation, we need to take \ncare of these men and women, not only while they wear the uniform, but \nalso when they become veterans. I look forward to continuing to work on \nbehalf of the veterans of South Dakota and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2251-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2251-S2253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 181st \nanniversary of Greek Independence that will be celebrated Monday, March \n25. Not unlike our founding fathers who sowed the seeds of the American \nrevolution by forming the underground society, the ``Sons of Liberty,'' \nGreek patriots seeking democracy established the ``Friendly Society'' \nin Odessa in 1814. Their ideals spread and the Greek people eventually \nrose up on March 25, 1821. This day would mark the beginning of an 8 \nyear struggle against the might of the Ottoman Empire which\n\n[[Page S2252]]\n\nhad ruled Greece for 400 years. In 1829, the Greeks were the first to \nwin their independence from the Ottoman Empire, and were formally \nrecognized in 1832. Their success spurred on other groups.\n  But this 19th century revolution was not the first time the Greeks \nhad contributed greatly to our world. In ancient times, Greek \ncivilization established traditions of democracy, society and culture \nthat resonate today. These Greek cultural accomplishments deeply \ninfluenced thinkers, writers and artists, especially those in ancient \nRome, Medieval Arabia, and Renaissance Europe. Modern democratic \nnations owe their fundamental political principles to ancient Greece. \nBecause of the enduring influence of its ideas, ancient Greece is known \nas the cradle of Western civilization.\n  In fact, Greeks invented the idea of the West as a distinct region \nbecause they lived west of the powerful civilizations of Egypt, \nBabylonia, and Phoenicia. Today we continue to marvel at their advances \nin philosophy, architecture, drama, government, and science, with \npeople worldwide enjoying ancient Greek plays, studying the ideas of \nancient Greek philosophers, and incorporating elements of ancient Greek \narchitecture into the designs of new buildings.\n  So I am proud to recognize the continued contributions of today's \nGreek-Americans to our country and my home State of Rhode Island. \nAlthough the earliest Greeks to come to America were men of the sea, \nsailing with Christopher Columbus, Ferdinand Magellan and other Spanish \nexpeditions to the New World, today's Greek Americans are involved in \nall aspects of American business and society, contributing with their \nhard work and active citizenship.\n  I would also note that the Greece-US relationship has deepened over \nthe years and there are extraordinary opportunities to strengthen it \neven more. We share mutual concern for greater security, stability and \nprosperity in the Mediterranean, Southeastern Europe, and the Caucasus. \nThe Greeks have traditionally been active as well as a force of \nprogress in these regions and their experiences will help the United \nStates as the two countries partner to face the challenges of the new \ncentury.\n  I am proud to join many of my colleagues as a co-sponsor of Senate \nResolution 214 which designated March 25, 2002 ``Greek Independence \nDay: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.'' I \ngive Greek Americans my best wishes as they celebrate Greece's \nindependence.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, over the past few days and weeks the \ndrumbeat for war against Iraq has been rising in both volume and tempo. \nI rise today to express my concern, and to urge President Bush to \nproceed with care and prudence.\n  At a minimum: the United States must first exhaust every diplomatic \nsolution that might avoid war, with war seen as a last resort; the \nUnited States must assure sufficient international support, similar to \nthe coalition that made the Gulf War viable; and, the administration \nmust fully consult with Congress, which has a significant \nconstitutional obligation in this matter, and receive proper \nauthorization.\n  Let me be clear: There is little question that Iraq poses a grave \nrisk to the United States and our friends and allies. How to deal with \nIraq remains, as it has for over a decade, one of the top foreign \npolicy priorities for the United States.\n  At this point we can not and should not lose sight of the fact that \nwe still have considerable work to do in Afghanistan. Rushing \nprecipitously towards another military confrontation, unless the need \nis imminent, would not be prudent.\n  We are all aware of the nature of the threat: Iraq under Saddam \nHussein seeks to develop WMD, has used these weapons against its own \npeople, has invaded its neighbors and threatened others in the region \nwith its missiles.\n  And we are all well aware that Iraq, having agreed to United Nations \ninspectors after its defeat in the Gulf War a decade ago, banned them \nin 1998. For 4 years the international community has had no access to \nIraq and no ability to inspect its weapons facilities.\n  The administration believes Iraq is continuing to develop chemical \nand biological weapons, and is seeking nuclear weapons. As a member of \nthe Intelligence Committee I believe that the administration is correct \nin this assessment.\n  And the administration has argued that Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction must be dismantled before President Saddam Hussein forms an \nalliance with Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups.\n  It is critical, therefore, that the United States, through the United \nNations, seek additional inspections, under a ``go anywhere, anytime'' \ninspection regime, to provide Iraq with the opportunity, one last time, \nto either work with the international community on this issue or, by \nits refusal, admit guilt and face the consequences.\n  I also believe that it is critical that, should an imminent threat \nrequire U.S. action, that the Administration come to Congress to seek \nits judgment and assent.\n  The resolution authorizing the use of force against the September 11 \nattackers provides the President authority to take military action only \nagainst those groups, individuals, or nations who aided in the \nSeptember 11 attacks, or harbored those involved.\n  It states: ``The President is authorized to use all necessary and \nappropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he \ndetermines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist \nattacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such \norganizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of \ninternational terrorism against the United States by such nations, \norganizations, or persons.''\n  On its face, then, this resolution is both narrow and specific, in \nthat it applies only to the September 11 attacks.\n  In order to take action against Iraq under this resolution, the \nPresident must determine both that Iraq has harbored any Al Qaeda \nmembers, or anyone else who aided in the September 11 attacks, and that \nsuch an attack would ``prevent any future acts of international \nterrorism,'' as also required by the resolution.\n  On the other hand, if the President attacks Iraq simply to destroy \nits weapons of mass destruction, which may be a justified action under \ncertain circumstances, this resolution does not provide the authority \nfor such an attack. Iraq's WMD program, if not directly linked to the \nSeptember 11 attacks, is a separate issue not covered by the September \nresolution.\n  In such a circumstance the President would need to, must, seek an \nadditional authorizing resolution from Congress.\n  I was pleased to see that Secretary of State Powell has indicated \nPresident Bush will fully consult with Congress before any military \naction is taken against Iraq.\n  It is imperative that we comply with the provisions of the War Powers \nResolution, a joint legislative act that will ensure: ``The collective \njudgment of both Congress and the President will apply to the \nintroduction of United States armed forces into hostilities.''\n  Given the gravity of placing potentially large numbers of America's \nforces in harm's way, I think anything less than such a ``collective \njudgment'' would tarnish the sacred trust our people have in their \ngovernment.\n  As our colleague Senator Byrd wrote in The New York Times earlier \nthis week: ``The Constitution states that the President shall be \ncommander in chief, but it is Congress that has the constitutional \nauthority to provide for the common defense and general welfare, raise \narmies, and to declare war. In other words, Congress has a \nconstitutional responsibility to weigh in on war-related policy \ndecisions.''\n  The challenges in taking action against Iraq underscore the need for \nthe United States to work with our friends and allies in the region and \nelsewhere if we are to take effective action against Iraq.\n  The administration has made great strides in creating as wide an \ninternational coalition as possible for action against terror and \nterrorists, it must do likewise for any action against Iraq.\n  In contemplating any such action against Iraq, we must consult with \nallies and build the kind of coalition that supported our efforts in \nthe Gulf War, especially those countries whose peoples and governments \nare bound to be affected by such an undertaking.\n\n[[Page S2253]]\n\n  We should not take action against Iraq until both we, the American \npeople and our regional partners, are convinced of the reasons for so \ndoing and that there is a clear mission and goal in mind.\n  The United States must also consider carefully the consequences of \nprecipitous action.\n  Can we assure our regional partners that our actions will not involve \nthe de-stabilization of the region?\n  Might unilateral unsupported action against Iraq result in attacks \nagainst close allies such as Israel or protests against regional \nleaders in Egypt, Saudi Arabia or Jordan?\n  Following any military action, are we prepared militarily and \nfinancially to remain in the region until Saddam is removed, the people \nof Iraq are free, and a viable democratic government is in place?\n  These are complex questions to which there may be no easy answers. \nBut they are questions that must be addressed before we take any action \nif those actions are to be successful and the results, enduring.\n  If this matter is not handled properly, there is a profound risk that \nthe Middle East will be further destabilized, and place U.S. interests \nin the region and in the war against terrorism in jeopardy.\n  None of us has the wisdom or foresight to see where this war will \nlead us, how long it will last, or when it will end.\n  But we are all foursquare in our determination that we, and all \ncivilized peoples, succeed.\n  I offer my thoughts and comments today not as a criticism of the \nadministration, but rather because I feel that we have a deep \nobligation to make sure that as we proceed with this endeavor we do so \nwith thoughtfulness, not afraid to ask the tough questions that must be \nasked or address the issues that must be addressed, and with the unity \nof purpose that will guarantee our success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2253-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2253-S2254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 GUN-RELATED DEATHS ARE STILL TOO HIGH\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Centers' for Disease Control most \nrecent National Vital Statistics Report, which measures all causes of \ndeath in the United States reports that the death rate from firearm \ninjuries dropped nearly 6 percent from 1998 to 1999. The 1999 gun-death \ntoll was 28,874 persons, the first time the figure has dropped below \n30,000 since national statistics on gun deaths were first kept in 1979. \nPreliminary data indicate that there was likely another significant \ndecline in 2000. These are encouraging statistics, but the number of \npeople killed by guns each year is still far too high.\n  There are several important pieces of legislation before the Senate \nthat were designed to address gun violence. On April 24, 2001, Senator \nReed introduced the ``Gun Show Background Check Act.'' This bill would \nclose a loophole in the law which allows unlicenced private gun sellers \nto sell guns without conducting a National Instant Criminal Background \nSystem check. I cosponsored that bill because I believe it would be an \nimportant tool to prevent guns from getting into the hands of criminals \nand other people prohibited from owning a firearm.\n  The ``Use the National Instant Criminal Background System in \nTerrorist Investigations Act'' was introduced by Senator Kennedy and \nSchumer in the wake of September 11. This bill would reinstate the 90-\nday period for the FBI to retain and review NICS gun purchasing data \nrecords for irregularities and criminal activity. The need for this \nlegislation was demonstrated when the Attorney General denied the FBI \naccess to the NICS database to review gun sales to individuals they had \ndetained in response to the terrorist attacks. I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor of this bill and urge the Senate to act on this legislation.\n  Another important component of any strategy to reduce gun violence is \npreventing children from gaining access to firearms. Senator Durbin's \n``Children's Access Prevention Act'' would hold adults who fail to lock \nup a loaded firearm or an unloaded firearm with ammunition liable if \nthe weapon is taken by a child and used to kill or injure him or \nherself or another person. The bill also increases the penalties for \nselling a gun to a juvenile and creates a gun safety education program \nthat includes parent-teacher organizations, local law enforcement and \ncommunity organizations. I am also a cosponsor of this important bill \nthat would help to curb the thousands of preventable firearm deaths \nthat occur each year.\n  The statistics I mentioned support the argument that the Brady Law is \nworking to prevent gun-related deaths. However, the number of gun-\nrelated deaths is still disturbingly high and more must be done. The \nbills I support are common sense approaches to gun-safety that deserve \nthe attention of the Senate.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, all of us in this Chamber know the \ndedication of those on our staffs who work tirelessly to keep us \ninformed and keep this process moving forward. And, once in a great \nwhile, a staffer comes along who becomes so much a part of the process, \nso much a presence in this place, that few can't imagine the Senate \nwithout them.\n  Ed Hall, staff director on the Committee on Foreign Relations, is one \nof those people.\n  A dedicated public servant for more almost 25 years now, he has been \na rock-solid steady hand, an extraordinary professional, and--above \nall--a gentleman.\n  Now he is completing his final week with the U.S. Senate. And we wish \nhim well.\n  But before he goes, I hope Ed won't mind too much, though I know he \nwill, if I take a few minutes to pay tribute to him. Ed is one of those \nrare, talented staffers who always seems to know the answer before we \nask the question. He always has the facts.\n  He conscientiously attends to the details of the hearings, the \nlegislation, the briefing books, the negotiations--with a trademark \ncombination of wisdom and graciousness, and without ever expecting a \nword of thanks, much less an entire speech.\n  All of us know and appreciate the hard work and dogged efforts of our \nstaffs, but too often it goes unspoken. And rarely is it expressed on \nthe Senate floor. Bud Ed Hall is an exceptional man who deserves \nexceptional recognition for making what we do here possible.\n  He is here when most of us arrive. And he is here long after most of \nus have gone home.\n  He is one of the most decent, hard-working, fair-minded and open-\nhearted men I have met, loyal almost to a fault, a professional with no \nagenda but to promote the work of the committee, and to look after its \nstaff.\n  Ed is perceptive about human nature and profoundly patient with it. \nBut what has always impressed me is his encyclopedic grasp of the \nlegislative process, along with expert insight into parliamentary \nprocedure.\n  It takes that kind of experience, wisdom and finesses to get things \ndone around here, and make no mistake, Ed Hall gets things done.\n  Ed developed these traits, I am sure, at Harvard and Michigan, as an \nAssistant U.S. Attorney, then in private practice, the Marine Corps \nReserve and through a series of positions of distinction on Capitol \nHill.\n  He started in 1975 with Senator Claiborne Pell on the Rules \nCommittee, moving 3 years later to the Commerce Committee as Chief \nCounsel for Senator Howard Cannon.\n  Then Ed practiced law for a while in Idaho, but as anyone who knows \nhim could tell you, Ed Hall is no simple country lawyer, to borrow a \nphrase that was popularized by my Senate colleague Sam Ervin, who was \nhere and Ed and I first arrived, so he came back to the Senate as Chief \nCounsel on the Foreign Relations Committee, again working with Senator \nPell.\n  A few years later, I had the good sense and the good fortune to \nretain Ed as Minority Staff Director.\n  If there is one thing that I think I will always remember when I \nthink of Ed, it is his unique take on the legislative process and the \ngoings-on of the Senate.\n  He has been known to say that if you know what to listen for, you \nlearn after a while that the Senate produces a kind of music, combining \nrhythm, pace and melody wholly unique to this place.\n  Ed Hall has always known what to listen for.\n  As both minority and majority staff director, Ed's role has been a \nkind of\n\n[[Page S2254]]\n\nconductor, orchestrating our work to the music of the Senate.\n  During my time on the committee as ranking Democratic member, and \nthen as chairman, Ed oversaw Senate consent to ratify the chemical \nweapons convention, the reorganization of the U.S. foreign affairs \nagencies, the debate deciding the expansion of NATO, and the \nestablishment of a way to pay our country's arrearage to the United \nNations.\n  He did it in close coordination with his Republican colleagues on the \ncommittee--sometimes at odds over small matters of language. Sometimes \nat odds over major issues of fundamental principle. But Ed has always \nbridged the gap.\n  He treats all parties with respect, and tries to accommodate all \ninterests involved. His success in so doing is evidenced by the close \npersonal friendship he shared with Admiral James ``Bud'' Nance, Staff \nDirector for my distinguished colleague from North Carolina, Chairman \nHelms, until Bud passed away in 1999.\n  Bud and Ed genuinely cared for one another, and the maturity and \nmutual approval that they brought to the job filtered down through all \nthe ranks of their respective staffs.\n  It is not for nothing that some of the younger staff members refer to \nEd Hall as ``Daddy Ed.'' He has led by example, bringing out the best \nin those for whom he is responsible and helping them feel that what \nthey do is more than a mere job.\n  But, though I can't imagine where he finds the time, Ed Hall's work \ndoesn't end when he leaves his office.\n  Ed's collaborative and caring approach to working with others is \nconsistent with his religious convictions. He has been modest about \nthem while in the office, but generous in expressing his faith through \nintense involvement in community affairs.\n  Ed has long been active in the work of ``The Green Door,'' a \nnonprofit organization that helps the mentally ill achieve independence \nand self-sufficiency.\n  He is a member of the board of directors for Episcopal Relief and \nDevelopment, which provides assistance to those in need in the United \nStates and abroad.\n  And he has been an at-large trustee for the Virginia Theological \nSeminary, where he will soon be vice president for Institutional \nAdvancement.\n  We can only hope that Ed's new position will give him more time with \nhis family. To his wife, Sherry, let me say thank you for all the times \nshe kept his dinner warm on my account.\n  Ed Hall has always seen to it that I receive the best possible \npreparation for a speech, and that the staff maintain a modest \ncollection of quotations for such occasions, and that it is always \nat hand.\n\n  So it will be no surprise if Ed recognizes something that the English \nessayist G.K. Chesteron once said:\n\n       The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting; \n     it has been found difficult and left untried.\n\n  Well, I am here to tell you that while some may have found it \ndifficult, and perhaps some have not tried hard enough, Ed Hall is \nliving proof of a transcendent ideal that people of all convictions \nwill recognize: he is an abundant spirit, a humble soul.\n  He is a pillar of this institution. In a place where turnover is the \norder of the day, he has been a rarity, and he leaves a legacy of \nservice for which the Senate will be forever grateful.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting Edwin K. Hall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2254-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DEPARTURE OF WALLY BURNETT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

I know that I speak for \nall members of the subcommittee in wishing him well and thanking him \nfor his fine service.\n  Wally Burnett brought a wealth of experience to the subcommittee \nstaff given his prior experience as Deputy Assistant Secretary of \nBudget and Programs at the Department of Transportation during the \nadministration of President George H.

This trait could be seen across all of \nthe Transportation bills that Chairman Stevens and Chairman Shelby \nushered through the Senate.\n  While Wally always demonstrated a strong sense of duty to the entire \nNation, Wally never forgot that he is an Alaskan. And while Wally could \nnot always be depended upon to wear a jacket to subcommittee and full \ncommittee meetings, he could be depended upon to provide his most \nexpert views in an informed and balanced manner. I will always be \ngrateful for the many courtesies that Wally demonstrated toward me, \nwhether I was serving as a junior minority member of the subcommittee \nor as subcommittee chairman.\n  As Wally leaves his position in the Senate, I wish him the best of \nluck in his new endeavor. I also express my hope that his tirelessly \npatient wife, Kristin, and his children, Tucker and Mattern, will \nfinally see more of him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2254-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                LEADERSHIP AT THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I recognize the \nachievements of a great Kentuckian. Dr. Lee Todd has not yet completed \nhis first year as President of the University of Kentucky, but he has \nalready left his mark on Kentucky's largest public educational \ninstitution. His approach to academic governance has earned him the \naccolades of both the students and faculty of the University of \nKentucky, as well as from local community leaders.\n  Dr. Todd's success at UK should not come as a surprise. As an alumnus \nof the University, he understands the interests and passions of the \nstudents. His training and tenure as an academic has given him a \ndetailed understanding of the challenges and needs of the faculty. And \nhis career as a successful businessman has well-prepared him to forge \nan efficient and responsive administration that is dually committed to \ncrafting excellence in education and enhancement of UK's endowment. I \nhave no doubt that he will succeed at both goals.\n  Building upon the achievements of his predecessors, Dr. Todd has \ncontinued to bring top-notch research and teaching faculty to Kentucky. \nIn addition, he has forged greater cooperation with and stronger ties \nto the Lexington community--a relationship that promises to be mutually \nbeneficial. From UK's truly exceptional Medical Center to its important \nagricultural research, the University of Kentucky is not merely a \npreeminent state educational institution, but a tremendous asset to the \nLexington community and the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky. Likewise, \nPresident Todd has worked to create a partnership with the federal \ngovernment, a partnership I look forward to continuing in the future.\n  President Lee Todd has brought with him innovative ideas and a \ncommitment to excellence at the University of Kentucky. I hope that the \nstudents of the University and the people of Kentucky are lucky enough \nto have President Todd at the helm for a very long time. Kentucky is \nfortunate to be able to claim Dr. Todd, his wife Patsy, and his \nchildren Troy and Kathryn as citizens.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Dr. Todd for his \nservice to the Commonwealth of Kentucky and to higher \neducation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2254-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2254-S2255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN HONOR OF PHILIP AUTHIER, MPH, RN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Philip Authier is also Vice President of Patient Care \nat St. Mary's Healthcare Center, in Pierre, South Dakota. Among his \nmany accomplishments, Mr. Authier, has been a member of AONE for 17 \nyears and served on the AONE Board of Directors from 1995 to 1999. \nDuring this time he also served on AONE's Finance Committee and as a \nAONE representative to the Region 6 Regional Policy Board of the \nAmerican Hospital Association. In addition, he is a past president of \nSouth Dakota Organization of Nurse Executives and has\n\n[[Page S2255]]\n\nchaired the finance and nursing policy committees of the South Dakota \nBoard of Nursing. In 2000, by a national membership vote, he was \nelected President-Elect for a one year term beginning January 1, 2001, \nand took on his current position as President this past January.\n  As President, Philip Authier will help lead the AONE in its mission \nto facilitate excellence in the nursing practices; to offer \nprofessional development opportunities; to influence health policy; and \nto support research and development in nursing administration. His \nexperience and expertise will help to achieve the important goal of \nimproving the recruitment and retainment of individuals to this very \nimportant profession. I am confident that his experience and expertise \nwithin this profession will help to achieve these goals.\n  Once again, I commend and congratulate Philip Authier, a fellow South \nDakotan, on his national leadership role in helping to address the \nneeds and concerns of the nursing profession throughout the \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2255-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A POEM BY DEBBIE ROGERS\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON.

Mr. President, I want to share with my \ncolleagues an excellent column by Thomas E. Thornhill that appeared in \nCharleston's The Post and Courier on March 15, 2002. Mr. Thornhill \npoints out the need to balance the environmental and esthetic \nconsequences of expanding the port of Charleston with the economic \nbenefits such expansion brings.\n  As we debate what to do with the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge as \npart of the energy bill, I think it is important to add to our dialogue \na perspective from someone who has seen the consequences of expansion \nin South Carolina, and who believes that nature mismanaged retaliates \nwith relentless vengeance.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n      The article follows.\n\n          [From the Post and Courier, Friday, Mar. 15, 2002.]\n\n       Port of Charleston Should Live Within Nature's Tolerances\n\n                        (By Thomas E. Thornhill)\n\n       How about a different slant on the port expansion issue? Do \n     we really know what Charleston Harbor can tolerate? This is a \n     finite body of water which has some limitations dictated by \n     nature. Yes, expansion of the port facilities will mean more \n     business, more trucks, more highway building, etc., but what \n     will it do to our rivers and harbor?\n       My brother and I have been working for water and soil \n     conservation for over 40 years. Our father coined the phrase, \n     ``Nature mismanaged, retaliates with relentless vengeance.''\n       We, the citizens, and the Corps of Engineers mismanaged \n     nature with the diversion of the Santee River into the Cooper \n     River, and we're still paying for it. We were pumping enough \n     mud out of Charleston Harbor to cover peninsular Charleston \n     by about 6 feet each year. That was reduced with another \n     diversion or rediversion canal, but the mud continues to \n     build up--just look at Drum Island and the Cooper side of \n     Daniel Island--tons and tons of spoil pumped from the \n     rivers..\n       We are not a locale of deep water; let's recognize that. \n     You need only spend a few days in our creeks and marshes to \n     know that we have that wonderful pluff mud, the nursery \n     grounds for the Atlantic Coast fisheries, that does not and \n     will not stay in place like rock and sand of other ports.\n       Waterside construction causes the natural flow to slow and, \n     in short order, the mud builds up. How else would we have \n     land east of East Bay Street, which was the city sea wall. \n     Look at the SPA Passenger Terminal, Yacht Basin, Maritime \n     Center--full of mud. Examine the land around the Sheraton \n     Hotel or Comfort Inn along the Ashley. It's sinking. There is \n     no way to contain our mud except by gentle slopes and \n     marshes.\n       As we dig our channels deeper and deeper, we are \n     mismanaging nature. We cannot dig 50-foot ditches in our \n     rivers without causing sloughing off of the shoreline, the \n     changing of the flow of our rivers, and the sinking of our \n     highlands. The harbor jetties are blamed for the demise of \n     Morris Island so that the lighthouse is now at sea. The \n     jetties are blamed for changing the geography on Folly \n     Island. Breakwaters, jetties and revetments are now outlawed \n     as they caused more erosion that they were designed to cure.\n       Charleston Harbor has limits dictated by nature. We cannot \n     continue to defy natural laws by overbuilding our shorelines, \n     packing our marshes with silt and fill, and overpopulating \n     our water courses. We cannot be one of the largest shipping \n     ports in the country and yet have the finest harbor resource \n     on the East coast. We cannot fill our waterfronts with docks \n     and still be America's Most Historic City and have the \n     quality of life that goes with it. We cannot double the \n     amount of super ships and still have one of the finest \n     recreational and scenic harbors in the world--to say nothing \n     about the inability of our transportation network to handle \n     the additional load.\n       Trucks are clogging I-26 and I-526 on any workday. Driving \n     a car is hazardous. The State Ports Authority has done a \n     magnificent job to make our port facilities and service the \n     envy of the world. With this same talent, they now need to \n     find a future that can live within the environmental \n     restraints that nature has dealt us. Perhaps their future \n     should be planned as though Daniel Island did not exist--the \n     filling of those marshlands is damage enough. We must not, as \n     the Bible teaches, ``sell our birthright for a mess of \n     pottage.''\n       As a port, we should live within the hand dealt us by \n     nature. As a port city, we should do the best with what we \n     were given to save it for future generations. Remember that \n     thousands of acres of marsh have been destroyed just to keep \n     the harbor dredged and remember that every structure on a \n     waterway or beach causes erosion problems elsewhere. Of \n     course the Port produces jobs and economic benefit (it always \n     has and will), but the incremental increase gained by \n     increasing the size of port facilities is to the profit of a \n     relatively small amount of the population, while those who \n     live here must shoulder the burden, esthetically, \n     economically and environmentally. ``Nature mismanaged \n     retaliates with relentless vengeance.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2255-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2255-S2256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN TRIBUTE TO COLONEL CHARLES E. MCGEE\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in these perilous times, citizens who \nhave overcome adversity to serve our nation with distinction deserve to \nbe recognized. I rise today to pay special tribute to an American who \nhas served with distinction as both a fighter pilot and a civilian. In \na 30 year military career that included service in three foreign wars, \nColonel Charles E. McGee logged over 6,300 flying hours, including over \n1,100 hours on more than 400 fighter combat missions.\n  Colonel McGee's career began with enlistment in the U.S. Army and \nsubsequent training at the Tuskegee Army Air Field in 1942. Upon \ngraduation in 1943, Colonel McGee flew 136 missions with the 302nd \nFighter Squadron of the 332nd Fighter Group in the European African \nMiddle Eastern Theater. Tactical missions were flown under the 12th Air \nForce using the P-39\n\n[[Page S2256]]\n\nAerocobra and then, on transfer to 15th Air Force, strategic missions \nflying the P-47 Thunderbolt and P-51 Mustang. He returned to Tuskegee \nas a captain and served as a Twin-Engine Instructor until the close of \nthe base.\n  Colonel McGee later served in the 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, \nflying the P-51 aircraft on 100 missions during the Korean War, earning \nhim a promotion to Major. In 1953, Colonel McGee returned to the United \nStates to attend the Air Force Command and Staff School at Maxwell Air \nBase, AL. Upon graduation, he was qualified to fly the F-89 Interceptor \nand promoted to Lt. Colonel.\n  In 1967, Colonel McGee received tactical Reconnaissance and RF-4C \nflight training and was assigned to command the 16th TAC Recon Squadron \nat Tan son Nhut Air Base. From there, he flew 172 missions in Vietnam, \nearning the Legion of Merit.\n  After his tour in Vietnam, Col. McGee was stationed in Europe, where \nhe served USEUR and the 7th Army in Air Liaison duty and was promoted \nto Colonel. He then served as Chief of Maintenance of the 50th Tactical \nFighter Wing. He returned to the United States in 1971 to serve for two \nyears at Richard Gebaur Air Force Base, MO. He served the Air Force \nCommunications Service as Director of Maintenance Engineering and \nCommander of the base and the 1840th Air Base Wing before retiring in \n1973. Over his career, he received many awards, including: the Legion \nof Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, Distinguished Flying Cross with two Oak \nLeaf Clusters, Legion of Merit, Air Medal with 25 Oak Leaf Clusters, \nArmy Commendation Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, President Unit \nCitation, Korean President Unit Citation, and the Republic of Greece \nWWII Commendation Medal.\n  Colonal McGee's service to his fellow citizens did not end with his \nretirement from the military. In 1972, he assisted in the founding of \nTuskegee Airman, Incorporated. This organization is dedicated to the \npreservation of the Tuskegee Airman legacy and the motivation of \nAmerican youth, with a focus on minority youth, toward career interests \nin aerospace technology. To date the organization has raised over $1.7 \nmillion and helped over 500 gifted American students of all races. \nCurrently, Colonel McGee is serving his second term as the \norganization's Executive President.\n  Throughout his life, Colonel McGee has shown extraordinary commitment \nto both our nation and his fellow citizens. Early in life, he overcame \na society adverse to the advancement of African Americans and served \nwith distinction in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Even in \nretirement, Colonel McGee remains dedicated to the advancement of \nAmerican youth and our Nation. On behalf of the citizens of Missouri \nand our great nation, I thank Colonel McGee for a lifetime of \noutstanding service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2256-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE SPEARFISH SPARTANS ARE THE 2002 SOUTH DAKOTA STATE MEN'S ``A'' \n                          BASKETBALL CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate the Spearfish Spartans. The Spartans, under second-year \ncoach Dan Martin, won the South Dakota State ``AA'' Basketball \nTournament March 16 in Rapid City, SD.\n  Coach Martin's squad went through the 2001-2002 season with only one \nloss, a double-overtime setback to Gillette, WY, a squad that went on \nto win its own State title. The Spartans entered the State tournament \nwith an impressive 20-1 mark and defeated Rapid City Central and \nWatertown before rallying in the final exciting minutes to overtake \nSioux Falls Lincoln, 65-61, for the State title. It was the Spartans' \nfirst-ever State basketball championship and the first Class ``AA'' \ntitle for a team west of the Missouri River since 1989.\n  The team was guided this season by the senior leadership provided by \nDeming Haugland, Aaron Croff, Slade Larscheid and Timm Cooper. Haugland \nand Croff were joined by Spartan sophomore Matt Martin on the all-\ntournament team and Haugland received the coveted Spirit of Su Award, \nfor his sportsmanship and actions both on and off the basketball court.\n  As Coach Martin told ``The Black Hills Pioneer'' after the title \nvictory, ``It was due to a lot of hard work. The boys put a lot of \nblood and sweat into it and they deserve it.'' I want to commend and \napplaud the community of Spearfish for their support of young people. \nThis title reflects that community support.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor and \ncongratulate Tara Lynn Poe of Paris, KY. Ms. Poe was recently crowned \nthe 2002 Kentucky Cherry Blossom Princess and will serve as ambassador \nfor Kentucky in the historic 90th Cherry Blossom Festival to be held \nhere in our Nation's capital March 30 through April 6.\n  In 1912, a prominent group of citizens in Japan graciously donated \nabout 3,000 cherry blossom trees, which are not native to North \nAmerica, to Washington, DC as a symbol of friendship between the United \nStates and Japan. First Lady Helen Herron Taft, who had briefly lived \nin Yokohama, Japan, decided to bring the beauty of Japan to the then \nswampy Tidal Basin. Mrs. Taft, along with Vicountess Chinda, wife of \nthe Japanese Ambassador, planted the first two trees on March 27, 1912 \nin West Potomac Park. These 89 year old trees are still living on the \nTidal Basin today. By 1939, State societies across the Nation were \nrecruiting capable and accomplished female college students to be \ncherry blossom princesses to represent their respective States in the \nceremonies and festival parade. The events were and still remain an \nattempt to educate young women about the history and political makeup \nof various cultures around the world. Although the festivities \nexperienced a slight delay with the outbreak of WWII in 1941, they soon \nregained their grandeur in 1948 and were able to help foster the \nhealing process between the United States and Japan. More than 2,500 \nstudents have participated in the cherry blossom princess program since \n1948.\n  As a proud representative of the Commonwealth of Kentucky in this \nyear's Cherry Blossom Festival, Tara Lynn Poe, a freshman at Centre \nCollege in Danville, KY, will have the unique opportunity to personally \nmeet with President Bush and First Lady Laura Bush. She will be \npresenting them with a copy of a children's book by Lexington author \nPaul Brett Johnson for the library foundation. Furthermore, Tara will \nhave the chance to learn from and with her fellow princesses and all \ninvolved in the festival about Japan and other countries, international \nrelations, and American culture, politics, and history. On April 5th by \na random spin of the wheel, Tara will be eligible to be crowned this \nyear's Cherry Blossom Queen and if selected will be invited to visit \nJapan, where she will be hosted by local dignitaries, including the \nJapanese Prime Minister and the Speaker of the Japanese Diet.\n  Kentuckians should be proud to have Tara Lynn Poe representing the \nCommonwealth in the Cherry Blossom Festival and I wish her the best in \nall of her future pursuits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2256-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2256-S2257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF E.I. du PONT De NEMOURS AND COMPANY\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, over the past few weeks, banners \nhave started\n\n[[Page S2257]]\n\nto appear on light-posts in my home town of Wilmington, DE, announcing \nthe celebration of the 200th anniversary of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and \nCompany, more familiarly and succinctly known as the DuPont Company.\n  It is a fairly modest call of attention to a remarkable event and a \nremarkable business institution. DuPont is the oldest company in \nDelaware, and certainly one of the oldest in our Nation; it has \nemployed hundreds of thousands of people in my State and millions \naround the world; it is a leader in scientific innovation that has \nremained dynamic throughout its history, changing with the times and, \nwith more patents than any other American firm, sometimes itself \nchanging the times.\n  One symbol of DuPont keeping and even setting the pace, will soon be \nseen by NASCAR fans around the country. DuPont is the primary sponsor \nof Jeff Gordon's race team, and beginning this month, Mr. Gordon will \nbe driving a special DuPont 200th anniversary car, which was unveiled \nin Wilmington last fall.\n  The name DuPont is familiar throughout and well beyond our Nation, \nbut many of our citizens, even NASCAR fans, may not realize how \nfamiliar DuPont products are in their daily lives, and may not know \nmuch of the history of the company that has endured and evolved, with a \ncentral place in our scientific and economic life, and with such great \nimportance to our State of Delaware.\n  Founded in 1802 by Eleuthere Irenee du Pont, with $36,000 in capital, \n18 shares at $2,000 a piece, DuPont began as a gunpowder plant, \nEleutherian Mills, on the Brandywine River near Wilmington. By 1811, \nDuPont was the largest manufacturer of gunpowder in the United States.\n  Explosives long remained an important aspect of the company. During \nWorld War I, DuPont supplied the Allies with 1.5 billion pounds of \nmilitary explosives, as well as providing American industry with half \nthe dynamite and blasting powder needed for construction and mining. \nAnd during World War II, DuPont produced 4.5 billion pounds of military \nexplosives, as well as nylon for parachutes, tents, ropes and other \nmilitary supplies. The company also contributed to the Manhattan \nProject, with the Hanford plant in Washington and the Oak Ridge plant \nin Tennessee, and built and operated chemical plants related to the war \neffort.\n  It was in the company's 100th anniversary year, 1902, that three of \nE.I. du Pont's great-grandsons bought out old partners, and started to \nmove toward diversification, opening Eastern Laboratory and, in 1903, \nthe Experimental Station in Wilmington. DuPont was soon in the dye \nbusiness, the rayon business, and after a company researcher named \nWilliam Hale Church made cellophane moisture-proof in 1927, the food \npackaging business. DuPont research in the 1920s also led to the \ndevelopment of a quick-drying paint for cars, which helped speed the \nmanufacturing process, so DuPont's automotive history goes back a long \nway.\n  The 1930s saw the development of, among other products, nylon, the \nfirst true synthetic textile fiber, which I mentioned was so important \nearly on in World War II supplies; Teflon', which evolved in \npart out of war-related research and which we know from our own kitchen \nsupplies; Butacite', which is used in shatter-proof glass; \nand Lucite'.\n  The 1950s brought the development of Mylar', which has \nuses from balloons to insulation, as well as Dacron' \npolyester, Orlon' acrylic fiber and the well-known \nLycra' brand fiber, which can stretch to five times its size \nwithout losing its shape. DuPont also started its serious global \ninvestment, with the opening of the International Department, in 1958.\n  In 1964, researcher Stephanie Kwolek, whom I have had the pleasure of \nmeeting, developed the remarkably strong fiber that we know as \nKevlar', which, in its application in body armor, has saved \nthousands of police officers' lives. Tyvek', which we see so \noften as building wrap, was also developed for commercial application \nin the 1960s, as was Nomex'--where we again give credit to \nDr. Kwolek, along with Paul Morgan, for their research. \nNomex' is a heat-resistant fiber with a range of uses, the \nmost well known of which is in protective gear for fire-fighters. \nCorian', which is now so familiar as a counter-top surface, \nfollowed shortly after.\n  To summarize where DuPont was at the close of the 1960s in terms of \nits leadership and innovation, especially in textile fibers, I'll note \nthat when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon in 1969, he was wearing a \nspace suit made up of 25 layers; 23 of those layers were DuPont \nmaterials.\n  The DuPont Company has continued to explore science-based solutions \nto real-world problems in a range of markets, from health care and \nnutrition to apparel and textiles to performance coatings and polymers \nto construction and electronics, always working to develop new products \nand to find innovative applications even for old workhorses like \npolyester and nylon. Just to note two current efforts, DuPont is \nundertaking leading-edge work in biotechnology, notably soy proteins, \nand in polymers, with an advanced technology now known as \nSorona'.\n  Among the many events in this anniversary year, in April, DuPont will \nbe presented with the National Building Museum's 2002 Honor Award, and \nI am proud to serve on the Leadership Committee for that event. In \nannouncing the award, the Building Museum folks noted, ``It is \ndifficult to imagine many aspects of modern construction without DuPont \nproducts, which make buildings safer, more durable, and more \nefficient.''\n  In addition to its industry leadership, the DuPont Company has set \nthe standard, which has been followed by other leading businesses in \nour State, for outstanding corporate citizenship. The Company has long \nengaged in generous charitable giving and support of non-profit \nagencies, both near its corporate home in Delaware and in communities \nwhere it operates throughout the world, as well as supporting and \nencouraging volunteer work and community leadership by its employees. \nDuPont has made a particular and extensive investment in science \neducation and research, from kindergarten classrooms to university \nlaboratories.\n  So this 200-year-old Company remains an innovator, an investor in \nsustainable and successful communities, and a charitable leader in \nDelaware, across the country and around the world. I have not always \nagreed with the Board Chairs and CEOs of the DuPont Company over the \nlast 30 years, but I have always respected them, and deeply respected \nthe place of honor that the DuPont Company has earned in Delaware and \nin the international business community.\n  So on behalf of the DuPont Company's neighbors and fellow citizens in \nDelaware, I am proud to honor its 200th anniversary, and to extend \ncongratulations to the company's board, executive leaders and \nemployees, along with our very best wishes for continued success in \nbringing ``The miracles of science''' to life in a way that \nserves us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2257-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2257-S2258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       JOHN E. ROBSON, PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN, EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in tribute to John Robson, \nthe President and Chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United \nStates, who passed away yesterday morning.\n  John had a truly remarkable career in both the public and private \nsectors. Prior to becoming President and Chairman of the Export-Import \nBank last year, he most recently had been a senior adviser with the San \nFrancisco investment banking firm of Robertson Stephens. He served as \nDeputy Secretary of the Treasury under former President Bush from 1989-\n1992, and was Dean of the Emory School of Business from 1986-88. From \n1978-85 he was President and Chief Executive Officer of the \npharmaceutical company G.D. Searle. He served as Chairman of the U.S. \nCivil Aeronautics Board from 1975-77, and was Under Secretary of \nTransportation from 1967-69. He was a graduate of Yale College and \nHarvard Law School.\n  I first worked with John during the crisis in the savings and loan \nindustry in the 1980's. As Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, he served \nas the Administration's point person in dealing with one of the most \nserious financial crises since the Great Depression. During that \nexperience, I came to know John as a very tough and determined leader\n\n[[Page S2258]]\n\nwho helped restore stability to an important segment of the U.S. \nfinancial system.\n  Most recently, I worked closely with John in his role as President \nand Chairman of the Export-Import Bank. In my view, the Bank and the \nAdministration were very fortunate to get an individual of John's \nexperience and stature for that challenging job.\n  The Export-Import Bank has a crucial role to play in helping U.S. \nexporters to compete in international markets against foreign companies \nwho receive export subsidies from their governments. However, the \nEximbank is often criticized from both the left and the right as \nproviding unnecessary subsidies to U.S. exporters. In addition, the \nEximbank also often receives internal challenges within the \nAdministration from the Treasury Department and OMB, who try to assert \ncontrol over the Bank. John was extraordinarily well suited to provide \nthe leadership to defend the important role the Export-Import Bank \nplays in U.S. trade policy within the Administration, and to explain \nthat role to the Congress and the public.\n  I was privileged to work closely with John in crafting S. 1372, the \nExport-Import Bank Reauthorization Act, which was just passed by the \nSenate last week. I am hopeful that the Congress will soon complete \naction on that legislation and send it to the White House for the \nPresident's signature. It would be a fitting tribute to John's \nleadership of the Eximbank.\n  I would like to extend my condolences of John's wife, Margaret, and \nhis son, Douglas. Our country will miss John's outstanding leadership \nand dedicated service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2258-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    IN CELEBRATION OF DELANCEY STREET FOUNDATION'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to share with the Senate my thoughts on the 30th \nAnniversary of the Delancey Street Foundation.\n  It is my great pleasure to honor the extraordinary contributions of \nthe Delancey Street Foundation. Thirty years ago, Delancey Street began \noffering outstanding self-help services to former felons, substance \nabusers and the homeless who wanted to build a new life. Today, \nDelancey Street is one of the most successful drug treatment programs \nin the Nation and has earned a reputation as an international model for \nrehabilitation. At no cost to the taxpayer or client, Delancey Street \nhas offered thousands of residents the necessary academic, vocational \nand interpersonal skills to turn their lives around and become \nproductive members of society. Recently, Delancey Street began a unique \npartnership with San Francisco State University to provide residents \nwith college degrees. Delancey Street is a shining light for people who \nhave nowhere else to turn.\n  Delancey Street is all the more impressive because its training \nschools provide important skills to its residents while providing \nwonderful services to the community. It now operates five facilities \nthroughout the country, including its headquarters in San Francisco. \nDelancey Street has many thriving enterprises such as a moving company, \nprint and copy shop, Christmas tree lots, automotive services center \nand the renowned Delancey Street Restaurant, all run entirely by the \nresidents.\n  None of this would be possible without the amazing Mimi Silbert, \nPresident and Co-Founder of Delancey Street. Her dedication, foresight, \nbusiness sense and compassion embody the spirit of Delancey Street. I \nsend my warmest congratulations to Mimi and all of the staff, \nresidents, volunteers and alumni on 30 years of success and my best \nwishes for even better decades ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2258-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING MR.

In 1992, he served as a Water \nResources Advisor, through a Congressional Fellowship, to the \ndistinguished Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan from New York, then \nChairman of Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  Mr. Sanford has been the recipient of several public service awards. \nHe has been honored by the United States Department of the Army for his \nsignificant contributions to national policy issues related to water \nresources and military infrastructure.\n  Through the years, many members of Congress have relied on Mr. \nSanford's insight and advice. He is trusted and respected throughout \nWashington and the Federal Government. Additionally, he has mentored \nmany young people within the Corps of Engineers, encouraging them to \nserve their nation to the best of their ability.\n  David Sanford, Jr. has dedicated nearly 34 years to the United States \nArmy Corps of Engineers, serving with honor and distinction. The Corps \npublic engineering services are renowned as world class. David, as a \ncareer member of the Corps elite force, has exhibited the kind of \ncharacter and leadership that has been associated with the Corps.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate the Custer Wildcats. The Wildcats under veteran coach \nLarry Luitjens, won the South Dakota Class ``A'' Basketball Tournament \nMarch 16 in Sioux Falls, SD.\n  This is the fifth title in a dozen years for the Wildcats and Coach \nLuitjens. Custer defeated Pine Ridge and Crow Creek to advance to the \nchampionship game against long-time State tournament rival Lennox. The \nWildcats rallied to win the contest 55-50. Custer had defeated Lennox \nto claim State titles in 1992, 1993 and 1998. Lennox defeated Custer \nfor the 1991 title. This is the first State title won by Custer since \nthe 1998 championship, when Derek Paulsen hit a game-winning basket. \nJust over a year later, Derek was tragically killed in an automobile \naccident.\n  This year's team included the athletic talents of Derek's brother, \nPaige, and their father Fred is a long-time Assistant Coach to \nLuitjens. ``It was just four years ago that we were here on this same \nfloor and Derek made the last shot that won the game for us,'' Coach \nLuitjens told the Rapid City Journal after this year's title victory. \n``You can't help but think about him.'' Guided by the spirit and memory \nof Derek Paulsen, the team won 20 of their last 21 games. Another \nspecial highlight this season came when Coach Luitjens became the \nwinningest coach in South Dakota basketball history.\n  Luitjens' 35-year coaching career includes stints with DeSmet, SD, \nand New England, ND, and the long-time coach now has a record of 590-\n224. Larry's teams from 1989 to 1991 put together a string of 49 \nconsecutive victories, South Dakota's longest winning streak among \nState ``A'' teams. Larry is known for his coaching expertise and the \nquality of teams he puts on the basketball court each year. He is also \nwell-respected for the sportsmanship he instills in his players and the \nstudents he mentors each year and the relationships he fosters between \nhis team and other teams in South Dakota, especially teams on South \nDakota's Indian reservations.\n  I want to applaud and commend the community of Custer for their \nongoing support of young people. This title reflects that community \nsupport. I want to acknowledge Superintendent Tim Creal and Athletic \nDirector Paul Anderson and recognize the dedicated efforts of Head \nCoach and Principal Larry Luitjens and Assistant Coaches Fred Paulsen, \nChris Kolker and Neil Sieger.

A bill to provide emergency agricultural assistance to \nproducers of the 2002 crop; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an agricultural \nsupplemental assistance package for the 2002 crops. I had hoped we \nwould not be in this position today. Unfortunately, due to delays in \ncompleting the farm bill conference report prior to the Easter recess, \nI believe it is necessary to introduce this legislation.\n  I want to make it very clear that in introducing this legislation, it \ndoes not mean the farm bill is dead. It may need CPR, but it certainly \nis not dead. Quite the contrary. The staff of conferees have been \ninstructed by the distinguished leadership of both parties of the House \nand Senate to continue to work over the recess period in the hope that \na bill can be completed shortly after the Easter recess. Having been \ninvolved in numerous farm bills, I know these conferences can often \nbecome quite contentious and bogged down.\n  Furthermore, it is not going to be easy to implement this bill, not \nto mention the wisdom of simply trying to push through a bill so we can \njust say it applies to 2002 crops. That may be easy to do this year, \nbut it may be difficult to live under the problems we could create for \nthe next 5 or 6 years.\n  Has anyone really stopped to consider this?\n  In addition, we already have many farmers in the South who have begun \ntheir spring planting, and producers all throughout the Nation will \nbegin to pull their drills through the fields in the coming weeks. Many \nof these producers and their bankers are desperately trying to run \ncashflow charts and figure out exactly what they will be dealing with \nfor this current crop as they work to determine their operating loans. \nThey are scratching their heads.\n  The biggest uncertainty they face is the level and form of \nagricultural assistance for this crop-year. Will it be through a new \nfarm bill, if we can get through a new farm bill--and I certainly hope \nwe can and people are working in good faith to get that accomplished--\nbut will it be through a new farm bill in place for the 2002 crops, or \nwill it be through a supplemental assistance package for 2002 while the \nnew bill would go into effect for the 2003 crops?\n  My point in introducing this legislation is to send a clear message \nto producers and their bankers, and that message is this: We are going \nto do everything in our power in Congress to get a farm bill completed \nand out the door, but we should also make sure it is a good bill, and \ndoing a good bill does take time. If additional time is needed to \ncomplete the bill past the time when it can apply to this year's crops, \nwe are then ready to come in with a supplemental assistance package.\n  This is an important line in the sand that our producers and our \nlenders can use to gauge cashflow projections as they work on operating \nloans for this crop-year. It is an important and necessary signal as we \nmove toward a planting season that will soon be in full swing in many \nparts of the country.\n  Unlike the 1,400-page farm bill we passed in the Senate, there are no \nsurprises in this supplemental legislation. The bill is very similar to \nthe assistance packages we have provided to our producers in recent \nyears, and it adheres to the budget allocations that were provided for \nagriculture in last year's budget resolution.\n  I have a list of levels of assistance that will be provided to \nfarmers and ranchers. The levels of assistance are as follows:\n  $5.047 billion for a Market Loss Assistance, MLA, payment equal to \nthe 2000 AMTA payment received by our producers. On a crop-by-crop \nbasis, this is: wheat, 58.8 cents a bushel; corn, 33.4 cents a bushel; \nsorghum, 40 cents a bushel; barley, 25.1 cents a bushel; cotton, 7.33 \ncents a pound; rice, $2.60 per cwt; oats, 2.8 cents a bushel.\n  All of these figures are above the level of MLAs we provided last \nyear.\n  The bill also includes: $466 million for oilseed payments; $55.21 \nmillion for payments to peanut producers; $93 million for recourse \nloans to honey producers; $186 million for specialty crop commodity \npurchases, with at least $55 million used for school lunch program \npurchases; $16.94 million for payments to wool and mohair producers; \n$93 million for cottonseed assistance; LDP eligibility for crops \nproduced on non-AMTA acreage; LDP graze-out for wheat, barley, and oats \nfor the 2002 crop; extension of the dairy price support program through \nDecember 31, 2002; $20 million for payment to producers of pulse crops; \n$100 million for tobacco assistance; $44 million for Conservation \nReserve Program Technical Assistance; $200 million for the Wetlands \nReserve Program; $300 million in additional funds for the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program, EQIP; $161 million for the Farmland \nProtection Program; and $500 million for the livestock feed assistance \nprogram, LAP, to provide assistance to producers for losses suffered in \n2001 and 2002.\n  I will be happy to talk this proposal over with my colleagues, and I \nseek bipartisan cosponsors in this effort. These market loss assistance \nlevels are above the levels provided to program crops last year and \nthey are similar to the AMTA payment levels we provided in 2000.\n  In closing, while this package does not represent a new farm bill, it \ndoes send a strong signal to producers and their bankers that even if a \nfarm bill cannot be completed in time to apply to the 2002 year crop, \nwe do intend to hold them whole or have a hold harmless bill at a level \nof Market Loss Assistance that is somewhat higher than occurred last \nyear.\n  Many of us are hearing from producers and lenders for guidance on \nwhat to plan for in terms of assistance this year. This bill makes \nclear we stand ready to again support our producers if we cannot \ncomplete the new bill in time for 2002 crops, which I hope we can do. I \nurge support for this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 2042. A bill to expand access to affordable health care and to \nstrengthen the health care safety net and make health care services \nmore available in rural and underserved areas; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my good friend \nand colleague, the Senator from Louisiana, Mary Landrieu, in \nintroducing the Access to Affordable Health Care Act. This is a \ncomprehensive seven-point plan that builds on the strengths of our \ncurrent programs, both public and private, to make quality affordable \nhealth care available to millions more Americans.\n  One of my top priorities in the Senate has been to expand access to \naffordable health care to all Americans. There are still far too many \npeople in our country without health insurance or with woefully \ninadequate coverage. An estimated 39 million Americans do not have \nhealth care insurance, including more than 150,000 in my home State of \nMaine.\n  The fact is, health insurance matters. The simple fact is that people \nwith health insurance are healthier than those who lack coverage. \nPeople without health insurance are less likely to seek care when they \nneed it and tend to forgo services such as periodic checkups and \npreventative services. As a consequence, they are far more likely to be \nhospitalized or to require costly medical attention for conditions that \ncould have been prevented or cured if caught at an early stage.\n\n[[Page S2263]]\n\n  Not only does this put the health of these individuals at greater \nrisk, but it also puts additional pressure on our already financially \nchallenged hospitals and emergency rooms. Compared with people who have \nhealth insurance coverage, uninsured adults are four times and \nuninsured children five times more likely to use a hospital emergency \nroom. The costs of care for these individuals are often absorbed by \nproviders and then passed on to covered individuals through increased \nfees and higher insurance premiums.\n  Maine is in the midst of a growing health insurance crisis. Insurance \npremiums are rising at alarming rates. Whether I am talking to a self-\nemployed fisherman or the owner of a struggling small business or the \nhuman resources manager of a large corporation, the cost of health \ninsurance is a common concern.\n  In 1999, the average family premium for employer-based coverage in \nMaine was more than $6,000, the 14th highest in the Nation at that \ntime. Since then, Maine employers have faced premium increases of as \nmuch as 40 percent a year. In fact, my own brother called me recently \nto tell me that his small business is faced with a 40-percent increase \nin health insurance premiums on top of a 30-percent increase the year \nbefore.\n  These premium increases are particularly burdensome for smaller \nbusinesses, the backbone of Maine's economy. Many small business owners \nare caught in a real squeeze. They know if they pass on the premium \nincrease to their employees, then more and more employees will be \nforced to decline coverage and, thus, will be completely uninsured, and \nyet these small employers simply cannot continue to absorb premium \nincreases of 20 to 30 to 40 percent year after year.\n  The problem of rising costs is even more acute for individuals and \nfamilies who must purchase health insurance on their own. Anthem Blue \nCross/Blue Shield, the single remaining carrier in Maine's nongroup \nmarket, has increased its rates by 40 percent over the past 2 years. \nMonthly insurance premiums often exceed the family's monthly mortgage \npayments. It is no wonder that more than 150,000 Mainers are now \nuninsured. Clearly, we simply must do more to make health insurance \nmore affordable and more available.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act, which Senator Landrieu and \nI are introducing today, is a 7-point plan that combines a variety of \npublic and private approaches to make quality health care coverage more \naffordable.\n  The legislation's seven goals are: One, to expand access to \naffordable health care for small businesses; two, to make health \ninsurance more affordable for individuals and families purchasing \ncoverage on their own; three, to strengthen the health care safety net \nfor those who lack coverage; four, to expand access to care in rural \nand underserved areas; five, to increase access to affordable long-term \ncare; six, to promote healthier lifestyles, and seven, to provide more \nequitable Medicare payments to Maine providers to reduce the Medicare \nshortfall.\n  This shortfall, this lack of fair reimbursement for Medicare \nservices, has forced hospitals, physicians, and other providers to \nshift costs on to other payers in the form of higher charges. That \ndrives up the cost of health insurance, and it is one of the reasons \nthat Maine's rates are higher than the insurance rates in most other \nStates.\n  I will discuss each of these seven points in more detail. First, \nexpanding access for small businesses, this legislation builds upon a \nbill I introduced with Senator Landrieu last year to help small \nemployers cope with rising health care costs. Since most Americans get \ntheir health insurance through their employers, it is a common \nassumption that people without health insurance are unemployed, but \nthat is not accurate. The fact is most uninsured Americans are members \nof families with at least one full-time worker.\n  As many as 82 percent of Americans without health insurance are in a \nfamily with a full-time worker. Uninsured working Americans are most \noften the employees of small businesses. In fact, some 60 percent of \nuninsured workers are employed by small firms. Smaller firms generally \nface higher costs for health insurance than larger companies, which \nmakes them less likely to offer coverage.\n  I know from my conversations with small businesses all over Maine \nthat they want to offer health insurance as a benefit for their \nemployees. They know it would help them to attract and retain good \nworkers. The only reason these small businesses are not offering health \ninsurance is a simple one: They simply cannot afford the premium costs.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will help small businesses \ncope with rising costs by providing new tax credits for them to make \nhealth insurance more affordable. It will encourage those small \nbusinesses who are now offering health insurance to continue to do so \nin the face of escalating premiums. It will encourage them to make the \ndecision not to drop coverage, and it will prompt small employers who \nwant to provide this coverage but have found it financially out of \nreach, to now offer this important benefit.\n  The legislation will also help to increase the clout of small \nbusinesses in negotiating with insurers. Premiums are generally higher \nfor smaller businesses because they do not have as much purchasing \npower as large companies. This limits their ability to bargain for \nlower rates. They also tend to have higher administrative costs than \nlarger companies because they have fewer employees among whom to spread \nthe fixed costs of a health insurance plan.\n  Moreover, they are not able to spread the risks of medical claims \nover as many employees as large firms. The legislation we are \nintroducing will help address these problems by authorizing Federal \ngrants to provide start-up funding to States to assist them with the \nplanning, development, and operation of small employer purchasing \ncooperatives.\n\n  I am not talking about association health plans, which are \ncontroversial for a number of reasons. I am talking about small \nemployer purchasing cooperatives. They will help to reduce the costs of \nhealth insurance for small employers by allowing them to band together \nto purchase insurance jointly.\n  Group purchasing cooperatives have a number of advantages for smaller \nemployers. They will, for example, bring an increased number of \nparticipants into the group and that helps to lower the premium costs. \nThey also decrease the risk of adverse selection. Our legislation would \nalso authorize a Small Business Administration grant program for \nStates, local governments, and nonprofits to provide information about \nthe benefits of health insurance to smaller employers, including the \ntax benefits, the increased productivity of employees and decreased \nturnover. Grants would be used to make employers aware of their current \nrights under State and Federal laws.\n  For example, one survey showed that 57 percent of small employers did \nnot realize they could deduct 100 percent of the costs of their health \ninsurance premiums as a business expense.\n  The legislation that Senator Landrieu and I are introducing would \nalso create a new program to encourage innovation by awarding \ndemonstration grants in up to 10 States to look at innovative coverage \nexpansion such as alternative group purchasing or pooling arrangements, \nindividual or small group market reforms, or subsidies to employers or \nindividuals purchasing coverage.\n  The States have been the laboratories of reform. For example, some \nStates have looked at providing assistance to employees to help them \nafford their share of an employer-provided insurance plan.\n  Second, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act will help expand \naccess to affordable health care for individuals and families who are \npurchasing coverage on their own. It would, for example, allow self-\nemployed Americans to deduct the full amount of their health care \npremiums retroactive to January 1 of this year.\n  Some 25 million Americans are in families headed by a self-employed \nindividual, and of these 5 million are uninsured. So if we establish \nparity in the tax treatment for health insured costs between the self-\nemployed and those working for large corporations, we will promote \nequity, and we will help to reduce the number of uninsured by working \nAmericans.\n  Another step this bill would take would build on the success of the \nState children's health insurance program,\n\n[[Page S2264]]\n\none of the very first bills I sponsored as a Senator. This program \nprovides insurance for children of low-income families who cannot \nafford health insurance and yet earn too much money to qualify for \nMedicaid.\n  We are proposing that we allow, as Senator Kennedy's family care bill \nwould, the option for States to cover the parents of children who are \nenrolled in programs like Maine's MaineCare program. States could also \nuse funds provided through this program to help eligible working \nfamilies pay their share of an employer-based health insurance plan. In \nshort, this legislation will help ensure low-income working families \nreceive the health care they need.\n  Another provision of the bill would allow States to expand coverage \nto eligible legal immigrants through the Medicaid and SCHIP programs. \nMaine is one of a number of States that is already covering eligible \nlegal immigrants, pregnant women, and children under Medicaid using 100 \npercent State dollars. Giving States the option of covering these \nchildren and families under Medicaid will enable them to receive \nFederal matching funds.\n\n  Another provision of the bill would give States the option of \nextending Medicaid to childless adults below 125 percent of the Federal \npoverty level who cannot afford private insurance and who have been \nforgotten or overlooked by other public programs. Maine has applied for \na waiver to expand its Medicaid Program in this way, and the State \nestimates this will provide health coverage to an estimated 16,000 low-\nincome uninsured Mainers.\n  Many people with serious health problems encounter difficulties in \nfinding a company that is willing to insure them. To address this \nproblem, the Collins-Landrieu bill authorizes Federal grants to provide \nmoney for States to create high-risk pools through which individuals \nwho have preexisting health conditions can obtain affordable health \ninsurance.\n  Finally, the legislation in this section would provide an \nadvanceable, refundable tax credit of up to $1,000 for individuals \nearning up to $30,000, and up to $3,000 for families earning up to \n$60,000.\n  This provision, which is similar to that proposed by President Bush, \nwould help to provide coverage for up to 6 million Americans who \notherwise would be uninsured for 1 or more months. It will help many \nmore working lower income families who currently purchase private \nhealth insurance with little or no government help and finding it \nincreasingly difficult to do so.\n  Third, the Access to Affordable Health Insurance Act will help to \nstrengthen our Nation's health care safety net by doubling funding over \nthe next 5 years for community health centers. We want to make sure we \nare reaching individuals who are homeless, individuals who are migrant \nworkers, individuals who are living in public housing. These centers, \nwhich operate in underserved rural and urban communities, provide \ncritical primary care services to millions of Americans, regardless of \ntheir ability to pay. About 20 percent of the patients treated at \nMaine's community health centers have no insurance coverage. Many more \nhave inadequate coverage. These community health centers play a \ncritical role in providing a health care safety net for some of our \nmost vulnerable individuals.\n  The problem of access to affordable health care services is not \nlimited to the uninsured. It is also shared by many Americans living in \nrural and underserved areas where there is a serious shortage of health \ncare providers. The legislation we are introducing, therefore, includes \na number of provisions to strengthen the National Health Service Corps, \nwhich supports doctors, dentists, and other clinicians who serve in \nrural and inner-city areas.\n  For example, taxing students adversely affects their financial \nincentive to participate in the National Health Service Corps and \nprovide health care services in underserved communities. Last year's \ntax bill provided a tax deduction for National Health Service Corps \nscholarship recipients to deduct all tuition, fees, and related \neducational expenses from their income taxes. The deduction did not \nextend to loan repayment recipients however, so loan repayment amounts \nare still taxed as income. Participants in the loan repayment program \nare actually given extra payment amounts to help them cover their tax \nlability which, frankly, is a little ridiculous. It makes much more \nsense to simply exempt them from taxation in the first place.\n  In addition, the legislation will allow National Health Service Corps \nparticipants to fulfill their commitment on a part-time basis. Current \nlaw requires all National Health Service Corps participants to serve \nfull time. Many rural communities, however, simply do not have enough \nvolume to support a full-time health care practitioner. Moreover, some \nsites may not need a particular type of provider--for example, a \ndentist--on a full-time basis. Some practitioners may also find part-\ntime service more attractive, which, in turn, could improve recruitment \nand retention. Our bill will therefore give the program additional \nflexibility to meet community needs.\n  Long-term care is the major catastrophic health care expense faced by \nolder American today, and these costs will only increase with the aging \nof the baby boomers. Most Americans mistakenly believe that Medicare or \ntheir private health insurance policies will cover the costs of long-\nterm care should they develop a chronic illness or cognitive impairment \nlike Alzheimer's Disease. Unfortunately, far too many do not discover \nthat they do not have coverage until they are confronted with the \ndifficult decision of placing a much-loved parent or spouse in long-\nterm care and facing the shocking realization that they will have to \ncover the costs themselves.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act will provide a tax credit \nfor long-term care expenses of up to $3,000 to provide some help to \nthose families struggling to provide long-term care to a loved one. It \nwill also encourage more Americans to plan for their future long-term \ncare needs by providing a tax deduction to help them purchase private \nlong-term insurance.\n  Health insurance alone is not going to ensure good health. As noted \nauthor and physician Dr. Michael Crichton has observed, ``the future of \nmedicine lies not in treating illness, but preventing it.'' Many of our \nmost serious health problems are directly related to unhealthy \nbehaviors-- smoking, lack of regular exercise, and poor diet. These \nthree major risk factors alone have made Maine the State with the \nfourth highest death rate due to four largely preventable disease: \nCardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic lung disease and diabetes. \nThese four chronic diseases are reponsible for 70 percent of the health \ncare problems in Maine.\n  Our bill therefore contains a number of provisions designed to \npromoted healthy lifestyles. An ever-expanding body of evidence shows \nthat these kinds of investment in health promotiong and prevention \noffer returns not only in reduced health care bill, but in longer life \nand increased productivity. The legislation will provide grants to \nStates to assist small businesses wishing to establish ``worksite \nwellness'' programs for their employees. It would also authorize a \ngrant program to support new and existing ``community partnerships,'' \nsuch as the Healthy Community Coalition in Franklin County, to promote \nhealthy lifestyles among hospitals, employers, schools and community \norganizations. And, it would provide funds for States to establish or \nexpand comprehensive school health education, including, for example, \nphysical education programs that promote lifelong physical activity, \nhealthy food service selections, and programs that promote a healthy \nand safe school environment.\n\n  And finally, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act would promote \nequity in Medicare payments and help to ensure that the Medicare system \nrewards rather than punishes States like Maine that deliver high-\nquality, cost effective Medicare services to our elderly and disabled \ncitizens.\n  According to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation, Maine ranks third in the nation when it comes to the \nquality of care delivered to our Medicare beneficiaries. Yet we are \n11th from the bottom when it comes to per-beneficiary Medicare \nspending.\n  The fact is that Maine's Medicare dollars are being used to subsidize \nhigher reimbursements in other parts of the country. This simply is not \nfair.\n\n[[Page S2265]]\n\nMedicare's reimbursement systems have historically tended to favor \nurban areas and failed to take the special needs of rural States into \naccount. Ironically, Maine's low payment rates are also the result of \nits long history of providing high-quality, cost-effective care. In the \nearly 1980s, Maine's lower than average costs were used to justify \nlower payment rates. Since then, Medicare's payment policies have only \nserved to widen the gap between low and high-cost States.\n  As a consequence, Maine's hospitals, physicians, and other providers \nhave experienced a serious Medicare shortfall, which has forced them to \nshift costs on to other payers in the form of higher charges. The \nMedicare shortfall is one of the reasons that Maine has among the \nhighest health insurance premiums in the Nation. The provisions in the \nAccess to Affordable Health Care Act provide a complement to \nlegislation that I introduced earlier this year with Senator Russ \nFeingold to promote greater fairness in Medicare payments to physicians \nand other health professionals by eliminating outdated geographic \nadjustment factors that discriminate against rural areas.\n  Mr. President, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act outlines a \nblueprint for reform based upon principles upon which I believe a \nbipartisan majority in Congress could agree. The plan takes significant \nstrides toward the goal of universal health care coverage by bringing \nmillion more Americans into the insurance system, by strengthening the \nhealth care safety net, and by addressing the inequities in the \nMedicare system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2043. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend by \nfive years the period for the provision by the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs of noninstitutional extended care services and required nursing \nhome care, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to \nimprove VA's response to meeting the long-term care needs of an aging \nveteran population. Specifically, the bill would extend two long-term \ncare authorities of the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits \nAct of 1999.\n  In November of 1999, Congress passed comprehensive long-term care \nlegislation for veterans. For the first time, VA was required to \nprovide extended care services to enrolled veterans. Section 101 of \nPublic Law 106-117, directed the VA to provide nursing home care to any \nveteran who is in need of such care for a service-connected condition, \nor who is 70 percent or more service-connected disabled. In addition, \nVA was to have provided non-institutional care, such as home-based \ncare, respite, and adult day health care, to all enrolled veterans. \nWithin 3 years of the bill's enactment, VA was to evaluate and report \nto the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs on its \nexperience in providing services under both of these provisions and to \nmake recommendations on extending or making permanent these provisions. \nThese programs were given an expiration date of 4 years so that we \ncould adequately study its effects and, if need be, make appropriate \nadjustments.\n  Unfortunately, it's been more than two years and very little has \nhappened with these long-term care programs. With both provisions due \nto expire next year, there is hardly enough time to sufficiently study \nthem. The legislation I introduce today will extend the expiration \ndates of both long-term care authorities for an additional 5 years, \nuntil December 31, 2008.\n  I am extremely disappointed that the VA has taken so long to bring \nthese new extended care authorities into the lives of veterans. \nAlthough there is a sense of urgency about meeting the long-term care \nneeds of veterans, the VA seems frozen to respond.\n  In addition to mandating that VA provide nursing home care to any \nveteran who is in need of such care for a service-connected condition, \nor who is 70 percent or more service-connected disabled, the Veterans \nMillennium Health Care and Benefits Act required the VA to maintain the \nstaffing and level of extended care during any fiscal year at the same \nlevel that was provided in fiscal year 1998. Unfortunately, both the \nstaffing level for nursing home care and the average daily census has \ndropped since 1998, and VA readily admits that they are not in \ncompliance with this mandate, citing a lack of resources.\n  In addition to providing nursing home care, a key element of the \nMillennium bill required VA to furnish non-institutional long-term care \nas part of the standard benefits package. While the bill was signed \ninto law at the end of 1999, it was just last October that VA finally \nissued interim guidance on the new benefit. The policy was essentially \nmeaningless, in that it required facilities to either have these non-\ninstitutional long-term care services available or to develop a plan \nfor providing such services. As a result, I suspect that many \nfacilities have not yet made non-institutional services universally \navailable. In order to confirm this, I have asked that the General \nAccounting Office provide me with information as to what inventory of \nnoninstitutional long-term care programs exists within VA. The GAO's \nreport should be completed shortly.\n  We know that there is an expanding need for long-term care in our \ncountry, and in the VA that demand is even more pressing. About 37 \npercent of the veteran population is 65 years or older, and that number \nwill grow dramatically in the next few years. By extending the existing \nlong-term care authorities, we signal to VA that they cannot shirk this \nresponsibility.\n  There is no doubt that long-term care is expensive. It is our \nresponsibility, however, to make sure that the necessary resources are \nprovided to VA to implement existing long-term care programs. For my \npart, I will continue to push VA to move forward, and in the near \nfuture, I will be chairing a Committee hearing to learn more about VA's \ninaction.\n  Long-term care should be seen as a part of the continuum of quality \nhealth care we have promised our veterans. The point of this \nlegislation is to extend two important VA long-term care authorities, \nand I urge all of my Senate colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2044. A bill to provide for further improvement of the program to \nexpand and improve the provision of specialized mental health services \nto veterans; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday to ensure that veterans who struggle with post-traumatic stress \nand substance use disorders continue to get the care that they need and \ndeserve. This legislation would increase the funding for an already-\nestablished grant program for specialized mental health services \nprograms. In addition, the legislation would guarantee that some \nfunding would go to those facilities which need it the most but, for \nwhatever reason, have not sought grants.\n  From its inception, the VA health care system has been challenged to \nmeet the special needs of veterans, such as spinal cord injuries, the \nneed for prosthetics, blindness, traumatic brain injury, homelessness, \npost-traumatic stress disorders or PTSD, and the substance abuse \ndisorders that frequently accompany these other afflictions. Over the \nyears, VA has developed widely commended expertise in providing \nspecialized services to meet these needs. We can all be rightfully \nproud of VA's specialized programs, which provide care that is often \nunparalleled in the greater health care community.\n  Unfortunately, these programs have been endangered by budget \nconstraints, a shift in focus from inpatient care to outpatient \nclinics, and the introduction of a new resource allocation system. In \n1996, Congress recognized that VA's constant battle to serve more \nveterans with a limited budget made these relatively costly specialized \nservices programs disproportionately vulnerable to reductions, and took \nsteps to protect them. The Veteran's Health Care Eligibility Reform Act \nof 1966 required the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to maintain VA's \ncapacity to treat specific special needs of disabled veterans at the \nthen-current level, and to report to Congress annually on the \nmaintenance of these specialized services.\n  Subsequently, internal VA advisory committees, the GAO, and my own \nstaff on the Committee on Veterans'\n\n[[Page S2266]]\n\nAffairs reported that these protections did not go far enough. Many \nspecialized programs--particularly substance abuse and PTSD treatment \nprograms, were closed, reduced in size, or understaffed, offering \nlittle or no care to veterans suffering from these seriously \ndebilitating disorders which often result from combat experiences.\n  VA's own annual capacity reports give evidence that these programs \nhave failed to provide services to veterans at the needed levels, or to \npreserve equal access throughout the system. However, the current law's \nreliance on systemwide, rather than local or regional capacity, and \nVA's failure to issue these reports on a timely basis as mandated, \nprevent us from understanding how well these programs meet veterans' \nneeds throughout the Nation.\n  In December 2001, Congress strengthened protection of specialized \nservices through the VA Health Care Programs Enhancement Act, which \ndescribed how VA is to maintain capacity for these services in \nconsiderably more detail. However, I believe that we must continue to \ndo what we can to foster innovation and to patch some of the holes in \nsubstance abuse and PTSD programs.\n  In addition to protecting VA's capacity to treat veterans' special \nneeds, Congress also designated $15 million in VA funding specifically \nto help medical families improve care for veterans with substance abuse \ndisorders and PTSD. The funds for these mental health grant programs, \nmandated by the Veterans Millennium Benefits and Health Care Act of \n1999, will soon revert to a general fund.\n  In order to distribute these funds, VA sought proposals from \nfacilities interested in expanding and improving their substance use \ndisorder and PTSD programs. VA began to release these funds a little \nmore than a year ago. As of this month, only 8 of the 16 PTSD treatment \nprograms awarded funding had become operational, and only a third of \nthese have hired their full complement of authorized and funded staff. \nOf the substance abuse disorder programs funded through this act, 18 of \n31 have not yet hired complete staffs.\n  Despite the slow start, this funding has already increased the PTSD \nand substance abuse disorder treatment programs available to veterans. \nMore than 100 staff have been hired in 18 of VA's 21 service networks \nto treat substance abuse disorders. Nine new programs, in Baltimore, \nMD; Atlanta, GA; San Francisco, CA; and Dayton, OH, among others, have \ninitiated or intensified opioid substitution programs for veterans who \nhave not responded well to drug-free treatment regimens. Other new \nprograms, such as those in Tampa, FL; Cincinnati, OH, Columbia, MO; and \nLoma Linda, CA, put special emphasis on treating veterans with more \ncomplex conditions that include PTSD and substance abuse. The \nadditional funding has enabled VA to develop better outpatient \nsubstance abuse and PTSD treatment programs, outpatient dual-diagnosis \nprograms, more PTSD community clinical teams, and more residential \nsubstance abuse disorder rehabilitation programs.\n  Due to these grants, VA has made improvements; however, many VA \nmedical center directors have been reluctant to hire specialized \nsubstance abuse or PTSD treatment staff when, in FY 2003, the funding \nfor these programs will be subject to a population-based allocation \nsystem and may disappear from their budgets. The legislation that I \nintroduce today would ensure that this funding remained ``protected'' \nfor three more years, and would increase the total amount of funding \nidentified specifically for treatment of substance abuse disorders and \nPTSD from $15 million to $25 million.\n  Of the $25 million authorized for this program, $15 million would be \nallocated to individual medical facilities which respond to the call \nfor proposals. The remaining $10 million would be provided as direct \ngrants to VA treatment facilities throughout the Nation, based on \nveterans' needs as identified by VA's Mental Health Strategic Health \nCare Group and the Committee on Care of the Severely Chronically \nMentally Ill.\n  Although I am disappointed that VA has still been unable to properly \nmaintain adequate levels of care for those veterans with specialized \nhealth care needs, I am encouraged that our actions to fund specific \nPTSD and substance abuse programs have provided a strong start.\n  Congress has spoken quite clearly in the past: VA does not have the \ndiscretion to decide whether or not to provide adequate care for \nveterans with substance abuse and post traumatic stress disorders. I \nask that my colleagues support this bill, which would help ensure that \nthese specialized services, a critical aspect of the health care VA \nprovides to veterans, are maintained at the necessary levels for the \nmen and women who have served this Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 2045. A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to take \nsteps to control the growing international problem of tuberculosis; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, Senator Smith and I are proud to \nintroduce the International Tuberculosis Control Act of 2002. This bill \nwill provide $200 million during each of the next three years for U.S. \nefforts to combat international TB.\n  Our bill also sets as a goal the detection of at least 70 percent of \nthe cases of infectious tuberculosis, and the cure of at least 85 \npercent of the cases detected by the end of 2005 for those countries \nwith the highest tuberculosis burden.\n  Why is this bill important? Consider the facts: Tuberculosis kills 2 \nmillion people each year; someone in the world is newly infected with \nTB every second; nearly one percent of the world's population is newly \ninfected with TB each year; TB is the single leading cause of death \namong women between the age of 15-44; and half of all people living \nwith HIV-AIDS will develop TB because of suppressed immune systems.\n  TB is an airborne disease. You can get it when someone coughs or \nsneezes. And with the increased immigration and travel to the United \nStates, we are seeing it re-emerge in many of our communities. That is \nwhy it is in the national interest here in the United States to fight \nTB throughout the world.\n  This is especially true when you consider that in the year 2000, 46 \npercent of TB cases detected in the U.S. occurred to foreign-born \npersons, up from 22 percent in 1986. In California, of the 3,297 cases \ndetected in 2000, 72 percent were among foreign born individuals.\n  Two years ago, Senator Smith and I teamed up to triple TB funding and \nget the authorization level up to $60 million. We are teaming up again \nso that USAID can work with its international partners like the World \nHealth Organization to expand the most effective program to stop the \nspread of TB--DOTS or Directly Observed Treatment Short-Course.\n  DOTS is so effective because it reduces the chance of Multi-Drug \nResident TB from developing. In the early 1990s, New York City spent \nnearly $1 billion to control an outbreak of drug-resistant TB. However, \na 6-month course of TB drugs under the DOTS programs can cost just $10.\n  That is why we feel that our bill is a wise investment that will \nreduce the cost of treating TB over the long run and, most important, \nsave lives throughout the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2045\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``International Tuberculosis \n     Control Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that:\n       (1) Tuberculosis is a great health and economic burden to \n     impoverished nations and a health and security threat to the \n     United States and other industrialized countries.\n       (2) Tuberculosis kills 2,000,000 people each year (a person \n     every 15 seconds) and is second only to HIV/AIDS as the \n     greatest infectious killer of adults worldwide.\n       (3) Tuberculosis is today the leading killer of women of \n     reproductive age and of people who are HIV-positive.\n       (4) One-third of the world's population is currently \n     infected with the tuberculosis bacterium, including \n     10,000,000 through 15,000,000 persons in the United States, \n     and someone in the world is newly infected with tuberculosis \n     every second.\n\n[[Page S2267]]\n\n       (5) With 46 percent of tuberculosis cases in the United \n     States in the year 2000 found in foreign-born persons, as \n     compared to 24 percent in 1990, it is clear that the only way \n     to control tuberculosis in the United States is to control it \n     worldwide.\n       (6) Left untreated, a person with active tuberculosis can \n     infect an average of 10 through 15 people in one year.\n       (7) Pakistan and Afghanistan are among the 22 countries \n     identified by the World Health Organization as having the \n     highest tuberculosis burden globally.\n       (8) More than one-quarter of all adult deaths in Pakistan \n     are due to tuberculosis, and Afghan refugees entering \n     Pakistan have very high rates of tuberculosis, with refugee \n     camps, in particular, being areas where tuberculosis runs \n     rampant.\n       (9) The tuberculosis and AIDS epidemics are inextricably \n     linked. Tuberculosis is the first manifestation of AIDS in \n     more than 50 percent of cases in developing countries and is \n     responsible for 40 percent or more of deaths of people with \n     AIDS worldwide.\n       (10) An effective, low-cost cure exists for tuberculosis: \n     Directly Observed Treatment Short-course or DOTS. Expansion \n     of DOTS is an urgent global priority.\n       (11) DOTS is one of the most cost-effective health \n     interventions available today. A full course of DOTS drugs \n     costs as little as US$10 in low-income countries.\n       (12) Proper DOTS treatment is imperative to prevent the \n     development of dangerous multidrug resistant tuberculosis \n     (MDR-TB) that arises through improper or incomplete \n     tuberculosis treatment.\n       (13) The Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and \n     Malaria is an important new global partnership established to \n     combat these 3 infectious diseases that together kill \n     6,000,000 people a year. Expansion of effective tuberculosis \n     treatment programs should constitute a major component of \n     Global Fund investment.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) DOTS.--The term ``DOTS'' or ``Directly Observed \n     Treatment Short-course'' means the World Health Organization-\n     recommended strategy for treating standard tuberculosis.\n       (2) Global alliance for tuberculosis drug development.--The \n     term ``Global Alliance for Tuberculosis Drug Development'' \n     means the public-private partnership that brings together \n     leaders in health, science, philanthropy, and private \n     industry to devise new approaches to tuberculosis and to \n     ensure that new medications are available and affordable in \n     high tuberculosis burden countries and other affected \n     countries.\n       (3) Global plan to stop tuberculosis.--The term ``Global \n     Plan to Stop Tuberculosis'' means the plan developed jointly \n     by the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership Secretariat and Partners \n     in Health that lays out what needs to be done to control and \n     eliminate tuberculosis.\n       (4) Global tuberculosis drug facility.--The term ``Global \n     Tuberculosis Drug Facility (GDF)'' means the new initiative \n     of the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership to increase access to \n     high-quality tuberculosis drugs to facilitate DOTS expansion.\n       (5) Stop tuberculosis partnership.--The term ``Stop \n     Tuberculosis Partnership'' means the partnership of the World \n     Health Organization, donors including the United States, high \n     tuberculosis burden countries, multilateral agencies, and \n     nongovernmental and technical agencies committed to short- \n     and long-term measures required to control and eventually \n     eliminate tuberculosis as a public health problem in the \n     world.\n\n      SEC. 4. ASSISTANCE FOR TUBERCULOSIS PREVENTION, TREATMENT, \n                   CONTROL, AND ELIMINATION.\n\n       Section 104(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2151b(c)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(7)(A) Congress recognizes the growing international \n     problem of tuberculosis and the impact its continued \n     existence has on those countries that had previously largely \n     controlled the disease. Congress further recognizes that the \n     means exist to control and treat tuberculosis by implementing \n     the Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis and by adequately \n     investing in newly created mechanisms, including the Global \n     Tuberculosis Drug Facility, and that it is therefore a major \n     objective of the foreign assistance program to control the \n     disease. To this end, Congress expects the agency primarily \n     responsible for administering this part--\n       ``(i) to coordinate with the World Health Organization, the \n     Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of \n     Health, and other organizations with respect to the \n     development and implementation of a comprehensive \n     tuberculosis control program; and\n       ``(ii) to set as a goal the detection of at least 70 \n     percent of the cases of infectious tuberculosis, and the cure \n     of at least 85 percent of the cases detected, by December 31, \n     2005, in those countries classified by the World Health \n     Organization as among the highest tuberculosis burden, and by \n     December 31, 2010, in all countries in which the agency has \n     established development programs.\n       ``(B)(i) There is authorized to be appropriated \n     $200,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2003 through 2005 \n     for carrying out this paragraph.\n       ``(ii) Funds appropriated under this paragraph are \n     authorized to remain available until expended.\n       ``(C) In carrying out subparagraph (A), not less than 75 \n     percent of the amount authorized to be appropriated under \n     subparagraph (B) shall be expended for antituberculosis \n     drugs, supplies, patient services, and training in diagnosis \n     and care, in order to increase directly observed treatment \n     shortcourse (DOTS) coverage, including funding for the Global \n     Tuberculosis Drug Facility.\n       ``(D) In carrying out subparagraph (A), of the amount \n     authorized to be appropriated under subparagraph (B)--\n       ``(i) not less than 10 percent shall be used for funding of \n     the Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility;\n       ``(ii) not less than 7.5 percent shall be used for funding \n     of the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership; and\n       ``(iii) not less than 2.5 percent shall be used for funding \n     of the Global Alliance for Tuberculosis Drug Development.\n       ``(E) The President shall submit a report to Congress \n     annually specifying the increases in the number of people \n     treated and the increases in number of tuberculosis patients \n     cured through each program, project, or activity receiving \n     United States foreign assistance for tuberculosis control \n     purposes.''.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am pleased to again join my \ncolleague Senator Boxer in introducing important tuberculosis control \nlegislation today on the floor of the Senate. Today we are introducing \nThe International Tuberculosis Control Act--this important legislation \nis designed to address the growing international problem of \ntuberculosis, (TB). We are introducing this legislation to coincide \nwith World Tuberculosis Day, this Sunday, March 24. World TB Day is an \noccasion for countries around the world to raise awareness about the \nthreat to the world's health caused by tuberculosis.\n  As many of us know TB is a global health crisis. Over two million \npeople will die from TB this year, and it is the leading killer of \nyoung women and of people with AIDS worldwide. Further, TB anywhere is \na threat everywhere in our highly mobile world. The Center for Disease \nControl CDC reports that in the year 2000, nearly 50 percent of all TB \ncases in the US occurred in foreign-born persons. We will not be safe \nfrom TB until we control the disease globally.\n  TB and HIV form a deadly co-epidemic. TB is responsible for more than \n40 percent of all AIDS deaths worldwide. An HIV-positive person is 30 \ntimes more likely to develop active tuberculosis and become infectious \nto others. Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa have seen TB rates \nincrease 4-fold due to the HIV-TB co-epidemic, decimating a whole \ngeneration of adults in many communities. In Eastern Europe and Asia, \nTB infection is widespread and HIV rates are rising rapidly. These \nareas are poised to see the TB-HIV co-epidemic explode.\n  TB also flourishes in and causes poverty. About 98 percent of the \nannual deaths from TB are in poor countries. Those who fall ill are \noften their family's primary breadwinner. When that person cannot work, \nchildren must often leave school to work or care for a sick relative. \nThe World Health Organization reported in 2000 that 75 percent of TB \npatients are men and women between the ages of 15-54, the most \neconomically productive years of life. Stopping TB will help fight \npoverty.\n  I strongly believe we must act to control TB now or pay later. Rising \ndrug resistance is a time bomb that could make TB virtually \nuncontrollable. Multi-drug resistant TB is far more dangerous and \ndifficult to treat, can cost up to $1 million per patient to cure, and \nkills over half of its victims, even in the U.S.\n  There is a plan for controlling TB. The new, internationally agreed-\nupon ``Global Plan to Stop TB'' provides a much-needed roadmap. It \ndescribes the resources needed, country-by-country, to meet \ninternational TB control targets by 2005. Complementary National TB \ncontrol plans exist for nearly all of the 22 high-burden TB countries.\n  The world must invest less than $1 billion in additional funds per \nyear to control TB, about what New York City spent to control an \noutbreak of drug-resistant TB in the early 1990s! And I believe that \n$200 million is a reasonable US share of the $1 billion needed globally \nto control this killer.\n  We have the tools to stop TB. ``The Global Plan to Stop TB'' is built \naround expanding access to DOTS treatment worldwide, a proven, and very \ncost-effective treatment system that uses just $10 worth of drugs to \ncure a patient in 6 months. Currently\n\n[[Page S2268]]\n\njust one in four of those who needs DOTS have access to it. Another \ntool for fighting TB is the new Global TB Drug Facility, which can \nprovide the steady supply of affordable drugs needed to cure patients \nand prevent the further spread of drug-resistance.\n  My colleague, Barbara Boxer, and I have been leading the way (along \nwith Foreign Operations Chairman Patrick Leahy and Ranking Senator \nMitch McConnell) in increasing US funding for international TB control, \nfrom virtually zero in 1997 to $75 million in 2002. The President's \n2003 Budget proposes to cut TB funding by one-third, but I feel that we \nmust do more in this area, not less. Just $200 million annually from \nthe U.S. would save tens of thousands of lives around the world and \nwould protect US citizens from TB and from the growing threat of drug-\nresistant TB. Investing in TB control is not only the right thing to \ndo; it is a wise U.S. investment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 2046. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize \nloan guarantees for rural health facilities to buy new and repair \nexisting infrastructure and technology; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Health \nCare Facility Improvement Act.\n  Traveling throughout my State of Idaho, I have heard from many people \nabout the need for additional funding to keep rural health facilities \noperational and up-to-date. After doing further research, I have found \nthat this is true in all States in virtually all rural areas. For this \nreason, I am introducing the Rural Health Care facility Improvement \nAct.\n  This bill would allow for $250,000,000 million in guaranteed loans to \nbe available to rural health care facilities. Individual facilities \ncould borrow up to $5,000,000 to be used for two purposes. First, to \nallow for capital improvements to their facility and equipment and \nsecond, to allow for the purchase of high-technology equipment.\n  Providing health care services to much of rural America has become \nincreasingly difficult in recent years. During the 1970s, rural \ncommunities thrived with economic expansion and unprecedented \npopulation growth. Rural health providers represented valuable \ninstitutions offering an array of medical services to their \ncommunities. Now many of these rural communities are struggling to \nmaintain critical health care facilities.\n  We all know that rural health care facilities are a vital part of the \ninfrastructure of rural communities and the collapse of health care \nservices in many areas often contributes to the further decline of \nrural communities. That's why it is so important to make sure that \nrural facilities have access to funds to keep them operational.\n  In the 1990's, rural health care providers have begun to rally in the \nface of this challenge. They have developed creative ways to meet the \nneeds of their communities with their limited resources. This \nlegislation is one more way to help those who are working to guarantee \nhealth care in rural America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2046\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to regulate interstate commerce in certain devices by \nproviding for private sector development of technological protection \nmeasures to be implemented and enforced by Federal regulations to \nprotect digital content and promote broadband as well as the transition \nto digital television, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise along with Senators Stevens, \nInouye, Breaux, Nelson, and Feinstein to introduce the Consumer \nBroadband and Digital Television Promotion Act of 2002, legislation \nthat will promote broadband and the digital television transition by \nsecuring content on the Internet and over the Nation's airwaves.\n  For several years the private sector has attempted to secure a safe \nhaven for copyrighted digital products, unfortunately with little to \nshow for its efforts. The result has been an absence of robust, \nubiquitous protections of digital media which has lead to a lack of \ncontent on the Internet and over the airwaves. And who has suffered the \nmost? Consumers, as they are denied access to high quality digital \ncontent in the home.\n  The reality is that a lack of security has enabled significant \ncopyright privacy which drains America's content industries to the tune \nof billions of dollars every year. For example, the movie studios \nestimate that they lose over $3 billion annually by way of analog \npiracy. In order to pirate copyrighted movies via analog formats, an \nindividual makes an illegal copy of the movie, sometimes by taping it \nin a movie theater with a personal video recorder, and then distributes \nit, in analog form, at discount. However, because subsequent copies of \nanalog movies degrade over time, there is a limit to the success of \nthis type of piracy.\n  In a digital age, however, the privacy threat is exponentially \nmagnified. So on the Internet, copyright content, be it a movie, a \nbook, music, or software, travels in a digital language of 1s and 0s, \nand every copy of that content, from the 1st to the 1000th is as \npristine as the original. Also, unlike an analog pirated movie, which \nmust be physically packaged and transported, a digital copy can be sent \naround the world on the Internet with a single click of a mouse. The \ncopyright industries are justifiably worried about distributing their \ncontent on the Internet absent strong copyright protection measures. As \nInternet access becomes increasingly available over high-speed, \nbroadband connections, these worries will only heighten.\n  It should be noted, however, that the Internet is not the only threat \nto unprotected digital content. Digital video programming is also \nsubject to a large privacy threat. Rapid advances in consumer \nelectronics make it easier to steal copyright content. Newly developed \ndigital compression and memory technologies make it possible to store \ntwo complete movies on a device the size of a postage stamp. Today, \ndigital media can be transmitted over wired or wireless channels and \nplayed and stored on a host of consumer electronics devices. By and \nlarge, these are positive developments for consumers.\n  But any device that can legitimately play, copy, or electronically \ntransmit one or more categories of media also can be misused for \nillegal copyright infringement, unless special protection technologies \nare incorporated into such a device. Unfortunately, as technology has \nadvanced, copy protection schemes have not kept pace, fostering a set \nof consumer expectations that at times actually promote illegal \nactivity on the Internet. For example, according to a Jupiter \nMedia Matrix report, over 7 million Americans use technology on the \nInternet to swap music and other digital media files. More recent news \nreports place this number at over 11 million. While some of this \nactivity is legal, much of it is not.\n\n  Every week a major magazine or newspaper reports on the thousands of \nillegal pirated works that are available for copying and redistribution \nonline. Academy award winning motion pictures, platinum records, and \nEmmy award winning television shows--all for free, all illegal. Piracy \nis growing exponentially on college campuses and among tech savvy \nconsumers. Such lawlessness contributes to the studios and record \nlabels' reluctance to place their digital content on the Internet or \nover the airwaves.\n  At the same time, millions of law abiding consumers find little \nreason to spend discretionary dollars on consumer electronics products \nwhose value depends on their ability to receive, display and copy high \nquality digital content like popular movies, music, and video games. \nAccordingly, only early adopters have purchased high definition \ntelevision sets or broadband Internet access, as these products remain \npriced too high for the average consumer. The facts are clear in this \nregard. Only two million Americans have purchased HDTV sets. As for \nbroadband, rural and underserved areas aside, there is not an \navailability problem. There is a demand problem. Roughly 85 percent of \nAmericans are offered broadband in the marketplace but only 10-12 \npercent have signed up. The fact is that most Americans are averse to \npaying $50 a month for faster access to email, or $2,000 for a fancy \nHDTV set that plays analog movies. But if more high-quality content \nwere available, consumers might come.\n  By unleashing an avalanche of digital content on broadband Internet \nconnections as well as over the digital broadcast airwaves, we can \nchange this dynamic and give consumers a reason to buy new consumer \nelectronics and information technology products. To do so requires the \ndevelopment of a secure, protected environment to foster the widespread \ndissemination of digital content in these exciting new mediums.\n  Although, it is technologically feasible to provide such a protected \nenvironment, the solution has not been forthcoming through voluntary \nprivate sector negotiations involving the industries with stakes in \nthis matter. This is not to say, however, that those industries do not \nrecognize the tremendous economic potential to be derived from a \nproliferation of top notch digital content to consumers in the home. \nThe movie studios, and the rest of the copyright industries, for \nexample, are tremendously excited about the possibility of providing \ntheir products to consumers over the Internet and the digital airwaves, \nprovided they can be assured that those products' copyrights are not \ninfringed in the process.\n  Although marketplace negotiations have not provided such an \nassurance, a solution is at hand. Leaders in the consumer electronics, \ninformation technology, and content industries are America's best and \nbrightest. They can solve this problem. The consumer electronics and \nhigh tech industries claim they are ready to do just that. America's \ntop high-tech executives sent me a letter three weeks ago to that \neffect. While, I want to believe them, industry negotiations have been \nlagging. Both sides share some blame in this area. But the blame games \nneed to end. It's time for results, not recriminations.\n\n  I believe the private sector is capable, through marketplace \nnegotiations--of adopting standards that will ensure the secure \ntransmission of copyrighted content on the Internet and over the \nairwaves. But given the pace of private talks so far, the private \nsector needs a nudge. The government can provide that nudge, and in \ndoing so continue the government's longstanding role in promoting, and \nsometimes requiring, the implementation of\n\n[[Page S2270]]\n\ntechnological standards in electronics equipment to benefit consumers. \nWe debated the merits of such an approach in the Commerce Committee on \nFebruary 28, 2002 when the leaders of the copyright, consumer \nelectronics, and information technology industries testified as to \ntheir distinct views on this issue. At that hearing, every Senator and \nevery witness agreed that the problem of digital piracy requires \nresolution.\n  Specifically, our hearing demonstrated that there are three discrete \nproblem areas that merit government intervention. First, is the piracy \nthreat presented toward unprotected digital broadcast television. Over \nthe air broadcast digital signals cannot be encrypted because the \nmillions of Americans who receive their signal via antennas cannot \ndecrypt the signal. As a result, digital broadcast signals are \ndelivered in unprotected format and are subject to illegal copying or \nredistribution over the Internet upon transmission. The technology \nexists today to solve this problem. It has been referred to as a \n``broadcast flag'' which would instruct digital devices to prevent \nillegal copying and Internet retransmission of digital broadcast \ntelevision. Consumer electronic devices would respond to the technology \nand prevent copyright infringement. However, because not every device \nwould be required to respond to the technology, ubiquitous response \nrequires a mandate by government.\n  The second problem is commonly referred to as the ``Analog hole.'' As \nprotected digital programming, usually delivered over satellite or \ncable, but also available on the Internet, is decrypted for viewing by \nconsumers, most frequently on television sets, the programming is \ntemporarily ``in the clear.'' At this point, pirates may have the \nopportunity to take advantage of an ``Analog hole'' by copying the \ncontent into a digital format, i.e. re-digitizing it, and then \nillegally copying and/or retransmitting the content. The technology to \nsolve this problem either exists today, or will be available shortly. \nRegardless, the solution is technologically feasible. As with the \n``broadcast flag'' the solution to the ``Analog hole'' will require a \ngovernment mandate to ensure its ubiquitous adoption across consumer \ndevices.\n  The final problem poses the greatest threat. Literally millions of \ndigital files of music and videos are illegally copied, downloaded, and \ntransmitted over the Internet on a regular basis. Current digital \nrights management solutions are insufficient to rectify this problem. \nSome consumers resorting to illegal behavior do so unknowingly. Many \nothers do so willingly. Regardless, consumers desire high-quality \ndigital content on the Internet and it is not being provided in any \nwidespread, legal fashion. Fortunately, a solution to this problem is \nalso technologically feasible. It too will require government action, \nincluding a mandate to ensure its swift and ubiquitous adoption.\n  While industries are at odds as to how to solve these critical \ncontent protection problems, the legislation we introduce today \nprovides us with the tools to break the logjam. Specifically, the \nlegislation requires the content, consumer electronics, and information \ntechnology industries to come together with representatives of consumer \ngroups to develop standards, technologies, and encoding rules to \nsafeguard digital content so that it will be made more readily \navailable to consumers without being subject to piracy. The affected \nparties would have one year to reach agreement. The technologies would \nthen be incorporated into all digital media devices to ensure universal \nprotection for digital content and universal access to such content for \nconsumers. The deadline on industry would work in the following \nfashion: if they come together to solve these problems in private \nsector talks, we will empower government enforcement so that all \nconsumer devices comply. If they don't, the government, in consultation \nwith the private sector, will have to step in.\n  America's creative artists deserve our protection. Our copyright \nindustries are among our greatest economic and creative assets. The \nframers recognized that innovation and creativity was instrumental to \nour country's economic health when they empowered Congress in the \nConstitution to protect copyrighted products. Now, however, copyrighted \nmedia products are delivered digitally, and copyright infringement is \nmore difficult to detect and prevent. That is why strong technological \nprotections need to be layered on top of the copyright laws, to \ncomplement the law as it exists today. Along those lines, I want to \nemphasize that this legislation does not alter existing copyright law. \nCopyright law rests squarely within the jurisdiction of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. I hope to work closely with Chairman Leahy and \nRanking Member Hatch to stop copyright piracy in a digital age.\n  Some have said that legislation is unwieldy in this area. But our \nlegislation would not be the first time Congress imposed technological \nrequirements to benefit consumers. And it won't be the last. We have \nbeen here before. In 1962, under the All Channel Receiver Act, Congress \nmandated that all television receivers include the capability to tune \nall channels, UHF and VHF, allocated to the television broadcast \nservice. More recently, in 1998, Congress required that all analog VCRs \nrecognize a standard copy control technology, know as ``Macrovision''. \nIn the former case, the Federal Government and the Federal \nCommunications Commission took the lead. In the latter case, industry \nfirst agreed to the `Macrovision' standard which Congress later \ncodified by legislation. So, whether Congress or industry has led the \nway, the results have benefitted consumers and industry, by providing \nAmericans with wider access to programming and content.\n  Pursuant to the bill we introduce today, the standards, technologies, \nand encoding rule would work in the following manner. Digital content \ndelivered over the Internet and over the broadcast airwaves would \ninclude instructions as to consumers' ability to copy available content \nand would prevent the illegal retransmission of that content over the \nInternet. Digital media devices such as televisions sets, cable boxes, \nand personal computers, would be manufactured to recognize and respond \nto those instructions to prevent illegal copying or redistribution.\n  I want to stress, however, in the strongest terms possible, that the \nstandards agreed to by industry would not be permitted to thwart \nlegitimate consumer copying of programming in the home, for time \nshifting purposes, for example. Similarly, the technologies and \nencoding rules would be required to take into account the need to \npreserve fair use of otherwise protected content, for educational and \nresearch purposes for example. Specifically, our bill requires that \nencoding rules ``take into account limitations on exclusive rights of \ncopyright holders, including the fair use doctrine.'' In addition, the \nlegislation specifies that no copy protection technology may prevent \nconsumers from ``making a personal copy for lawful use in the home'' of \nnon pay-per-view television programming. I want to be clear on this \npoint, no legislation can or should pass Congress in this area that \ndoes not seek to protect legitimate consumer copying and fair use \npractices.\n\n  Critics of earlier drafts of our legislation painted it as heavy \nhanded and awkward government selection of technologies. I want to \nrespond. We have listened to their arguments delivered in dozens of \nmeetings with my staff, and the bill we introduce today does nothing of \nthe sort. Under the new legislation, if the required private sector \nnegotiations fail, the FCC will begin a process, in consultation with \nthose same private sector representatives, to implement technologically \nfeasible solutions. So, in practice, the private sector, even in the \nevent of a government initiated approach, will have every incentive and \nopportunity to guide a solution largely on its own.\n  Critics of earlier discussion drafts of our legislation also claimed \nthat it would freeze innovation and that any solutions would invariably \nbe out of date shortly after they are selected due to the rapid and \naccelerated development of technology in the high tech sector. But here \ntoo we have listened and responded. Pursuant to our legislation, if the \nprivate sector determines that the selected technological solution \nneeds to be updated or modified, they may do so. Its as simple as that. \nSuch a change might be warranted because the technologies or encoding \nrules in use have been compromised by hackers or pirates. Or, \ntechnological improvements may be developed that\n\n[[Page S2271]]\n\nensure greater security for content, or more readily take into account \nconsumers or researchers' fair use expectations.\n  Regardless, in any of these instances, at any time, the legislation \nwould allow the representatives of the content, consumer electronics, \nand information technology industries to implement any necessary \nmodification of the agreed upon technologies. They could simply do so \non their own, and then notify the FCC of their actions.\n  At every stage in the process, the private sector, not the \ngovernment, has the opportunity and the incentive to grab the reins. To \ndate, however, this has not happened. The legislation we introduce \ntoday seeks to change that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation, the \nConsumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2048\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The lack of high quality digital content continues to \n     hinder consumer adoption of broadband Internet service and \n     digital television products.\n       (2) Owners of digital programming and content are \n     increasingly reluctant to transmit their products unless \n     digital media devices incorporate technologies that recognize \n     and respond to content security measures designed to prevent \n     theft.\n       (3) Because digital content can be copied quickly, easily, \n     and without degradation, digital programmers and content \n     owners face an exponentially increasing piracy threat in a \n     digital age.\n       (4) Current agreements reached in the marketplace to \n     include security technologies in certain digital media \n     devices fail to provide a secure digital environment because \n     those agreements do not prevent the continued use and \n     manufacture of digital media devices that fail to incorporate \n     such security technologies.\n       (5) Other existing digital rights management schemes \n     represent proprietary, partial solutions that limit, rather \n     than promote, consumers' access to the greatest variety of \n     digital content possible.\n       (6) Technological solutions can be developed to protect \n     digital content on digital broadcast television and over the \n     Internet.\n       (7) Competing business interests have frustrated agreement \n     on the deployment of existing technology in digital media \n     devices to protect digital content on the Internet or on \n     digital broadcast television.\n       (8) The secure protection of digital content is a necessary \n     precondition to the dissemination, and on-line availability, \n     of high quality digital content, which will benefit consumers \n     and lead to the rapid growth of broadband networks.\n       (9) The secure protection of digital content is a necessary \n     precondition to facilitating and hastening the transition to \n     high-definition television, which will benefit consumers.\n       (10) Today, cable and satellite have a competitive \n     advantage over digital television because the closed nature \n     of cable and satellite systems permit encryption, which \n     provides some protection for digital content.\n       (11) Over-the-air broadcasts of digital television are not \n     encrypted for public policy reasons and thus lack those \n     protections afforded to programming delivered via cable or \n     satellite.\n       (12) A solution to this problem is technologically feasible \n     but will require government action, including a mandate to \n     ensure its swift and ubiquitous adoption.\n       (13) Consumers receive content such as video or programming \n     in analog form.\n       (14) When protected digital content is converted to analog \n     for consumers, it is no longer protected and is subject to \n     conversion into unprotected digital form that can in turn be \n     copied or redistributed illegally.\n       (15) A solution to this problem is technologically feasible \n     but will require government action, including a mandate to \n     ensure its swift and ubiquitous adoption.\n       (16) Unprotected digital content on the Internet is subject \n     to significant piracy, through illegal file sharing, \n     downloading, and redistribution over the Internet.\n       (17) Millions of Americans are currently downloading \n     television programs, movies, and music on the Internet and by \n     using ``file-sharing'' technology. Much of this activity is \n     illegal, but demonstrates consumers' desire to access digital \n     content.\n       (18) This piracy poses a substantial economic threat to \n     America's content industries.\n       (19) A solution to this problem is technologically feasible \n     but will require government action, including a mandate to \n     ensure its swift and ubiquitous adoption.\n       (20) Providing a secure, protected environment for digital \n     content should be accompanied by a preservation of legitimate \n     consumer expectations regarding use of digital content in the \n     home.\n       (21) Secure technological protections should enable content \n     owners to disseminate digital content over the Internet \n     without frustrating consumers' legitimate expectations to use \n     that content in a legal manner.\n       (22) Technologies used to protect digital content should \n     facilitate legitimate home use of digital content.\n       (23) Technologies used to protect digital content should \n     facilitate individuals' ability to engage in legitimate use \n     of digital content for educational or research purposes.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \nnominally foreign corporations created through inversion transactions \nas domestic corporations; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nwould bar multinational corporations from avoiding millions of dollars \nin taxes through the use of shell corporations in foreign tax havens.\n  On February 18 the New York Times in an article entitled ``U.S. \nCorporations Are Using Bermuda to Slash Tax Bills,'' reported that a \nnumber of prominent U.S. corporations, using creative paperwork, have \ntransformed themselves into Bermuda corporations purely to avoid paying \ntheir share of U.S. taxes. These new Bermuda entities are shell \ncorporations. They have no staff, no offices and no real business \nactivity in Bermuda. They exist for the purpose of shielding income \nfrom the IRS.\n  How does the ``Bermuda Triangle'' tax loophole work? U.S. companies, \nreferred to as ``domestic corporations,'' pay U.S. taxes on their \nworldwide income, whether that income is earned in the United States or \nabroad. Foreign corporations pay U.S. taxes only on income earned in \nthe United States.\n  Through the use of a process called corporate inversion, a domestic \ncompany can be ``acquired'' by a shell corporation chartered in a \nforeign county with low or no corporate taxes, Bermuda for example. \nUnder such an arrangement, the shareholders of the new foreign parent \nare the same as the shareholders of the old U.S. company. This maneuver \nrequires little more than filing of the proper paperwork in the new \n``home'' country and payment of a registration fee. The new foreign \nparent corporation need not have any offices or any staff, and they \nusually don't.\n  United States tax law contains many provisions designed to expose \nsuch creative accounting and to require U.S. companies that are foreign \nin name only to pay the same taxes as other domestic corporations. \nCorporate inversions are designed to exploit a specific loophole in \ncurrent law so that the company is treated as foreign for tax purposes, \nand therefore pays no U.S. taxes on its foreign income.\n  My bill closes this loophole in a way that is narrowly tailored to \ncapture\n\n[[Page S2273]]\n\ncorporate inversion transactions. In the case of inversion ``stock \nswaps'' the bill directs the IRS to look at the ownership of the new \ncompany to assess whether it is a domestic firm.\n  The loophole gives tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks to major \nmultinational companies with significant non-U.S. business. It also \nputs other U.S. companies unwilling or unable to use this loophole at a \ncompetitive disadvantage. No American company should be penalized \nstaying put while others renounce U.S. ``citizenship'' for a tax break.\n  Of course when some companies don't pay their fair share, the rest of \nAmerican taxpayers and businesses are stuck with the bill. I think I \ncan safely say that very few of the small businesses that I visit in \nDetroit Lakes, MN, or Mankato, in Minneapolis, or Duluth can avail \nthemselves of the Bermuda Triangle.\n  When we have our debate over budget priorities here in the Senate, we \nneed to decide whether we are going to go after tax scofflaws or \ninstead put these resources into fair tax relief, public investment, or \nsaving social security. That's what this legislation is all about. I \nhope colleagues will take a close look and be able to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Warner, Mr. Levin, \n        Mr. Daschle, Mr. Lott, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. McCain, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, \n        Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Reed, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Akaka, \n        Mr. Roberts, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Allard, Mr. Nelson of \n        Nebraska, Mr. Sessions, Mrs. Carnahan, Ms. Collins, Mr. Dayton, \n        Mr. Bunning, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 2051. A bill to remove a condition preventing authority for \nconcurrent receipt of military retired pay and veterans' disability \ncompensation from taking affect, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last Session I, along with 79 cosponsors, \nintroduced S. 170, ``The Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2001.'' Our \nbill addressed a 110-year old injustice against over 500 thousand of \nour Nation's veterans. Congress has repeatedly forced the bravest men \nand women in our Nation, retired career veterans, to essentially forgo \nreceipt of a portion of their retired pay if they received a disability \ninjury in the line of service.\n  In October, I introduced an amendment identical to S. 170 for the \nSenate Defense Authorization Bill. The Senate adopted my amendment by \nunanimous consent. Unfortunately, the House choose not to appropriate \nfunds for this important measure.\n  I rise today to again introduce a bill along with my colleagues Mr. \nHutchinson, Mr. Warner, Mr. Levin, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Lott, Mr. Kennedy, \nMr. Thurmond, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. McCain, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Smith of New \nHampshire, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Reed, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Akaka, \nMr. Roberts, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Allard, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \nMr. Sessions, Mrs. Carnahan, Ms. Collins, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Bunning, and \nMr. Bingaman that will correct this inequity for veterans who have \nretired from our Armed Forces with a service-connected disability.\n  Our bill will repeal the contingency language enacted in the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 and thus remove a \ncondition preventing authority for concurrent receipt of military \nretired pay and veterans' disability compensation from taking effect. \nIt will permit retired members of the Armed Forces who have a service \nconnected disability to receive military retirement pay while also \nreceiving veterans' disability compensation.\n  Congress approved inequitable legislation prohibiting the concurrent \nreceipt of military retired pay and VA disability compensation shortly \nafter the Civil War, when the standing army of the United States was \nextremely limited. At that time, only a small portion of our armed \nforces consisted of career soldiers.\n  Today, nearly one and a half million Americans dedicate their lives \nto the defense of our Nation. The United States' military force is \nunmatched in terms of power, training and ability. Our nation's status \nas the world's only superpower is largely due to the sacrifices our \nveterans made during the last century. Rather than honoring their \ncommitment and bravery by fulfilling our obligations, the federal \ngovernment has chosen instead to perpetuate a longstanding injustice. \nQuite simply, this is disgraceful, and we must correct it.\n  Once again our Nation is calling upon the members of the Armed Forces \nto defend democracy and freedom. We must send a signal to the men and \nwomen currently in uniform that our government takes care of those that \nmake sacrifices for our Nation. We must demonstrate to veterans that we \nare thankful for their dedicated service.\n  Military retirement pay and disability compensation were earned and \nawarded for entirely different purposes. Current law ignores the \ndistinction between these two entitlements. Military retired pay is \nearned compensation for the extraordinary demands and sacrifices \ninherent in a military career. It is a reward promised for serving two \ndecades or more under conditions that most Americans find intolerable. \nVeterans' disability compensation, on the other hand, is recompense for \npain, suffering, and lost future earning power caused by a service-\nconnected illness or injury. Few retirees can afford to live on their \nretired pay alone, and a severe disability only makes the problem worse \nby limiting or denying any post-service working life.\n  Career military retired veterans are the only group of Federal \nretirees who are required to waive their retirement pay in order to \nreceive VA disability. All other federal employees receive both their \ncivil service retirement and VA disability with no offset. Simply put, \nthe law discriminates against career military men and women. It \nassumes, in effect, that disabled military retirees neither need nor \ndeserve the full compensation they earned for their 20 or more years \nserved in uniform.\n  This inequity is absurd. How do we explain it to the men and women \nwho sacrificed their own safety to protect this great Nation? How do we \nexplain this inequity to those members currently risking their lives to \ndefeat terror?\n  We are currently losing over one thousand World War II veterans each \nday. Every day we delay acting on this legislation means continuing to \ndeny fundamental fairness to thousands of men and women. They will \nnever have the ability to enjoy their two well-deserved entitlements.\n  This bill represents an honest attempt to correct an injustice that \nhas existed for far too long. Allowing disabled veterans to receive \nmilitary retired pay and veterans disability compensation concurrently \nwill restore fairness to Federal retirement policy.\n  This legislation is supported by numerous veterans' service \norganizations, including the Military Coalition, the National Military/\nVeterans Alliance, the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans of America and the \nUniformed Services Disabled Retirees.\n  Passing this bill will finally eliminate a grossly inequitable 19th \ncentury law and ensure fairness within the Federal retirement policy. \nOur veterans have heard enough excuses. Now it is time for them to hear \nour gratitude.

Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Reid and \nSenator Warner in introducing a bill that will eliminate, once and for \nall, the inequity that our Nation's veterans have been burdened with \nfor 110 years. Across this great Nation there are over 400,000 \ndisabled, military retirees that must give up their retired pay in \norder to receive their VA disability compensation. Military retirees \nare the only group of Federal retirees who are forced to fund their own \ndisability benefits.\n  Men and women who served our country, who dedicated their lives to \nthe defense of freedom, have earned fair compensation. The issue has \nbeen before the Senate for years. Concurrent receipt legislation \nintroduced earlier this year by Senator Reid and myself had 79 \ncosponsors. The Congress needs to act this year on this issue.\n  This bill will honor Americans who answered our Nation's call for 20 \nyears or more. They are veterans who stood the line, defending our \nNation, during times of peace and times of war. Military retirement pay \nand disability compensation are earned and awarded for entirely \ndifferent purposes. Current law ignores the distinction between these \nentitlements. Military retirees have dedicated 20 or more years to our \nnational defense in earning their retirement, whereas disability \ncompensation is awarded to compensate a veteran for injury incurred in \nservice to our Nation. Our veterans have earned and deserve fair \ncompensation. I have been a longstanding supporter of efforts to repeal \nthe century-old law that prohibits military retirees from collecting \nthe retired pay that they earned as well as VA disability compensation.\n  Since September 11, the American people have gained a greater \nappreciation of our military. The men and women in uniform have \nperformed admirably in the war against terrorism. I recently visited \nour troops in Afghanistan. Their professionalism, their dedication, and \ntheir patriotism was an inspiration. As we all know, Afghanistan is \nstill a very dangerous place. We need to send a message to those \nsoldiers that are putting their lives on the line every day that our \ngovernment provides just and fair compensation for those that will have \ngone before them.\n  The Fiscal Year 2002 Defense Authorization Act included authority for \nconcurrent receipt, but made it subject to offsetting funding. The bill \nwe are introducing today moves forward in requiring full concurrent \nreceipt, with no restrictions.\n  I pledge to continue the fight on this important issue. I look \nforward to joining with Senator Reid in ensuring that the Senate Budget \nResolution includes full funding for concurrent receipt. I will work \nwith Senator Warner and my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee to see that the bill we are introducing today is incorporated \ninto the Fiscal Year 2003 Defense Authorization bill.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this important legislation. Is is simply the right and fair \nthing to do for American veterans.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in introducing \nlegislation to allow our disabled military retirees to receive all of \nthe compensation they have earned through their service to our Nation.\n  With this legislation, we are taking the next critical step in \neliminating a tremendous injustice that impacts disabled military \nretirees. Many of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, have \njoined in cosponsoring this important legislation.\n  What is our common goal? To ensure that an important class of \ndisabled veterans, military retirees who have suffered disability \nduring their years of military service, are fairly and appropriately \ncompensated by the Nation they served so well. We cannot and should not \nwait any longer for this to happen.\n  Last year, with overwhelming bipartisan support, the Congress \noverturned the 110-year-old prohibition against ``concurrent receipt'' \nas part of the Fiscal Year 2002 National Defense Authorization Act. In \nother words, we repealed the prohibition in law that prevents military \nretirees from receiving both their regular retired pay and veterans \ndisability compensation, without a dollar for dollar offset. \nUnfortunately, we did not have the necessary funding to pay for this \nrepeal. The resulting compromise in conference was a confidential \nrepeal.\n  On its face this legislation before us is a somewhat technical \nproposal. By its terms, it simply repeals language enacted in law last \nDecember that requires the President to propose offsetting legislation \nfunding concurrent receipt and requires Congress to pass ``qualifying \noffsetting legislation'' before concurrent receipt of military retired \npay and veterans' disability compensation can begin. The underlying \nauthorization to receive both concurrently, as provided for in the \nFiscal Year 2002 National Defense Authorization Act, stands. The \ncondition which has delayed implementation would be removed by the \nlegislation we are introducing today.\n  Both Senator Levin as chairman, and I as ranking member of the \nCommittee on Armed Services, have requested that the Senate Budget \nCommittee include funding in the budget resolution to fund this hard-\nearned benefit. I have requested that this funding be included ``above \nthe line''--that is, in addition to the President's requested amount \nfor defense. In my view, Congress should not be forced to cut the \nPresident's requested initiatives and programs--which are critical to \nthe ongoing war on terrorism, to fund this benefit.\n\n  The House Budget Committee has already included a portion of the \nfunds required for ``concurrent receipt'' in their budget resolution, \n``above the line.''\n  It is time to move forward on this important issue. The legislation \nwe are introducing will permit implementation of the law the Congress \nhas already passed, and I am confident that, working with the Budget \nCommittee, we can find the money to pay for it.\n  Our Nation has no more valuable assets than our men and women in \nuniform. They are called upon to leave their families, deploy to areas \naround the world, and face threats on a daily basis. They are on the \nfront lines, defending our freedom. Our Nation must meet its commitment \nto those dedicated Service members. How can we ask the men and women \nwho have so faithfully served to sacrifice a portion of their \nretirement because they are also receiving compensation for an injury \nsuffered while serving their country?\n  Our career military service members were promised health care for \nlife for themselves and their families. Two years ago, we the Congress \nacted to make that promise a reality. Yes, there was a significant cost \nassociated with providing that care. But there is no cost too high to \nprovide for those who ensure our freedom.\n  Today we are considering a similar situation. Is the cost too high of \nproviding our disabled military retirees both the military retired pay \nthey have earned and compensation they are due for a disability they \nreceived while serving their Nation? I think not.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2052. A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to reauthorize and improve the temporary assistance to needy \nfamilies program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S2275]]\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr President, I am proud to introduce a bill that \nreauthorizes the landmark welfare reform legislation passed 1996. It \nwill allow States to continue their excellent work on behalf of \nfamilies on welfare. This reauthorization bill is designed to allow \nstates to continue to provide the flexible initiatives that have \nreduced national welfare caseloads by over 50 percent and moved \nmillions of Americans from welfare to work.\n  Welfare reform was a bold experiment to dramatically change a major \nsocial program. In 1996, Congress ended the entitlement of eligible \nfamilies with children to cash aid. The results five years later are \nimpressive. Over two-thirds of the people who are leaving the welfare \nrolls have left for work.\n  Six years ago, we said the goal of welfare reform should be to \npromote work and to protect children. We stood here together, on \nunchartered ground, and endorsed significant policy changes that we \nbelieved would help families gain independence and economic self-\nsufficiency, while protecting the children. States began to revise \nwelfare service delivery with guidance based on the new reforms. Each \nstate designed and implemented programs that were unique and specific \nto their populations.\n  While there are still many challenges facing families who are \nstruggling to make the transition from welfare to work, as well as \nchallenges facing States in administering the program, I believe that \nwe are on the right course. It is essential to keep on course and \nsupport the fundamental principles adopted in 1996, as well as maintain \nnew State flexibility in order to reward and continue the innovations \nmade by the States.\n  In West Virginia, welfare reform has brought bold changes. Parents on \nwelfare get extra support as they face new responsibilities and \nobligations to make the transition from welfare to jobs. Last summer, I \nhosted a roundtable discussion to meet with individual West Virginians \nwho were undergoing major life transitions. They told me that they were \nproud to be working, but that it was often still a struggle to make \nends meet and do the best for their children. The goal of this \nlegislation is to help those parents, and millions more, to promote the \nwell-being of their children even as they work.\n  Today, I am introducing the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Reconciliation Act Amendments of 2002. States are making \nmeasurable progress. We should continue to build on this foundation, \nand not reduce State flexibility. It is essential we continue welfare \nreform, not unravel it, or restructure it.\n  This bill acknowledges that we must keep the focus on work, by both \nrequiring and rewarding work. To ensure a real focus on helping parents \nleave welfare rolls for a job, this legislation gradually replaces the \ncaseload reduction credit with a new employment credit. States will \nonly get a bonus toward their work participation requirement if parents \nmove from welfare to a job. This credit will acknowledge the dignity of \nall work by providing a bonus for parents who get jobs, both full and \npart-time. A mother who has never worked in her life and then gets a \npart-time job has had a true accomplishment, and that deserves \nrecognition. It is also the first step toward independence.\n  I am especially grateful to Senator Lincoln and Congressman Levin for \ntheir leadership and vision in designing this new incentive. It is an \nempowering approach to promoting work and sends the proper message to \nfamilies who are striving to become self sufficient. I am pleased to \nincorporate their proposal into my bill.\n  At this point, with a soft economy, it would be unwise to \nsignificantly change State TANF programs to impose drastically higher \nwork participation rates requiring 40 hours per job placement \nactivities would be, plain and simple, an unfunded mandate.\n  State officials have testified before the Finance Committee that such \nchanges would force States to restructure existing programs that are \nworking and turn their focus away from those who need some assistance \nwith child care or transportation, but are no longer dependent on a \nwelfare check. We should not turn away from helping our working \nfamilies while spending limited resources to meet new, and arbitrary, \nwork rates and hours.\n  To promote work, it is essential to help working parents. We \nobviously must invest more in child care funding to help parents stay \non the job. My proposal seeks to increase guaranteed child care funding \nfor this provision by $1 billion each year. This increase is designed \nto address existing needs of the current TANF program.\n  This bill would continue the transitional Medicaid program so \nfamilies can keep health care coverage for a year as they move from \nwelfare to work. In 1996, I was proud to work with Senator Breaux and \nthe late Senator John Chafee to protect access to health care for such \nvulnerable families. I have incorporated Senator Breaux's bipartisan \nbill to continue transitional Medicaid coverage and I appreciate his \nleadership on this and other key issues. Our bill also gives states \nmore flexibility and options to place parents in vocational training \nand English as a Second Language programs so parents can get jobs. In \nrecognition of Maine's success with the Parents as Scholar program, \nstates have the option to follow the Maine model for 5 percent of their \ncaseload to combine work and education.\n  Because States are investing more in the existing welfare program \nthan the current $16.5 billion grant, this legislation would provide a \nmodest increase of $2.5 billion in the basic TANF block grant over the \nnext five years. The new TANF funding would be allocated based on \nthe number of poor children. In 1996, Congress promised States that it \nwould fully fund the Social Services Block Grant at $2.8 billion \ndollars. The block grant is a flexible resource to states to help \nfamilies, and many States use it for child care. Unfortunately, its \nfunding was slashed to $1.7 billion in recent years. I believe that \nsince the States kept their promise on welfare reform, Congress should \nkeep our promise to fund the Social Services Block Grant.\n\n  The bill also invests $200 million to create BusinessLink Grants, \ncompetitive grants to support public and private partnerships to help \nparents get jobs. The Welfare-to-Work Partnership is just one example \nof how nonprofits working with business leaders can make a real \ndifference. The Partnership includes over 20,000 businesses that have \nprovided more than 1 million jobs to parents moving from welfare to \nwork. I have met with the board members of this group, and we should \nencourage such partnerships. I know that other groups, like the \nSalvation Army and Good Will, are doing important work on providing \ntransitional job opportunities, and these organizations would be \neligible for grants as well.\n  A job is the first step, but for welfare parents to make a successful \ntransition to independence, they need a range of supports. To achieve \nthis goal, the bill will create Pathways to Self-Sufficiency Grants to \nimprove this support network for parents. These grants are intended to \nprovide incentives and support to TANF caseworkers and nonprofit \norganizations to help improve the comprehensive network of supports for \nworking families, including Medicaid, CHIP, child care, EITC, and a \nrange of services. Working mothers deserve to know what type of support \nwill be available so that they do not slip back into welfare.\n  Work is fundamental, but we also need to be concerned about important \naspects of the lives of children and children. This legislation creates \na Family Formation Fund to encourage health families, reduce teenage \npregnancy, and improve child support and participation of parents in \nchildren's lives. The bill authorizes Second Chance homes, an \ninnovative program to help teenage parents get the support and \neducation they need. The bill seeks to end certain discrimination and \nharsh rules for two-parent families in the current system. If our goal \nis to support marriage, we should not penalize married couples.\n  Our legislation also makes a simple, but important change. Under the \ncurrent TANF program, each welfare parent has an Individual \nResponsibility Plan that serves as an assessment and work plan. In \naddition to having a responsibility to work, parents have a \nresponsibility to protect their children's well-being. To emphasize \nthis fundamental point, this bill adds language directing states to \nincorporate the concept of a child's well-being into each\n\n[[Page S2276]]\n\nparent's Individual Responsibility Plan. States have great flexibility, \nbut it is important to send a clear message that one of a parent's \nresponsibilities is the well-being of their children.\n  This legislation builds on the foundation of the 1996 Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. My hope is that \nthis framework will help promote bipartisan discussion about how we can \nmake even more improvements in our welfare system, while maintaining \nour partnership with the States. We all must work together, the \nAdministration, the Congress and the States, to improve our partnership \nto help families move from welfare to work.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the section-by-section summary of my \nbill in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the section by section analysis was ordered \nto be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section by Section Analysis\n\n\n                         TITLE I--TANF Funding\n\n       Increase the main TANF grant of $16.5 by adding $2.5 \n     billion over 5 years, based on the number of poor children \n     per state. It will gradually increase the TANF block grant \n     from $16.5 billion in 2003 to $17.4 billion in 2007.\n       The Supplemental Grants are renewed, in an expanded manner, \n     and ``built into'' the main TANF funding stream. Under \n     expansion, 34 States will qualify, compared to 17 States in \n     the past. The new Supplemental Grant is $472,749,000 per \n     year.\n       The Contingency Fund is reinstated in a more effective \n     form.\n       A $300 million bonus fund is created to reward States which \n     reduce poverty, along the lines of the ``high performance'' \n     bonus. In addition, States which show an increase in child \n     poverty are required to include ``measurable milestones'' in \n     their corrective action plans.\n       Reauthorization of other grants, such as bonus grants to \n     high performance states and grants for Indian Tribes, and \n     continuation of penalties for failure of any State to \n     maintain certain level of historic effort.\n       Funding for the Social Services Block Grant, SSBG, which \n     funds an array of needed programs including day care, \n     education and training programs, and services for victims of \n     domestic violence, is restored to $2.8 billion per year, as \n     is the 10 percent TANF transfer authority, as promised in the \n     original 1996 welfare reform law.\n\n\n                       TITLE II--Supporting Work\n\n       Replace caseload reduction credit with employment credit \n     beginning with fiscal year 2005. Employment credit will \n     reward States in which families leave welfare for work; \n     additional credit will be awarded for families leaving \n     welfare with higher earnings.\n       Guaranteed funding for the mandatory component of the Child \n     Care Development Block Grant, CCDBG, is increased from $2.7 \n     billion to $3.7 billion per year. The TANF transfer authority \n     continues.\n       States which adopt a ``Parents as Scholars'' program, which \n     combines work and post-secondary education, may count \n     participants in such a program as meeting the work \n     participation requirements, up to a maximum of 5 percent of a \n     State's caseload. Vocational training and education are \n     permitted to count toward the work participation requirements \n     for up to 24 months, not 12, and teenage mothers completing \n     high school are exempt from the 30 percent cap. States can \n     count up to 10 hours of ESL, with assessment, toward work \n     participation.\n       Provide $200 million over five years for new Business Link \n     grants to create public/private partnerships to encourage \n     employers to design innovative ways, including transitional \n     jobs, to help individuals moving from welfare to work.\n\n\n                     TITLE III--Supporting Families\n\n       Eliminate the stricter work participation requirement for \n     two-parent families.\n       States are prohibited from imposing stricter eligibility \n     criteria for two-parent families, such as continuing the AFDC \n     ``100 hour'' rule. In addition, the work participation rate \n     for two-parent families is conformed to that for one-parent \n     families.\n       Create a Family Formation Fund to provide $100 million for \n     research, technical assistance, and best practices in three \n     areas, including; 1. formation of two-parent families, 2. \n     reducing teen pregnancy, and 3. increasing the ability of \n     non-custodial parents to support and be involved in their \n     children's lives.\n       Since a child's well-being is part of a parent's \n     responsibility, states are directed to include child well-\n     being as part of the Individual Responsibility Pan for all \n     parents in the program.\n\n\n                      TITLE IV--State Flexibility\n\n       New Pathway to Self-Sufficiency Grants, $150 million over 5 \n     years, are made available to improve coordination of benefit \n     systems and to conduct outreach to low-income families, \n     working families in particular, to promote enrollment of \n     eligible families in assistance programs. States, local \n     governments, and non-profit organizations are eligible to \n     receive the grants, with a preference for applications which \n     involve collaborations.\n       States deserve flexibility and the option to offer wage \n     subsidies to parents who meet the existing work requirements \n     but need modest income support. Such subsidies would be \n     considered ``work supports'' and as such would be treated as \n     work supports, and not count toward the federal 60-month time \n     limit.\n       Retain the 20 percent hardship waivers for State \n     flexibility, but allow States that select the Domestic \n     Violence Option to serve the victims of domestic violence as \n     a separate and distinct category, since this option has \n     specific rules, including a 6-month review.\n       States operating under 1996 waivers are permitted to \n     continued doing so.\n       Provide States with the option to align foster care and \n     adoption assistance eligibility with TANF eligibility. States \n     must retain the income and assets standards for foster care \n     established in the 1996 welfare reform law as the minimum \n     standard, but States would have the option of updating the \n     standards to align them with TANF eligibility. This is \n     designed to streamline administrative work, and is similar to \n     State flexibility to align food stamp vehicle rules to TANF \n     vehicle rules.\n       Allow States to cover eligible legal immigrants under TANF, \n     regardless of date of entry.\n       Give States more flexibility to transfer TANF funds to \n     carry out existing transportation-for-jobs programs or \n     reverse commute projects.\n\n\n                       TITLE V--Healthy Children\n\n       Provide transitional Medicaid to parents and children \n     making the transition from welfare to work. Provide States \n     with the option of automatically enrolling families who leave \n     TANF for a job in Medicaid for a full year, without the \n     necessity of reapplying.\n       States will have an option to provide Medicaid and CHIP \n     services to legal immigrant children and pregnant women, \n     regardless of date of entry.\n       Authorize $32 million for Second Chance Homes for teenage \n     expectant mothers. These facilities allow these girls to live \n     in a safe environment and receive formal and parenting \n     education and prenatal care.\n\n\n                    TITLE VI--Public Accountability\n\n       To improve accountability, States are required to make \n     public the financial and program data submitted to the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, when the data \n     is transmitted, including posting the information on the \n     State's web site.\n       Under current law, four antidiscrimination statutes apply \n     to activities funded by TANF: the Age Discrimination Act of \n     1975; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; and Title VI of the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964. GAO is required to conduct a review \n     of how States have complied with the requirements of these \n     laws and make recommendations for improving compliance. HHS \n     is also required to issue a ``best practices'' guide for \n     States in complying with these laws in TANF.\n       Ensure that an adult in a family receiving TANF and engaged \n     in a work activity shall not displace any public employee or \n     position.\n       Conduct longitudinal studies in 10 States of TANF \n     applicants and recipients to determine the factors that \n     contribute to positive employment and family outcomes.\n       A GAO study to determine the impact of the prohibition on \n     SSI benefits for legal immigrants.\n       Grant to improve States' policies and procedures for \n     assisting individuals with barriers to work.\n       GAO survey and evaluation of State activities on workforce \n     development for professional staff delivery in TANF and TANF-\n     related services. The report should assess the range of \n     caseloads and effects of caseload on family outcomes and \n     satisfaction. The survey should provide information on the \n     qualifications, education and training for staff, and the \n     amount of staff turnover.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST:\n  S. 2053. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve \nimmunization rates by increasing the distribution of vaccines and \nimproving and clarifying the vaccine injury compensation program, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Vaccine \nAffordability and Availability Act.'' The United States has succeeded \nin dramatically reducing the incidence of disease through the use of \nvaccines. In some cases, we've even been able to eradicate specific \ndiseases, including smallpox. Smallpox, which has killed more people \nthan any other disease or war in history, has been eradicated by the \nresearch, development and deployment of vaccines.\n  Still, our success should not and must not dampen our resolve for \ncombating disease with vaccines. Many vaccine-preventable diseases are \nstill increasing morbidity and mortality due to a lack of public \nawareness about the existence and effectiveness of vaccines, and, in \nsome cases, due to a shortage of certain vaccines.\n  The goal of this bill is to improve how we vaccinate people in \nAmerica today. It would reduce the cost of vaccines, make vaccines more \naccessible,\n\n[[Page S2277]]\n\nenhance vaccine education, and streamline the vaccine compensation \nprogram. I urge all of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to \nsupport this bill and, in so doing, support the prevention of disease \nand the saving of lives.\n  We must strengthen our immunization system. We need only look at the \nexperiences of three developed countries, Great Britain, Sweden and \nJapan, when they allowed their immunization rates to drop due to fear \nassociated with the pertussis, whooping cough, vaccine. In Great \nBritain, a decrease in pertussis immunizations in 1974 resulted in an \nepidemic of more than 100,000 cases of pertussis and 36 deaths by 1978. \nIn Japan between 1974 and 1979, pertussis vaccination rates fell from \n70 percent, with 393 cases and no deaths, to around 20 to 40 percent, \nwith 13,000 cases and 41 deaths. In Sweden between 1981 and 1985, the \nannual incidence rate of pertussis per 100,000 children 0-6 years of \nage increased from 700 cases to 3,200 cases. Low diphtheria \nimmunization rates in the former Soviet Union for children and the lack \nof booster immunizations for adults have increased diphtheria from 839 \ncases in 1989 to nearly 50,000 cases and 1,700 deaths in 1994.\n  As the General Accounting Office, GAO, described in a March 2000 \nreport, infectious diseases are responsible for nearly half of all \ndeaths worldwide for people under the age of 44. The report further \nstates that immunizing children against infectious diseases is \n``considered to be one of the most effective public health initiatives \never undertaken'' in the United States and the number of people in the \nUnited States contracting vaccine-preventable diseases has been reduced \nby more than 95 percent. Every year, millions of children are safely \nvaccinated, preventing thousands of childhood deaths and even more \ndebilitating illnesses. While vaccines save lives and save the nation \nfrom lifelong medical costs associated with contracting vaccine-\npreventable diseases, no product is risk-free.\n  When Congress passed the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act in \n1986, it recognized that ``[v]accination of children against deadly, \ndisabling, but preventable infectious diseases has been one of the most \nspectacularly effective public health initiatives this country has ever \nundertaken.'' Congress further noted that the ``[u]se of vaccines has \nprevented thousands of children's deaths each year and has \nsubstantially reduced the effects resulting from disease.'' Congress \nfurther recognized that the cost of litigation initiated on behalf of \nchildren claiming vaccine-related injuries has resulted in an enormous \nincrease in the price of vaccines and a significant reduction in the \nnumber of vaccine manufacturers in the U.S. market.\n  The Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, ACCV, was established \npursuant to the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act to advise \nthe Secretary of HHS on ways to improve the Vaccine Injury Compensation \nProgram, which was also established in the same law. Meeting minutes \nfrom a September 2001 ACCV meeting best sum up the integral connection \nbetween vaccine supply, production, and liability concerns that our \nbill seeks to address: ``The vaccine supply in the United States is \nbecoming quite fragile. Over the last 20 to 30 years, there has been a \nsignificant decrease in the number of vaccine manufacturers. As a \nresult, there is a relatively small group of manufacturers with limited \nmanufacturing capability. This fragility compromises the ability to \nmeet current vaccine needs and limits capacity to respond to \nemergencies.''\n  In the early 1980s, lawsuits alleging vaccine-related injury or death \nthreatened vaccine production, availability, cost and even the \ndevelopment of new vaccines. Coupled with already low profit margins, \nthe vaccine market became unstable. Gross sales of the DTP vaccine in \n1980 for all manufacturers fell to about $3 million. If even a few of \nthe vaccinated children experienced adverse reactions to the DTP \nvaccine and recovered $1 million each, for a lifetime of mental \nimpairment, then damages would easily exceed total sales. Costs \nassociated with researching new vaccines and the uncertainty created by \nliability once the vaccine was approved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration and marketed, further jeopardized future vaccine \ndevelopment.\n  In an attempt to address liability projections, manufacturers either \nraised their prices, the DTP vaccine rose from $.19 in 1980 to more \nthan $12.00 by 1986, or left the vaccine market entirely. By the mid-\n1980's, the number of manufacturers of DTP vaccine declined from seven \nto one and the Nation experienced a critical shortage of vaccine. As a \nresult, we stopped immunizing 2 year olds, leaving them vulnerable to \nwhooping cough, diphtheria, and tetanus.\n  In 1986, Congress established the Vaccine Injury Compensation \nProgram, VICP, as part of the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. \nThe VICP was created to address two major goals: To provide \ncompensation to those who suffered rare but serious side effects from \nvaccines and to stabilize the vaccine production and supply market. The \nVICP was established as a Federal ``no-fault'' compensation system to \ncompensate individuals who have been injured by certain covered \nchildhood vaccines. While vaccine-injured parties are required to file \nclaims under the VICP before filing lawsuits, proof requirements are \nmuch lower than in court and procedures are simplified for injuries \nthat are listed on the Vaccine Injury Table. The balance that was \nstruck was that the burden of proving causation was significantly \nreduced for VICP claimants, while the litigation burden on \nmanufacturers and administrators of covered vaccines is decreased.\n  The Vaccine Affordability and Availability Act seeks to ensure the \nVICP balance between fairness to claimants seeking compensation for \nvaccine-related injury or death and stability for continued vaccine \nproduction is strengthened. It further addresses the concerns of \nclaimants who file for compensation under VICP, in large part based on \nrecommendations made by the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, \nACCV. Because family plays such an important role in the rehabilitation \nand treatment of a child injured by a vaccine, the legislation allows \nVICP awards to cover family counseling and guardianship costs.\n\n  Additionally, the bill raises the payment ceiling on two capped \npayments that have not been raised since the VICP was implemented in \n1988. The legislation also lengthens the filing deadline so that \npetitioners may have more time to adequately assess the life care and \nmedical needs of a vaccine-injured child before filing and adjudicating \na VICP claim. It also allows claimants to recover interim costs before \nfinal judgment is reached, to ease the financial strain on petitioners \nfor costs associated with filing a VICP claim. The bill also broadened \nthe membership criteria so that an adult who has been injured by a \nvaccine may participate on the ACCV. Finally, the legislation makes \nclear that all of these changes apply to pending and future VICP \nclaims.\n  Today, only two American companies and two European companies sell \nvaccines in the United States. The United States is currently \nexperiencing shortages in 5 of the 9 recommended childhood vaccines, \nfor which there are only four manufacturers licensed to sell in the \nUnited States. Once again, the threat of liability and the cost of \nlitigation pose challenges to the stability of our vaccine supply. \nAccording to the March 18, 2002 edition of Forbes magazine, the profit \nmargin for vaccines is very slim. Just one of the pending class action \nlawsuits seeks $30 billion in damages. The entire global value of the \nvaccine market, all around the world, is only $5 billion.\n  The ``Vaccine Affordability and Availability Act'' simply ensures \nthat the VICP's goal of stabilizing the vaccine market is not \njeopardized. In establishing the VICP in 1986, Congress sought to \nensure that individuals claiming injury from covered vaccines must \nfirst file for compensation under the VICP. Some individuals, however, \nhave attempted to evade this requirement by arguing, for example, that \na preservative used in a vaccine, and included in the vaccine's product \nlicense application and product label, is not itself a ``vaccine'' so \nthe VICP restrictions do not apply to claims for injuries caused by \npreservatives. This bill restates the original intent of the law, that \na vaccine is all the ingredients and components which are approved by \nFDA to be in the product.\n\n[[Page S2278]]\n\n  The bill makes necessary clarifications to the VICP to ensure that \nunwarranted litigation does not again destabilize the vaccine market \ncausing the few manufacturers licensed to sell vaccines in the United \nStates to leave the market resulting in even more serious shortages of \nessential vaccines. It clarifies that a vaccine-injured person must \ntimely file a petition and complete the VICP process before third \nparties may bring a civil action in connection with that person's \ninjuries. The bill adopts the ACCV recommendation that clarifies that \ncertain well-defined medical conditions such as structural lesions and \ngenetic disorders may be considered to be ``factors unrelated,'' and \ntherefore non-compensable under VICP, to a vaccine, even if the exact \ndefect in the gene, for example, is unknown. The legislation also \nclarifies that vaccine manufacturers and administrators cannot be sued \nunless there is evidence that a vaccine has caused present physical \nharm, they cannot be sued for medical monitoring to look for some \ntheoretical future harm. The bill clarifies the definition of \nmanufacturer to specify that a vaccine includes all components or \ningredients of the vaccine and clarifies the existing law to ensure \nthat any component or ingredient listed in a vaccine's product license \napplication or label will not be considered to be an adulterant or \ncontaminant. As with the changes we are making for VICP claimants, \nthese changes would apply to pending and future VICP claims.\n  This bill also requires that the Secretary of HHS prioritize, acquire \nand maintain a 6-month supply of vaccines to address future vaccine \nshortages and delays in production and authorizes new funds for this \npurpose. By authorizing additional funding for grants to State and \nlocal governments to increase influenza immunization rates for high \nrisk populations and by authorizing funding to increase immunization \nrates for adolescents and adults who are medically underserved and at-\nrisk for vaccine-preventable diseases, this bill seeks to meet the \nchallenge of improving adolescent and adult immunization rates. \nFinally, it ensures that colleges, universities and prisons are given \ninformation about the availability of a vaccine for bacterial \nmeningitis and that health care clinics and providers are given \ninformation about the availability of hepatitis A and B vaccines.\n  In summary, the ``Vaccine Affordability and Availability Act'' \nclarifies, updates, and streamlines the existing Vaccine Injury \nCompensation Program to address concerns of petitioners to the program, \nto ensure that we are better prepared for normal market shortages and \ndelays in production and that unwarranted litigation does not further \ndestabilize our vaccine supply. I urge my colleagues to support this \nmuch needed legislation to improve the way the VICP operates for \nclaimants seeking compensation and for manufacturers and administrators \nof vaccines seeking greater certainty in liability exposure, which, in \nturn, will stabilize vaccine production.\n  This bill will help to ensure that the balance between the two very \nimportant goals of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program is \nmaintained: To provide for fair and expeditious compensation for \npersons injured by covered vaccines; and to ensure a stable supply of \nvaccines by avoiding unwarranted litigation relating to vaccine-related \ninjuries and deaths. I urge my colleagues to support and pass this much \nneeded legislation at a time when liability concerns once again \nthreaten our vaccine supply.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2053\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make grants to train sexual assault nurse \nexaminers, law enforcement personnel, and first responders in the \nhandling of sexual assault cases, to establish minimum standards for \nforensic evidence collection kits, to carry out DNA analyses of samples \nfrom crime scenes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Debbie \nSmith Act, a bill to provide law enforcement the tools to track and \nconvict sexual assailants, and to help ensure that rape survivors are \nprovided prompt treatment that also provides the dignity and respect \nthey deserve. This bill addresses a serious problem in this country, \nthe huge DNA backlog and uneven processing of DNA evidence in rape \ncases.\n  According to the Department of Justice, somewhere in America, a woman \nis raped every two minutes. One in three women will be raped in her \nlifetime. In my home State of Washington the number of sexual assaults \nis even higher. According to the Washington State Office of Crime \nVictims Advocacy 38 percent of women in my State have been sexually \nassaulted. This is unacceptable.\n  Debbie Smith, is a native of Roanoke, VA, who was brutally raped in \nthe woods behind her house in March 1989. Six years later, because \nevidence had been properly preserved, her assailant's DNA profile was \ncross-referenced with the Virginia DNA Databank and was found to match \nthe DNA of a current prison inmate. He was convicted of the rape and \nwas sentenced to two life terms plus 25 years. Debbie Smith has since \nbecome a national spokesperson on the importance of collecting and \nanalyzing DNA samples.\n  As Debbie Smith and women in my State have come to know collecting, \nanalyzing, and entering this critical DNA information evidence into the \nCombined DNA System, CODIS, database is often the key to finding and \nconvicting a sexual assailant and stopping him from attacking again. \nUnfortunately, many jurisdictions throughout the country do not have \nthe funding for this simple, yet vital process. Consequently, crime \nscene kits go unanalyzed and valuable DNA information is lost forever.\n  Today, over 20,000 DNA samples are sitting useless in storage. These \nsamples could be holding the clues needed to solve crimes, or even to \ntrack a serial rapist. This means 20,000 women who had the courage to \nreport their rape may never find the peace of mind of someone knowing \ntheir assailant has been caught.\n  By authorizing funding to carry out analyses on crime scenes samples \nand cross-reference DNA evidence with crime databanks, this bill \nprovides law enforcement with the tools necessary for an effective and \nsuccessful criminal investigation.\n  The bill also provides grants to broaden the use of the Sexual \nAssault Nurse Examiners program. The SANE program provides nurses and \nfirst responders with specific training so that critical forensic \nevidence is thoroughly collected and documented and that sexual assault \nsurvivors are treated with professional care in a confidential and \nsensitive environment. SANE nurses can make the difference to women \nfacing one of the most difficult events of their lives. And, SANE \nnurses can make the difference in sending valuable information to crime \nlaboratories rather than improperly collected evidence that is \nimpossible to analyze.\n  In 1995, a young woman at home in Olympia, WA, was raped at gunpoint. \nAt St. Peter Hospital later that night, she said the SANE nurses who \ncollected DNA evidence after the assault ``made [her] feel at ease, \nmore confident, and more comfortable.'' The SANE nurses' training in \nproper evidence collection proved equally valuable. The DNA evidence \ncollected, when cross-referenced with the CODIS was databank matched \nthat of a convicted serial rapist Jeffrey Paul McKechnie, the ``I-5 \nRapist.,'' resulting in his conviction for the crime.\n  This bill is a reasonable and necessary step that needs to be taken \nto address the backlog of DNA samples from rape cases across the \ncountry, and to broaden the use of the SANE program to improve and \nstandardize the collection of forensic evidence while also addressing \nthe physical and psychological needs of the victim. This bill makes \nsure that we can catch the next Jeffrey Paul McKechnie and make our \nstreets safer. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass \nthis bill and get the necessary funding to address the DNA backlog in \nthis critical area once and for all.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself and Mrs. Carnahan):\n  S. 2056. A bill to ensure the independence of accounting firms that \nprovide auditing services to publicly traded companies and of \nexecutives, audit committees, and financial compensation committees of \nsuch companies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nIntegrity in Auditing Act. I am introducing this bill with my colleague \nfrom the Commerce Committee, Senator Jean Carnahan of Missouri. This \nlegislation presents a comprehensive approach to securities reform as a \nkey element in protecting America's shareholders and consumers in our \ncapitalist system. We look forward to the Commerce Committee's \nSubcommittee on Consumer Affairs, Foreign Commerce and Tourism hearings \nin April on these issues.\n  I am focusing my review of the Enron collapse on institutional \ninvestors, like State pension funds representing the guaranteed \nretirement plans of our police officers, firefighters, teachers, and \nother State and local workers. The Florida Pension Fund took a bath \nfrom investing in Enron, and it cost my State plenty. I want to protect \nthe taxpayers and prevent large losses in our public pension systems in \nthe future.\n  The legislation I am introducing today addresses the safety nets \nintended to protect investors like State pension funds against abuses. \nThe Integrity in Auditing Act prohibits auditors from providing any \nnonaudit services to their audit clients. The bill allows auditors to \nperform tax-consulting services with the approval of a company's Audit \nCommittee. Additionally, the bill prohibits outside accountants from \nworking in a management job for a client company for 1 year. These key \nprovisions, essential to any reform effort, are similar to those found \nin other bills including a bill introduced by my colleagues, Senators \nCorzine and Dodd.\n\n[[Page S2282]]\n\n  The legislation adds additional safeguards for the investing public, \nincluding State pension funds. The bill requires that companies rotate \ntheir outside auditors every 7 years. The company can continue its \nrelationship with the auditing firm through nonaudit client services.\n  The Enron collapse poses a challenge to us in designing a system of \ncorporate governance that secures better financial disclosure for the \nfuture. In my view the best response to Arthur Andersen's precarious \nstate is to make sure our efforts to reform the profession enables the \nauditing profession to continue their needed work in our capital \nmarkets with the potential loss of one big player. The legislation I \nintroduce today strives to meet that objective.\n  In addition to protecting the integrity of the auditing process, this \nlegislation recognizes that independent directors should effectively \nmonitor management behavior and represent the interests of the \nshareholder. The Council of Institutional Investors and others have \ncalled for auditor and board independence. Accordingly, the Integrity \nin Auditing Act requires enhanced disclosure of director links to \ncompanies.\n  The bill requires that a company disclose, with every filing, any \nboard of director relationship, familial, professional, financial, to \nthe company. This legislation also requires that all Audit and \nCompensation Committee members must be independent directors.\n  We should be clear that the Securities and Exchange Commission impose \na swift and serious approach to improving our corporate governance \nsystems. This bill includes a sense of the Senate that the SEC should \ntake a tough enforcement approach, including criminal prosecutions, if \nwarranted.\n  One of the biggest casualties of Enron's bankruptcy filing is the \ngrowing lack of confidence and trust by consumers, employees, and \ninvestors in the financial statements of companies. Willful blindness \nof companies leads to fuzzy disclosures. Cozy relationships among \ncompany executives, its auditors and board of directors, money \nmanagers, Wall Street analysts, lawyers, and others, cry out for \nreform. Our public institutional investors like state pension funds \ndeserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I recently read Teddy Roosevelt's 1902 annual message \nto Congress. Our 26th President was known as a Trust Buster. He told \nthe truth about our free enterprise system. He said ``We can do nothing \nof good in the way of regulating corporations until we fix clearly in \nour minds that we are not attacking corporations; we are merely \ndetermined that they shall be so handled as to serve the public good. \nWe draw the line against misconduct, not against wealth.''\n  We can all learn from history as we proceed to find thoughtful and \nappropriate ways to reform our securities laws on behalf of the public.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, today my friend, Senator Nelson of \nFlorida, and I are introducing important legislation to restore \naccountability to the accounting industry. The Integrity in Auditing \nAct will help renew Americans' confidence in our financial markets. \nInvestors rely on the financial information that is provided by \ncompanies and certified by independent auditors. This legislation is \ndesigned to make sure that these auditors are truly independent.\n  Over the course of the last few months, I have been looking into the \ndevastating events related to the collapse of the Enron Corporation. As \na member of both the Governmental Affairs Committee and the Commerce \nCommittee, I have participated in numerous hearings on this matter. We \nhave heard testimony from many experts about the different things that \nwent wrong at Enron. The shareholders were failed by many parties who \nwere supposed to be looking out for their interests: the company \nexecutives, the board of directors, the Government watchdogs, and \ncertainly, the accountants who certified that Enron's financial \nstatements were accurate.\n  But, this is not just about Enron. This is about the disturbing \nnumber of restatements that firms have filed in recent years. It is no \nlonger uncommon for a company to say that profits they previously \ntouted were actually fictitious. This is absolutely unacceptable. And \nto the extent that inaccurate accounting can be eliminated by removing \nany conflicts of interest that are preventing better audits, Congress \nmust act quickly to do so.\n  Let me be clear, that I have the deepest respect for the many \naccountants in this country who are extremely hard working and honest. \nThis legislation is not meant to impugn individual accountants or the \naccounting industry. Rather, it will improve this industry. The \nIntegrity in Auditing Act will ensure that accountants can do their \njobs with the highest professionalism, free from any pressures to \noverlook suspicious bookkeeping by their clients.\n  The reforms we propose today are urgent and in the interest of all \nAmericans. Auditors who simply rubber stamp questionable financial \nreports for their clients do a tremendous disservice to all investors. \nIf they prevent true and accurate information from coming to light, \nauditors endanger the hard earned savings of working Americans. Many \nparents are investing money every year to pay for the college expenses \nof their children. Many workers are saving for their golden years in \n401(k) plans or other retirement accounts. Young couples, saving to buy \ntheir first homes, often put money into mutual funds or money market \naccounts. All of these investors are entitled to accurate information \nso that they can make wise decisions about their savings.\n\n  This legislation is an important step toward ensuring that investors \ncan trust the financial information provided by companies. Let me \nbriefly summarize how this legislation establishes the independence of \nauditors. First, it prohibits audit firms from providing non-audit \nservices to their clients. An exception is made if the client's Audit \nCommittee believes it is in the best interest of the shareholders to \nalso receive tax services consulting from the audit firm. But it will \nprevent companies from engaging in extremely lucrative management \nconsulting or technology consulting contracts with the auditors who \nought to be providing unbiased assessments of the companies' financial \nhealth.\n  Second, this legislation requires that every seven years a company \nrotate the firm that performs its independent audit. Arthur Levitt, the \nformer chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission made it very \nclear why such rotation is important. In his testimony before the \nSenate Banking Committee he proposed that audit firms ought to be \nrotated in order ``to ensure that fresh and skeptical eyes are always \nlooking at the numbers.''\n  This legislation will also close the revolving door that could \ncompromise independent auditors. It prohibits outside accountants from \nworking, in a management capacity, for a client company for a period of \n1 year. This simple restriction will ensure that shareholders, and not \ncompany management, remain an auditor's primary concern.\n  In the interest of providing full information to investors, our \nlegislation also requires that any connections between the company and \na member of the board of directors be fully disclosed, whether those \nconnections are familial, financial, or professional. It also prohibits \nany directors who have such potential conflicts of interest from \nserving on the board's audit or compensation committees.\n  Lastly, this legislation would express the sense of the Senate that \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission ought to take a tough approach \nto the enforcement of securities laws.\n  America has the most vibrant and dynamic economy in the world. The \nfoundation of our economy is our capital markets, which are robust and \nresilient. But the success of these markets depends on the free flow of \naccurate, reliable information. Our markets are the envy of the world \nbecause of the confidence investors have in the private and public \ninstitutions that produce, verify, and analyze this information.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will improve our markets. It \nwill restore public confidence in auditors. And it frees accountants \nfrom any inappropriate conflicts of interest. I encourage my colleagues \nto support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n\n[[Page S2283]]\n\n  S. 2058. A bill to replace the caseload reduction credit with an \nemployment credit under the program of block grants to States for \ntemporary assistance for needy families, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Making \nWork Pay Act of 2002.'' A companion bill is being introduced in the \nHouse by Representative Sandy Levin of Michigan. I worked with Mr. \nLevin to reform the welfare program in 1996, and I am proud and honored \nto work with him again in this next phase of welfare reform.\n  I am also proud to be joined today by Senator Breaux of Louisana and \nSenator Rockefeller of West Virginia. As members of the Finance \nCommittee and representatives of rural States with similar challenges, \nwe all share the goal of ensuring that States have the resources and \nthe flexibility they need to continue moving people from welfare to \nwork.\n  The welfare reform bill President Clinton signed into law in 1996 has \nbeen a success. Nationally, welfare rolls have dropped by 52 percent. \nOver the last 5 years, enrollment in Arkansas' welfare program has \ndropped by 43 percent.\n  In 1996, we fundamentally changed welfare from an entitlement program \nto temporary assistance, a move which has allowed many needy families \nto achieve a liberating measure of self-sufficiency. Our message then \nwas ``work first.'' Today, people are working. Now our message should \nbe ``make work pay.'' To do this, we need to help people get good \npaying jobs by providing the support services like child care and \ntransportation that are absolutely essential to keeping those jobs.\n  We have rewarded States for moving people off welfare. Unfortunately, \nthat tends to ignore the important question of what happens after they \nleave welfare. What we need to do now is find ways to reward States for \nplacing people into good jobs and helping them with vital work support \nservices such as child care and transportation. These services are \nparticularly vital in States like Arkansas, where good child care is \nscarce and public transportation barely exists.\n  The legislation we introduce today measures State performance along \nthe entire continuum from welfare to work. It gives credit to States \nfor providing work-support services and short-term emergency \nassistance, which prevent people from ever needing welfare benefits in \nthe first place. Current law and President Bush's welfare re-\nauthorization proposal give no credit to States for these efforts, thus \ndiscouraging the use of these highly effective welfare-to-work methods.\n  My legislation revises how work participation rates are calculated to \nbetter fit post-reform welfare programs and more accurately measure the \nlevel of work activity among those served. Specifically, States receive \nhalf credit for people who work part time and pro-rate to full time, \nand they receive full credit for people that they are able to move into \nwork by supplying child care and transportation assistance. In \naddition, people who are deemed severely and permanently disabled \nduring the year are excluded from the State's work participation \nrequirement, so that states aren't penalized for failing to engage \nthese disabled people in work.\n  The ``Making Work Pay Act of 2002'' is supported by the American \nPublic Human Services Association, which played a fundamental role in \nhelping us develop this bill. I thank them for their support and urge \nmy colleagues to use them as a resource in assessing the needs of their \nstates. I also urge my colleagues to support this legislation as a \nnecessary first step into the next phase of welfare reform, to move \nbeyond ``work first'' to ``making work pay.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Hutchinson, and \n        Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 2059. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nAlzheimer's disease research and demonstration grants; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Alzheimer's \nDisease Research, Prevention, and Care Act of 2002. I am pleased that \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Hutchinson are joining me as original \ncosponsors of this legislation. This bill expands and directs \nAlzheimer's disease research at the National Institutes of Health \n(NIH), and expands and reauthorizes the Alzheimer's Demonstration Grant \nProgram. This important legislation gets behind our Nation's families, \nboth in the lab and in the community.\n  Alzheimer's disease is a devastating illness. Four million Americans \nincluding one in 10 people over age 65 and nearly half of those over \n85, have Alzheimer's disease. The total annual Cost of Alzheimer's care \nin the United States today is at least $100 billion.\n  As our population ages and baby-boomers become seniors, Alzheimer's \ndisease will take an even greater toll. Unless science finds a way to \nprevent or cure Alzheimer's disease, 14 million people in the United \nStates will have Alzheimer's disease by the year 2050. The race to find \na cure is more urgent than ever.\n  But these statistics do not begin to tell the story of what \nAlzheimer's means to families. My dear father suffered from Alzheimer's \ndisease. My family and I watched him die one brain cell at a time. I \nknow the pain that patients and families go through when Alzheimer's \ndisease strikes.\n  I believe that honor thy mother and father is not only a good \ncommandment to live by, it is also a good policy to govern by. That's \nwhy I have introduced this legislation that meets the day-to-day needs \nof seniors and the long-range needs of our Nation.\n  The Alzheimer's Disease Research, Prevention, and Care meets seniors' \nday-to-day needs by reauthorizing the Alzheimer's Demonstration Grant \nProgram. The purpose of the program is to develop and replicate \ninnovative ways to provide care to Alzheimer's patients that are \ntraditionally hard to reach or undeserved. These grants enable States \nto provide support services like home care, respite care, and day care \nto Alzheimer's patients and their families. This legislation expands \nthe Alzheimer's Demonstration Program by authorizing the funding needed \nto support these outstanding programs in every State.\n\n  In my own State of Maryland, Alzheimer's Demonstration grants have \nbeen used to train workers at nursing homes and assisted living \nfacilities to care for people with dementia. This training means that \nAlzheimer's patients will get high quality care when they leave their \nhomes and enter a nursing home. And it means that families can rest \nassured that their mom or dad is safe and in good hands.\n  This legislation also meets the long term needs of our aging Nation \nby expanding and directing Alzheimer's disease research at the National \nInstitute on Aging.\n  Our best shot at curbing the number of families who suffer from \nAlzheimer's disease is to find ways to prevent it before it starts. \nThis bill authorizes the Alzheimer's Disease Prevention Initiative. The \nNational Institute on Aging is currently conducting seven prevention \ntrials. The Alzheimer's Disease Research, Prevention, and Care Act \nsupports the National Institute on Aging's Prevention Initiative and \ndirects the Institute to focus its efforts on identifying possible ways \nto prevent Alzheimer's and conducting clinical trials to test their \neffectiveness.\n  Clinical trials can involve millions of dollars, tens of thousands of \nparticipants, and years or even decades. This bill establishes an \nAlzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Group to improve and enhance the \nNational Institute on Aging's ability to conduct several large scale, \ncomplex clinical trials simultaneously. Promising therapies should not \nhave to wait to be tested until current trials are complete and \nresources are made available. This legislation authorizes a national \nconsortium for cooperative clinical research at the National Institute \non Aging to improve the existing clinical trial infrastructure, develop \nnovel approaches to design these clinical trials, and make it easier to \nenroll patients.\n  This bill directs the National Institute on Aging, in consultation \nwith other relevant institutes, to conduct research on the early \ndiagnosis and detection of Alzheimer's disease. As promising therapies \nbecome available that can delay the progression of Alzheimer's, new \ntechnologies are needed\n\n[[Page S2284]]\n\nto detect and diagnose the disease before its symptoms strike.\n  There is still much that is not known about the causes of Alzheimer's \ndisease. In the last few years, for example, scientists have found that \nin stroke patients who later develop Alzheimer's disease, their \ndementia will worsen much more quickly than in Alzheimer's patients who \nhave never had a stroke. This bill directs the National Institute on \nAging to study this connection between vascular disease and Alzheimer's \ndisease. Finding answers to questions about this connection will open \nnew doors for researchers to explore promising ways to prevent and \ntreat Alzheimer's disease.\n  This legislation establishes a research program at the National \nInstitute on Aging on ways to help caregivers of patients with \nAlzheimer's disease. Family caregiving comes at enormous physical, \nemotional, and financial sacrifice, which puts the whole system at \nrisk. Three of four caregivers are women. One in eight Alzheimer \ncaregivers becomes ill or injured as a direct result of caregiving, and \nolder caregivers are three times more likely to become clinically \ndepressed than others in their age group. Research is needed to find \nbetter ways to help caregivers bear this tremendous, at times \noverwhelming responsibility.\n  Finally, this legislation increases the funding authorized for the \nNational Institute on Aging to $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2003. \nInvestments we make now in Alzheimer's Disease and aging research mean \nlonger, healthier lives for all of us. If science can help us delay the \nonset of Alzheimer's by even 5 years, it would save this country \nbillions of dollars--and would improve the lives of millions of \nfamilies.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation that gets behind our nation's families. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a letter of support from the Alzheimer's Association be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 21, 2002.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: On behalf of the Alzheimer's \n     Association, I am writing to strongly support your \n     legislation, the Alzheimer's Disease Research, Prevention and \n     Care Act of 2002. I congratulate you on your continued \n     leadership on issues important to older Americans as well as \n     issues important to individuals with Alzheimer's disease.\n       Right now, 14 million Americans--most of them babyboomers--\n     are living with a death sentence of Alzheimer's disease. For \n     most of them, the process that will destroy their brain cells \n     has already started. We have to act now, or it will be too \n     late to save them. Your legislation will support ongoing \n     efforts at the National Institute on Aging to find a way to \n     prevent and cure this disease. We are particularly pleased \n     that your bill places an emphasis on promising areas of \n     research, including the connection between Alzheimer's and \n     vascular disease and the development of new diagnostic \n     technologies.\n       Your legislation will also reauthorize a highly successful \n     Alzheimer demonstration program at the Administration on \n     Aging (AoA). These state grant projects demonstrate how \n     existing public and private resources within states may be \n     more effectively coordinated and utilized to enhance \n     educational needs and service delivery systems for persons \n     with Alzheimer's, their families and caregivers. In addition, \n     AoA has also identified ``best practices'' among the projects \n     and disseminated information on successful innovative \n     approaches. The demonstration program has fostered \n     collaborations between Alzheimer's Association chapters and \n     state aging and mental health agencies, public health \n     departments, private foundations, universities, physicians \n     and managed care organizations, as well as more than 300 \n     local community agencies.\n       On behalf the 4 million Americans with Alzheimer's disease, \n     I thank you for your efforts to support research and programs \n     for these individuals and the family members who care for \n     them. We look forward to continuing to work with you and your \n     staff on this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Stephen McConnell,\n                                        Interim President and CEO.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 2060 A bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional \nOffice in St. Petersburg, Florida, after Franklin D. Miller; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am honored to introduce \nlegislation to name the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, Regional \nOffice in St. Petersburg, FL, after Command Sergeant Major Franklin D. \nMiller, United States Army, Retired.\n  Frank Miller faithfully served our country as a soldier for thirty \nyears from 1962 until his retirement in 1992. During much of that time, \nFrank Miller served in Army Special Forces units, including four tours \nin the Republic of Vietnam. Frank Miller's combat decorations include \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor, the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, \nthe Air Medal, and six Purple Hearts. He received the Medal of Honor \nfor his bravery in battle in 1971, when, despite his own severe wounds, \nhe single-handedly overcame four enemy attacks and safely evacuated the \nsurviving members of his patrol.\n  Upon Frank Miller's retirement from the Army in 1992, with the U.S. \nArmy's highest enlisted rank of Command Sergeant Major, he continued to \nserve his community, country and fellow veterans as a benefits \ncounselor for the Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office in St. \nPetersburg, FL. Frank Miller remained very active in support of our \nveterans, the Armed Forces, and America's interest around the world. He \nwas frequently invited to speak to groups around the country, sharing \nhis experiences with others and serving as an example of honor, self-\nsacrifice, and dedication. Former Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Henry \nH. Shelton, who knew Frank Miller personally, has described him as, \n``an icon to what service in the armed forces is all about.''\n  Sadly, in July of 2000, Frank Miller passed away in Florida. He is \nsurvived by his three children, Joshua, Melia, and Danielle, and his \nbrother, Walter, who also is a retired Command Sergeant Major of the \nArmy's Special Forces.\n  Frank Miller dedicated his life to serving our country. He cared \ndeeply for the soldiers he led in combat, even to the very risk of his \nown life above and beyond the call of duty. He put his fellow veterans \nabove all else in his efforts to keep our nation's promise to care for \nthose who put America above self and bore the pain of battle. He was a \nloving father and brother, a true soldier's soldier, and a fellow \nAmerican whose life impacted many people. Frank Miller's life should be \nremembered and appropriately commemorated. I hope to help honor his \nlife by introducing legislation to name the Florida Veterans Affairs \nRegional Office in honor of Command Sergeant Major, Retired, Franklin \nD. Miller. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2060\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS \n                   REGIONAL OFFICE IN ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In recognition of conspicuous and meritorious duty in \n     the Army, Franklin D. Miller was awarded the Medal of Honor, \n     the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, the Air Medal, and six \n     Purple Hearts.\n       (2) Upon retiring from the Army, Franklin D. Miller worked \n     for the Department of Veterans Affairs at the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Regional Office in St. Petersburg, Florida, \n     thereby continuing to serve his country and his fellow \n     veterans.\n       (3) Franklin D. Miller remained active in support of the \n     Armed Forces and the foreign policy of the United States by \n     making speeches, participating in the activities of civic \n     organizations and schools, and supporting special forces \n     units, and by being both a role model for all Americans and a \n     true American hero.\n       (b) Designation of Building.--The building housing the \n     Regional Office of the Department of Veterans Affairs in St. \n     Petersburg, Florida, is hereby designated as the ``Franklin \n     D. Miller Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office \n     Building''. Any reference to that building in any law, \n     regulation, map, document, record, or other paper of the \n     United States shall be considered to be a reference to the \n     Franklin D. Miller Department of Veterans Affairs Regional \n     Office Building.\n       (c) Memorial Activities.--(1) The Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs shall, on the date of the first celebration of \n     Memorial Day that occurs after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, provide for an appropriate ceremony at the building \n     designated by subsection (b) to honor Franklin D. Miller and \n     to commemorate the designation of the building after Franklin \n     D. Miller.\n\n[[Page S2285]]\n\n       (2) The Secretary shall provide for the permanent display \n     of an appropriate copy of the Medal of Honor citation of \n     Franklin D. Miller in the lobby of the building designated by \n     subsection (b).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 2061. A bill to establish a national response to terrorism, a \nnational urban search and rescue task force program to ensure local \ncapability to respond to the threat and aftermath of terrorist \nactivities and other emergencies, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nResponse to Terrorism and Consequence Management Act of 2002. This bill \nis designed to take a few of the very important steps necessary to put \nin place a national policy and plan for responding to the consequences \nand aftermath of acts of terrorism, including acts involving weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  The cowardly terrorist attacks on September 11 on the Pentagon, the \nWorld Trade Center and Pennsylvania is one of the saddest days in the \nhistory of our Nation. However, I can personally attest that the spirit \nof the American people has never been stronger or more caring. Last \nmonth, I visited ground zero, I talked with survivors as well as many \nof the heroic men and women who continue to rebuild from our losses in \nthe aftermath of this terrible tragedy. I have never been more touched \nor more proud of our Nation's ability to stand tall, and to stand \nunbowed.\n  While the President has advanced a plan since September 11 which the \nCongress has begun to fund, there is still much work to be accomplished \nbefore we have in place the necessary protection and capacities to \nrespond to both the threat of acts of terrorism and the consequences of \nsuch acts. In particular, we need a statutory structure that will \nenable the various agencies of both the states and the Federal \nGovernment to coordinate and build a Federal, State and local capacity \nto fully respond to acts of terrorism, including acts involving weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  We must do more to ensure that states and localities have the needed \nresources, training and equipment to respond to threats and acts of \nterrorism and the consequences of such acts. In response, the President \nis proposing to fund FEMA at an unprecedented $3.5 billion for FY 2003 \nas a further downpayment to ensure that the Nation will not be caught \nunaware again by a cowardly act of terrorism and is fully capable of \nresponding to both the threat and consequence of any act of terrorism.\n  These FEMA funds are targeted to states and localities and are \nintended to create a safety net of First Responders with firefighters, \nlaw enforcement officers and emergency medical personnel at its heart. \nDespite the response to September 11, the current capacity of our \ncommunities and our First Responders vary widely across the United \nStates, with even the best prepared States and localities lacking \ncrucial resources and expertise. Many areas have little or no ability \nto cope or respond to the consequences and aftermath of a terrorist \nattack, especially ones that use weapons of mass destruction, including \nbiological or chemical toxins or nuclear radioactive weapons.\n  The recommended commitment of funding in the President's Budget is \nonly the first step. There also needs to be a comprehensive approach \nthat identifies and meets state and local First Responder needs, both \nrural and urban, pursuant to federal leadership, benchmarks and \nguidelines.\n  This legislation is intended to move the Federal Government forward \nin developing that comprehensive approach with regard to the \nconsequence management of acts of terrorism. The bill establishes in \nFEMA an office for coordinating the federal, state and local capacity \nto respond to the aftermath and consequences of acts of terrorism. This \nessentially represents a beginning statutory structure for the existing \nOffice of National Preparedness within FEMA as the responsibilities in \nthis legislation are consistent with many of the actions of that office \ncurrently. This bill also provides FEMA with the authority to make \ngrants of technical assistance to states to develop the capacity and \ncoordination of resources to respond to acts of terrorism. In addition, \nthe bill authorizes $100 million for states to operate fire and safety \nprograms as a step to further build the capacity of fire departments to \nrespond to local emergencies as well as the often larger problems posed \nby acts of terrorism. America's firefighters are, with the police and \nemergency medical technicians, the backbone of our Nation and the first \nline of defense in responding to the consequences of acts of terrorism.\n  The legislation also formally recognizes and funds the urban search \nand rescue task force response system at $160 million in fiscal year \n2002. The Nation currently is served by 28 urban search and rescue task \nforces which proved to be a key resource in our Nation's ability to \nquickly respond to the tragedy of September 11. In addition, Missouri \nis the proud home of one of these urban search and rescue task forces, \nMissouri Task Force 1. Missouri Task Force 1 made a tremendous \ndifference in helping the victims of the horrific tragedy at the World \nTrade Center as well as assisting to minimize the aftermath of this \ntragedy. These task forces are underfunded and underequipped, but, \nnontheless, are committed to be the front-line soldiers for our local \ngovernments in responding to the worst consequences of terrorism at the \nlocal level. I believe we have an obligation to realize fully the \ncapacity of these 28 search and rescue task forces to meet First \nResponder events and this legislation authorizes the needed funding.\n  Finally, the bill removes the risk of litigation that currently \ndiscourages the donation of fire equipment to volunteer fire \ndepartments. As we have discovered in the last several years, volunteer \nfire departments are underfunded, leaving the firefighters with the \ndesire and will to assist their communities to fight fires and respond \nto local emergencies but without the necessary equipment or training \nthat is so critical to the success of their profession. We have started \nproviding needed funding for these departments though the Fire Act \nGrant program at FEMA. However, more needs to be done and this \nlegislation is intended to facilitate the donation of used, but useful, \nequipment to these volunteer fire departments.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nNational Response to Terrorism and Consequence Management Act of 2002--\n                         Summary of Legislation\n\n\n   TITLE I. CAPACITY BUILDING FOR URBAN SEARCH AND RESCUE TASK FORCES\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``National Urban Search and \n     Rescue Task Force Assistance Act of 2002.''\n       Sec. 102. Statement of Findings and Purpose. The purpose of \n     this act is to provide the needed funds, equipment and \n     training to ensure that all urban search and rescue task \n     forces have the full capability to respond to all emergency \n     search and rescue needs arising from any disaster, including \n     acts of terrorism involving a weapon of mass destruction.\n       Sec. 104. Assistance. Requires no less than $1.5 million \n     annually for the operational costs of each urban search and \n     rescue task forces. Authorizes additional grants for (1) \n     operational costs in excess of the $1.5 million; (2) the cost \n     of equipment; (3) the cost of equipment needed to allow a \n     task force to operate in an environment contaminated by \n     weapons of mass of destruction, including chemical, \n     biological, and nuclear/radioactive contaminants; (4) the \n     cost of training; (5) the cost of transportation; (6) the \n     cost of task force expansion; (7) the cost of Incident \n     Support Teams, including the cost to conduct appropriate task \n     force readiness evaluations; and (8) the cost of making task \n     forces capable of responding to international disasters, \n     including acts of terrorism.\n       Requires FEMA to prioritize all funding to ensure that all \n     urban search and rescue task forces have the capacity, \n     including all needed equipment and training, to deploy two \n     separate task forces simultaneously from each sponsoring \n     agency.\n       Sec. 106. Technical Assistance for Coordination. Allows \n     FEMA to award no more than four percent of the funds for \n     technical assistance to allow urban search and rescue task \n     forces to coordinate with other agencies and organizations, \n     including career and volunteer fire departments, to meet \n     state and local disasters, including acts of terrorism \n     involving the use of a weapon of mass destruction including \n     chemical, biological, and nuclear/radioactive weapons.\n       Sec. 107. Additional Task Forces. Allows FEMA to establish \n     additional urban search and rescue teams pursuant to a \n     finding of\n\n[[Page S2286]]\n\n     need. No additional urban search and rescue teams may be \n     designated or funded until the first 28 teams are fully \n     funded and able to deploy simultaneously two task forces \n     from each sponsoring agency with all necessary equipment, \n     training and transportation.\n       Sec. 108. Performance of Services.

A bill to reauthorize the United States Institute for \nEnvironmental Conflict Resolution, and for other purposes: to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \ncontinue Federal support for the U.S. Institute for Environmental \nConflict Resolution. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues, \nSenators Bob Smith, Jim Jeffords, and Daniel K. Inouye. \n  The Congress enacted legislation to establish the U.S. Institute for \nEnvironmental Conflict Resolution in 1998, with the purpose of offering \nan alternative to litigation for parties in dispute over environmental \nconflicts. As we know, many environmental conflicts often result in \nlengthy and costly court proceedings and may take years to resolve. In \ncases involving Federal Government agencies, the costs for court \nproceeding are usually paid for by taxpayers. While litigation is still \na recourse to resolve disputes, the Congress recognized the need for \nalternatives, such as mediation and facilitated collaboration, to \naddress the rising number of environmental conflicts that have clogged \nFederal courts, executive agencies, and the Congress.\n  The Institute was placed at the Morris K. Udall Foundation in \nrecognition of former Representative Morris K. Udall from Arizona and \nhis exceptional environmental record, as well as his unusual ability to \nbuild a consensus among fractious and even hostile interests. The \nInstitute was established as an experiment with the idea that hidden \nwithin fractured environmental debates lay the seeds for many \nagreements, an approach applied by Mo Udall with unsurpassed ability.\n  The success of the Institute is far greater than we could have \nimagined. The Institute began operations in 1999 and has already \nprovided assistance to parties in more than 100 environmental conflicts \nacross 30 States.\n  Agencies from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Departments of \nInterior and Agriculture, the U.S. Navy, the Army Corps of Engineers, \nthe Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, and others have all called upon the Institute for \nassistance. Even the Federal courts are referring cases to the \nInstitute for mediation, including such high profile cases as the \nmanagement of endangered salmon throughout the Columbia River Basin in \nthe Northwest.\n  The Institute also assisted in facilitating interagency teamwork for \nthe Everglades Task Force which oversees the South Everglades \nRestoration Project. The U.S. Forest Service requested assistance to \nbring ranchers and environmental advocates in the southwest to work on \ngrazing and environmental compliance issues. Even Members of Congress \nhave sought the Institute's assistance to review implementation of the \nNation's fundamental environmental law, the National Environmental \nPolicy Act, to assess how it can be improved using collaborative \nprocesses.\n  Currently, the Institute is involved in more than 20 cases and many \nmore are pending consideration. The Institute accomplishes its work by \nmaintaining a national roster of 180 environmental mediators and \nfacilitators located in 39 States. We believe that mediators should be \ninvolved in the geographic area of the dispute whenever possible and \nthat system is working.\n  The demand on the Institute's assistance has been much greater than \nanticipated. At the time the Institute was created, we did not \nanticipate the magnitude of the role it would serve to the Federal \nGovernment. The Institute has served as a mediator between agencies and \nas an advisor to agency dispute resolution efforts involving \noverlapping or competing jurisdictions and mandates, developing long-\nterm solutions, training personnel in consensus-building efforts, and \ndesigning internal systems for preventing or resolving disputes.\n  Unfortunately, experience has also taught us that most Federal \nagencies are limited from participating because of inadequate funds to \npay for mediation services. This legislation will authorize a \nparticipation fund to be used to support meaningful participation of \nparties to Federal environmental disputes. The participation fund will \nprovide matching funds to stakeholders who cannot otherwise afford \nmediation fees or costs of providing technical assistance.\n  In addition to creating this new participation fund, this legislation \nsimply extends the authorization for the Institute for an additional 5 \nyears with a modest increase in its operation budget. The proposed \nincrease is in response to the overwhelming demand on the Institute's \nservices, an investment that will ultimately benefit taxpayers by \npreventing costly litigation.\n  On February 11, 2002, the Arizona Daily Star included an editorial \nthat recognizes the benefits of this Institute to resolving \nenvironmental conflicts faced by various parties, including Federal and \nnon-Federal parties, and recommends continuing support for the \nInstitute. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Arizona Daily Star, Feb. 11, 2002]\n\n                          An Effective Agency\n\n       One of the little-known gems in Tucson is one of the few \n     federal agencies, if not the only one, with headquarters \n     outside of the Washington, D.C. area--the Institute for \n     Environmental conflict Resolution.\n       With a name like that, the institute clearly is not a \n     tourist attraction. What makes it a gem is that it is proving \n     to be remarkably successful at finding solutions to \n     environmental conflicts that otherwise likely would end in \n     lawsuits.\n\n[[Page S2287]]\n\n       The institute is an arm of the Morris K. Duall Foundation. \n     It was proposed by Senator John McCain and created by \n     Congress in 1998. Very few people then realized what McCain \n     apparently did--there was a great need for such an agency.\n       Terrence Bracy, chair of the Board of Trustees for the \n     foundation, says the institute expected to handle perhaps 20 \n     to 25 cases per year. The institute handled 60 last year and \n     expects to handle even more this year.\n       Says Bracy: ``We didn't know how big the market was. We \n     didn't know whether it would work.'' But work it has.\n       Now, the institute's original funding will expire their \n     McCain is expected to introduce a bill to reauthorizing the \n     funding probably at the current level.\n       It's a good idea, and it would help if Arizona's other \n     congressional delegates, especially Jim Kolbe and Ed Paster, \n     who both represent Southern Arizona, and Senator John Kyl, \n     joined McCain in seeking the funding.\n       Bracy knows that the federal government has an immediate \n     stake in mediation. That is because many of the cases being \n     mediated involved governmental agencies, either as agencies \n     potentially being used or as agencies suing others.\n       A Unique aspect of the institute's work is that because it \n     is a federal agency, it has status and credibility with other \n     government agencies and with the courts. That makes its \n     medication efforts even more effective.\n       The institute has had contracts with the Navy, Fish and \n     Wildlife, the Bureau of Reclamation, the National Parks \n     Service, the Department of Transportation, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency and others, according to Barcy.\n       ``What happens over time,'' Bracy says, ``is we see this \n     thing this tremendous need.'' He is right.\n       Tucsonans should recognize what a gem they have in their \n     midst. And Arizonas congressional delegation should get \n     firmly behind McCain's efforts to reauthorize the funding for \n     the Institute for Environmental Conflict Resolution.\n       It is a government program that even the most anti-\n     government conservatives should love.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Nothing is more indicative of the support for the \nInstitute than the cosponsorship of my two colleagues, Senator Smith \nand Senator Jeffords, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over \nmost environmental matters before the Congress. I thank Senator Smith \nand Senator Jeffords for their critical support, and I look forward to \nworking with them to enact this important, bipartisan legislation.\n  This is a matter of some urgency as the existing authorization will \nexpire in this fiscal year. I look forward to working with the \ncosponsors of this legislation and the rest of my colleagues to move \nthis bill forward expeditiously to ensure continuing support for the \nvaluable services of the U.S. Institute for Environmental Conflict \nResolution to our Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2064\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the implementation of air quality \nprograms developed pursuant to an Intergovernmental Agreement between \nthe Southern Ute Indian Tribes and the State of Colorado concerning Air \nQuality Control on the Southern Ute Indian Reservation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Southern \nUte and Colorado Intergovernmental Agreement Implementation Act of \n2002.\n  As my colleagues know, successful environmental laws recognize that \nlocal implementation is almost always better than a ``one size fits \nall'' program run from Washington, DC. For example, the Federal Clean \nAir Act authorizes States and Indian tribes to become responsible for \nestablishing implementation plans, designating air quality standards, \nand implementing many of the regulatory programs needed to maintain or \nimprove air quality.\n  With respect to the Southern Ute Indian Reservation in my State of \nColorado, however, there is some question about whether the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, can delegate Clean Air Act \njurisdiction to the Southern Ute Tribe in the same manner that it would \ndelegate authority to any other Indian tribe.\n  In 1984 Congress ratified a jurisdiction and boundary agreement \nbetween the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and the State of Colorado. \nApproving this agreement spared both sides the exorbitant costs of \ngoing to court to fight over the jurisdictional status of each square \ninch on the Reservation.\n  In addition, the 1994 arrangement allows the tribe and the State to \nwork out any questions about jurisdiction within their agreed-upon \nframework. With respect to Federal officials dealing with the tribe and \nthe State, however, this arrangement could create some uncertainty. \nBecause it could be argued that it prevents the tribe from exercising \nauthority that may be delegated to any Indian tribe under the Clean Air \nAct.\n  Instead of placing the Environmental Protection Agency in the middle \nof a controversy about whether it is authorized to delegate Clean Air \nAct programs within the Southern Ute Indian Reservation, the tribe and \nthe State signed a historic ``Intergovernmental Agreement'' to resolve \nany controversy between the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and the State of \nColorado.\n\n  In this way, the State and the tribe have once again agreed that it \nis better for them to control their own destiny by reaching an accord \nthey can both live with rather than putting their fate in the hands of \nbureaucrats and judges. I applaud the proactive spirit which led the \ntribe and the State to resolve a potential controversy before a problem \nor conflict even arose.\n  The program established by the agreement reflects the unique issues \nand context that brought the tribe and the State to the negotiating \ntable. First, consistent with Congress' mandate in the Clean Air Act, \nthe Tribe will be the entity responsible for administering Clean Air \nAct programs within the reservation boundaries. The tribal program \nadministrators have complete access to the State's technical resources \nand personnel. Second, an equal number of tribal and State \nrepresentatives will sit on the Commission established by the \nagreement.\n  The Commission is authorized to hear and decide any appealable \ndecisions. The Commission will also set the pace for tribal \napplications for delegations of authority. Finally, the agreement seeks \nto make the Federal courts available to hear any challenges to \ndecisions by the Commission.\n  I am aware of the number of complex issues raised by this historic \nagreement, and efforts are already underway to address and resolve some \nof these issues. I believe it is the right time to introduce a bill to \nallow the appropriate committee to begin to formally consider this \nproposal. I know the parties will continue to direct their efforts at \nbringing this important matter to a successful conclusion.\n  In closing, let me again commend the efforts of both the tribe and \nthe State in negotiating and signing this historic agreement. I would \nask unanimous consent that a letter from Colorado Governor Bill Owens \nbe printed in the Record. Finally, I am pleased that Senator Wayne \nAllard joins with me in the views expressed in this statement and in \ncosponsoring this bill.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\n\n\n\n                                            State of Colorado,\n\n                                         Denver, CO, May 22, 2000.\n     Re: Intergovernmental Agreement between the State of Colorado \n         and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe Regarding Air Quality \n         regulation.\n\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: On December 13, 1999 I signed an \n     historic agreement between the State of Colorado and the \n     Southern Ute Indian Tribe in which the State and the Tribe \n     agreed to establish a single, cooperative air quality \n     authority for all lands within the Southern Ute Reservation. \n     This cooperative arrangement, negotiated by Attorney General \n     Salazar, my office and the Colorado Department of Public \n     Health and Environment (``CDPHE''), is the first of its kind \n     in the United States between a state and a tribe to regulate \n     air quality. Because the arrangement is unique, statutory \n     authority or clarification is needed at both the State and \n     federal levels to accommodate the agreement. The General \n     Assembly sent to me a bill to accomplish the changes \n     necessary at the State level that I signed into law on March \n     15, 2000. I am writing today to ask you to sponsor \n     legislation achieving a clarification to existing federal law \n     assuring that the agreement in its contemplated framework can \n     move forward. I have attached a draft of the legislation we \n     believe is needed to clarify that the agreement can work as \n     well as a copy of the intergovernmental agreement signed in \n     December.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       As you know, the Southern Ute Indian Tribe's Reservation \n     consists of approximately 681,000 acres, located mainly in La \n     Plata County. The Reservation is a checkerboard of land \n     ownership. About 308,000 surface acres are held in trust by \n     the United States for the benefit of the Tribe (``trust \n     lands.'') The remaining 3780,000 surface acres are owned in \n     fee by non-Indians or individual Tribal members (``fee \n     lands''), or consist of national forest land. In 1984, \n     Congress enacted Public Law 98-290, which confirmed the \n     exterior boundaries of the Reservation. P.L. 98-290 also \n     clarified that the Tribe has jurisdiction over the trust \n     lands and Indians anywhere in the Reservation, and the State \n     has jurisdiction over non-Indians on the fee lands.\n       Oil and natural gas production takes place throughout the \n     Reservation. These facilities are stationary air pollution \n     sources. Historically CDPHE's Air Pollution Control Division \n     has issued permits to non-Indian owned sources located on fee \n     lands. Recently, the Tribe petitioned EPA for the right to \n     issue all permits within the exterior boundaries of the \n     Reservation including the facilities historically regulated \n     by the State of Colorado. In 1998, the EPA issued regulations \n     implementing provisions of the Clean Air Act allowing Indian \n     tribes to be treated in the same manner as States to \n     administer certain air quality programs. In July 1998, the \n     Southern Ute Tribe applied to the EPA for treatment as a \n     state for all lands within the Reservation. On the basis of \n     PL 98-290, the State objected, arguing that it had \n     jurisdiction over the non-Indian sources on the fee lands.\n       To avoid a potentially long and costly fight in the federal \n     courts about which governmental entity has jurisdiction over \n     the fee lands, the Tribe and the State have now agreed to \n     establish a single, cooperative air quality authority for all \n     lands within the Reservation. On December 13, 1999, the Tribe \n     and the State entered into an Intergovernmental Agreement \n     (copy attached) which provides that a joint Tribal/State \n     Commission will establish air quality standards. The Tribe \n     will receive a delegation of authority from EPA to administer \n     the air quality programs, but the delegation is contingent \n     upon and shall last only so long as the Agreement and \n     Commission are in place.\n\n\n                      Tribal and State Legislation\n\n       The Agreement provided for legislation by both the Tribe \n     and the State approving the Agreement and enacting \n     substantive law necessary to carry out the Agreement's \n     provisions. On January 18, 2000, the Tribe adopted its \n     legislation. On March 15, 2000, I signed HB 1324, which \n     adopted and codified the Agreement and HB 1325, which \n     established the State's authority to establish the Commission \n     and otherwise implement the Agreement.\n\n\n                          Federal Legislation\n\n       The Agreement envisions a delegation by the EPA to the \n     Tribe to administer Clean Air Act programs, contingent upon \n     the existence of the Joint State/Tribal Commission. This is a \n     unique arrangement and is not clearly specified within the \n     Clean Air Act. Parties have argued to me that clarifying \n     legislation by Congress is necessary to resolve any \n     uncertainty about the EPA's power to delegate authority to \n     run an air pollution program to the Tribe and for the \n     Commission to act under such a delegation. The Commission \n     also will set the standards and rules of the air quality \n     program that the Tribe will administer. The Commission will \n     serve as the administrative appellate review body for \n     enforcement and other administrative actions. The Agreement \n     provides that the Commission's final review is final agency \n     action, and further judicial review would be in the federal \n     courts. The existence of such federal jurisdiction should \n     also be clarified by Congress.\n       Enclosed is a draft of the proposed federal legislation and \n     a legislative history for your review. These draft documents \n     would accomplish the limited but necessary changes to make \n     the Agreement fully operational. The bill is set up to add a \n     section to P.L. 98-290 to narrow the application of the \n     revisions only to the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and the State \n     of Colorado, so that other states or tribes would not be \n     affected.\n\n\n                               Next Steps\n\n       The full operation of the Agreement is conditioned upon \n     passage of federal legislation no later than December 13, \n     2001. I recognize that this may be difficult but from the \n     State's perspective the sooner the Agreement could be \n     operational the better since EPA will be regulating the \n     affected entities until the Joint Commission and Tribe take \n     over. We would like to be helpful and I offer a meeting \n     between you and your staff and representatives of the \n     Governor's Office, the Colorado Department of Public Health \n     and Environment and the Colorado Attorney General's Office at \n     your earliest convenience discuss this issue.\n       Thank you for taking the time to consider this request. \n     Please feel free to contact Britt Weygandt in my office for \n     any assistance you may need.

Bush's Commission to \n     Strengthen Social Security (referred to in this resolution as \n     the ``Commission'') produced 3 proposals for Social Security \n     reform that included individual accounts and significant \n     reductions in the level of guaranteed benefits;\n       Whereas the proposed changes to guaranteed benefits could \n     reduce benefits to future retirees by 45 percent;\n       Whereas the Commission proposals also suggested reducing \n     benefits for early retirees, forcing many Americans to delay \n     retirement; and\n       Whereas the Commission justified proposed cuts in \n     guaranteed benefits by pointing to long-term projected \n     shortfalls in the Social Security Trust Fund, however, the \n     Commission's proposals to divert payroll tax revenues from \n     the Trust Fund into private accounts would substantially \n     accelerate the\n\n[[Page S2289]]\n\n     date by which the Trust Fund would become insolvent: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that Congress \n     should reject the reductions in guaranteed Social Security \n     benefits proposed by the President's Commission to Strengthen \n     Social Security.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Lieberman, I am \nsubmitting a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that \nCongress should reject the reductions in guaranteed Social Security \nbenefits proposed by the President's Commission to Strengthen Social \nSecurity.\n  The central purpose of Social Security is to ensure that Americans \nwho work hard and contribute to our Nation can maintain a decent \nstandard of living in their old age. The program provides a critical \nsafety net. Only 11 percent of American seniors live in poverty, but \nwithout Social Security that figure would be 50 percent.\n  It is hard to overstate the importance of Social Security in \nprotecting seniors' retirement security. For two-thirds of the elderly, \nSocial Security is their major source of income. For one-third of the \nelderly, Social Security is virtually their only source of income.\n  Despite its critical importance for seniors, the level of Social \nSecurity benefits generally is quite modest. In fiscal year 2001, the \naverage benefit for retired workers was about $10,000 per year. This \nclearly is insufficient to maintain a decent standard of living in most \nparts of the country, especially for seniors with relatively high \nhealth care costs.\n  Unfortunately, even the modest level of guaranteed benefits under \ncurrent law is now at risk. Last year, the President's Commission to \nStrengthen Social Security, appointed by President Bush to help promote \nhis goal of partially privatizing Social Security, proposed a set of \noptions for changes in the program that included significant reductions \nin the level of guaranteed benefits.\n  The Commission's report included a proposal in which guaranteed \nbenefit levels would be reduced by changing the way that benefits are \nadjusted over time. The details of this change are complicated, but the \nbottom line is not: compared to current law, the proposal could reduce \nthe benefits provided to workers who retire in the future by about 45 \npercent. The Commission's report also suggested changes that would \nreduce benefits for those who retire early, which could force many \nAmericans to delay their retirement.\n  The Commission justified proposed cuts in guaranteed benefits by \npointing to long-term projected shortfalls in the Social Security Trust \nFund. And it is true that as the baby boomers begin to retire, they \nwill put significant new demands on our budget. However, the \nCommission's proposals for private accounts actually would make the \nTrust Fund's financial problems worse. By proposing to divert payroll \ntax revenues from the Trust Fund into private accounts, the Commission \nwould only accelerate the date by which the Fund would become \ninsolvent.\n  Proponents of privatizing Social Security like to argue that the \nreturns for assets held in private accounts are likely to be high. That \nmay be true for some fortunate seniors, but others will suffer with the \ninevitable fluctuations in the market. In any case, we need to remember \nwhy we have Social Security in the first place, to provide a floor to \nensure that seniors can live out their lives in dignity. The real \nquestion for the Congress is where to set that floor. And, in my view, \n$10,000 a year for the average beneficiary is, if anything, too low.\n  It is important to keep Social Security's long-term problems in \nperspective. According to estimates by the Social Security \nAdministration, the present value of the Trust Fund's unfunded \nobligations amounts to $3.2 trillion over the next 75 years. By \ncontrast, the 75 year cost of last year's tax cut, if made permanent, \nhas been estimated to be $7.7 trillion. In other words, the long-term \ncost of the tax cut is more than twice as large as the long-term \ndeficit in Social Security.\n  There is simply no excuse for making dramatic cuts in guaranteed \nSocial Security benefits, as the President's commission has proposed.\n  So, I hope my colleagues will support this resolution and join in \nrejecting the cuts in guaranteed benefits proposed by President Bush's \ncommission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2289-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2289-S2290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3040.

SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) This Title can be cited as the ``Iraq Petroleum Import \n     Restriction Act of 2001.''\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that\n       (i) the government of the Republic of Iraq:\n       (A) has failed to comply with the terms of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 687 regarding unconditional Iraqi \n     acceptance of the destruction, removal, or rendering \n     harmless, under international supervision, of all nuclear, \n     chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents and \n     all related subsystems and components and all research, \n     development, support and manufacturing facilities, as well as \n     all ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 \n     kilometers and related major parts, and repair and production \n     facilities and has failed to allow United Nations inspectors \n     access to sites used for the production or storage of weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n       (B) routinely contravenes the terms and conditions of UNSC \n     Resolution 661, authorizing the export of petroleum products \n     from Iraq in exchange for food, medicine and other \n     humanitarian products by conducting a routine and extensive \n     program to sell such products outside of the channels \n     established by UNSC Resolution 661 in exchange for military \n     equipment and materials to be used in pursuit of its program \n     to develop weapons of mass destruction in order to threaten \n     the United States and its allies in the Persian Gulf and \n     surrounding regions.\n       (C) has failed to adequately draw down upon the amounts \n     received in the Escrow Account established by UNSC Resolution \n     986 to purchase food, medicine and other humanitarian \n     products required by its citizens, resulting in massive \n     humanitarian suffering by the Iraqi people.\n       (D) conducts a periodic and systematic campaign to harass \n     and obstruct the enforcement of the United States and United \n     Kingdom-enforced ``No-Fly Zones'' in effect in the Republic \n     of Iraq.\n       (E) routinely manipulates the petroleum export production \n     volumes permitted under UNSC Resolution 661 in order to \n     create uncertainty in global energy markets, and therefore \n     threatens the economic security of the United States.\n       (ii) Further imports of petroleum products from the \n     Republic of Iraq are inconsistent with the national security \n     and foreign policy interests of the United States and should \n     be eliminated until such time as they are not so \n     inconsistent.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON IRAQI-ORIGIN PETROLEUM IMPORTS.\n\n       The direct or indirect import from Iraq of Iraqi-origin \n     petroleum and petroleum products is prohibited, \n     notwithstanding an authorization by the Committee established \n     by UNSC Resolution 661 or its designee, or any other order to \n     the contrary.\n\n     SEC. 3. TERMINATION/PRESIDENTIAL CERTIFICATION.\n\n       This Act will remain in effect until such time as the \n     President, after consultation with the relevant committees in \n     Congress, certifies to the Congress that--\n       (1) Iraq is in substantial compliance with the terms of--\n       (A) UNSC Resolution 687 regarding the access of UN Special \n     Commission inspectors to suspected Iraqi Weapons of Mass \n     Destruction program sites; and\n       (B) UNSC Resolution 986 prohibiting the smuggling of \n     petroleum by Iraq in circumvention of the ``Oil-for-Food'' \n     program; or that\n       (2) resuming the importation of Iraqi-origin petroleum and \n     petroleum products would not be inconsistent with the \n     national security and foreign policy interests of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 4.

TALMADGE, FORMERLY A SENATOR FROM THE \n                            STATE OF GEORGIA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the consideration of S. Res. 231.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 231) relative to the death of the \n     Honorable Herman E. Talmadge, formerly a Senator from the \n     State of Georgia.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise today to mourn one of this body's \ngreatest giants--Herman Eugene Talmadge.\n  The tallest tree in all the Georgia forest has fallen. And we will \nnever see another one that stood so tall and had such strength. All of \nus in Georgia politics who came after him have worked in his shade.\n  My heart grieves for his wife Linda, his family and his legion of \nloyal friends.\n  Without question, Herman Talmadge was Georgia's greatest governor of \nthe 20th Century. He proposed and passed Georgia's first sales tax, and \nthat ushered in a new day of State services. Nowhere was the impact \ngreater than in education.\n  When Herman Talmadge became Governor in 1948, Georgia still had more \nthan 1,750 one-room school houses. Many other school buildings were in \na dilapidated State.\n  The major school construction program he launched was badly needed. \nIt changed the state of education in Georgia.\n  But he did more than just construct new school buildings. Governor \nTalmadge also implemented Georgia's first statewide effort to reform \neducation. It was called the Minimum Foundation Program for Education.\n  The result was dramatic improvement in public education in Georgia--\nincreased funding, better-trained, higher-paid teachers, finally, a 9-\nmonth\n\n[[Page S2308]]\n\nschool year, and bus service in rural areas that gave every Georgia \nchild the opportunity for an education.\n  And one other thing I can say personally concerning education: \nSenator Talmadge certainly educated me.\n  He beat the tar out of me when I ran against him for the Senate in \n1980. And I have often said I learned more from that losing race than I \ndid in all the others that I won.\n  This Senator has a Ph.D. from ``Herman Talmadge University.''\n  Although it took me a few years to realize it, I have been a better \nman and a better Governor and a better Senator because of what he \ntaught me.\n  For example, I never proposed a program or let anyone else propose \nsome ``pie in the sky'' without asking, How much does it cost and how \nare we going to pay for it?\n  But we are not here to talk about what he taught me. We are here to \npay tribute to a Georgia icon, a giant political leader, the likes of \nwhich we will never see again.\n  A man who gave and did so much for our State, our Nation, and our \npeople.\n  The Talmadge Administration also left Georgia an economic development \nlegacy, an unprecedented highway construction program was undertaken. \nThe Ports Authority and our network of State farmers' markets were \nexpanded. And the forestry industry benefited from his statewide \nprogram of protection and reforestation.\n  Governor Talmadge also built a network of hospitals and health \ncenters throughout Georgia. And he doubled State funding for mental \nhealth.\n  Two years after he left the Governor's office, he was easily elected \nto the U.S. Senate in 1956 to replace the legendary Walter F. George \nupon his retirement.\n  Those were big shoes to fill. But Herman Talmadge immediately \nestablished himself as an authority on agricultural programs. In fact, \nhe chaired the Agriculture Committee for a decade--from 1971 through \n1980.\n  I will never forget the day I went to my first meeting as a member of \nthe Agriculture committee. I sat down at the table and right behind me \nwas the huge magnificent portrait of Senator Talmadge. I wrote him a \nnote saying that ``he was still in Washington looking over my \nshoulder.''\n  Senator Talmadge was a primary sponsor of the modern School Lunch \nProgram, and of the 1972 Rural Development Act, which created a system \nof rural hospitals.\n  In welfare reform, Herman Talmadge was ahead of his time. His \nTalmadge Work Incentive Training Act provided tax credits as an \nincentive to hiring welfare recipients.\n  In its first two years, this law took more than one million people \noff the welfare rolls nationwide. It resulted in a savings of $4 \nbillion dollars. Georgia alone saved more than $400 million.\n  Without a doubt, his service together, with Senator Richard B. \nRussell, who chaired the Armed Forces Committee, gave Georgia the most \npowerful presence it has ever had in the U.S. Senate.\n  I will close with this last observation. The ultimate test of any \nstatesman is to have a combination of insight and courage.\n  Herman Eugene Talmadge always possessed both in abundance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, without \nany intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 231) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 231\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate has heard with profound sorrow \n     and deep regret the announcement of the death of the \n     Honorable Herman E. Talmadge, formerly a Senator from the \n     State of Georgia.\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate communicate \n     these resolutions to the House of Representatives and \n     transmit an enrolled copy thereof to the family of the \n     deceased.\n       Resolved, That when the Senate adjourns today, it stand \n     adjourned as a further mark of respect to the memory of the \n     deceased Senator.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I did not know Herman Talmadge, but when I \narrived here in Washington his reputation was evident. Even though what \nwe are doing tonight is somewhat perfunctory, it should not take away \nfrom the many great deeds this man did for the State of Georgia and his \ncountry, as indicated in the statement by Senator Zell Miller.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/21/senate-section/article/S2308-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--AMENDMENT NO. 3070\n\n  Mr. REID.
