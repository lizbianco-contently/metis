Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak. I \nwant to address a growing disconnect that I detect between what I am \nhearing in my home State of New Mexico and much of what I am hearing \nand reading here in Washington, DC. Frankly, I begin to worry when we \nare talking about one thing in Washington while the people we represent \nat home are talking about other things, or talking about them in \ndifferent ways--in coffee klatsches, in barber shops, in various \nsettings.\n\n[[Page S9356]]\n\n  What do I mean by that? I mean in Washington in recent weeks the \ndrumbeat has been about how we need to prepare for and pursue an attack \non Iraq, and how the United Nations had better get its act together to \npursue this effort in weeks rather than months or we would unilaterally \nact in its place.\n  In my State, there is talk about Iraq. Frankly, there is a great deal \nof concern about what is being planned and what is being contemplated, \non what timetable. But the main issue I hear from people in my State \nrelates to the economy and what is happening in the economy. Why would \nthe economy be a major issue in New Mexico, somebody might ask? One \nreason is the article that appeared in the Albuquerque Journal \nyesterday with a headline that says, ``New Mexico Tops U.S. for Poverty \nin 2001.''\n  It indicates the poverty rate for the U.S. was at 11.7 percent last \nyear, and in my State it was 17.7 percent of our population living \nbelow the poverty line. The median income for the same period dropped \nover $700 between 2000 and 2001. Income levels fell for every group. \nThis is according to the U.S. Census. This is not some group with an \naxe to grind. This was the U.S. Census that reported that income levels \nfell for every group except the very richest and the very poorest. So \nthat is one reason people are concerned about the economy.\n  Another reason is because of what is happening to their pension \nplans, to their 401(k)s. I heard a discussion a week or so ago where I \nthought one of the commentators made a very good point. He said there \nwill be an October surprise this year. As we approach elections in this \ncountry there is always a concern on the part of people who watch the \npolitical comings and goings that there will be an October surprise; \nsomething will be done in October to try to change the outcome of the \nelection. In fact, this commentator said there will be an October \nsurprise, but the surprise will be when each person opens their \nquarterly report showing where their retirement savings now stand, \nwhere they stand in their 401(k). They will see a dramatic decline in \nthe amount of retirement savings that they have because of what is \nhappening in the economy.\n  More and more people are worried that nobody in Washington--and this \nis what I begin to pick up in my State--there is a concern that no one \nin Washington seems concerned. No one seems concerned about the \neconomy. There is no talk about any strategy to improve the economy. \nThere is no plan to improve the economy.\n  To hear the pronouncements that have come out of the administration \nin recent weeks and months, you would think the economy is just fine, \nthat everything is humming right along. At least we are no longer \nhearing from the Secretary of Treasury and others that we are on the \ncusp of a rebound in the economy. That talk has faded. But certainly \nthere is no talk about any plan or any suggestion about how we are \ngoing to strengthen the U.S. economy. And the fact that we are not \ntalking about it is of concern.\n  It is possible I am just reading the wrong newspapers, watching the \nwrong TV reports. Maybe there is something being planned. Maybe there \nis some strategy that is being developed in the administration. I have \nnot seen it. I hope there is. My strong belief, though, is that the \nadministration's basic position on the economy is: Stay the course.\n\n  The problem with staying the course is this is not a very good course \nfor the average American. It is not a very good course for the average \nperson in my State. So I hope we will begin to hear something here in \nWashington about this issue which is dominating the discussion in my \nhome State.\n  Let me also say something about this threatened war in Iraq. \nObviously, Americans want to deal with any imminent threat to our \nNation's security. I think much more so are we ready to do that after \nthe catastrophe of 9/11. If weapons of mass destruction have been \ndeveloped or are being developed with the intent to use those against \nus or against our allies, then that is a threat that requires us to \nact. I think there is general agreement on it.\n  We all share the goal of wanting to eliminate the threat of these \nweapons. But the question we need to debate is the means for \naccomplishing the goal. So far the means that the administration has \ninsisted upon and put forward is a so-called regime change. That is the \nmeans. We are going to pursue a regime change. That is an interesting \nphrase. That is a euphemism for attacking Iraq, killing or capturing \nSaddam Hussein and his cadre of leaders, and replacing them with the \nleadership of our choice. There are some potential problems with \npursuing that particular means to deal with these weapons of mass \ndestruction. Let me just mention a few of those problems which have \nbeen discussed by others but need to be discussed even more.\n  One is what is the precedent we are setting? This is not a normal \ncourse for our country to pursue, attacking and invading another \ncountry without some imminent threat being demonstrated.\n  Second, the implications: What are the implications of such action \nfor our relations with other Arab countries?\n  Third, what is the cost to us in resources? One figure we heard from \nthe administration was $100 billion. What is the cost? What is the cost \nin American lives we must anticipate?\n  The question is, who would constitute the successor government if we \nare going to displace this government and put in place a government \nmore to our liking; who would that be?\n  The questions of how large and how prolonged a commitment do the \nAmerican people want to make to the rebuilding of Iraq, to bringing \nreforms to Iraq, the effect of such an attack on world oil markets and \nthe price of oil, the spikes in the price of oil that might occur and \nwhat that might do to our own economy, are legitimate.\n  They are questions people in my State are concerned about and they \nare questions we need to have fully considered in Washington.\n  We need to look at other possible means besides just the simple \napproach of regime change. One set of ideas that has been put forward \nrecently, that I think deserves attention and I want to just call it to \nthe attention of my colleagues today, is a paper prepared by Jessica \nMathews, President of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \nentitled, ``A New Approach, Coercive Inspections.''\n  This is a serious proposal and one that deserves serious attention. \nEssentially, the idea is that if our primary goal is to deal with \nweapons of mass destruction and the threat that those weapons pose when \nheld by Iraq, then we need to consider, perhaps, a middle ground \nbetween the unacceptable status quo, which none of us like, and this \nidea of full-scale invasion of Iraq in order to change the regime. It \nproposes a third approach. It proposes a new regime of coercive \ninternational inspections where we would have a multinational military \nforce created by the Security Council, which we would participate in, \nand which would be there to ensure that inspections take place as the \nU.N. has indicated they would. There would be several advantages if we \nwere able to pursue that kind of option.\n  It would have the advantage of assuring our allies that we want to \nwork with them and not go it alone. It would assure the world that our \npriority is what we say it is, and that is eliminating the threat of \nweapons of mass destruction, not just evening old scores with Saddam \nHussein. It avoids military conflict, if the goal of weapons inspection \nand weapons destruction can be achieved without military conflict. It \nreserves the option of force being used.\n\n  Frankly, pursuing a course such as this on Iraq would allow us to \ntone down the saber rattling, to calm anxieties here at home and in the \nworld community. I think there is a great benefit that can be achieved \nfrom that, not only in our relations with our allies but I believe the \neconomy also would benefit from believing we are pursuing a more \nmeasured course such as is described in this paper.\n  This is not the only proposal for how we should proceed. Maybe it is \nnot the best, but it is certainly a serious proposal and one we should \nconsider before we rush to authorize the President to use any and all \nforce to bring justice and peace to that region of the world.\n  In conclusion, people in my State want to know what is going to \nhappen on the economy, what this Government is going to do to help them \npursue a\n\n[[Page S9357]]\n\nbetter life and have greater economic opportunity in the future. They \nalso, with regard to Iraq, expect us to think before we act. They \nhope--I hope--this President and this administration are not so \ncommitted to a single course of action that serious discussion and \nserious consideration of proposals such as this are precluded.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time and I yield the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent the paper to which I referred be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The papers in this collection grew out of discussions held \n     at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace from late \n     April to late July of this year. The discussions included top \n     regional and military experts, former inspectors with dozens \n     of man-years' experience in Iraq, and individuals with \n     intimate knowledge of the diplomatic situation at the United \n     Nations.\n\n                  A New Approach: Coercive Inspections\n\n      (By Jessica T. Matthews, President, Carnegie Endowment for \n                          International Peace)\n\n       The summary proposal that follows draws heavily on the \n     expertise of all those who participated in the Carnegie \n     discussions on Iraq and on the individually authored papers. \n     Further explanation and greater detail on virtually every \n     point, especially the proposal's military aspects, can be \n     found therein.\n       With rising emphasis in recent months, the president has \n     made clear that the United States' number one concern in Iraq \n     is its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). No link \n     has yet been found between Baghdad's assertively secular \n     regime and radical Islamist terrorists. There is much else \n     about the Iraqi government that is fiercely objectionable but \n     nothing that presents an imminent threat to the region, the \n     United States, or the world. Thus, the United States' primary \n     goal is, and should be, to deal with the WMD threat.\n       In light of what is now a four-year-long absence of \n     international inspectors from the country, it has been widely \n     assumed that the United States has only two options regarding \n     that threat: continue to do nothing to find and destroy \n     Iraq's nuclear, chemical, biological, and missile programs, \n     or pursue covert action or a full-scale military operation to \n     overthrow Saddam Hussein. At best, the latter would be a \n     unilateral initiative with grudging partners.\n       This paper proposes a third approach, a middle ground \n     between an unacceptable status quo that allows Iraqi WMD \n     programs to continue and the enormous costs and risks of an \n     invasion. It proposes a new regime of coercive international \n     inspections. A powerful, multinational military force, \n     created by the UN Security Council, would enable UN and \n     International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection teams to \n     carry out ``comply or else'' inspections. The ``or else'' is \n     overthrow of the regime. The burden of choosing war is placed \n     squarely on Saddam Hussein. The middle-ground option is a \n     radical change from the earlier international inspection \n     effort in which the playing field was tilted steeply in \n     Iraq's favor. It requires a military commitment sufficient to \n     pose a credible threat to Iraq and would take a vigorous \n     diplomatic initiative on Washington's part to launch. Long-\n     term success would require sustained unity of purpose among \n     the major powers. These difficulties make this approach \n     attractive only in comparison to the alternatives, but in \n     that light, its virtues emerge sharply.\n       Inspections backed by a force authorized by the UN Security \n     Council would carry unimpeachable legitimacy and command \n     broad international support. The effort would therefore \n     strengthen, rather than undermine, the cooperation the United \n     States needs for long-term success in the war against \n     terrorism. It would avoid setting a dangerous precedent of a \n     unilateral right to attack in ``preventive self-defense.'' \n     Although not likely to be welcomed by Iraq's neighbors, it \n     would be their clear choice over war. Regional assistance \n     (basing, over-flight rights, and so on) should therefore be \n     more forthcoming. If successful, it would reduce Iraq's WMD \n     threat to negligible levels. If a failure, it would lay an \n     operational and political basis for a transition to a war \n     to oust Saddam. The United States would be seen to have \n     worked through the United Nations with the rest of the \n     world rather than alone, and Iraq's intent would have been \n     cleanly tested and found wanting. Baghdad would be \n     isolated. In these circumstances, the risks to the region \n     of a war to overthrow Iraq's government-from domestic \n     pressure on shaky governments (Pakistan) to government \n     misreading U.S. intentions (Iran) to heightened Arab and \n     Islamic anger toward the United States-would be sharply \n     diminished.\n       Compared to a war aimed at regime change, the approach \n     greatly reduces the risk of Saddam's using whatever WMD he \n     has (probably against Israel) while a force aimed at his \n     destruction is being assembled. On the political front, \n     coercive inspections avoid the looming question of what \n     regime would replace the current government. It would also \n     avoid the risks of persistent instability in Iraq, its \n     possible disintegration into Shia, Suni, and Kurdish regions, \n     and the need to station tens of thousands of U.S. troops in \n     the country for what could be a very long time.\n       A year ago, the approach would have been impossible. Since \n     then, however, four factors have combined to make it \n     achievable: Greatly increased concern about WMD in the wake \n     of September 11; Iraq's continued lies and intransigence even \n     after major reform of the UN sanctions regime; Russia's \n     embrace of the United States after the September 11 attacks, \n     and the Bush administration's threats of unilateral military \n     action, which have opened a political space that did not \n     exist before.\n       Together, these changes have restored a consensus among the \n     Security Council's five permanent members (P-5) regarding the \n     need for action on Iraq's WMD that has not existed for the \n     past five years.\n\n\n                             core premises\n\n       Several key premises underlie the new approach.\n       Inspections can work. In their first five years, the United \n     Nations Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM), which was \n     responsible for inspecting and disarming Iraq's chemical, \n     biological, and missile materials and capacities, and the \n     IAEA Iraq Action Team, which did the same for Iraq's nuclear \n     ones, achieved substantial successes. With sufficient human \n     and technological resources, time, and political support, \n     inspections can reduce Iraq's WMD threat, if not to zero, to \n     a negligible level. (The term inspections encompasses a \n     resumed discovery and disarmament phase and intrusive, \n     ongoing monitoring and verification extending to dual-use \n     facilities and the activities of key individuals.)\n       Saddam Hussein's overhelming priority is to stay in power. \n     He will wilingly give up pursuit of WMD, but he will do so if \n     convinced that the only alternative is his certain \n     destruction and that of his regime.\n       A credible and continuing military threat involving \n     substantial forces on Iraq's borders will be necessary both \n     to get the inspectors back into Iraq and to enable them to do \n     their job. The record from 1991 to the present makes clear \n     that Iraq views UN WMD inspections as war by other means. \n     There is no reason to expect this to change. Sanctions, \n     inducements, negotiations, or periodic air strikes will \n     not suffice to restore effective inspection. Negotiations \n     in the present circumstances only serve Baghdad's goals of \n     delay and diversion.\n       The UNSOM/IAEA successes also critically depended on unity \n     of purpose within the UN Security Council. No amount of \n     military force will be effective without unwavering political \n     resolve behind it. Effective inspections cannot be \n     reestablished until a way forward is found that the manor \n     powers and key regional states can support under the UN \n     Charter.\n\n\n                    negotiating coercive inspections\n\n       From roughly 1997 until recently, determined Iraqi \n     diplomacy succeeded in dividing the P-5. Today, principally \n     due to Iraq's behavior, Russia's new geopolitical stance, and \n     U.S.-led reform of the sanctions regime, a limited consensus \n     has reemerged. There is now agreement that Iraq has not met \n     its obligations under UN Resolution 687 (which created the \n     inspections regime) and that there is a need for the return \n     of inspectors to Iraq. There is also support behind the new, \n     yet-to-be tested inspection team known as the UN Monitoring, \n     Verification, and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC, created in \n     December 1999 under Resolution 1284). Because three members \n     of the P-5 abstained on the vote to create UNMOVIC, this \n     development is particularly noteworthy. The May 2002 adoption \n     of a revised sanctions plan was further evidence of a still \n     fragile but real and evolving convergence of view on the \n     Security Council.\n       Perhaps paradoxically, U.S. threats to act unilaterally \n     against Iraq have the potential to strengthen this limited \n     consensus. France, Russia, and China strongly share the view \n     that only the Security Council can authorize the use of a \n     force--a view to which Great Britain is also sympathetic. All \n     four know that after eleven years of the United Nations' \n     handling of the issue, a U.S. decision to act unilaterally \n     against Iraq would be a tremendous blow to the authority of \n     the institution and the Security Council in particular. They \n     want to avoid any further marginalization of the Council \n     since that would translate into a diminution of their \n     individual influence. Thus, U.S. threats provide these four \n     countries with a shared interest in finding a formula for the \n     use of force against Iraq that would be effective, acceptable \n     to the United States, and able to be authorized by the \n     Council as a whole. That formula could be found in a \n     resolution authorizing multinational enforcement action to \n     enable UNMOVIC to carry out its mandate.\n       Achieving such an outcome would require a tremendous \n     diplomatic effort on Washington's part. That, however, should \n     to be a seen as a serious deterrent. Achieving desired \n     outcomes without resort to war is, in the first instance, \n     what power is for. Launching the middle-ground approach would \n     amount, in effect, to Washington and the rest of the P-5 re-\n     seizing the diplomatic initiative from Baghdad.\n       The critical element will be that the United States makes \n     clear that it forswears unilateral military action against \n     Iraq for as long as international inspections are working. \n     The United States would have to convince Iraq and others that \n     this is not a perfunctory bow to international opinion \n     preparatory to an invasion and that the United States' intent \n     is to see inspections succeed, not a ruse to have them \n     quickly fail. If Iraq\n\n[[Page S9358]]\n\n     is not convinced, it would have no reason to comply; indeed, \n     quite the reverse because Baghdad would need whatever WMD it \n     has to deter or fight with a U.S. attack. Given the past \n     history, many countries will be deeply skeptical. To succeed, \n     Washington will have to be steady, unequivocal, and \n     unambiguous on this point.\n       This does not mean that Washington need alter its \n     declaratory policy favoring regime change in Iraq. Its stance \n     would be that the United States continues to support regime \n     change but will not take action to force it while Iraq is in \n     full compliance with international inspections. There would \n     be nothing unusual in such a position. The United States has, \n     for example, had a declaratory policy for regime change in \n     Cuba for more than forty years.\n       Beyond the Security Council, U.S. diplomacy will need to \n     recognize the significant differences in strategic interests \n     among the states in the region. Some want a strong Iraq to \n     offset Iran. Others fear a prosperous, pro-West Iraq \n     producing oil to its full potential. Many fear and oppose \n     U.S. military dominance in the region. Virtually all, \n     however, agree that Iraq should be free of WMD, and they \n     universally fear the instability that is likely to accompany \n     a violent overthrow of the Iraqi government.\n       Moreover, notwithstanding the substantial U.S. presence \n     required for enforced inspections and what will be widely \n     felt to be an unfair double standard (acting against Iraq's \n     WMD but not against Israel's), public opinion throughout the \n     region would certainly be less aroused by multlaellateral \n     inspections than by a unilateral U.S. invasion.\n       Thus, if faced with a choice between a war to achieve \n     regime change and an armed, multilateral effort to eradicate \n     Iraq's WMD, all the region's governments are likely to share \n     a clear preference for the latter.\n\n\n                   implementing coercive inspections\n\n       Under the coercive inspections plan, the Security Council \n     would authorize the creation of an Inspections Implementation \n     Force (IIF) to act as the enforcement arm for UNMOVIC and the \n     IAEA task force. Under the new resolution, the inspections \n     process is transformed from a game of cat and mouse \n     punctuated by diversions and manufactured crises, in which \n     conditions heavily favor Iraqi obstruction, into a last \n     chance, ``comply or else'' operation. The inspection teams \n     would return to Iraq accompanied by a military arm strong \n     enough to force immediate entry into any site at any time \n     with complete security for the inspection team. No terms \n     would be negotiated regarding the dates, duration, or \n     modalities of inspection. If Iraq chose not to accept, or \n     established a record of noncompliance, the U.S. regime-change \n     option or, better, a UN authorization of ``use of all \n     necessary means'' would come into play.\n       Overall control is vested in the civilian executive \n     chairman of the inspection teams. He would determine what \n     sites will be inspected, without interference for the \n     Security Council, and whether military forces should \n     accompany any particular inspection. Some inspections--for \n     example, personnel interviews--may be better conducted \n     without any accompanying force; others will require maximum \n     insurance of prompt entry and protection. The size and \n     composition of the accompanying force would be the decision \n     of the IIF commander, and its employment would be under his \n     command.\n       The IIF must be strong and mobile enough to support full \n     inspection of any site, including socalled sensitive sites \n     and those previously designated as off limits. ``No-fly'' and \n     ``no-drive'' zones near to-be-inspected sites would be \n     imposed with minimal advance notice to Baghdad. Violations of \n     these bans would subject the opposing forces to attack. \n     Robust operational and communications security would allow \n     surprise inspections. In the event surprise fails \n     and ``spontaneous'' gatherings of civilians attempt to \n     impede inspections, rapid response riot control units must \n     be available.\n       The IIF must be highly mobile, composed principally of air \n     and armored cavalry units. It might include an armored \n     cavalry regiment or equivalent on the Jordan-Iraq border, an \n     air-mobile brigade in eastern Turkey, and two or more \n     brigades and corps-sized infrastructure based in Saudi Arabia \n     and Kuwait. Air support including fighter and fighterbomber \n     aircraft and continuous air and ground surveillance, provided \n     by AWACS and JSTARS, will be required. The IIF must have a \n     highly sophisticated intelligence capability. Iraq has become \n     quite experienced in concealment and in its ability to \n     penetrate and mislead inspection teams. It has had four \n     unimpeded years to construct new underground sites, build \n     mobile facilities, alter records, and so on. To overcome that \n     advantage and ensure military success, the force must be \n     equipped with the full range of reconnaissance, surveillance, \n     listening, encryption, and photo interpretation capabilities.\n       The bulk of the force will be U.S. For critical political \n     reasons, however, the IIF must be as multinational as \n     possible and as small as practicable. Its design and \n     composition should strive to make clear that the IIF is not a \n     U.S. invasion force in disguise, but a UN enforcement force. \n     Optimally, it would include, at a minimum, elements from all \n     of the P-5, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, as well as \n     others in the region.\n       Consistent with the IIF's mandate and UN origin, Washington \n     will have to rigorously resist the temptation to use the \n     force's access and the information it collects for purposes \n     unrelated to its job. Nothing will more quickly sow division \n     within the Security Council than excesses in this regard.\n       Operationally, on the civilian front, experts disagree as \n     to whether UNMOVIC's mandate contains disabling weaknesses. \n     Although some provisions could certainly be improved, it \n     would be unwise to attempt to renegotiate Resolution 1284. \n     Some of its weaknesses can be overcome in practice by tacit \n     agreement (some have already been), some will be met by the \n     vastly greater technological capabilities conferred by the \n     IIF, and some can be corrected through the language of the \n     IIF resolution. Four factors are critical:\n       Adequate time. The inspection process must not be placed \n     under any arbitrary deadline because that would provide \n     Baghdad with an enormous incentive for delay. It is in \n     everyone's interest to complete the disarmament phase of the \n     job as quickly as possible, but timelines cannot be fixed in \n     advance.\n       Experienced personnel. UNMOVIC must not be forced to climb \n     a learning curve as UNSCOM did but must be ready to operate \n     with maximum effectiveness from the outset. To do so, it must \n     be able to take full advantage of individuals with \n     irreplaceable, on-the-ground experience.\n       Provision for two-way intelligence sharing with national \n     governments. UNSCOM experience proves that provision for \n     intelligence sharing with national governments is \n     indispensable. Inspectors need must information not available \n     from open sources or commercial satellites and prompt, direct \n     access to defectors. For their part, intelligence agencies \n     will not provide a flow of information without feedback on \n     its value and accuracy. It must be accepted by all \n     governments that such interactions are necessary and that the \n     dialogue between providers and users would be on a strictly \n     confidential, bilateral basis, protected from other \n     governemnts. The individual in charge of information \n     collection and assessment on the inspection team should \n     have an intelligence background and command the trust of \n     those governments that provide the bulk of the \n     intelligence.\n       Ability to track Iraqi procurement activities outside the \n     country. UNSCOM discovered covert transactions between Iraq \n     and more than 500 companies from more than 40 countries \n     between 1993 and 1998. Successful inspections would \n     absolutely depend, therefore, on the team's authority to \n     track procurement efforts both inside and outside Iraq, \n     including at Iraqi embassies abroad. Accordingly, UNMOVIC \n     should include a staff of specially trained customs experts, \n     and inspections would need to include relevant ministries, \n     commercial banks, and trading companies. As with military \n     intelligence, tracking Iraqi procurement must not be used to \n     collect unrelated commercial and technical intelligence or \n     impede legal trade.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       War should never be undertaken until the alternatives have \n     been exhausted. In this case that moral imperative is \n     buttressed by the very real possibility that a war to \n     overthrow Saddam Hussein, even if successful in doing so, \n     could subtract more from U.S. security and long-term \n     political interests that it adds.\n       Political chaos in Iraq or an equally bad successor regime \n     committed to WMD to prevent an invasion from ever happening \n     again, possibly horrible costs to Israel, greater enmity \n     toward the United States among Arab and other Muslim publics, \n     a severe blow to the authority of the United Nations and the \n     Security Council, and a giant step by the United States \n     toward-in Zbigniew Brzezinski's phrase-political self-\n     isolation are just some of the costs, in addition to \n     potentially severe economic impacts and the loss of American \n     and innocent Iraqi lives, that must be weighed.\n       In this case alternative does exist. It blends the \n     imperative for military threat against a regime that has \n     learned how to divide and conquer the major powers with the \n     legitimacy of UN sanction and multilateral action. \n     Technically and operationally, it is less demanding than a \n     war. Diplomatically, it requires a much greater effort for a \n     greater gain. The message of an unswerving international \n     determination to halt WMD proliferation will be heard far \n     beyond Iraq. The only real question is can the major powers \n     see their mutual interest, act together, and stay the course? \n     Who is more determined--Iraq or the P-5?\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am fortunate to represent a State whose \ncitizens have long been involved in international affairs. Whether \nthrough military or diplomatic service, volunteering for the Peace \nCorps, studying abroad, or because we live on a great international \nborder, Vermonters have strong views about these issues.\n  I was in Vermont this past weekend, and as always I had the \nopportunity to speak to many Vermonters from all walks of life. I can \nsay, beyond any doubt, that Vermonters across the political spectrum \nare very concerned about our policy toward Iraq.\n  They are worried that we are shifting our focus away from ending the \nviolence in the Middle East, eliminating\n\n[[Page S9359]]\n\nal-Qaida, and rebuilding Afghanistan even though that Herculean task \nhas barely begun.\n  The President has sent to Congress a proposed resolution for the use \nof military force against Iraq. It would permit the President to take \nany action whatsoever to ``defend the national security interests of \nthe United States against the threat posed by Iraq, and restore \ninternational peace and security in the region.''\n  While I hope this is the beginning of a consultative, bipartisan \nprocess to produce a sensible resolution and to act on it at the \nappropriate time, the current proposal is an extraordinarily over-\nbroad, open-ended resolution that would authorize the President to send \nAmerican troops not only into war against Iraq, but also against any \nnation in the Gulf or Middle East region, however one defines it.\n  Declaring war, or providing the authority to wage war, is the single \nmost important responsibility given to Congress under the Constitution. \nAs history has shown, wars inevitably have unforeseen, terrible \nconsequences, especially for innocent civilians.\n  Blank-check resolutions, such as the one the President proposes, can \nlikewise be misinterpreted or used in ways that we do not intend or \nexpect. It has happened before, in ways that many people, including \nMembers of Congress, came to regret. That is why a thorough debate is \nso necessary. And that is also why this Vermonter will not vote for a \nblank check for this President or any President. My conscience and the \nConstitution do not allow it.\n  The timing of the debate is also important. Congress is being asked \nto send Americans into battle, even though diplomatic efforts have not \nyet been exhausted. Nor do we have a complete assessment by U.S. \nintelligence agencies of the threat that Iraq poses to the United \nStates.\n  I will have more to say when the debate on the resolution occurs. But \nI do want to take a few minutes to share some initial thoughts as we \nbegin to consider this difficult question.\n  The question we face is not whether Saddam Hussein is a menace to his \npeople, to his neighbors and to our national security interests. The \nIraqi regime has already invaded Iran and Kuwait, gassed members of its \nown population, and repeatedly flouted international conventions \nagainst armed aggression. It is clear that Iraq has tried to develop a \nrange of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical, and \nbiological weapons, with which Iraq might threaten the entire Gulf \nregion.\n  I would like to see Saddam Hussein gone as much as anyone. But the \nquestion is, how immediate is this threat and what is the best way to \ndeal with it, without undercutting our principal goal of protecting the \nAmerican people from terrorism, promoting peace in the Middle East, and \nother important U.S. national security priorities?\n  Some administration officials have suggested that to ask questions \nabout going to war in Iraq is somehow unpatriotic, or indicative of a \nlack of concern about national security. That is nothing more than \nelection year partisan politics at its worst. These questions are being \nasked by Americans in every State of the Union.\n  Until recently our focus has been, rightly so, on destroying al-Qaida \nand other terrorist networks. While that challenge has already cost \nbillions of dollars and continues to occupy the attention and resources \nof the Department of Defense and the U.S. intelligence community, the \nadministration has suddenly shifted gears and is now rushing headlong \ntoward war with Iraq.\n  Some have argued that Congress must act now to strengthen the \nPresident's hand as the administration negotiates at the United \nNations.\n\n  But what we would really be saying is that regardless of what the \nSecurity Council does, we have already decided to go our own way. I \ncontrast that with the situation in 1990 when the United States \nsuccessfully assembled a broad international coalition to fight the \nGulf War. The Congress passed a resolution only after the U.N. acted.\n  President Bush deserves credit for focusing the world's attention on \ninternational terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. I have said \nthis over and over again. But the process that has brought us to the \nbrink of preparing for war with Iraq has been notable for its \nconfusion.\n  The statements of administration officials have been fraught with \ninconsistencies. They claim to speak for the American people, but \naverage Americans are urging the administration to proceed cautiously \non Iraq and to work with the United Nations and the Congress. Our \nallies are confused and angry about the way this has been handled. Our \nfriends in the Middle East are fearful of what lies ahead.\n  Fortunately, the President heeded calls to go to the United Nations, \nand in his speech to the General Assembly he described in great detail \nSaddam Hussein's long history of deception and defiance of U.N. \nresolutions. I commended that speech. I am also pleased that it focused \non enforcing those resolutions, especially concerning weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  But the American people need to hear more than generalized \naccusations and threatening ultimatums. They need to know the scope and \nurgency of the problem, Saddam's current and future capabilities, the \noptions for solving the problem, and the short and long-term \nimplications of each course of action, including the very real dangers \nof unintended consequences.\n  I agree with the President when he says that Saddam Hussein cannot be \ntrusted and that disarming Iraq is the goal. But the first way to try \nto accomplish this is not through precipitous, unilateral military \naction. Rather, it is by building an alliance and working through the \nUnited Nations.\n  Earlier this week, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nGeneral John Shalikashvili, warned the administration of the dangers of \nattacking Iraq without the backing of the United Nations:\n\n       We are a global nation with global interests, and \n     undermining the credibility of the United Nations does very \n     little to help provide stability and security and safety to \n     the rest of the world, where we have to operate for economic \n     reasons and political reasons.\n\n  Working through the United Nations to readmit the weapons inspectors \ncould be effective in disarming Iraq. Rolf Ekeus the former executive \nchairman of UNSCOM, has stated:\n\n       International weapons inspectors, if properly backed up by \n     international force, can unearth Saddam Hussein's weapons \n     programs. If we believe that Iraq would be much less of a \n     threat without such weapons, the obvious thing is to focus on \n     getting rid of the weapons. Doing that through an inspection \n     team is not only the most effective way, but would cost less \n     in lives and destruction than an invasion.\n\n  A study by the Carnegie Endowment, co-authored by former U.S. \nmilitary and United Nations officials, supports this view: ``With \nsufficient human and technological resources, time, and political \nsupport, inspections can reduce Iraq's [weapons of mass destruction] \nthreat, if not to zero, to a negligible level.''\n  There are distinct advantages to this approach. For one, if Iraq \nagain refuses to comply with U.N. demands, there will be a much \nstronger case for more forceful action.\n  It would also help mitigate potential damage to our relations with \nother nations whose support we need to achieve other important U.S. \ngoals, such as capturing terrorists or promoting peace in the Middle \nEast.\n  Diplomacy is often tedious. It does not usually make the headlines or \nthe evening news, and much has been made of our past diplomatic \nfailures. But history has shown over and over that diplomacy can not \nonly protect our national interests, it can also enhance the \neffectiveness of military force when force becomes necessary.\n  Many experts believe that, despite deception by the Iraqis, the U.N. \ninspection process destroyed much of the Iraqi weapons program, and new \ninspections could succeed in substantially disarming Saddam. However, \nthe U.N. regime broke down when Saddam Hussein starting blocking the \ninspections and the Security Council was divided on how to respond.\n  I support the unconditional return of inspectors backed up by an \ninternational military force. But, the world must not repeat the \nmistakes of 1998. We have already seen some troubling signs of \ndiplomatic double talk from the Iraqis, particularly on the issue of \nunimpeded access for the inspectors. The international community cannot \ntolerate deception and defiance on the part of the Iraqis, and \nSecretary Powell is right to push for a new U.N. resolution.\n\n[[Page S9360]]\n\n  Other members of the Security Council should join United States and \nBritish efforts to craft a strong new resolution with a deadline for \nIraqi compliance. The U.N. has a responsibility to enforce its demands. \nIf the U.N. does not act to ensure that the inspection regime is \neffectively structured, we will end up back where we were in 1998. \nSaddam will play the same cat and mouse game, the U.N. will look \ntoothless, and we will be not be able to destroy the Iraqi weapons \nprogram.\n  We need a strengthened inspection regime that has preexisting \nauthority from the Security Council to deploy military force to back up \nthe inspectors if there is resistance from Iraq. I hope that the \nAdministration works with the United Nations, not so much the other way \naround, to make this happen.\n  If Iraq resists the inspections, and the President decides to use \nmilitary force, then the procedure is clear. He can seek a declaration \nof war from the Congress, and the Congress can vote. But voting on such \na resolution at this time would be premature.\n\n  A decision to invade Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein should be based on \na complete assessment of Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, \nand the threat Iraq poses to the United States. What is the evidence--\nas opposed to assertions and assumptions--that Iraq is close to \nacquiring a nuclear weapon? What is the evidence that Iraq is capable \nof launching, or has any intention of launching, an attack against us \nor one of our allies?\n  And there are more questions that are as yet unanswered. What is the \nevidence that Saddam Hussein wants to commit suicide, which such an \nattack would guarantee? Why is containment, a strategy which kept the \nSoviet Union with its thousands of nuclear warheads and chemical and \nbiological weapons at bay for 40 years, not valid for Saddam Hussein, a \ncold, calculating tyrant who cares above all about staying in power?\n  I am not sure how these questions can be answered without an updated \nNational Intelligence Estimate. As the Washington Post has reported, \nthere are conflicting views within the intelligence community on Iraq, \nand without this estimate, which pulls together the different \nassessments by various parts of the intelligence community, Congress is \nbeing asked to give a blank check without all of the facts. I am not \ngoing to write a blank check under any circumstances and I am certainly \nnot going to do it with less than all of the facts.\n  We also must assess whether an attack could spin out of control and \ndraw the entire Middle East into war. As Secretary Rumsfeld \nacknowledged, an Iraqi attack on Israel could spark a deadly spiral of \nescalation in which Israeli retaliation prompts responses from other \nArab states. Israel has a right of self-defense, and Prime Minister \nSharon has said that Israel would retaliate. At the very least, it \nwould further inflame Arab populations whose governments are key to \nbringing lasting peace to the Middle East and reducing the breeding \ngrounds for extremist Islamic fundamentalism and international \nterrorism. Some of those breeding grounds are within the borders of \nsome of our closest friends in the region and we should not lose sight \nof that.\n  We also must fully assess the costs of a war. The Gulf War cost tens \nof billions of dollars, but ultimately other nations helped to defray \nthose costs. The President's Economic Adviser said that this war could \ncost as much as two hundred billion dollars, and that assumes it does \nnot spread beyond Iraq.\n  As the combat in Afghanistan showed, once again, we have the finest \nfighting forces in the world. We can be confident that we would win a \nwar with Iraq, but there would be American lives lost, especially if \nIraq lures U.S. troops into urban combat.\n  We have to remember that it is one thing to topple a regime, but it \nis equally important, and sometimes far more difficult, to rebuild a \ncountry to prevent it from becoming engulfed by factional fighting. If \nthese nations cannot successfully rebuild, then they will once again \nbecome havens for terrorists.\n  The President would need to show that a post-Saddam Iraq would not be \na continual source of instability and conflict in the region. While \nIraq has a strong civil society that might be able to become a \ndemocracy, in the chaos of a post-Saddam Iraq another dictator could \nrise to the top or the country could splinter into ethnic or religious \nconflict.\n  To ensure that this does not happen, does the administration foresee \nbasing thousands of U.S. troops in Iraq after the war, and if so, for \nhow many years and for how many billions of dollars at a time when the \nU.S. economy is weakening, the Federal deficit is growing, and poverty \nis increasing here at home?\n  Is the administration committed to investing the resources it is \ngoing to take to rebuild Iraq, even when we are falling short of what \nis needed in Afghanistan?\n  In Afghanistan, the Taliban was vanquished with a minimum of U.S. \ncasualties, but destroying al-Qaida, which is the primary goal of our \nefforts in Afghanistan, is proving far more difficult. We are told that \nwhile al-Qaida's leadership has been badly disrupted, its members have \ndispersed widely. Although there is a growing belief that Osama bin \nLaden is dead, we have no proof.\n  In addition, the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan is critical. \nThere are thousands of homeless Afghans and a real threat of widespread \nhunger or famine this winter. There are families who lost loved ones or \ntheir homes were destroyed in the violence perpetrated by the Taliban, \nyears of civil war, or from mistakes made during military operations by \nU.S. and coalition forces.\n  Yet the administration, despite calls by President Bush for a \nMarshall plan, did not ask for a single cent for Afghanistan for fiscal \nyear 2003. In addition, $94 million for humanitarian, refugee, and \nreconstruction assistance to Afghanistan, which Congress added in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill, was not deemed an emergency by the \nPresident.\n  Some relief organizations have already been told that they may have \nto shut down programs for lack of funds. This is happening in a country \nthat so desperately needs the most basic staples such as water, \neducation and medical help. Afghans who have returned to their homes \nfrom outside the country may become refugees once again.\n  Many other nations have yet to fulfill pledges of assistance to \nAfghanistan, but if the President is serious about a Marshall Plan, and \nI believe he is right, then we need to do much more to help rebuild \nthat country.\n  Yet, as we continue to face difficult challenges in Afghanistan and \nhunting down members of al-Qaida, not to mention a number of challenges \nhere at home such as the economy, we are suddenly being thrust into a \ndebate about Iraq. It is a debate that will have lasting consequences \nfor our standing in the world as a country that recognizes the \nimportance of multilateral solutions to global problems and that \nrespects international law.\n  General Wesley Clark, who headed the successful U.S. and NATO \nmilitary campaign in Kosovo, recently addressed this problem directly, \nwhen he wrote:\n\n       The longer this war [on terrorism] goes on--and by all \n     accounts, it will go on for years--the more our success will \n     depend on the willing cooperation and active participation of \n     our allies to root out terrorist cells in Europe and Asia, to \n     cut off funding and support of terrorists and to deal with \n     Saddam Hussein and other threats. We are far more likely to \n     gain the support we need by working through international \n     institutions than outside of them.\n\n  The world cannot ignore Saddam Hussein. I can envision circumstances \nwhich would cause me to support the use of force against Iraq, if we \ncannot obtain unimpeded access for U.N. inspectors or the United States \nis threatened with imminent harm.\n  But like many Vermonters, based on what I know today, I believe that \nin order to solve this problem without potentially creating more \nenemies over the long run, we must act deliberately, not precipitously.\n  The President has taken the first step, by seeking support from the \nUnited Nations. Let us give that process time. If it fails, then we can \ncross that bridge when we come to it.\n  But I am reminded of my first year as a U.S. Senator. The year was \n1975, and there were still 60 or 70 Senators here who had voted for the \nTonkin Gulf resolution a decade earlier. That vote was 88-2, and many \nof those Senators,\n\n[[Page S9361]]\n\nDemocrats and Republicans, spoke of that vote as the greatest mistake \nof their careers.\n  That resolution was adopted hastily after reports of a minor incident \nwhich may, in fact, not have occurred at all. It was interpreted by \nboth the Johnson and Nixon administrations as carte blanche to wage war \nin Vietnam for over a decade, ultimately involving over half a million \nAmerican troops and resulting in the deaths of over 58,000 Americans.\n  I am not suggesting that the administration is trying to deceive \nCongress or the American people, and I recognize that the situation in \nIraq today is very different from Vietnam in 1964. But we learned some \npainful and important lessons back then. And one that is as relevant \ntoday as it was 38 years ago, is that the Senate should never give up \nits constitutional rights, responsibilities, and authority to the \nexecutive branch. It should never shrink from its Constitutional \nresponsibilities, especially when the lives of American servicemen and \nwomen are at stake.\n  So when we consider the resolution on Iraq, I hope we will remember \nthose lessons, because under no circumstances should the Congress pass \na blank check and let the administration fill in the amount later. The \nConstitution does not allow that, and I will not do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nSouth Dakota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/26/senate-section/article/S9361-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9361-S9364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to state my intention to \nvote in favor of a resolution to authorize the use of military force \nagainst Iraq. At this point, final resolution language is begin arrived \nat, and I believe this effort will lead to a resolution which will gain \nbroad, bipartisan support. I support the President, and as a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee, look forward to working with him to \nensure that our Armed Forces remain the best-equipped, best-trained \nfighting force in the world.\n  Simply put, the world would be a far safer place without Saddam \nHussein. As long as he remains in power in Iraq, he will be a threat to \nthe United States, to his neighbors, and to his own people. Over the \npast decade, he has systematically reneged on his commitments to the \ninternational community. He has refused to halt his weapons of mass \ndestruction program, to renounce his support for international \nterrorism, and to stop threatening peace and stability in the region. \nThe threat that Saddam Hussein continues to pose to our national \nsecurity interests, and his failure to abide by previous United \nNation's Security Council resolutions, provides sufficient \njustification should military action become necessary.\n  I am pleased that President Bush has come to the Congress to ask for \nauthorization for the use of force in Iraq, and that the White House is \ncontinuing to work with us to develop the appropriate language for a \ncongressional resolution. It is important for the people's \nrepresentatives in Congress to have the opportunity to fully debate and \nvote on a matter of this importance. I hope we will move to this vote \nin an expeditious manner.\n  In addition, I back the administration's efforts to build support for \nour policy in Iraq with our allies and with the international community \nas a whole. Secretary of State Colin Powell has been particularly \neffective in making the case that Iraq has not complied with the \nrelevant Security Council resolutions and that he remains a threat. \nMake no mistake, I believe the United States is within its rights to \nact alone militarily to protect our vital national security interests. \nI we are required by circumstances to act alone, I will support that \ndecision. U.S. action should not be contingent upon the decisions made \nby other nations or organizations. My expectation, however, is that \nthis resolution will strengthen the hand of the President at securing \nUnited Nations or other forms of international support and cooperation, \nand I encourage his on-going effort in that regard.\n  I believe that there is value in building an international coalition \nof nations and in having the full support of our allies. International \nsupport brings practical benefits, such as basing rights for U.S. \nsoldiers and equipment in the region and authorization to use the \nairspace of neighboring countries to execute military strikes against \nIraq. In addition, international support will increase the likelihood \nof success for our long-term strategy in Iraq and for the ongoing war \non global terrorism. I encourage the President to continue his efforts \nto build a strong coalition of nations to support our Iraq policy.\n  Mr. President, this issue has particular significance for me--my son \nBrooks is on active duty in the Army and is a member of one of the \nthree units that General Franks has identified as likely to prosecute \nthis war. There is a strong possibility that I may be voting to send my \nown son into combat, and that give me special empathy for the families \nof other American servicemen and women whose own sons and daughters may \nalso be sent to Iraq. Nevertheless, I am willing to cast this vote--one \nof the most important in my career both as a Senator and certainly as a \nfather--because I recognize the threat that Saddam Hussein represents \nto world peace. It is my hope that we can move forward quickly, in a \nbipartisan manner, to approve a resolution that will give the President \nthe authority he needs to defend our Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Under the previous \norder, the Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is called the greatest deliberative \nbody in the world. I have always been enormously proud to be a part of \nit. There are times I think we treat the light too seriously and then \nthe serious too lightly, but in this time and place, the issue of \nnational security is something all of us understand is serious.\n  This is a deadly serious business. The question of war with Iraq, the \nquestion of homeland security, are very important issues. I know there \nwas some controversy yesterday beginning with stories in the newspaper \nand in the Senate Chamber about statements by the President.\n  I don't think there is a context in which it is ever appropriate for \nus to suggest or the President to suggest the opposing political party \nor members of the opposing political party do not support this \ncountry's national security. You will never, ever, hear me suggest a \ngroup of my colleagues don't care about this country's national \nsecurity. I will never do that. It is not the appropriate thing to do.\n  When you read the President's statements at fundraisers about these \nmatters and hear his suggestion, no matter the context, that the U.S. \nSenate doesn't seem to care about national security, or places special \ninterests ahead of the Nation's interests with respect to security, \nthat is wrong.\n  National security is deadly serious business. The issue has to do \nwith the country of Iraq, but much more than that--a very troubled \nregion of the world--the question of whether a tyrant, an international \noutlaw of sorts, is going to acquire nuclear weapons and threaten his \nregion and the rest of the world, and what we might be considering \ndoing about that, what we should do about it, and what the United \nNations considers we should do about it. That is serious business.\n  Any discussion ever about sending our sons and daughters to war is \nserious business. It has no place in political fundraisers or in the \nnormal routine of American political partisan activity leading up to an \nelection.\n  Yesterday I attended a top secret briefing with Vice President Cheney \nat his invitation. I happen to think we are all on the same side. We \nhave a single relentless interest, and that is the interests of this \ncountry and its security.\n  Yesterday it was said some of this dispute relates to the discussions \nabout homeland security and the position taken by some Members of the \nSenate with respect to homeland security. There is no right or wrong \nway to do homeland security. There are a lot of ideas on how one might \naddress homeland security.\n  I happen to believe port security is very important. We have 5.7 \nmillion containers coming in on container ships every single year; \n100,000 of them are inspected, and 5.6 million are not. If a terrorist \nwere to want to introduce a weapon of mass destruction into this \ncountry, do you think they would not consider putting it in a container \non a ship that is going to come up to a dock\n\n[[Page S9362]]\n\nat 2 miles an hour and dock at one of our major ports, to be taken off \nand put on 18 wheels, driven across the country to its target?\n  No, we will spend $7 or $8 billion this year believing a rogue nation \nor terrorist will acquire an intercontinental ballistic missile, put a \nnuclear bomb on top of it; so we will spend $7 to $8 billion on \nnational missile defense. Is that the smart thing to do, at a time when \n5.6 million containers will show up at our docks and are uninspected? \nThat is a decision this Congress ought to take a hard look at.\n  We have differences on the homeland security bill. It is not that one \nside believes in supporting this country's defense and this country's \nsecurity and the other side doesn't. There are differences about it. Is \nputting 170,000 people into one agency, moving all these boxes around \ninto one agency, is that going to make us better, more fit, more \ncapable of defeating terrorism? Maybe. But big, slow, and bureaucratic \nis not the way to address terrorism. These 170,000 people will not \ninclude the CIA and the FBI. Just read the papers in the last couple of \nmonths and ask yourself, where have the problems been in the gathering \nand the interpretation of intelligence and information about \nprospective terrorists? They are not even a part of this.\n\n  Some say if the President doesn't have flexibility to deal with all \nof these workers in any appropriate way he thinks necessary, somehow it \naffects our country's security. It is as if taking 170,000 workers and \nputting them into one agency and providing some basic security, the \nkind of basic security they have had with respect to jobs, is counter \nto this Nation's security. I don't believe that at all.\n  Go back 100 years and ask yourself what happens in a country such as \nours when you decide the Federal workforce shall become a part of \npatronage, Federal workers will have no security, but can be used at \nthe whim of an executive agency. I am not talking about this one; I am \ntalking about any executive agency or any administration. This country \nhas been best served by making sure we have a Federal workforce that we \ncan trust, that works hard, that is honest, that serves this country \nwell, and that doesn't serve any partisan interest ever.\n  Some say let's get rid of all the worker protections, that is the way \nto handle homeland security. That doesn't make any sense to me. There \nis not a Republican or a Democratic way to develop the issue of \nsecurity for this country. This is not about political parties. It is \nabout trying to figure out what is the best approach to protect this \ncountry's interests, what is the best approach to do that.\n  Those who want to use this politically do no service to this \ncountry's interest. It is not about politics. It is, indeed, about \nsecurity.\n  Let me make the next point. Yes, security with respect to people such \nas Saddam Hussein, and I hope at the end of the day we can find a way \nto pass a resolution in this Senate that has broad bipartisan support. \nI hope that is what happens. I believe that is what should happen. I \nhope at the end of the day we will have passed a homeland security bill \nthat works, one that is effective, one that gives us confidence about \ndefeating prospective terrorists and those prospective terrorists' acts \nagainst the American people.\n  Also, there is another issue with respect to security, and that is \nthe security of our country with respect to the economy and what is \nhappening inside our country. Take a look at the stock market these \ndays. The stock market has collapsed like a pancake. Why? Because \ninvestors are nervous. There is no predictability, consistency, \nsecurity. They are nervous.\n  We have had a circumstance in recent years where big budget surpluses \nthat were projected for 10 years have turned to big budget deficits. We \nhave had a recession. We have had a terrorist attack on our country \nthat was the worst terrorist attack in the history of our country. We \nhave had, in addition to that, a war against terrorists and a collapse \nof the technology bubble and a collapse of the stock market. We have \nhad a corporate scandal unparalleled in the history of this country. It \nshakes the faith of the American people in this economic system of \nours.\n  Even as we discuss all of these security issues, let's understand \nthere is one additional security issue, and that is the economic \nsecurity of the people in this country, an economy that, hopefully, \ngrows and provides opportunities and jobs once again. This economy is \nin trouble, and it would serve this President and this Congress well to \ndecide we ought to work together to do something about that as well.\n  More and more people are out of work. What does that mean? Is that a \nstatistic? No, it is not just a statistic; it is someone who comes home \nfrom work one day and says: Honey, I have lost my job, a man or woman \nwho is well trained and worked hard, and because the economy runs into \nsome whitewater rapids and some trouble, they are laid off. Hundreds of \nthousands of Americans are losing their jobs. It is a big problem.\n  For those who lose their jobs, their statistic is 100-percent \nunemployment. They wonder whether there are people around here who care \nabout that. Will there be people who care about economic security \nissues, trying to put the pieces back together in an economy that is \ntroubled?\n  We are told the average 401(k) retirement savings account has lost \nabout a third of its value. A North Dakotan who worked for the Enron \nCorporation for many years wrote to me and said: I had $330,000 in my \n401(k) account. It was my life savings--$330,000. It is now worth \n$1,700.\n  Do you think that family cares about whether we try to do something \nto fix what is wrong with this economy? That also deals with security--\neconomic security.\n  We have all across the central heartland of this Nation family \nfarmers, in my judgment the economic all-stars of America. They raise \nthe food that a hungry world so desperately needs. But a massive \ndrought has occurred across much of this country. Many of those farmers \nand ranchers have produced nothing.\n  In my home area of southwestern North Dakota, the landscape looks \nlike scorched earth. It looks like the moonscape, in fact, with no \nvegetation.\n\n  The question is: What about economic security for people who have \nsuffered a natural disaster of a drought? This Senate answered that. \nThe Senate said: Let's provide some emergency help, just as we do when \ntornadoes, earthquakes, fires, and floods happen. When these natural \ndisasters occur, this country says to people affected: You are not \nalone; we are here with you; we want to help. So this Senate, with 79 \nvotes, said: We want to help you; we want to help provide some economic \nsecurity during a tough time, during a disaster. The drought was not \nyour fault, we say to farmers and ranchers.\n  But the House of Representatives and the President do not support the \nbill we passed in the Senate that also deals with economic security.\n  Nobody in this Chamber has a farm someplace 15, 25 miles from town \nand has invested virtually everything they have in seeds to plant in \nthe ground in the spring and then discovered it did not rain and those \nseeds are gone, there is no crop, and they do not have the money for \nfamily expenses to continue, so they are going to have to have an \nauction sale. No one in this Chamber suffers that fate--no one.\n  No one in this Chamber gets up to do chores in the morning--milk \ncows, feed the cattle, service farm machinery. Nobody does that. But \nthis Chamber understands because 79 Members of the Senate voted for a \ndisaster package to help family farmers during this disaster.\n  We hope that when we have all of this talk about security, which I \nthink is deadly important and deadly serious--we hope security includes \na discussion about economic security, and part of that economic \nsecurity is providing a disaster bill and disaster help to family \nfarmers when they need it. I ask the House of Representatives and the \nPresident to stop blocking that disaster bill.\n  Another part of this issue of economic security is fixing what is \nwrong with respect to corporate governance in dealing with corporate \nscandals. We passed a bill in the Senate dealing with that, but it is \nnot quite enough. We must do more.\n  Senator Sarbanes, in my judgment, deserves the hero's award for being \nable to put together the bill he did. I\n\n[[Page S9363]]\n\nwas proud to vote for it. One amendment, to give an example of the \nunfinished business, I tried to offer and which was blocked for 3 or 4 \ndays by my colleague, Senator Gramm from Texas, dealt with bankruptcy. \nThat amendment is not now law. Let me give an example of what I was \ntrying to do and why it is unfinished business if we are really going \nto provide economic security.\n  The Financial Times did a study of the 25 largest bankruptcies in \nAmerica. Here is what they discovered: Of the 25 largest corporate \nbankruptcies in America, the year and a half before bankruptcy, 208 \nexecutives of those corporations took $3.3 billion out of the company. \nThen they went bankrupt.\n  My belief is, when executives are taking a company to bankruptcy and \nfilling their pockets with gold, there is something fundamentally \nwrong. Investors lose their savings, employees lose their jobs, \neverybody else loses their shirt, and the top executives of the largest \nbankrupt companies in the country walk away to their homes behind gated \nwalls someplace and count their money. They walked off with $3.3 \nbillion in the 25 largest bankruptcies. Shame on them.\n  I wanted to offer an amendment that recaptures and disgorges those \nill-gotten gains. Does anybody here believe that anybody, as they take \na company into bankruptcy, the year before it goes to bankruptcy should \nbe getting incentive payments and bonus payments for a company that is \ngoing down the tubes? Does anybody believe that? That is unfinished \nbusiness, and there are other pieces dealing with this corporate issue \nto which we must respond.\n\n  The other unfinished business deals with health care, for example, \nand prescription drugs. We have not passed a prescription drug bill and \nput a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare Program despite all of \nour best efforts. That also deals with economic security because when \nsomeone needs lifesaving medicine and cannot afford it, it means that \nmedicine saves no lives.\n  We have people in this country who desperately need prescription \ndrugs to provide the miracle cures and the opportunities for a better \nlife and cannot afford them. We believe putting a prescription drug \nbenefit in the Medicare Program is the right thing to do. No, not some \nshell, not some phony gimmick by saying, as the House did, just \ncobbling up a little effort: By the way, let's call this a prescription \ndrug benefit and let the managed care organizations handle it. That \ndoes not make any sense. They know it. We know it. They are just trying \nto create a defensive position to say they did something when, in fact, \nthey did nothing.\n  We are going to do something, and we should, with respect to \nprescription drugs for senior citizens. We ought to do it right and do \nit well. That is another piece of unfinished business that deals with \nsecurity--economic security and family security.\n  In Dickinson, ND, a woman went to her doctor with breast cancer and \nhad surgery for breast cancer, and the doctor said to the woman on \nMedicare: In order to prevent a recurrence of breast cancer, the best \nchance to prevent a recurrence, you need to take these prescription \ndrugs I am going to prescribe for you.\n  She said: Doctor, what does it cost? And he told her.\n  She said: Doctor, there is no way I can afford to buy those \nprescription drugs. I am just going to have to take my chances.\n\n  That is how the doctor testified at a forum I held at home in North \nDakota. That is why it is important to complete the undone business \ndealing with economic security, security for American seniors, to put a \nprescription drug benefit in the Medicare Program that really works. We \nhave not been able to do that because we are blocked by people who do \nnot want that to happen.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has served in the House of Representatives and \nnow in the Senate and understands, as well as anyone, the procedures \nthat take place in both bodies. We have been on homeland security for \nthe 4th week. I was told yesterday they had 30 people who wanted to \nspeak on this amendment. As I mentioned earlier this morning, that is a \ncode ward for ``filibuster.''\n  Is it not unusual that a President, who says he wants this bill so \nbadly, has not helped move the bill in 4 weeks, and now the majority \nleader has arranged a procedure where they can have a vote on the so-\ncalled Gramm amendment and they are not taking yes for an answer? Do \nyou think they are really serious about moving homeland security?\n  Mr. DORGAN. There is no evidence of that in the last 3 or 4 weeks. If \never you have seen an example of slow walking, this has been it.\n  We can, should, and will pass a homeland security bill. We are going \nto need help to do it. Those who say they want to pass this bill but \nhave their heels dug in and are preventing action by the Senate, in my \njudgment, are delaying the inevitable. We will pass homeland security \nbecause we should.\n  We have an amendment on which we ought to vote. We do not need 40 \nspeakers after 4 weeks. Have a vote on the amendment. That is the way \nto deal with this. I understand there are people who oppose the \namendment. The opposition comes from people who either want it their \nway or they do not want it at all. They think, If we cannot get our \nway, we do not want legislation to move.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I have learned a lot from the \nSenator from North Dakota on agricultural matters because the State of \nNorth Dakota depends heavily on its agricultural base for everything in \nthe State. As a result of that, I was 1 of 79 Senators who supported--\nbecause the case was made so clearly--farmers all over America who were \nin desperate need of help because of the drought that has struck the \ncountry. We have in the Interior appropriations bill, which is also \npart of what we have been doing for 4 weeks, a provision to give that \naid.\n  I ask the Senator, would it not be better to do that now than to have \nthis legislation hung up on how money will be distributed to fight \nfires?\n  Mr. DORGAN. There is an urgent need to get this bill completed. The \nInterior bill, as well, has been on the floor. For those who are \nlistening to this discussion, we are working on two issues \nsimultaneously. They call it dual tracking. We have homeland security \nand the Interior appropriations bill. Both have been on the floor for \nweeks.\n  With respect to the Interior bill, the 79 votes cast for the issue of \nproviding disaster aid for family farmers demonstrates the strong \nsupport of this Senate for doing that. Yet it is part of an Interior \nbill that is being held up.\n  There is an urgent need to get this done. We have family farmers, and \nthe families are sitting around their supper tables talking about their \nhopes and dreams, whether they are going to have to have an auction \nsale. Will they be able to make it? Or get through the winter? Or raise \ncattle in the spring? Or plant seed in the spring? They do not know. If \nwe provide disaster help, they will. If we do not, many will not make \nit.\n\n  I have been pleased, and will always be pleased as a Member of this \nbody, to support, in every circumstance, those around this country who \nsuffer disasters. When Florida is hit by a devastating hurricane, or \nCalifornia by a devastating earthquake, or a dozen other natural \ndisasters I could name, I am the first to say we ought to help. I \nalways want to vote for it. I always want our country to say to those \npeople affected by the disasters, you are not alone; the rest of the \ncountry is with you.\n  That is why I was so pleased with what the Senate did, by 79 votes, \nsaying we need a disaster bill to deal with the devastating drought. In \nsome areas it is as bad as it has been since the 1930s.\n  In answer to the question, there is urgent business in the Interior \nbill. We ought to get it done. Those who are blocking it ought to stop \nblocking it.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, because of the need to pass homeland security and \ncertainly this drought assistance, and we are spending so much \nunnecessary time on it, I have said this is an effort to divert \nattention from all the issues of the economy, and I have heard the \nSenator from North Dakota ask on many occasions: Why are we not doing \nsomething about passing appropriations bills? Why are we not doing \nsomething to stimulate the economy? Why are we not doing something with \nbankruptcy reform? Election reform? Why\n\n[[Page S9364]]\n\naren't we doing something with generic drugs? The Senator talked about \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights, terrorism insurance--on all the domestic \nissues, we have heard not a word and are getting no help from the \nmajority in the House or the minority in the Senate, and certainly not \nfrom the White House.\n  Does the Senator acknowledge we are not spending much time on \neconomic issues?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I talked about the issue of security and I said it is \ndeadly serious business, national security, homeland security. But \nthere is another area very important for the country. That is economic \nsecurity. We are spending virtually no time on that. We ought to. The \nAmerican people deserve to have a Congress that, yes, is concerned \nabout national security, concerned about homeland security, but that is \nwilling to tackle during tough economic times the economic security \nissues as well. This Congress has not been willing to do that.\n  Let me end as I began, because this is important. I will never \nminimize the importance of the security issues. In my judgment, the \nPresident and the Congress need to act and speak as one when we talk \nabout the security of this country. No one will never, ever hear me say \nany Member in this Chamber does not believe in the security of this \ncountry or does not act to support the security of this country. I will \nnever say that. I don't want to hear the President say it. I don't want \nto hear anyone else say it. I believe every Republican, Democrat, \nconservative and liberal, believes in their heart that whatever they \nare doing represents the security interests of this country. They love \nthis country and believe in the country, and that goes for everyone \nserving this country. I don't want anyone to suggest in any way under \nany context there are those who believe in security more than others. \nWe all love this country. We all want to do what is right and best for \nthis country. I will strongly support the security of this country. It \nis national security. It is homeland security. It is economic security.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the second half of \nthe time shall be under the control of the Republican leader or his \ndesignee.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/26/senate-section/article/S9364-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9364-S9366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to encourage my \nSenate colleagues to pass legislation on homeland security and to send \nit to conference. There are many more agreements, much more agreement \nthan disagreement, and the disagreements are relatively minor.\n  Last week, I said the Senate was dysfunctional because we had not \npassed a budget resolution. For the first time since the Budget Act was \npassed in 1974, the Congress has not passed a budget resolution. The \nSenate has not passed a budget resolution. Thirteen appropriations \nbills have not been passed. We have been on the Interior bill for weeks \nnow and homeland security for weeks. Long speeches. Not getting to the \npoint. Not voting. Not moving ahead with the legislation.\n  Last week, it was an accurate characterization to say the Senate was \ndysfunctional. This week, the Senate has become a chamber of rancor. It \nis plain that President Bush did not intend to impugn anyone's \npatriotism. He was commenting on two provisions of the homeland \nsecurity bill related to labor-management relations. Even on those \nmatters, the differences are relatively minor. The relationship between \nRepublicans and Democrats is better characterized by the embrace \nbetween President Bush and the majority leader at the joint session of \nCongress shortly after September 11, 2001.\n  The current controversy may well be giving encouragement, aid, and \ncomfort to Osama bin Laden, deep in some cave, and Saddam Hussein, in \nthe bowels of some bomb shelter. However, we know who the enemies are. \nThe enemies are the terrorists and the enemies are those who pose the \nrisk of using weapons of mass destruction.\n  I believe it is vital to move ahead with the homeland security bill \nto correct major deficiencies which have been disclosed in the \nintelligence agencies in the United States. We had a veritable \nblueprint, prior to September 11, 2001, and if we had connected all of \nthe dots, I think the chances were good that we could have avoided \nSeptember 11. The Congress of the United States and the administration \nhave a duty, a solemn duty, to do everything in our power to prevent \nanother terrorist attack. We lost thousands of Americans and the \nofficial word from the administration, articulated by a number of \nranking executive department officials, is that there will be another \nterrorist attack. It is not a matter of if, it is not a matter of \nwhether, it is a matter of where or when.\n  I am not prepared to accept that conclusion. I believe the United \nStates has the intelligence resources and can muster the intelligence \nresources to prevent another September 11.\n  When I served as chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the 104th \nCongress, I introduced legislation which would have brought all of the \nintelligence agencies under one umbrella. There have been repeated \nefforts to accomplish that, not just the legislation I introduced in \n1996. There is on the President's desk a plan submitted by former \nNational Security Adviser, General Scowcroft, to accomplish a \ncoordination of all intelligence agencies. However, it has not been \ndone because of the turf battles between the various intelligence \nagencies. Those turf battles regrettably are endemic and epidemic in \nWashington, DC. They have to come to a conclusion.\n  We have the mechanism now, the homeland security bill, to make those \ncorrections. We knew prior to September 11, from the FBI Phoenix \nmemorandum, about men taking flight training who had big pictures of \nOsama bin Laden. The report was disregarded. We knew prior to September \n11 that there were two terrorists in Kuala Lumpur. The CIA knew about \nit, but did not tell the FBI or INS, and they turned out to be two of \nthe pilots on September 11.\n  We know from the efforts made by the Minneapolis Office of the FBI to \nget a warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act as to \nZacarias Moussaoui, which would have given us a veritable blueprint of \nal-Qaida's intention, that certainly it would have led us to the trail \nand could have prevented September 11.\n  Then we have the famous, or infamous, report coming to the National \nSecurity Agency on September 10 about an attack the very next day, \nwhich was not translated.\n  There is much more I could comment about, but the time is limited.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. OK, on your time.\n  Mr. REID. We don't have any time, but I am sure if we need any time--\n--\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Domenici, who is the only Senator waiting, says \nit is OK, so I will be glad to respond to the question.\n  Mr. REID. The reason I want to have an exchange with the Senator is I \nthink maybe what the Senator said here today could resolve this \nhomeland security matter.\n  I believe, as the Senator from Pennsylvania does, that if there are \ndifferences we have here in the Senate version of the bill, it will go \nto conference with the House. The House and the Senate will sit down, \nthe White House people will be involved, as they always are in \nimportant conferences, and we will come up with a product. I think \ninstead of scrumming, as we are here, I think we would be better off, \nas the Senator has suggested, to get a bill out of here, get it to \nconference, and get something to the President's desk.\n  So I fully support, as I heard him, the Senator from Pennsylvania. I \nthink that is the way to resolve this matter. Get a bill out of here, \nget it to the conference, and, as the Senator said--how much difference \nis there between the two versions of this amendment that is creating so \nmuch controversy? There are differences, but I am not sure they are as \nbig as some think.\n  The labor-management issue, which seems to be a big problem, if that \nmatter is as close as what the Senator from Pennsylvania said, I think \nit could be resolved in conference.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada for that \nquestion, and I am glad to respond. I had intended to talk a little \nlater about the differences. Let me take them up now to emphasize the \npoint that the Senator from Nevada has made, that the differences are \nnot very big.\n\n[[Page S9365]]\n\n  I agree with the Senator from Nevada that we ought to send the bill \nto conference. When we had prescription drugs on the Senate floor, I \nvoted for the Republican measure, Grassley-Snowe, and then I voted for \nthe bill put up by the Democrats, by Senator Graham of Florida. It \nseemed to me the important thing was to get the matter to conference so \nthat the issue could be resolved with finality.\n  The two pending issues which are outstanding on labor relations, the \ndifference between the bill offered by Senator Gramm and the bill \noffered by Senator Lieberman, with the Breaux amendment, boil down to \nthis: It is the President's authority to waive the provisions on \ncollective bargaining in the event of a national emergency.\n  Now, listen closely to what the President must do under existing law:\n\n       The President may issue an order excluding any agency or \n     subdivision thereof for coverage under this chapter, \n     collective bargaining, if the President determines that, A, \n     the agency or subdivision has as a primary function \n     intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national \n     security work; and the provisions of this chapter cannot be \n     applied to that agency or subdivision in a manner consistent \n     with national security requirements and considerations.\n\n  This is what Senator Breaux wishes to add:\n\n       The President could not use his authority without showing \n     that, No. 1, the mission and responsibilities of the agencies \n     or subdivision materially changed and, No. 2, a majority of \n     such employees within such agencies or subdivision have as \n     their primary duty: Intelligence, counterintelligence, or \n     investigative work directly related to terrorism \n     investigation.\n\n  It is true the Breaux amendment does add a requirement for the \nPresident to exercise his authority. It is true that there is an \nadditional requirement, and the President does lose a little power. \nHowever, the requirements of existing law which relate to intelligence, \ncounterintelligence, and investigation are very similar to the \nprovisions of the Breaux amendment which again relate to intelligence, \ncounterintelligence, or investigative work directly related to \nterrorism investigation.\n  The President must make an additional showing. However, it is a \nshowing which is very much in line with what the President has to show \nunder existing law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, what is the order \nfollowing the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order of speakers.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that I follow him for up to 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, the other provision which is in controversy relates to \nthe flexibility which the President is seeking on six categories. The \nBreaux amendment would allow the President to have the flexibility \nunder four of the categories, and then in the event of disagreement \nbetween management and the union, the controversy would go to the \nFederal Services Impasse Panel.\n  There are seven members of that panel and all have been appointed by \nPresident Bush. It is customary for that panel to change when the \nadministration changes. The four categories which are in the Breaux \nbill allow for performance appraisal, classification, pay raise system, \nand labor-management relations, all of which the President wants, and \nonly the limitation going before the impasse panel, which should not be \nan obstacle, and then the other two are adverse actions and appeals.\n  So that if you boil it all down, our area of disagreement is really \nvery minor. The bill which is going to come out of conference is \nobviously going to take up these issues. We know as a matter of \npractice when there is a Presidential veto or a firm statement about a \nPresidential veto, invariably the Congress relents on an individual \npoint.\n  So it would be my hope that we could yet resolve this controversy. I \ntalked to Senator Breaux, Senator Gramm of Texas, and Senator \nLieberman, and the parties are very close. I have not yet stated a \npreference for either position. I am being lobbied on both sides. It is \na very major matter for my constituency on both sides, a very large \nlabor constituency in Pennsylvania, and very grave concern on my part \nthat the President's powers not be diminished in a way which would \nimpede his efforts on a Department of Homeland Security.\n  When you take a look at where we are with the various problems of \nlapses in security--there have been a parade of witnesses before the \njoint intelligence committees of the House and Senate. We counted some \nof these, not all. In view of the limited time, Mr. President, I ask \nthat there be added at the conclusion of my comments a recitation of a \nnumber of other warnings which were given, which could have provided a \nveritable blueprint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Our job is plain, it seems to me, and that is to move \nahead, to have a reconciliation, a rapprochement. Let us not have this \nas a chamber of rancor. Let us not have a dysfunctional Senate. We have \nmany bills which are now pending in the conference committees, which \nhave not been acted upon--the energy bill, the Patients' Bill of \nRights, the voting machine correction bill, the terrorism reinsurance \nbill, the bankruptcy bill, and others, which are awaiting conference. \nWe have a very heavy duty to the American people to complete the \npeople's business, and we need to finish the appropriations bills and \nnot have a continuing resolution.\n  I think it is becoming apparent to the American people that we have a \ndysfunctional Senate. We have to move away from that. We have to let \nour enemies--the terrorists and Saddam Hussein--know that the Democrat \nand Republican Party system is better characterized by that famous \nembrace between the President and Senate majority leader at the Joint \nSession of Congress shortly after September 11.\n  I intend to return to the floor to talk in more detail about the \nBreaux amendment, but I think it is plain by an analysis of what the \nBreaux amendment does that it ought to be resolved and it ought not to \nstop this Congress in legislating. It would be a travesty and a tragedy \nif we were to go over into next year without having a homeland security \nbill so that we can correct the major problems in the intelligence \nfunction of this country.\n  I again thank my colleague from New Mexico and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                          A Virtual Blueprint\n\n\n                             NSA Intercepts\n\n       The NSA intercepted two messages on the eve of September 11 \n     attacks on the world Trade Center and the Pentagon warning \n     that something was going to happen the next day, but the \n     messages were not translated until September 12. The Arabic-\n     language messages said, ``the match is about to begin,'' and \n     ``Tomorrow is zero-hour.'' They came from sources--a location \n     or phone number--that were of high enough priority to \n     translate them within two days but were not put in the top \n     priority category, which included communications from Usama \n     bin Laden or his senior al Qaeda assistants.\n\n\n                                 Murad\n\n       In January 1995, the Philippine National Police discovered \n     Ramzi Yousef's bomb making lab in Manila and arrested an \n     accomplice named Abdul Hakim Murad. Captured materials and \n     interrogations of Murad revealed Yousef's plot to kill the \n     Pope, bomb U.S. and Israeli embassies in Manila, blow up 12 \n     U.S.-owned airliners over the Pacific Ocean, and crash a \n     plane into CIA headquarters. Murad is a promoter of the same \n     radical interpretation of Sunni Islam ideology as Usama bin \n     Laden, who emerged during this time frame as promoting this \n     radical ideology.\n       NOTE: This provided a data point on a terrorist group \n     discussing a plan to use an aircraft as a weapon in the \n     possession of the Intelligence Community.\n\n\n                           Phoenix Memorandum\n\n       The FBI paid too little attention to a July 10, 2001 \n     memorandum written by an FBI agent in Phoenix urging bureau \n     headquarters to investigate Middle Eastern men enrolled in \n     American flight schools. The ``Phoenix Memo'' cited Usama bin \n     Laden by name and suggested that his followers could use the \n     schools to train for terror operations.\n       Federal authorities have been aware for years that a small \n     number of suspected terrorists with ties to bin Laden had \n     received flight training at schools in the United States and \n     abroad.\n       Pakistani terrorist plotter Murad, who had planned to blow \n     up airliners over the Pacific,\n\n[[Page S9366]]\n\n     trained at four U.S. schools in the early 1990s.\n\n\n                           Crawford Briefing\n\n       President Bush and his top advisers were informed by the \n     CIA in early August 2001 that terrorists associated with \n     Usama bin Laden had discussed the possibility of hijacking \n     airplanes. The top-secret briefing memo presented to \n     President Bush on August 6 carried the headline, ``Bin Laden \n     Determined to Strike in US,'' and was primarily focused on \n     recounting al Qaeda's past efforts to attack and infiltrate \n     the United States.\n\n\n                      Moussaoui & Minneapolis FBI\n\n       Minneapolis FBI agents investigating terror suspect \n     Zacarias Moussaoui last August were severely hampered by \n     officials at FBI headquarters, who resisted seeking FISA \n     surveillance and physical search warrants, applied erroneous \n     probable cause standards, and admonished agents for seeking \n     help from the CIA.\n\n\n                              Kuala Lumpur\n\n       The CIA tracked two of the Flight 77 (Pentagon) terrorists \n     to a Qaeda summit in Malaysia in January 2000, then did not \n     share the information as the terrorists reentered America and \n     began preparations for September 11. The CIA tracked one of \n     the terrorists, Nawaf Alhazami, as he flew from the meeting \n     to Los Angeles, and discovered that another of the men, \n     Khalid Almihdhar, had already obtained a multiple-entry visa \n     that allowed him to enter and leave the United Stats as he \n     pleased. The CIA did nothing with this information. Instead, \n     during the year and nine months after the CIA identified them \n     as terrorists, Alhazami and Almihdhar lived openly in the \n     United States, using their real name, obtaining drivers \n     licenses, opening bank accounts and enrolling in flight \n     schools--until the morning of September 11, when they boarded \n     American Airlines Flight 77 and crashed into the Pentagon.\n\n\n                               Bin Laden\n\n       On February 26, 1993, a bomb was detonated in the parking \n     garage of the World Trade Center in New York City. On June \n     24, 1993, the FBI arrested eight individuals for plotting to \n     bomb a number of New York City landmarks, including the \n     United Nations building and the Lincoln and Holland tunnels. \n     The central figures in these plots were Ramzi Yousef and \n     Shaykh Omar Abd al-Rahman--both of whom have been linked to \n     Usama Bin Laden and are now serving prison sentences.\n       Following the August 1998, bombings of two U.S. Embassies \n     in East Africa, Intelligence Community leadership recognized \n     how dangerous Bin Laden's network was and that he intended to \n     strike in the United States. In December 1998 DCI George \n     Tenet provided written guidance to his deputies at the CIA, \n     declaring, in effect, ``war'' with Bin Laden.\n       Concern about Bin Laden continued to grow over time and \n     reached peak levels in the spring and summer of 2001, as the \n     Intelligence Community faced increasing numbers of reports of \n     imminent al Qaeda attacks against U.S. interests. In July and \n     August 2001, that rise in intelligence reporting began to \n     decrease, just as three additional developments occurred in \n     the United States: the Phoenix memo; the detention of \n     Zacarias Moussaoui; and the Intelligence Community's \n     realization that two individuals with ties to Usama Bin \n     Laden's network--Nawaf Alhazami and Khalid Almihdhar--were \n     possibly in the United States.\n       In June 1998, the Intelligence Community learned that Usama \n     Bin Laden was considering attacks in the U.S., including \n     Washington, DC, and New York. This information was provided \n     to senior U.S. Government officials in July 1998.\n       In August 1998, the Intelligence Community obtained \n     information that a group of unidentified Arabs planned to fly \n     an explosive-laden plane from a foreign country into the \n     World Trade Center. The FBI's New York office took no action \n     on the information. The Intelligence Community has acquired \n     additional information since then indicating links between \n     this Arab group and al Qaeda.\n       In September 1998, the Intelligence Community obtained \n     information that Usama Bin Laden's next operation could \n     involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into a U.S. \n     airport and detonating it; this information was provided to \n     senior U.S. Government officials in late 1998.\n       In October 1998, the Intelligence Community obtained \n     information that al Qaeda was trying to establish an \n     operative cell within the United States. This information \n     indicated there might be an effort underway to recruit U.S. \n     citizen Islamists and U.S.-based expatriates from the Middle \n     East and North Africa;\n       In the fall of 1998, the Intelligence Community received \n     additional information concerning a Bin-Laden plot involving \n     aircraft in the New York and Washington, DC, areas;\n       In November 1998, the Intelligence Community learned that a \n     Bin Laden was attempting to recruit a group of five to seven \n     young men from the United States to strike U.S. domestic \n     targets.\n       In the spring of 1999, the Intelligence Community learned \n     about a planned Bin Laden attack on a U.S. Government \n     facility in Washington, DC. Additionally, in 1999, the threat \n     of an explosive-laden aircraft being used in a suicide attack \n     against the Pentagon, CIA headquarters, or the White House, \n     was noted in a Library of Congress report to the National \n     Intelligence Council.\n       In late 1999, the Intelligence Community learned of Bin \n     Laden's possible plans to attack targets in Washington, DC, \n     and New York City during the New Year's Millennium \n     celebrations.\n       On December 14, 1999, an individual named Ahmed Ressam was \n     arrested as he attempted to enter the United States from \n     Canada with detonator materials in his car. Ressam's intended \n     target was Los Angeles International Airport. Ressam, who has \n     links to Usama Bin Laden's terrorist network, has not been \n     formally sentenced yet.\n       In March 2000, the Intelligence Community obtained \n     information regarding the types of targets that operatives in \n     Bin Laden's network might strike. The Statue of Liberty was \n     specifically mentioned, as were skyscrapers, ports, and \n     airports, and nuclear power plants;\n       Between late March and September 2001, the Intelligence \n     Community detected numerous indicators of an impeding \n     terrorist attack, some of which pointed specifically to the \n     United States as a possible target. Among these are:\n       Between May and July, the National Security Agency reported \n     at least 33 communications indicating a possible, imminent \n     terrorist attack--none of which were specific as to where, \n     when, or how an attack might occur, nor was it clear that any \n     of the individuals involved in these intercepted \n     communications had any first-hand knowledge of where, when, \n     or how an attack might occur. These reports were widely \n     disseminated within the Intelligence Community.\n       In May 2001, the Intelligence Community obtained \n     information that supporters of Usama Bin Laden were \n     reportedly planning to infiltrate the United States via \n     Canada in order to carry out a terrorist operation. This \n     report mentioned an attack within the United States, though \n     it did not say where in the U.S., or when, or how an attack \n     might occur. In July 2001, this information was shared with \n     the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), \n     U.S. Customs Service, and the State Department and was \n     included in a closely held intelligence report for senior \n     government officials in August 2001.\n       In May 2001, the Intelligence Community received \n     information that seven individuals associated with Usama Bin \n     Laden departed various locations for the United States;\n       In June 2001, the DCI's Counter Terrorism Center (CTC) had \n     information that key operatives in Usama Bin Laden's \n     organization were disappearing while others were preparing \n     for martyrdom;\n       In July 2001, the DCI's CTC was aware of an individual who \n     had recently been in Afghanistan who had reported, ``Everyone \n     is talking about an impending attack.'' The Intelligence \n     Community was also aware that Bin Laden had stepped up his \n     propaganda efforts in the preceding months;\n       In the late summer 2001, the Intelligence Community \n     obtained information that an individual associated with al \n     Qaeda was considering mounting terrorist operations in the \n     United States. There was no information available as to the \n     timing of possible attacks or on the alleged targets in the \n     United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senator Specter, I am sure you had some more \nto say and I apologize, but it seems like the harder I try to get time \nhere the worse it works out for me.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is the Senator's turn, and I am anxious to hear what \nthe Senator has to say.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/26/senate-section/article/S9366-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9366-S9368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I made a few remarks 3 or 4 days ago \ntalking about where we are and what we are doing, and I would like to \nfinish those remarks today, perhaps start on a discussion of the \nAmerican economy.\n  First, in less than 5 days the new fiscal year begins. That means if \nyou are a businessman, no matter how small or how large, you would be \nclosing down your books, you would be adding everything up, you would \nbe doing a couple of additions and subtractions, and you would find out \nhow well or how poorly you did--a very important event in the life of \nan ongoing business.\n  The United States is similar except it is much bigger. Frankly, it \ndoes not keep its books nearly as well as the small businesspeople of \nAmerica, who must keep them much better than we do because of the \nInternal Revenue Service if nothing else. We are not audited by \nanybody. We do ours in some strange ways.\n  The truth is that the year ends October 1. I think both the occupant \nof the Chair and the Senator from New Mexico can remember when it was \nJuly. We found out that was too soon in the year. If you started a year \nin January, you started work, it was too quick to have everything done \nin July. So we had a completed year, since I have been\n\n[[Page S9367]]\n\na Senator, when we went to October. We had to fix that up. And now \nOctober was thought to be ample time to get our work done.\n  Not a single appropriations bill has been sent to the President. The \nlast time this situation occurred, excluding last year after the \nattacks, was in 1995 during the infamous Government shutdown. You \nremember that, the shutdown period.\n  I come to the Senate because there has been a lot of talk about who \nis to blame for what. Frankly, I would like to suggest that the \nmajority party and the majority leader bear the burden of running the \nSenate. They can run it with all the laments they can put forth and all \nthe blame they can shed upon the situation, but the truth is, as \ndifficult as it is, it is their job and the first and most important \nthing is that they are supposed to prepare and have a vote on a budget \nresolution. While it is not everything, to many things that transpire \nafter it, it is a very big issue, a very big instrument.\n  So we find ourselves, as I indicated, where we are 5 days from the \nend of the year. All of those appropriations bills that are coming \nalong that have not been finished pick up October 1 as the starting \ndate because the other ones that we put in run out. So if we do not do \nsomething by October 1, most parts of Government will shut down.\n  We found that out in 1995 when there was a cleavage between the \nCongress and the President. The President would not sign some bills \nbecause he did not like certain items, and clearly he pinned the blame \non Congress for sending those bills up to him in a manner that he would \nnot sign and closed down the Government, one piece after another. So it \nwas a job that we had to get done.\n  I believe my friend--the new chairman of the Budget Committee who \ntook over in the middle of a 2-year cycle because the Democrats got one \nadditional Member to vote with them, so everything went to them--went \ntheir way. I believe the answer was it was just too hard to get a \nbudget.\n  The occupant of the chair knows how difficult it was. He sat there \nfor days on end. But that wasn't anything new. Senators before him and \nSenators after him, if we still keep a budget, will sit there for hours \non end trying to get it done. It should have been done. A budget \nresolution is an important issue upon which we should focus.\n  It is important we in the Senate understand we did not get a budget \nresolution because some thought it was not necessary. They were wrong. \nSome thought we would get along without it, but they were wrong. The \nAmerican people are the ones suffering because we can't get our work \ndone.\n  I don't believe there is any room to lay blame for that on this side \nof the aisle. It is that side of the aisle--the majority party of the \nSenate now, this particular month--that has to bear the blame.\n  Back in May, the majority leader blamed the lack of a budget on an \nevenly divided membership in the Senate. Early this month, the chairman \nof the Democratic National Committee--who has a propensity, because he \nspeaks well, to put his nose in legislative business as if he were one \nof us--said on the Sunday show, ``Face the Nation'':\n\n       We couldn't do it because we need 60 votes and we couldn't \n     get 60 votes.\n\n  Wrong, wrong, wrong. A budget resolution needs 50 votes--not 60.\n  The occupant of the chair, as a valued member of the Budget \nCommittee, knows that. Every Senator knows that. There are many votes \nthat are 60 votes because you did not get a budget resolution--because \nthe law says you are punished in some instances. Some things can't get \npassed with a majority, even though we require a majority. That the \nbudget laws say without the budget, you have to have 60 votes, but not \nto pass it.\n  The budget should have been passed. We should have gone back to it on \na number of occasions, and it should have been done.\n  Finally, just last week the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \nreferring to an amendment that was voted on by the Senate on June 20, \nclearly implying it was the Senate budget, literally said here on the \nfloor, and I quote:\n\n       We got 59 votes for that proposal on a bipartisan basis. We \n     needed a supermajority of 60.\n\n  That is wrong. You needed 60 votes. Because you didn't have a budget \nwhich did not permit you to do what he was suggesting, we didn't get 60 \nvotes.\n  So that ought to be corrected. Everybody should know the fact we did \nnot have a budget caused it; not that we were voting on a budget that \nneeded 60 votes.\n  I want to be very clear. We have not voted on a budget resolution in \nthe Senate this year. This will be the first time the Budget Act in its \nlife--which, incidentally, is not a very long life. It is only 27 years \nold. That means Senator Domenici could have been here for its entire \nlife. I have been. I could have been on the committee for its entire \nlife. I was. I could have been the chairman for \\1/2\\ of its time in \nexistence. I was--maybe 2 years less than \\1/2\\.\n  In any event, we split it when we were controlling the Senate. That \nis who deemed that.\n  There has not been a budget resolution brought before the Senate to \nbe debated on the floor this year. The chairman of the Budget Committee \nknows this, and he knows the majority leader knows this, and to even \nhint we would have considered a budget but didn't pass it is not so.\n  We have now learned--and I hope they have learned--that if the \nDemocrats are still in control next year, which I doubt--but if they \nare, we should have learned you had better bring it up, even if you are \none or two votes short. And you had better spend 2 weeks debating and \nsee what happens. At least you will have tried, and you might be \nsurprised. Somebody around who would rather there not be a budget would \nsay I will vote to report it out.\n  I have been, as I indicated, on the Budget Committee since its \nbeginning in the 94th Congress. I have been honored to serve on it. I \nam very embarrassed by what is happening to it because it is getting \nvery close to becoming something we use as an instrument to require 60 \nvotes for certain things we do and don't do. But as far as it being the \npolicy determiner we expected, it is beginning to fall apart as we \nspeak and as we vote. I know what a budget is. I think I know what we \nshould have done.\n  Just last week the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, referring \nto an amendment that was voted on in the Senate on June 20, clearly \nimplying that it was a Senate budget, literally said here on the floor \nand I quote: ``. . . we got 59 votes for that proposal on a bipartisan \nbasis. We needed a supermajority, which is 60.''\n  Mr. President, let me be as clear as I can possibly be--we have not \nvoted on a budget resolution in the Senate this year. This will be the \nfirst time in the Budget Act's nearly 27 year history that the Senate \nhas not adopted a budget blueprint.\n  No budget resolution has ever been brought to the Senate floor to be \ndebated and voted on this year. The Chairman of the Budget Committee \nknows this, the Majority Leader knows this, and to even hint that we \nhave considered a budget, is an absolute insult to those of us that \nhave worked to make the budget process a functioning part of the fiscal \ndecisionmaking mechanism here in the Senate.\n  I think I know what a budget is, and let me assure those who may \ncare, it does not take 60 votes to adopt a budget in the Senate. \nDespite what the Majority Leader, the current Chairman, or the \nDemocratic National Committee Chairman says.\n  In fact, of those nearly 32 budget conference resolutions the Senate \nhas adopted over the years, almost half, fourteen, were adopted with \nless than 60 votes.\n  And last year, as Chairman of the Budget Committee, in an evenly \ndivided Senate, I had considered and we adopted a budget resolution for \nFY 2002. It was tough but we worked hard and in that evenly divided \nSenate, the Senate passed its budget blueprint by a vote of 65-35.\n  So let us be clear, it does not take 60 votes to adopt a budget.\n  So what other excuse is given for not adopting a congressional budget \nthis year?\n  Unbelievable, the Chairman of the Budget Committee comes to the floor \nand says because the House of Representatives adopted a budget that \nused OMB assumptions or did not make 10 year estimates, that it was \nimpossible for the Senate to adopt a budget.\n\n[[Page S9368]]\n\n  Mr. President, to blame somehow the House of Representatives for \nadopting their own budget resolution as the reason why the Senate did \nnot consider its own, simply defies logic.\n  That is why the Budget Act created a concurrent resolution, that is \nwhy the Budget Act established a conference on a House-passed and \nSenate-passed budget resolution. I have been in many conferences on \nbudget resolutions, and they were tough, but the fact that I knew they \nwere going to be tough, never stopped me from doing my job as Chairman \nof the Budget Committee, and again the Senate has always adopted a \nbudget resolution.\n  So what other excuse is made for the Senate not acting on a budget? \nThe President's budget submitted way back in February is the other \nexcuse for us not acting here in the Senate.\n  This has to be the weakest of all excuses. This is not the \nPresident's budget we are expected to adopt. This is not the \nPresident's budget resolution. This is the ``congressional budget.''\n  We are an equal branch of government in this balancing act between \nthe Executive and the Legislative over fiscal policy.\n  I have never been shy about expressing differences with Presidents of \neither party over the years when I though their budget proposals needed \nmodifications. The same holds true for President Bush's executive \nbudget plan transmitted to Congress last February.\n  But I have always guarded the congressional prerogative to produce a \n``congressional budget.'' This is our responsibility under the Budget \nAct and I would also go so far as to say, under the Constitution. \nBecause the President has a budget plan that might differ from one that \nCongress might produce, is certainly no reason for the Congress not to \nact. In fact, I would argue it is a reason for the Congress to act.\n  I do not think it should be any surprise that we begin a new fiscal \nyear with no appropriation bills at the President's desk to sign. The \nfailure of this Senate to consider and act on a budget blueprint, to \nsit down and tough it out back in the spring, has made the \nappropriation process stumble and fall this year.\n  Last year in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Congress also \ndid not have any regular appropriation bills enacted before the \nbeginning of this fiscal year. This was understandable under the \ncircumstances.\n  But I contend the major reason the appropriation process has failed \nthis year, is because we were not willing to adopt a budget resolution. \nYou have to go back to 1996 to find the last time no appropriations \nwere enacted before the beginning of the fiscal year. A time under \nPresident Clinton and the infamous 26 days of government shut-down and \n14 continuing resolutions.\n  No, there is no other way to say it and it is tough. This Majority \nLeader and this Chairman of the Budget Committee and this Senate failed \nin their one basic responsibility under the Budget Act--produce a \nbudget resolution. And now everybody else is to blame but ourselves. I \nthink those who take the time to understand what is going on here can \nsee the hypocrisy of the Majority Leader and Chairman's statements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/26/senate-section/article/S9368-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9368-S9369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a statement I want to start and \nthen put the remainder in the Record, and if we get time in the next 2 \nweeks, I will come back a couple of times.\n  The economy is much in the air now. It is not as much as perhaps the \nIraq situation. But the Democratic Party and their leaders want to make \nit the important issue and put the war in the backseat.\n  I don't think that is going to happen because the people of this \ncountry know the war is an imminent problem. And, if we have a war, the \namount of money we plan to spend in the budget will probably get \nchanged in a mammoth way to accommodate the needs of the war.\n  When we had the war in the gulf the last time, our allies paid most \nof the bill. I recall looking at the formula that was drawn by the OMB. \nActually, our allies just took the formula and said we are bound by the \nformula, and wrote the checks. Some of those paid as much as $13 \nbillion for that war. That was our friend we were all arguing about \nwhich has a little oil. Here is our share. Japan didn't enter that war. \nThey wrote a big check. We didn't pay much for that war. We don't have \nsuch an agreement now. Maybe somebody will start thinking about it.\n  Let me talk about the economy.\n  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said recently the U.S. \neconomy has confronted very significant challenges over the past year: \nMajor declines in the equity markets, which none of us thought would \never happen. Many Americans thought it would go on forever. The equity \nmarket had ballooned out of all proportion, and people such as Alan \nGreenspan were giving us warnings. It did begin its downward trend and \nit still is continuing on that path.\n  To date, Dr. Greenspan said the economy appears to have withstood \nthis set of blows very well--the blows being the investment spending, \nthe retrenchment, the tragic terrorist attacks of last September. The \nFederal budget has been able to withstand that, and the economy has \nbeen able to withstand that.\n  The economy is not in great shape right now. But not in great shape \neither at this time are many individual problems in this country. \nConsumption is strong. Unemployment gains are creeping back up.\n  But to blame President Bush is pure unadulterated, partisan politics. \nFor those who talk about it being his problem, the issue would be what \nwould they do to fix it? Some would raise taxes by an enormous amount; \nor by repealing the cuts that were made. Nobody with their right mind \nabout the economy would suggest that.\n  But when you say it is not in very good shape today, what would you \ndo about it? We will blame the President. What would you do positive \nabout it? A large group would say raise taxes.\n  I find it hard to believe if we had to do that and came to that \npoint, very many people would vote for it when they finally understood \nthe negative consequences of that.\n  I want to mention every now and then I look to a Democratic economist \nwho is of renown, and is of the other party, and everybody knows who he \nis; that is, Democratic economist Joe Stiglitz. He was Vice Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve under President Clinton. He has written many \narticles and books on the economy.\n  He has indicated, and I quote:\n\n       This economy was slipping, and it was slipping into a \n     recession even before Bush took office as President and \n     before the corporate scandals--\n\n  That we haven't yet determined the breadth and number of them, but \neven before they started--\n\n       were rocking America.\n\n  That was earlier yet than when the President took office.\n  He says we were moving into a recession. What we did were the right \nthings to get out of the recession. We cut taxes, and we increased \nspending of things that would spend quickly.\n  We also at the same time, working with the Federal Reserve Chairman, \ngot interest rates to come down. You remember how many times he cut \nthem. And so you had the triad that would help a recession.\n\n  I wonder how bad it would be if we had not done that. I wonder how \nbad the economy would be if we had not cut taxes at the right time and \nif, in fact, we did not have the Federal Reserve working in harmony \nreducing the interest rates, and if we had not spent some additional \nmoney, some which came because of the war costs.\n  So the economic growth has started slowing down. It started in mid-\n2000, well before the President took office. In 1997, more than 3 years \nbefore he was elected, you could begin to see, as you analyze corporate \nprofits, they were coming down. This is 3 years before he went out on \nthe steps and took the oath and became President of the United States.\n  Rather than call this a Bush recession, we ought to call it a Clinton \nhangover. If you want to use another word for each one so there is \nnothing negative about it, that would be all right.\n  In the late 1990s, we had a stock market boom and an investment boom.\n  Much of the rise in the stock market and investment was sustainable, \nbut some of it was not.\n  We are now making up for the excesses of that period. We are finally\n\n[[Page S9369]]\n\ncoming to grips with the need to make sure companies are honest when \nthey account for their profits.\n  It seems as though for a few years there in the late-90s, some CEOs \nforgot about ethics and morals. They could say just about anything \nabout their profits and no one was there to check. As long as the stock \nmarket was going up, no one seemed to care ethics and morals, and laws \nwere not enforced.\n  But now we're checking. Now the SEC is doing its job of making sure \nshareholders aren't getting ripped-off. Now we're going after the \ncorporate criminals.\n  A few years ago, the federal government looked the other way. Now, \nthanks in large part to President Bush, that's not happening any more.\n  Having said that, I believe that when the economic history of this \nera is written, what will strike people is not that we had a recession \nbut that things were not worse.\n  In early 2000 the NASDAQ hit 5000. If you had told people that two \nyears later the NASDAQ would be treading water at about 1200, as it is \nnow, they might have assumed we had gone through some sort of \nDepression. Well, as bad as things got last year, we did not have a \nDepression.\n  The policies we enacted over the past two years have made the economy \nbetter, not worse. If it weren't for those policies who knows how weak \nthe economy would be now.\n  Over and over again we hear that our policies are bad for the economy \nbecause they turned surpluses into deficits. That is just not true.\n  I have staked a large part of my career arguing for fiscal \ndiscipline, much of it when it was unpopular, even with many members of \nmy own party. But now is not the time quibble about the budget deficit.\n  The deficit this year will be about 1.6 percent of GDP. But look at \nthe same point in previous business cycles. Back in the 1976 recovery, \nthe deficit was 4.2 percent of GDP. In the 1980s it peaked at 6 \npercent. In the early 1990s it peaked at 4.7 percent. So 1.6 percent is \nnot large considering we are in the early stages of a recovery and in a \nwar.\n  If fiscal mismanagement were hurting the economy we would see rising \ninterest rates. But interest rates are going down, not up. The rate on \n10-year Treasury Notes is the lowest in 40 years. Homeowners are \nrefinancing their mortgages at a record rate. Notice that those who \nclaimed the Bush tax cut would lead to higher interest rates have been \nvery quiet of late regarding that key point in their argument.\n  Yes, things could be better. But long term, our economic fundamentals \nare strong. Productivity is growing at about a 5 percent rate and new \ninnovations continue.\n  Cutting taxes was the right thing to do and we did it just in the \nnick of time. I am proud of the work we did this year and last year in \ncutting taxes and my fellow Republicans and a few Democrats should be \nproud too.\n  I thank the Senate for yielding time to me, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I listened to my distinguished colleague \nwith great interest. If my colleague wishes to speak for a few more \nminutes, I will follow my colleague. I say to the Senator, I was very \ninterested in what you were saying.\n  Does my colleague wish to take some additional time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, that is very nice of you to \noffer. When you want to speak on the floor, you take the gamble. I have \nsome other things to do. I had to wait a little longer for my position. \nYou can rest assured that since I think it is pretty good, the Senate \nwill hear more before we go out. And they will hear another one on two \nsubjects that have to do with who is to blame for what, suggesting we \nought to get on with doing things rather than blaming, which is what I \nthink the American people would like.\n  Thank you very much, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. He is clearly one of \nthe elder statesmen of this institution, with some almost 30 years of \nservice in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/26/senate-section/article/S9369-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9369-S9371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE GRAMM-MILLER AMENDMENT TO THE HOMELAND SECURITY BILL\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today, with other colleagues, to \nsupport the Gramm-Miller amendment. I wish to address very specifically \nsome provisions.\n  The overall amendment addresses the concerns which I had very early \non and are outlined in a letter to the Governmental Affairs Committee. \nAt that time, I said to the then-chairman, in writing, I had specific \nconcerns. This particular amendment by Gramm and Miller has taken care \nof those concerns. It is for that reason I lend my support.\n  It provides the President with the authority he needs to organize our \nGovernment at this critical time to deal with these most unusual \nthreats that are confronting our Nation today.\n  The Presiding Officer and I are privileged to serve together on the \nArmed Services Committee, and he full well appreciates the diversity \nand the unprecedented threats that face this Nation today.\n  I think Senators Gramm and Miller have gone about this in a very \nbalanced way. I specifically thank the Senator from Texas and the \nSenator from Georgia because I approached them, asking that they \ninclude a provision in their bill which I had devised with the help of \nmy colleague from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, my colleague from Utah, who \nis in the Chamber, and my colleague from Virginia, Senator Allen. \nSenator Allen and Senator Bennett have taken the lead in the high-tech \ncaucus.\n  In the course of one of our periodic meetings on this subject, the \ngroup brought to our attention the need to have this type of indemnity \nlegislation, and once Senator Bennett, Senator Allen, and I approached \nthe Gramm-Miller team, they accepted this amendment. I wish to talk \nabout it today and the importance of that amendment within the \namendment that is on the floor now.\n  The legislation I am proposing with others would authorize the \nPresident to apply basically the same indemnification authorities now \navailable to the Secretary of Defense, such that it can be applied to a \nmuch larger number of the departments and agencies of the Federal \nGovernment, as well as State and local--as well as State and local--\ngovernments so these entities of the Federal and State government can \ngo about the business of contracting with our private sector and enable \nthe contractors to have certain protections regarding the products \nwhich are the subject of the contract or the services, which products \nand services are directly contributing to the war on terrorism and the \nprotection of our Nation.\n\n  It is quite interesting, I find there is an urgent need for this \nauthority. It has existed in the Department of Defense for so many \nyears. I was privileged to serve in the Department of Defense from 1969 \nthrough 1974 as Secretary and Under Secretary of the Navy. The \nPresiding Officer, I think, was on active duty at that time and had an \nexemplary career in the military.\n  But, for example, contractors today would not sell the chemical and \nbiological detectors to a wider range of Federal agencies and \ndepartments, and State and local, but they can take the same product \nand sell it to the Department of Defense. So we are kind of caught up \nin interpretations of a Presidential directive, the existing law. I \nthink we do not have the time to sort it out in the courts, and it is \nbest to clarify it here in Congress.\n  This is a bipartisan effort, I assure the Presiding Officer and \nothers.\n  Some of our Nation's top defense contractors simply cannot sell these \nproducts to the other agencies, State and Federal, today. In the \nmeantime, our vulnerability here in the United States, in my own \nexperience, is of great concern to me.\n  We should give the President the option that he currently does not \nhave of deciding whether other departments and agencies, Federal and \nState, should have this authority.\n  The liability risk has been a longstanding deterrent to the private \nsector, freely contracting with the Department of Defense, but now \nwishes to broaden its contracting with other departments and agencies.\n\n[[Page S9370]]\n\n  Congress has acted in the past to authorize the indemnification of \ncontracts. I find this history fascinating. For example, on December \n18, 1941, just a short time after the tragic Pearl Harbor experience--2 \nweeks--the Congress enacted title II of the First War Powers Act of \n1941. By providing authority to the President to indemnify contracts, \nthis legislation and its successor pieces of legislation have enabled \nthe private sector to enter into contracts that involve a substantial \nliability risk occasioned by their services and products.\n  Administrations since President Franklin Roosevelt's day have used \nthese authorities to indemnify or share the risk with defense \ncontractors. This was required to jump-start the ``arsenal of \ndemocracy,'' as described by the President in 1941.\n  It was true again in 1958, when the nuclear and missile programs were \nfacilitated by the indemnification of risk associated with the use of \nnuclear power and highly volatile missile fuels.\n  It is true today for technology solutions required by agencies \nengaged in the war against terrorism. And that is the purpose of this \nlegislation.\n  This war is going to be different in many ways--many ways--we cannot \nenvision at this moment or in the future. For one, much of the Nation's \nhomeland defense activities are going to be conducted by State and \nlocal governments. It is, thus, imperative to ensure that State and \nlocal governments can access vital antiterrorism technologies and not \nlet the contractor be subjected to undue risk.\n  To facilitate this, my amendment would require the establishment of a \nFederal contracting vehicle to which State and local governments could \nturn to rapidly buy antiterrorism solutions from the Federal \nGovernment. The President would also be authorized, if he deemed it \nnecessary, to indemnify these purchases. Again, discretion rests with \nthe President, and he, in turn, has delegated this authority to the \nSecretary of Defense. I presume if this legislation becomes law, he \nwill delegate it to other heads of departments and agencies.\n  Again, I wish to emphasize two points: One, that this authority is \ndiscretionary. The President, on a case-by-case basis, may decide \nwhether to indemnify contracts.\n  I expect the President will use the authority much as it has been \nused at the Department of Defense, carefully and thoughtfully, and only \nfor those products the Government cannot obtain without the use of this \nauthority.\n  The second point I want to emphasize is that indemnification is not \nin conflict with any efforts to limit or cap liability. My legislation \nshould not be seen as an alternative for tort reform, but merely as one \ntool that can be used by the President to ensure that vitally needed \ntechnologies necessary for homeland defense are placed into the hands \nof those who need them.\n  During World War II and all subsequent wars, conflicts and \nemergencies in which the U.S. has been involved, we have needed \ndomestic contractors to be innovative, resourceful and ready to support \nefforts at home and abroad. In 1941, the Congress wanted contractors to \nknow that if they were willing to engage in unusually hazardous \nactivities for the national defense, then the U.S. Government would \naddress the potential liability exposure associated with the conduct of \nsuch activities. Our position should be no different now.\n  I conclude with remarks about another matter connected with the \nGramm-Miller amendment. There are many aspects in the creation of this \nnew department of homeland defense that are unprecedented. Contentious \ncivil service issues have largely driven the debate on homeland \nsecurity in this Chamber in the past days and weeks. Over 170,000 \nemployees from 22 agencies will be transferred to the new Department of \nHomeland Security, including an estimated 43,000 Federal employees \nrepresented by 18 different unions.\n  Since President Bush proposed the creation of homeland security, I \nhave been involved in discussions with a number of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle and with the Federal employee unions and their \nmembers about the potential consequences to Federal employees. In order \nto successfully achieve this complex collaboration, I recognize the \nimportance of the President's request for increased flexibility in \nmanaging the new Department.\n  The uncertainty, however, of the administration's intentions with \nadditional labor and management flexibility has fostered mistrust, \nunderstandably so, among these Federal employees. The administration in \nno way should put into question basic labor rights and civil service \nprotections for these employees.\n  The administration cannot ignore the impact this is having on morale, \nnot only on the employees being transferred, but throughout the Federal \nworkforce. With no firm commitment from the administration that \ncollective bargaining rights will not be weakened outside of reasons \ndirectly related to national security, I cannot blame these Federal \nemployees for being anxious.\n  I can personally attest to the dedication of civil service employees \nthroughout the Federal Government. There has never been reason to \nquestion that during a national crisis, Federal employees perform their \nduties first, setting aside personal grievances. Federal employees have \nbeen relocated, reassigned and worked long hours under strenuous \ncircumstances with no complaints since the September 11 attacks. Their \nloyalty is first and foremost to their country. Federal employees have \nproven this time and again.\n  I have carefully considered several compromise proposals on the civil \nservice provisions in the homeland security legislation. I am strongly \nconcerned about initiatives that would weaken or interfere with the \nPresident's authority under current law to exclude Federal employees \nfrom collective bargaining if those employees are primarily involved in \nnational security work. Every President, since it became law in 1978, \nhas exercised this authority in the interest of national security. \nThere can be no argument that this new department's primary purpose and \nfocus is protecting our national security interests.\n  That said, I would strongly encourage the administration to engage in \nfurther discussions with the Federal employee unions and assuage some \nof their concerns. Information should be available on an ongoing basis \nconcerning the administration's actions and intentions regarding \ncreation and management of the new department.\n  It is my hope that before the House of Representatives and Senate \nvote on the final version of homeland security legislation, some \nprovisions can be agreed upon to lessen the tension, the fear that \nexists in the civil service ranks.\n  I have been privileged to have lived my life in Virginia, the greater \nmetropolitan area, and have had the opportunity to be in the civil \nservice in a number of positions, all the way from a letter carrier and \nforest firefighter, in 1943-1944, and service in the military to \nSecretary of the Navy, where I was privileged to have, as a part of my \ndepartment, several hundred thousand Federal service employees.\n  I guarantee you, the ranks of the Federal civil service employees are \nno less patriotic than the ranks of the military. They are fine, loyal, \nhard-working Americans. I am hopeful the distinguished manager of the \nbill and others can listen and take into consideration their concerns \nand somehow put into this bill those provisions which will lessen the \nfear and the concern among these brave citizens in our country.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, no one has been clearer or more effective \nor more concerned about trying to protect the rights of people who work \nfor the Federal Government than the Senator from Virginia. It would \nhave been easy for the Senator from Virginia to simply look the other \nway, forget about the terrorist threat, and be on the other side of \nthis issue. It has not escaped my attention many people who are \nGovernment employees work in the Senator's State.\n  I thank the Senator for making this bill, supported by the President, \nbetter by his input. I thank him for looking at the big picture. If we \ncould keep everything the way it is and provide for the national \nsecurity of the country, there would not be much of a debate. But, \nunfortunately, in real life, it is not black and white, right or wrong; \nit is tough choices.\n  Maybe it is because the Senator has the background of having been \ninvolved in defending the Nation himself,\n\n[[Page S9371]]\n\nhaving been Secretary of the Navy, or maybe it is simply because he \njust has the big picture. I thank him for his leadership on this issue.\n  I assure him, if there is any way we can work out an agreement on a \nbipartisan basis to find a solution, I want to do that.\n  There is one constraint: We cannot give the President a law that \nwon't get the job done. If he says he needs a pickup truck, we can't \ngive him this beautiful, shiny pickup truck with no steering wheel.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator. I appreciate his \nleadership and, quite frankly, his courage on this issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his very \nthoughtful remarks. If I may say, in conversations in the presence of \nthe President of the United States on this subject and the importance \nof homeland security--and I have attended several meetings along with \nother colleagues--this matter has been raised. I detect in the \nPresident no concern that Government employees are secondhand citizens, \nbut they are entitled to their rights.\n  That is the purpose of this legislative body, to bridge the gaps to \nthe extent we can and protect all the people.\n  I thank my colleague and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/26/senate-section/article/S9371-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards).

Mr. President, we are in a parliamentary posture where we \nwill have a vote tomorrow at such time as may be determined, either \nthat or an hour after we come in. The majority leader has said \nprivately and has authorized me to say publicly that we would be \nwilling to have that vote today, the reason being, of course, we have \nbeen told by the minority that we are not going to get cloture. It is \nhard to comprehend that, but that is what they said. It would seem to \nme it would be in everyone's best interest to see if that, in fact, is \nthe case today, if, in fact, we did get cloture, and the 30 hours could \nrun and it would not interfere with the duties of the other Senators, \nexcept those who wish to speak. Postcloture, a Senator has up to 1 \nhour.\n  There are lots of things going on at home. This is election time, as \nwe know. It appears to me, as I said earlier today, we have had so many \ncode words. This is a filibuster. We were told yesterday there were 30 \nspeakers on this amendment. Realistically, what amendment ever had 30 \nspeakers? There won't be 30 speakers on this amendment, but there will \nbe a lot of people moving around, stalling for time, which has happened \nnow for 4 weeks on this bill.\n  I said yesterday, and I am beginning to believe more all the time, \nand it appears clear to me, that there does not seem to be any \nintention of either the White House or the Republican majority in the \nHouse or the minority in the Senate, of wanting to move this bill \nforward.\n  There is general agreement that the bill the Senators from \nConnecticut and Tennessee came up with is a bill we should have passed \nvery quickly. There are problems that could have been resolved in the \nHouse and the Senate conference. For every day we spend talking about \nIraq--and I think we should spend some time every day talking about \nIraq and homeland security--it is 1 day we do not have to deal with the \nstumbling, staggering, faltering economy.\n  If we spend each day on issues focusing away from the economy and \nwhat needs to be done in the Senate, including doing something about \nterrorism insurance, doing something about a Patients' Bill of Rights, \nwhich the Presiding Officer worked very hard on--we need to do \nsomething on a generic drug bill. There was the fiasco that took place \nin Florida. Again, 2 years after the fiasco of all time with the \nelections, still nothing can be done because the House will not let us \ndo anything. The energy conference is moving forward by tiny steps, but \nit is one of the few things happening.\n  It is obvious to me there is an effort to do everything that can be \ndone so we do not focus on the economy. It is too bad. We can either \nformally come in later and offer the vote on the cloture motion set for \ntomorrow or do it today. But the offer is there.\n  For all the Senators worried about what is going to happen tomorrow, \nthey should understand--and I understand there are some on the other \nside who do not even care if they are here or not because they really \ndo not need them on a vote because we have to try to get 60 votes. But \nthat is OK; we will still do everything we can. On this side we are \ngoing to move forward on this bill. We will, as the leader indicated, \nwork weekends, we will work nights, whatever it takes, to try to move \nforward on this bill. I am disappointed we are being told there will \nnot be cloture on this until tomorrow.\n  That is, I repeat, only an effort to stall moving forward on this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will respond to the distinguished \nDemocratic floor leader by simply going back and reviewing the facts \nand setting out the obvious blueprint that will solve our problems. I \nremind my colleagues we have been on this bill for over 4 weeks largely \nbecause of the debate on the Byrd amendment, and not a minute of that \ntime was wasted because we were convinced by the major premise of the \nByrd amendment. In the Gramm-Miller substitute we deal with that \nproblem by maintaining the power of the purse, which is the fundamental \nconstitutional power of the Congress.\n  I am not complaining about the fact that we have spent the bulk of \nour time on an amendment that is still pending because the plain truth \nis we learned something ``we'' being Senator Miller and I. We learned \nsomething. We concluded that Senator Byrd was right on and we changed \nour substitute. By the way, we have never voted on the Byrd amendment.\n  The plain truth is the great bulk of the time we have been on this \nbill we have been debating that amendment, and it is yet to be \nresolved.\n  I remind my colleagues that Senator Thompson, the ranking Republican \non the committee, offered a simple amendment that said we ought not \ntell the President how to set up the White House. This amendment was \npartly controversial in terms of the President's National Security \nAdviser and his terrorism adviser. That amendment was, sure enough, \nadopted. But only after 6 days of delay on the part of our Democrat \ncolleagues. And then there were other delays before it was ever added \nto the bill.\n\n  The problem is, they have delayed this bill, and not us. Everybody is \nentitled to their own opinion. They are just not entitled to their own \nfacts. The weakness our colleagues on the other side of this issue have \nis that the facts are against them. What is the old deal in law? When \nthe facts are against you, argue the law.\n  What is the current holdup? The President of the United States, \nworking with a Democrat and a Republican, has spent 4 weeks listening \nto things that have been said and concerns that have been raised, \nstarting with Senator\n\n[[Page S9372]]\n\nByrd. We have made 25 major changes in the President's proposal. In \nterms of the President's personnel flexibility, we have limited his \npower to eliminate exactly the concerns that have been raised by every \nopponent of the President who has spoken out on this issue.\n  Does the fact that we have eliminated the ability to discriminate \nwhile preserving basic workers' rights in terms of being judged on \nmerit change the rhetoric of the debate? No. When people are debating, \nthey still act as if the President could be arbitrary or capricious. \nBut the point is he cannot be under our bipartisan substitute that the \nPresident supports.\n  We are at war. We were attacked on September 11. Thousands of our \npeople were killed. The President has asked us to bring together \n170,000 people in the Federal Government to help him prosecute this war \nand protect American lives.\n  After listening to many concerns, changing the President's proposal, \nand adopting 95 percent of the Lieberman proposal Senator Lieberman \nsays: You have taken 95 percent of my bill. What is wrong with it, if \nyou are for 95 percent of it?\n  It is like a nice, shiny, fancy red truck--I remember our ranking \nmember drove one in the campaign--still legendary--but it is only \nmissing a steering wheel. What Senator Miller and I have done, working \nwith some 45 of our colleagues, is we have taken that truck and we have \nput a steering wheel in it.\n  In wartime, with American lives at risk, the President of the United \nStates, asks only one thing: Give him a vote on his homeland security \nbill. Some people may view that as an extraordinarily extreme request. \nBut I submit that there is not a State in the Union, whether it is \nConnecticut or Nebraska, Tennessee, New Jersey, or North Carolina, \nwhere you could go into any coffee bar in any drugstore or restaurant, \nand sit down and gather a group of people around and ask them the \nfollowing question: When the President has asked for powers to defend \nAmerican lives during wartime, should we give him these powers that he \nsays that he needs? My guess is you would have a hard time finding \nsomebody in Nebraska who would say no.\n  All we are asking is something very different. We would like him to \nbe given the tools to do the job. We are simply asking that we have a \nvote on his proposal.\n  Our Democrat colleagues say: No, we are not going to give you an up-\nor-down vote on the President's proposal. We are going to make you vote \non it the way we want to write it, before we let you vote on it the way \nthe President wants it. Under the rules of the Senate, they can do \nthat. Under the rules of the Senate, if they have the votes, they can \ndo whatever they want to do. The Democrats have the right to deny the \nPresident an up-or-down vote. They have the right to do it under the \nSenate rules. We know at this very moment that terrorists are plotting \nthe murder of our citizens, we know this and worry about it every day. \nUnder these extraordinary circumstances, the question is not what they \nhave a right to do, but rather it is what is right to do.\n\n  Let me say this. We have this little gimmick going on. It is too cute \nby half. The gimmick is that by using the parliamentary procedure of \ncloture, they are going to put the President's proposal into a \nstraitjacket where they get to change it before it is voted on.\n  Look, I have used parliamentary procedure myself. Every Member has a \nright to do it. But do you think the American people are stupid? Do you \nthink the American people are not going to figure out what the game is \nhere? Do you think the American people are not going to get it \nstraight, that not only are you not with the man and do not support the \nPresident's request for the tools he wants, but you won't even give him \na vote on the tools? You have the power to do it under the rules of the \nSenate, but you have to have the votes, and you don't have the votes. \nSo we are going to play this game.\n  I hope everybody is watching this--I hope a lot of people are \nwatching it. I can tell you one thing. I used to think, before I got \nold, that I had reasonable political abilities. But I could not defend \nthe position of the opposition. There is no city in my State that I \ncould go into and take the position of the opponents of the President \nand walk out of there with my hat, much less with my head.\n  The bottom line is we are going to go through a little parliamentary \ngimmick tomorrow where we are going to vote on cloture to try to put \nthe President into a parliamentary straitjacket where he never gets a \nvote on his proposal. But there is a problem. It takes 60 votes to get \ncloture, and our Democrat colleagues do not have 60 votes, and they are \nnot going to get 60 votes.\n  So, rather than playing all these games while American lives are in \njeopardy, the obvious thing to do is to give us a vote. I would be \nhappy to propound a unanimous consent request to have a vote at 11 \no'clock on Tuesday, up or down, on the President's proposal. We want a \nvote on the President's proposal. Look, I know people back home. They \nare trying to pay the bills. They are trying to figure out how to get \nSarah off to school. They are not quite paying attention. But I do not \nthink they are going to believe that the President does not want his \nown proposal to be voted on. Again, they may be confused. They are not \npaying attention. They are busy. They are counting on us to do the \nright thing. But they are not stupid.\n  The way to solve this thing and get on with this bill is to do \nsomething you are going to end up doing anyway, and that is, give the \nPresident a vote.\n  Let me reiterate that no one has proposed a compromise that I have \nnot set down and talked to him about. It continues to dumbfound me that \nwe have had an issue of life and death for American citizens become a \npartisan issue. I think every person in the Chamber who has been \ninvolved in this debate will have to grudgingly say that this is true.\n  Now before somebody comes out here and starts screaming let me tell \nyou what partisan issue is. It is an issue where you draw the line \nright down the middle of the Senate and almost everybody on the left \nside of the Senate is on one side and almost everybody on the right \nside of the Senate is on the other side. That is how we define issues \nbecoming partisan.\n  How did it ever happen, when you saw the way we all felt after 9/11?\n  Let me tell you how it happened. It happened because it is not easy \nto provide for homeland security. The vote on Iraq is an easy vote \nbecause, so far as I know, there is no organized, active political \nconstituency for Saddam Hussein. He doesn't have an organized political \ngroup in America that is actively lobbying on his behalf, of which I am \naware.\n  There are some people who believe we ought to turn over American \nsecurity to the U.N. I understand that view. I reject it. When the \nlives of my people are at stake, it is my responsibility and it is the \nresponsibility of our Government. It is not the responsibility of our \nallies, not the responsibility of the U.N. I am not willing to delegate \nit to anybody else. But I respect differences of opinion.\n  But that is an easy issue compared to this issue. The reason it is an \neasy issue compared to this issue is that you cannot promote homeland \nsecurity without having to make tradeoffs.\n  That is why we are here. We all want to protect Americans. I would \nnever say--and I don't believe that my Democrat colleagues are--we are \nnot concerned about national security. The problem concerns that it is \nnot free. The problem concerns that there are tradeoffs. And the \ntradeoff is, if we are going to give the President the power to hire \nthe right person, put them in the right place, and at the right time, \nif we are going to allow the President to have the tools to fight an \nenemy that did show up anywhere and could kill thousands of our people, \nwe have to be willing to change the way we do business in a Federal \nbureaucracy.\n  The Federal bureaucracy does not want to change the way we do \nbusiness. Unlike Iraq, this is an issue where there are strong \npolitical forces that are against giving the President this power \nbecause they do not want to change the way they run their business.\n  Look, I am not going to stand up here and state that the position \nthat the rights of public employees is morally inferior to the position \nthat lives are more important than ``workers' rights.'' I believe it is \na law of order. But that is a moral judgment somebody else has to make.\n\n[[Page S9373]]\n\n  All I am saying is the reason this has become such a contentious \nissue is that we have one of the most powerful political forces in \nAmerica--the public employee labor unions and the Federal bureaucracy--\nand to have an effective homeland security system, you cannot have the \nhorse-and-buggy civil service that we have today.\n  Interestingly enough, there are only 20,000 members of the union who \nwould be among the 170,000 people who will be brought together in this \nagency. And only 20,000 of them are members of unions. Yet, remarkably, \nwe have an amendment pending that would give unions that represent \n20,000 workers veto power over the President's decision with regard to \n170,000 workers.\n  I don't think that would make a whole lot of sense where I am from, \nand I don't think it makes sense where you are from. But that is why we \nhave a battle.\n  Let me also say that I think part of our problem was, when this bill \nwas written in committee, and when it was being debated early on, \nnobody was paying much attention to it except organized special \ninterests in Washington, DC. As a result, this was written as sort of a \nbusiness-as-usual bill. But business is not usual. When workers' rights \ninterfere with people's right to their life and their freedom, then I \nthink there has to be some flexibility.\n  I am going to talk more in a moment about the bill. Maybe I should \nlet other people talk before I do. But let me just sum up by saying we \nhave been on this bill for over 4 weeks because the opponents of the \nbill have taken that tack. We have been on this bill for 4 weeks \nbecause it took 6 days to get a vote on the amendment offered by \nSenator Thompson, and even then it was 3 more days before it was added \nto the bill.\n  All we want is to have a vote on the President's proposal. We are \ngoing to get it. We can go through all kinds of games. We can fill up \nthe tree, as they say. We can use parliamentary procedure. We can try \nto get cloture and put the President in a box. But the American people \nare not going to be deceived because they are not stupid. In the end, \nthey want the President to have the tools he needs. But they are never, \never going to accept not even giving him a vote.\n  Maybe you can justify this. Maybe this makes sense where you are \nfrom. But there are a lot of things at night when I get down to say my \nprayers for which I thank God. One of them is, I don't have to defend a \nposition of the people on the other side of this issue, because I am \ntotally incapable of doing it. I don't think it is defensible.\n\n  I want to urge them once again, let us work out a compromise.\n  I am going to in a moment--this is the last point I will make because \nothers are getting ready to speak--outline why this amendment by \nSenator Nelson is anything but a compromise. I am going to outline for \nonly a moment how this totally destroys the ability of the President to \nget the job done. I think most people, when they listen to that, and \nwho are objecting, will understand what the issue is about.\n  But I have given the Senator in writing the changes he would have to \nmake for the President to be able to accept it. In the previous offer \nthat was brought forward, we gave one simple change--preserving the \nsupremacy of the President on national security. Every President since \nJimmy Carter has had the ability in the name of national security to \nmake personnel changes. But, remarkably, the Senator's amendment and \nthe underlying bill take away from President Bush powers that he had \nthe day before the terrorist attacks.\n  How many Americans would be absolutely stunned to know that in the \nname of homeland security we are debating a bill that takes away power \nfrom the President to use national security powers?\n  Somewhere, somehow, somebody's priorities have gotten way off base. \nEither the President and those of us who support him are completely \nlost in terms of any weighting of the reality of the world we are in, \nor the people who oppose the President have gotten badly off base and \nout of tune with the reality we face.\n  Obviously, I don't make the judgment about which side is lost in the \nwilderness. But I would have to say I believe the American people are \ngoing to reach the conclusion that the President is right and \nreasonable and the people who oppose him are wrong and unreasonable.\n  There is a way out of this mess. But the President can't do it alone.\n  I urge my colleagues to end this charade, reach an agreement, and let \nus have a bipartisan bill. And, if you are not willing to do that, you \nare going to have to give the President an up-or-down vote. There is no \nother way you are going to be able to do it without it. We can go \nthrough the process. We can vote on cloture tomorrow. We are not going \nto get cloture. We can do it next week. But in the end, the President \nis going to get a vote. But what the President wants is not a vote but \na compromise with one constraint--the President has only got one \nconstraint: Give me something that can work. Give me the tools to \nfinish the job. But don't give me tools that won't work. He has a \nlittle bit harder time than his opponents because their proposals don't \nhave to work. His proposals do.\n  That is my plea.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, after the exchanges that were heard on \nthe floor yesterday, I must say I hope we can come back to this debate \non homeland security and focus more directly on all the common ground \nwe have with a spirit of compromise and clearheaded perceptions that \ncan bring us together so we can get this done.\n  I find the comments of the Senator from Texas, who is about to leave \nthe floor, so full of misunderstandings or misperceptions and so full \nof inflexibility that I must respond to them.\n  The Senator talks about delay.\n  Let me just recite some history on this bill. It was in October of \nlast year--almost a year ago--that Senator Arlen Specter, our \ndistinguished Republican colleague from Pennsylvania, and I introduced \na bill, a piece of legislation, to create a Department of Homeland \nSecurity. That measure came from work our committee had done.\n  But these special interests that Mr. Gramm, the Senator from Texas, \ninvokes, throws around, they were not involved in the construction of \nthat legislation. That legislation came from public hearings we had, \nand primarily and largely from a nonpartisan citizens commission \ncreated according to legislation sponsored by the former Speaker of the \nHouse, Newt Gingrich, chaired by two distinguished former Senators, \nRepublican Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and Democrat Gary Hart of \nColorado, who suggested a Department of Homeland Security.\n  That was October. Talk about delay. The President of the United \nStates took the position then that the executive office he had created \nwith Governor Ridge could handle the urgent and enormous new \nresponsibility post-September 11 of homeland security. We respectfully \ndisagreed.\n  I must say, just to harken back to the debate of yesterday, that was \na disagreement on substance. I never would have thought to suggest that \nthe President of the United States was putting the bureaucratic \nopposition to the new Department of Homeland Security ahead of the \nnational security interests of the United States, which was suggested \nearlier this week by the President himself in referring to this \nmarginal dispute--significant but marginal dispute--that we are having \nover how best or whether to protect the rights of homeland security \nworkers.\n  So that was October, November, December, January, February, March, \nApril, May. In May, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee reported \nout a bill, based on the one Senator Specter and I put in, on a 9-to-7 \nvote, creating a Department of Homeland Security.\n  President Bush and most of my Republican colleagues--the seven \nRepublicans on the committee who voted on that--were opposed to the \nDepartment at that point.\n  Because we are talking about delay, the truth is, if we had all \ngotten together last fall, this Department would be up and protecting \nus today. But we had a difference of opinion about it.\n  On June 6, President Bush announced that he endorsed the idea of a \nDepartment of Homeland Security. That was the turning point that led us \nto what I thought was the inevitability that we\n\n[[Page S9374]]\n\nwould create such a Department because of the urgent need to do so \npost-September 11, 2001.\n  We worked together on a bipartisan basis with the White House. We \naccepted some of the changes that the White House had in our \nlegislation. We worked with colleagues on the committee and outside--\nRepublican and Democrat--to improve our bill.\n  At the end of July, after 2 days in markup, the committee reported \nout the bill. I said at that point that 90 percent of our committee \nbill was in concert, was in agreement, with what President Bush had in \nhis bill--90 percent.\n  Senator Gramm, after his considerable work on the Gramm-Miller \nsubstitute, said that--he raised me 5--95 percent of his substitute was \nthe same as our bill.\n  So can't we agree on that 5 or 10 percent on which we have \ndisagreement? Can't we come together in the interests of the urgent \nnational need for homeland security?\n  No one is delaying on this side. Right now, the reality is that the \nSenator from Texas is leading an effective filibuster against moving \nahead on this bill. And why? Because we have achieved a compromise on \nthe major outstanding point of division, which is, how do you protect \nthe rights of homeland security workers? It is a bipartisan compromise \nbecause one Senator, the courageous Senator from Rhode Island, has \ndecided that he is going to find common ground in the interest of \npreserving the national security authority of the President while \ngiving a little bit of due process to Federal workers. That is all this \ndoes.\n  I think there may be some others of our colleagues on the Republican \nside who would support this compromise because it is reasonable and it \nmeets the test that the White House set up that they did not want any \ndiminution of the President's authority. Under this compromise, there \nis none. Senator Nelson of Nebraska will speak about this in a moment. \nHe is an architect of this proposal.\n  So the fact is, my friend from Texas does not have the votes. We have \nat least 51 on our side. And for that reason, he is not going to let us \ngo ahead and vote. He asks that there be an up-or-down vote on the \nPresident's proposal, but what he is asking for is something that is \npretty much unheard of around here: Don't allow any amendments.\n  The President is a good man. The Senator from Texas is a good man. \nBut they are not infallible. None of us is infallible. The Senate has a \nright to amend. In fact, we are asking here for one amendment.\n  I wish the Senator from Texas were on the floor because I would ask \nhim, wasn't he aware that the President's proposal in the House--the \nRepublican-controlled House--didn't get voted on without amendment? \nThere were amendments offered. They improved it. The Gramm-Miller \nsubstitute changes the proposal the President initially made because \nthat is the way this process works.\n  So if there is any inflexibility here, I say, respectfully, it is on \nthe side of the Senator from Texas and those who stand with him. We are \nso close to having a reasonable compromise and a good bill to create a \nDepartment of Homeland Security. And he is right; the terrorists are \nout there. They are planning right now to do us damage. And we remain \ndangerously disorganized in the Federal Government.\n  One of the things our bill will do is to plug the gaps, close the \ninconsistencies, break down the walls that the investigation of the \nJoint Intelligence Committee has shown us contributed, I believe \nmeasurably, to the vulnerability that the terrorists took advantage of \nin September of 2001--September 11.\n  So I am sorry we are back to this futile, foolish debate. This is a \ngood compromise, the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux compromise. Senator Nelson \nwill speak to it in more detail in a moment. We agree on 90 to 95 \npercent of the underlying bill. We have the same departments. Let's get \nthis done and stop this inflexibility.\n  Mr. President, as a show of good will, I want to offer here on the \nfloor now what we informally offered to the Senator from Texas \nyesterday off the floor. He asks for something that usually does not \nhappen around here, which is an up-or-down vote in the sense of without \nthe right to amend.\n  But just to show how anxious we are to move forward, Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that immediately upon the disposition of Senator \nNelson's amendment, Senator Gramm be recognized to offer a further \nsecond-degree amendment, which is the text of the President's proposal \nas contained in amendment No. 4738, and that the Senate then vote \nimmediately on his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have \nnot had an opportunity to either consider the suggested unanimous \nconsent request or to talk to my other colleagues, some of whom are not \non the floor, who are directly involved in these negotiations. So for \nthat reason, at this time, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, that offer remains pending. I hope \nSenator Gramm will consider it. It says that the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux \namendment, compromise, would be voted on first, and then we give \nSenator Gramm the opportunity to have the President's proposal voted \non.\n  Now, is he worried that that means he might not have the votes for \nthe President's proposal without the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment on \nit?\n  I ask him to consider that because it would both give him what he \nasks for and it would allow the Senate to move forward and complete our \nbusiness, pass this legislation, get it to conference with the House, \nand create a Department of Homeland Security to protect the American \npeople.\n  There has been too much nonsense in this debate, too much \nirrelevancy, and not enough appreciation in this hour of urgent \nvulnerability for our country about how critically important it is for \nus not to do business as usual but to rise above the normal nonsense \nand do what we are supposed to do on foreign and defense policy, which \nis to forget our party labels, to leave our ideological rigidity at the \ndoor, and come here and reason together in the interest of the beloved \ncountry we are privileged to serve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity \nto be here today and speak in favor of the amendment which, together \nwith Senators Chafee and Breaux, I have submitted for consideration to \nthe homeland security debate.\n  I wish my good friend and colleague from Texas was in the Chamber \nbecause I have hunted with him. He is an excellent hunter. He is a \ngreat sharpshooter. Today his shots miss the target. The truth is, he \nis right on one point: The people of America are smart. They are smart \nenough to know that you are not entitled to your own set of facts, but \nit is pretty easy for somebody to mischaracterize or restate the facts \nin a way that will make their case.\n  That is what happened on the floor this morning. If you want to \nattack an amendment, then refer to those who support the amendment as \nopponents of the President. Everybody knows Senator Chafee, Senator \nBreaux, and I are not opponents of the President. This is an area where \nI thought we had agreement with the White House.\n  Let me characterize the facts not as I see them but as they have been \nstated by others. I refer, first, to the letter from Governor Ridge, \ndated September 5, to Senator Lieberman. I quote:\n\n       The President seeks for this new department the same \n     prerogatives that Congress has provided other departments and \n     agencies throughout the executive branch.\n\n  Then there are several examples set forth as bullets. The third \nbullet point reads:\n\n       Personnel flexibility as currently enjoyed by the Federal \n     Aviation Administration.\n\n  He also adds the Internal Revenue Service and the Transportation \nSecurity Administration.\n  This proposal adopts the language of the Internal Revenue Service in \nconnection with the reorganization of that Department. I thought we \nwere in the position to offer exactly what was being requested. I am a \nlittle bit confused about this because I happened to be presiding the \nday my good friend from Texas appeared on the floor and\n\n[[Page S9375]]\n\nsaid, with regard to providing Presidential authority: We have done the \nsame thing in the past with the Federal Aviation Administration. But \ninterestingly enough, in one area we have granted a tremendous amount \nof flexibility, when we decided to reform the Internal Revenue Service. \nWe gave the executive branch of Government tremendous flexibility in \nhiring, firing, pay, and promotion because we were so concerned about \nthe inefficiency and the potential corruption in the Internal Revenue \nService.\n  He went on to ask his colleagues, if we believed it worked there, \nthen why do we not believe it can work here?\n  That is exactly what we have offered. Now we find that is not \nacceptable.\n  I have already referred to the concern I have; that is, when the \ngoalposts are moved and the rules change in the middle of the game or \nthe circumstances around you continue to be in flux, how in the world \ncan you ever meet the expectations of the other side?\n  What my colleagues and I have tried to do is offer a compromise that \nwill bridge the gap to bring together that last 5 percent Senator \nLieberman and Senator Gramm referred to, to close the gap, fill the \nlast 5 percent, end the debate, and do what we need to do--vote to pass \na homeland security bill so it can go to conference and we can have \nnational security.\n  It has been suggested that perhaps we are not as interested in \nnational security as we are in other interests. National security is \nnot only the primary interest, it is the driving force behind the \nhomeland security bill. It has been suggested that there is another \ninterest, as though that is going to take away from national security.\n  That is not going to take away from national security because this \namendment provides enough support for the President's powers, the \nPresident's authority to do what the President needs to do. It is \nconsistent with what Governor Ridge has suggested, and it is consistent \nwith what our good friend and colleague from Texas asked for on the \nfloor of the Senate over a week ago.\n  Characterization is important. But the important thing the American \npeople understand is that on the floor of the Senate sometimes losing \nbecomes winning. While the same set of facts are stated there, they can \nbe characterized in different ways. You have seen a characterization \ntoday that is different than what the facts truly are.\n  It is hard to find another interpretation from what my good friend, \nthe Senator from Texas, has said on the floor of the Senate or what \nGovernor Ridge has written very clearly in his letter.\n  It seems to me we can, in fact, close the gap, stop the debate, and \nmove forward and pass this legislation.\n  Senator Lieberman made a good point: In the Congress of the United \nStates, it is rare that a bill that is introduced in one form is in \nthat same form by the time it has completed its process. There are \namendments. There are amendments because there are different ideas in \nwhich we try to approach these very important issues, to find \nlegislation that will solve the problems we face.\n\n  This bill is different now than it was at the very beginning. I can \ntell you today that, if we can accept this amendment, we can, in fact, \nclose the gap.\n  I have met with Senator Gramm. He is absolutely right. He has always \noffered to meet to discuss this or any other issue to see if we can \nclose the gap. We are continuing to have discussions. I hope we are \nable to close the gap. But if the conditions change, it is very \ndifficult to close the gap.\n  I hope we will be able to move beyond what appear to be partisan \nremarks this morning to what will be American remarks about how we can \nfind a solution--not to characterize it as Republican or Democrat, but \nto characterize it as an American solution to an American problem \nfacing the American people. And it is the American way to debate, \ncompromise, and ultimately come up with a solution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I would like to directly respond to the \nSenator from Nebraska. As I understand his point, it is that his \ncompromise, which is looked upon as the bipartisan compromise because a \nRepublican has joined in it--what Senator Gramm's efforts have done, \nalong with Senator Miller, apparently is not looked upon as a \nbipartisan compromise, even though a Democrat has joined in that; that \nis just a matter of terminology--the Nelson compromise purports to give \nthe President flexibility because it gives the President flexibility \nthat the IRS has.\n  He is absolutely right. The IRS has been mentioned in conjunction \nwith this debate as one of those agencies where we have given the \nPresident flexibility.\n  What the Senator fails to point out is that also a part of that \ndebate has been the discussion of other agencies where we have given \nthe President much more flexibility than we have given the IRS.\n  The flexibility we gave the IRS was hotly contested and hotly \ndebated, but the IRS had so many problems. They had spent billions of \ndollars trying to get their computers to talk to each other. We had \nhearings about their problems. This is one agency now. This is just one \norganization. Because of all the difficulties they had, we decided to \ngive them flexibility with regard to pay, hiring, and some other items. \nBut as a part of that, there was a procedure that required negotiation \nwith the employees union. It required, I believe, a written agreement, \nand it required, if an agreement was not reached, it had to go before \nthe Federal Services Impasses Panel.\n  The Senator adopted those provisions and put it in the compromise and \nsaid: OK, we have given you what the IRS has.\n  The only problem with that is we have given flexibility to the FAA, \nwe have given flexibility to the Transportation Security Agency, we \nhave given flexibility to the GAO, none of which require the head of \nthose agencies to go before the Federal Services Impasses Panel.\n  It is only with regard to the IRS and a hotly contested compromise \nthat we placed that burden on the leadership of IRS. In these other \nagencies where we gave additional flexibility, we did not put the \nimpasses panel as a part of that. So our friends on the other side find \none area where the people running the Department have to go through \nadditional hurdles to interject any flexibility, and they adopt that \none instead of the example we have given in other agencies.\n  What about that? Maybe we made the right decision with regard to the \nIRS and the wrong decision with the GAO, the wrong decision on FAA, the \nwrong decision on TSA. What is the right decision?\n  Let's forget about the fact that it is 3 to 1. Let's ask ourselves, \nwhat is the right decision?\n  I point out that we are not trying to fix one dysfunctional agency. \nGoodness knows, the Government is full of them. Instead of addressing \nthem in a general fashion, what we have done is when they get so bad, \nthey come before us and we give them something, some flexibility of one \nkind or another. But we are not trying to do that here.\n  What the President is trying to do and what the Gramm-Miller \nsubstitute amendment is trying to do is to pull together 170,000 \nFederal employees, requiring the coordination of 17 different unions, \n77 existing collective bargaining agreements--77 existing collective \nbargaining agreements--7 payroll systems, 80 different personnel \nmanagement systems, an overwhelming task under any circumstances.\n  Are we to equate that with the IRS, especially in light of the fact \nwe impose these same requirements on these other agencies to which we \ngave flexibility? The IRS example should not be the high water mark. \nThe IRS example is the low water mark. That is the least flexibility we \ncan give, less than what we gave to these other agencies and certainly \nless than what we should give the President when we are reorganizing an \nentire major section of the Government involving 77 different \ncollective bargaining agreements, 7 payroll systems, and 80 different \npersonnel management systems.\n  We are comparing elephants to peanuts. With what are we left? We are \nleft with a system that takes the crux of the labor-management \ndifficulties we have seen in times past where we spend months and years \nnegotiating\n\n[[Page S9376]]\n\nitems in these collective bargaining agreements, such as color of \nuniforms, whether or not the smoking area should be lit and heated, \nwhether or not the cancellation of the annual picnic was in violation \nof the collective bargaining agreement. It took 6 years on an army base \nin St. Louis to resolve that one.\n\n  With regard to issues such as those, collective bargaining and the \nmyriad levels of appeals and the indefinite amount of time it takes, \nall the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, if they can get \nthat far, this compromise so-called takes that totally off the table--\ntotally off the table. This compromise does not allow the new Homeland \nSecurity Department to make any changes with regard to labor-management \nrelations under chapter 71 or with regard to appeals under chapter 77.\n  If one looks at page 3, at least in the copy I have, of the \namendment, chapter 97, Department of Homeland Security, my friend from \nNebraska and his colleagues establish a human resources management \nsystem. OK, sounds good so far because, goodness knows, we need to \nestablish a new system. We have seen the failures of the past, the \ncreations of the 1920s and the 1940s that some would insist we bring \nover lock, stock, and barrel into the 21st century.\n  Then it says: Any new system established under this subsection shall, \none, be flexible; two, be contemporary but not waive, modify, or \notherwise affect a whole list of items, including labor-management \nrelations, chapter 71, and the appeals section under chapter 77.\n  There are many other issues that are taken off the table, too: \nchapter 41, chapter 45, chapter 47, chapter 55, chapter 57, chapter 59, \nchapter 72, chapter 73, chapter 79. This bill takes all of those off \nthe table and says you cannot touch them in your new system.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Tennessee yield for \na question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have been trying to determine whether the provisions \nof the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment supplements the provisions to \ntitle 5 of 7103(b)(1) which says:\n\n       The President may issue an order excluding any agency or \n     subdivision thereof from coverage under this chapter if the \n     President determines that--\n       (A) the agency or subdivision has as a primary function \n     intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national \n     security work, and\n       (B) the provisions of this chapter cannot be applied to \n     that agency or subdivision in a manner consistent with \n     national security requirements and considerations.\n\n  The language submitted by the Nelson amendment says: The President \ncould not use his authority without showing that the mission and \nresponsibilities of the agency or subdivision materially changed and, \ntwo, a majority of such employees within such agency or subdivision \nhave as their primary duty intelligence, counterintelligence, or \ninvestigative work directly related to terrorist investigation.\n  If I might have the attention also of the Senator from Connecticut, I \nhad raised this question with the Senator from Connecticut and also the \nSenator from Nebraska, or talked to their staff, and have been told \nthat the provisions of the Nelson amendment supplement which is now in \nexisting law.\n  I have been advised by people from the administration personnel \ndepartment that the Nelson provision replaces existing law which then \nwould leave out the language of national security requirements.\n  My question to one of the managers of the bill, the Senator from \nTennessee who has the floor, is whether this is a replacement for or an \naddition to?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Let me address it first, if I may.\n  I don't know whether you would call it a replacement, total \nreplacement, or an addition to. The significant thing, in answer to the \nSenator's question, under any definition it is a diminution of the \nPresident's authority from existing law. It is a diminution in this \nway: Under existing law, the President can make a determination that an \nagency or a subdivision of an agency is primarily involved in \nintelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security \nwork, and he can set aside the collective bargaining agreement.\n  Under the Nelson amendment, there is an additional requirement for \nthe President. He must also go through the requirement of determining \nthe mission and responsibility of the agency materially changed.\n  If you have a situation where a person was, in times past, doing a \ncertain thing, and he is going to be brought into the new agency--and \nperhaps he is doing pretty much the same job; his job has not changed \nthat much. What has changed is the rest of the world. September 11 \nchanged it. Our heightened requirement in security changed.\n  That whole job where the President has not exercised his authority in \ntimes past might take on a different dimension, although he is doing \nthe same job. In the first place, the President might not be able to \nmake this finding. In the second instance, he would be setting himself \nup for another hurdle, for someone to challenge him in court.\n  I believe the Senator will agree there has been one instance under \ncurrent law where people have gone to court to challenge the President, \nand the President and persons got an arbitrary and capricious standard \novercome. It is a tough challenge for a plaintiff to overcome, but the \nPresident has to go in there and made a determination as to how much he \nsays. We are talking about national security. How much do you divulge? \nHow much can you get in camera and all of that business? That is \ncurrent law.\n  Under this, he has an additional establishment that he has to make \nthat there is a material change, not with regard to the work of the \nagency, as in current law, but with regard to the majority of the \nemployees working in that agency.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Tennessee \nthat there is an additional requirement. I might differ with him as to \nhow substantial it is.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If I could add to my answer, under present law the \nPresident has the authority to make that determination based on the \nprimary function of an agency involving national security. Under this, \nnational security does not appear. It says primary duty: intelligence, \ncounterintelligence, or investigative work. It does not say national \nsecurity.\n  What it does say is that it must be directly related to terrorism. \nTerrorism is important. But there are national security concerns that \ndo not necessarily have to do with terrorism. It is a limiting of the \ncircumstances under which a President can make a determination.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if the international security \nconsideration is stricken, there is an enormous difference. But that \ngoes to the basic question as to whether this is in place of or in \naddition to. If there is a national security consideration, it is \nnonjustifiable. You cannot take appeals.\n\n  All the President has to do is come to court and say it is national \nsecurity. If national security is not in the requirement, then you get \ninto the arbitrary capriciousness, et cetera, on administering appeals.\n  Perhaps, if I might have the attention of the Senator from Tennessee, \nI think in listening to the Senator and looking at this, in regard to \nwhat you are talking about, it is clearly a replacement. It would be \nclearly redundant if it were not. It says: No agency shall be excluded \nas a result of the President's authority unless the President \nestablishes these things.\n  I don't see how it could be more clear. I don't see how it could rest \nside by side with current law.\n  If it is a ``replacement,'' it makes an enormous difference.\n  I was on the floor earlier in morning business saying if it is in \naddition to, it is a diminution of the President's power but not very \nmuch because of the similarity. But if it is a substitute for--Senator \nNelson is on the floor. If I might have leave of the Senator from \nTennessee to direct the question to Senator Nelson or Senator \nLieberman, is it a substitute for or in addition to?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If I may do so without yielding my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, responding to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, I will begin and still leave the floor with Senator \nThompson. I think Senator Nelson may want to respond also.\n  It is my understanding that it is the clear intention of the sponsors \nof what\n\n[[Page S9377]]\n\nI call the Morella-Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment that it supplement, \nnot replace, existing language.\n  I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, this concern he expresses is \nreal. This is a concern that does not go to the intentions of the \nsponsors of the amendment. I have not talked to him, but let us reason \ntogether how we can make clear in this legislation, in this amendment, \nwhat the intentions are. It is not to alter this.\n  If I were to describe--and I stand to be corrected by the sponsors of \nthe amendment--if I were to describe what the amendment does in this \nregard, regarding collective bargaining rights, it says to the \napproximately 43,000 to 47,000 currently unionized employees of various \ndepartments that will be moved to the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity--and remember, some of these people have worked for decades; \nsome have worked for a few years--while the existing authority that \nthis President, the previous President, all Presidents back to \nPresident Carter have had, to suspend collective bargaining rights in \nthe interest of national security, these folks have continued to keep \ntheir jobs and be in unions because no previous President has believed \nthat national security was inconsistent with their jobs being \nunionized.\n  All we are saying in this compromise amendment is to now, simply \nbecause they have been moved from where they are--Border Patrol, \nCustoms agents, FEMA, Coast Guard, civilian employees, whatever--they \nhave been moved to the Department of Homeland Security, to take their \nright to belong to a union away, you have to show their job has \nchanged.\n  The President has to declare it and that is it. There is no appeal.\n  That is my understanding of the intention of the amendment. But on \nthe question, Is the amendment supplementary or does it replace, it is \nintended to be supplementary. We will work with the Senator from \nPennsylvania to make that clear.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Tennessee would mind if the cosponsor of \nthe amendment spoke.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Without losing my right.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. If I might respond, I agree with my friend \nand colleague from Connecticut. It is our intent this be additional \nauthority, an additional opportunity for the President to make a \ndecision about national security. I agree also that were it to be \nappealed, the national security would just simply eliminate the appeal. \nI am confident.\n  If it is not as clear as it needs to be, we will certainly, with our \ngood friend from Pennsylvania, help make it clear. Perhaps this will \nresolve the concern the White House has about this language. Our goal \nis to make it supplemental.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I think it is very clear it is a supplement to the \nexisting language in section 7103. If you read our amendment it says \nthat:\n\n       No agency or subdivision of an agency which is transferred \n     to the Department pursuant to this Act shall be excluded from \n     the coverage of chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, as \n     a result of any order issued under section 7103(b)(1).\n\n  Section 7103(b)(1) is the existing language setting out what the \nPresident has to do. Ours is added to that. So it doesn't replace the \noriginal 7103(b)(1). That is still intact. This is a supplement to that \nand is to be read in connection with both of them together. The \nPresident makes that determination and it is his decision. It is like a \nteacher giving a test and the teacher is grading the test. The \nPresident in this case is the teacher and he grades his own test. He \nmakes that determination and they are both to be read together, so \nnational security is still a part of it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have one additional question, if I \nmight.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Before we get off that point, it doesn't matter if you \ncall it in addition or supplement to. It places requirements on the \nPresident and the hurdles before the President that are not in existing \nlaw.\n  Do you or do you not, in this amendment, require the President to \nestablish the mission and responsibilities of the agency have \nmaterially changed?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a response to that?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The answer is yes. But I would also say, the point you \nmade earlier, if you have the same agency today that, somehow, because \nthings have changed in this country, is in fact moved to a different \nlocation, they are doing the same type of work, but instead of doing it \nwith regard to domestic security they are doing it because of an \noutside threat by terrorists, for instance, that mission has \nsubstantially changed. Their mission is no longer to stop, perhaps, \nMexicans from crossing the U.S. border into Texas. Their mission is now \nto stop terrorists from entering the United States. That mission has \nsubstantially changed. That meets the test. Who gives the test? The \nPresident. Who grades the test? The President. So that mission has \nchanged if the enemy has changed. That is very clear. It is a decision \nthe President would make.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If I may respond to that, the ultimate arbiter is not \nthe President in this case. It is some Federal district judge. If the \nSenator from Louisiana was making this determination, I would be \nsatisfied and happy and content the right conclusion would come. But \nthe Senator has just given a scenario of his opinion as to what would \nconstitute material change. Others may or may not agree with that. But \nthere can be no dispute there is an additional requirement placed on \nthe President.\n  You can argue it is justified, that we didn't place that requirement \non Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton or the former President Bush or Ronald \nReagan, but we are going to place it on this President at this time. \nYou can make that argument. But I must say I have difficulty in seeing \nhow one can argue this does not place additional requirements on this \nPresident to make additional determinations, on the one hand, and \nwith regard to a more narrow area of things, that is terrorism, on the \nother.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The point is it is for the last 30 years under the \nexisting law the President having to make this decision, that it has \nalways been possible to go to Federal court under Federal law if \nsomeone thought the President hadn't met the existing standard. They \ncould take him to court. We are not changing that at all. In the last \n30 years there has been one case. The one case ultimately said the \nPresident was within his authority to do exactly what he wanted to do--\none case in 30 years.\n  The existing law says the standard the President has to meet is \nalways subject to going to court saying he didn't meet the standard. We \nare not changing that at all.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I may say in response, the issue is not jurisdiction of \nthe court, whether you go to court. I agree with that. The issue is \nwhat happens once you get there. Under the current law, all the \nPresident has to establish is as an agency it is primarily involved in \nnational security.\n  Under this amendment, the President would have to establish something \nsimilar to that, and, in addition, the primary purpose of most of the \nemployees within that agency had changed. That is a factual \ndetermination that is a colossal headache. It is a hurdle.\n  Again, you can say the President ought to have that additional hurdle \nat this time. But again I hardly see how one can make the argument this \nis not a change in existing law and we are opening up, not just one but \nat least two, avenues for Federal district court recommendations.\n  Mr. BREAUX. May I make one final point and then I will sit down.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am happy to yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I think we are probably not going to agree on this. I \nsuggest to the distinguished ranking member, what we need around here \nis a little law and order, and perhaps we could go ahead and vote on \nit. We could resolve it very quickly. Let's just vote on it and then \nmove on to the next step.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I agree with that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. One additional question.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Gramm had made the comment in his earlier \npresentation that every President since President Carter has had the \npower to\n\n[[Page S9378]]\n\nmake personnel decisions on national security grounds. We have just had \na discussion with some of the people from the personnel department. We \nhave been cited to no authority as to the personnel decisions under \nchapter 43, chapter 51, chapter 53, chapter 75 and chapter 77. These \nare all provisions of the Gramm bill. The only exception for national \nsecurity is one on labor relations--labor-management relations in \nchapter 71.\n  The question I have for the manager of the bill, the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee, is whether he knows of any provision, statutory \nprovision or other provision, which will give the President the \nauthority to make personnel decisions on national security grounds?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I know of no other. Obviously, if I am proven incorrect \non that, we will supplement this record. But this is clearly the area--\nwhich points out the importance of it, which points out the whole \npersonnel issue--getting the right people in the right place at the \nright time with the right pay and the right responsibilities and the \nright accountability is what this is all about. Therefore, Congress--\nmany years ago, President Kennedy signed the bill--decided that the \nPresident should have the right, in personnel, with regard to matters \nof national security. And even broader than that: Intelligence, \ncounterintelligence, and investigative, which is something I know my \nfriend from Pennsylvania knows a great deal about--investigative.\n\n  I do not know whether that has ever been exercised, that particular \nprovision, but it is a pretty broad provision. Every President since \nJimmy Carter has exercised that provision. As far as I know, it has not \nbeen controversial.\n  This President Bush exercised it not too long ago with regard to the \nU.S. attorneys. There was a hue and cry that went up. It was said they \nmay be prosecuting terrorists and we may have to move them around \nsomewhat and all that. Well and good, but you included the secretaries.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That was on collective bargaining, was it not, as \nopposed to personnel?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I beg your pardon?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The President exercised his authority under national \nsecurity grounds on a collective bargaining issue as opposed to a \npersonnel issue?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. You could say that, but it was under this (B)(3) \nauthority on national security grounds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Correct.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. The secretaries were a part of the unit and the \nassistant U.S. attorneys wanted to be organized. I am not familiar with \nthat concept. When I was assistant U.S. attorney, when I was brought \nin. I stayed as long as they wanted me or I wanted to stay. When they \nelected another President, I was gone. Nowadays we have a civil service \nsystem and folks there were trying to take it one step further and \nunionize.\n  In light of what is going on in the world, the determination was made \nit is not a good idea to have people prosecuting terrorists, bogged \ndown with negotiating some of these things, some of which are quite \nfoolish, we have been describing. For better or for worse, that \ndecision was made.\n  The secretaries were incorporated because the President's authority \nonly goes to taking action with regard to agencies or subdivisions of \nthe agencies. So the suggestion was made to the union representatives \nat that time, as I understand it, in talking to the OPM people, let's \nchange the law so we can carve out secretaries. And they said: Oh, no, \nno, no. We don't want to do that.\n  We do not like the issue framed just the way it is. That created some \ncontroversy with regard to the only time this President has exercised \nauthority there. But as far as I know, historically, all Presidents \nhave exercised it. It happens to be controversial.\n  I simply do not understand. If we are going to debate whether or not \nthis is merely supplemental, and we don't want to really do anything \nwith regard to the President's authority, why in the world can't we go \nback to the traditional authority that every President has had?\n  What is the message we are sending to the American people? Do some of \nour colleagues distrust this President who seems to have the trust of \nthe American people with regard to matters of life and death? From all \nthe polls I can read, I think he is doing the best he can. I think all \nPresidents always do the best they can. We rally around them in times \nof war and in times of great national issues.\n  Do we really want to be fighting for days on end as to whether or not \nyou can say it is significant or you can say it is insignificant? You \ncan say it is in addition to, you can say it is a modification, and you \ncan say it is supplemental. But do we really want to change that now \nfor the sake of--if it is not 40,000 union employees, it is 20,000--\nthose who are in bargaining units? Only 20,000 are union members out of \n170,000.\n  My colleagues who support the Nelson amendment would suggest that we \nput up these additional hurdles with regard to the President's national \nsecurity authority only with regard to homeland security. The area \nwhere he needs the authority the most is the only waiver area which \nthey would take away. The Labor Department is not affected by this. The \nEnergy Department is not affected by this. It is only the homeland \nsecurity area. I have great difficulty in understanding the wisdom \nbehind doing that at this time.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a further \nquestion?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have heard this debate. It reminds me \nof why I didn't go to law school. It is easier to hire people with the \nexpertise of the Senators here who have gone to law school to try to \nexplain this than it is to understand it yourself.\n  I have a very simple question coming from a more simple attitude \nabout this whole thing. Is it not true that the President of the United \nStates has said he will veto this bill if it has this in it? If that is \nthe fact, it doesn't matter if we have 99.400-percent agreement on \neverything else. The legislation is not going to go forward.\n  I ask the Senator from Tennessee, who is in closer touch with the \nWhite House than I am, if it is not true that the President said he \nwill veto this bill if this is in it?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. That is my understanding. I think it is important to \nunderstand the rationale behind that.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am not challenging that. I don't want to trigger \nanother discussion of all the rationality. I want to cut to the \nquestion that the Senator from Connecticut asked: Why can't we come \ntogether, as we always do with legislation, and get this thing moving \nforward? I ask the Senator from Tennessee, Should we be aware of the \nfact that, right or wrong, the President, as is his right under the \nConstitution, has made his intentions very clear? And shouldn't we be \npaying attention to that as we make our negotiations as well as all the \nother issues that have been discussed on the floor?\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes. Indeed. I do not think any of us want to spend all \nthis time and effort on something that basically we think ought to \nhappen in terms of reorganization of an important part of Government \nfor naught and go before the American people and say we have failed \nbecause we insist on the status quo with regard to managing this thing \nbut not the status quo with regard to the President's national security \nauthority.\n  I can't read the President's mind. We learned that our CIA Director \ndeclared war to his people some time ago, and he is taking a lot of \ncriticism and abuse, quite frankly, from some of our people who are our \nallies--one, in particular, I think in a particularly shameless \nfashion, in order to get reelected in Germany, has said some things \nwhich I think is going to haunt the relationship between the United \nStates and Germany for a while. In the midst of all that--albeit he was \ntalking about the Iraq issue and not this one--I think it put the \nPresident in a difficult position when we are spending all this time \ndebating.\n  Again, this is the one area where we do not like status quo. Whether \nit is small, whether it is large, whether you slice it thin or you \nslice it thick, any way you cut it, it is additional steps that the \nPresident has to make, and additional opportunities for somebody to \ntake into court, and things of that nature.\n  I don't think it says there is no basis for a President saying he is \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S9379]]\n\nveto something and I wouldn't support him just because he threatened a \nveto. I am sure that I have opposed Presidents who threatened vetoes \nbefore. My attitude was to let them veto it because I didn't think it \nwas sound, or I didn't think there was a rationale for it.\n  I am not afraid to say that one should look past that. I think it is \ngoing to be extremely difficult to go before the American people to \nexplain why we insist on passing something that the President says he \nwon't sign. But it is even more important that we look at the \nunderlying rationale.\n  I have been on the Governmental Affairs Committee ever since I have \nbeen in the Senate. The thing I leave the Senate with--the sentiment, \nthe idea, the notion, the feeling--is how difficult it is to make even \na little change in the way Government works.\n  We have seen from Department to Department to Department overlap, \nduplication, billions of dollars wasted, $20 billion in 1 year, \ndysfunction, inability to incorporate information technology systems \nthat private industry has been able to do for years, and human capital \ncrises. We are going to be losing 45 percent of our workforce in about \n5 years. We are keeping the wrong people and losing the right people. \nAnd we can't pay people what we ought to be paying them. We have seen \nall of that happen in the operation of government services, money, and \nso forth. It will hurt us if we incorporate all of that into this new \nhomeland security bill.\n  You take all of that history, all those GAO reports, all of those IG \nreports we have seen year after year saying the Government is a mess in \nmany respects, and it cannot pass an audit. It is a management mess. \nPeople say ``Tut, tut.'' And you see an article in the paper every once \nin a while.\n  We bring them down and chastise them. They go back for another year. \nThe next year they come back, they are still on the high-risk list and \nnothing has changed.\n  Take that in context then to the President. We are at war. We now \nperceive the need to organize our Government--at least a part of our \nGovernment--in a different way. We see that old systems in many \nrespects simply need to be redone.\n  We have a President who the American people are behind and support, \nand we still can't make any change in our system in terms of how we \nmanage this new Department, in terms of a civil service system that \nPaul Volcker down at Brookings--it is not a conservative, liberal \nthing--Paul Volcker and everybody agrees is a broken system that \nunderwhelms itself at every task it takes. And we still, at long last, \neven in light of this history of failure, even with the loss of \nthousands of Americans, even if we agreed on the need to reorganize, \ncan't make any changes in a system that is at the heart of the changes \nthat need to be made.\n  The right people with the right pay and the right motivation and \nright accountability at the right place at the right time is what it is \nall about. Yet we are endangering--as we endanger as we speak--not \nbeing able to pass a bill to do one thing at long last.\n  I fear for my country. Once this issue is over, I fear that it will \nbe so difficult to make any changes in the way the Government operates \nthat it is going to collapse administratively of its own weight. There \nis enough fault to go around. There are a lot of years. This did not \nhappen overnight. But that is the only way, apparently, that we can \nchange anything around here. We cannot come together and agree on \nchanges that need to be made, apparently.\n  I fear for my Government because if we cannot administer these \ndepartments, and we cannot make them run, we cannot get the right kind \nof people in the right places, none of this other stuff will work.\n  It all gets back to personnel. You say: Well, we're OK 90, 95 \npercent. That 5 percent is the nut that holds the propeller on the \nairplane. It is just a little nut--bolt, let's say--it is very small in \nweight in comparison to the weight of the airplane, but it is just what \nholds everything together.\n  It is a depressing situation when, in light of all this, at long \nlast, we are hung up on some of these issues. The other side says: \nWell, you shouldn't be hung up. You ought to agree with us. And we are \nsaying the same thing. But I will just pass on the merits of the case \nfor a moment.\n  We are not making much progress on doing things differently than we \nhave done before, except with regard to the President's national \nsecurity authority--we ought to diminish that somewhat.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator yield the floor without losing his \nright to the floor for a moment?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from Tennessee.\n  I want to take a moment to try to answer the very good question the \nSenator from Utah has asked which is, regardless of what our positions \nare on this particular amendment--Nelson-Chafee-Breaux, a bipartisan \namendment--hasn't the President said he would veto the bill if it was \nattached? I have not heard that specifically with regard to this \namendment. Maybe I missed it. And I am glad I have not heard it because \nof the history I want to recite now.\n  The President, or somebody in the White House--maybe the President \nhimself--said if the bill, as it came out of our committee, had the \nprovisions with regard to Federal employees, homeland security workers, \nin it, that the President probably would veto the bill.\n  I must say when that was said and the media asked me about it. I \nsaid: I can't believe the President would veto this bill based on that \ndifference because we agree on 90 to 95 percent of the components of \nthe bill. It is creating a new Department. We all agree it is urgent. \nLet's get it done. We can argue about this.\n  As a matter of fact, Governor Ridge was good and honorable enough to \nsay to me at a meeting about this subject a week or 2 ago: I do \nremember at the beginning you, Senator Lieberman, said to me, Please, \nlet's not get into a fight over civil service. Let's pass the bill. And \nthen we can come back in 6 months--in fact, our committee bill requires \nthe new Secretary to come back in 6 months.\n  OK. We went ahead. We adopted the Voinovich-Akaka bipartisan reform \non civil service in our committee bill. But we did not give the \nPresident any of the waivers he asked for and other provisions of civil \nservice.\n\n  On the question of this extraordinary authority that Presidents have \nhad since President Carter to remove collective bargaining rights, we \nset up essentially an appeals process to a Federal board, the FLRA, of \nwhich the President appoints two of the three members. That is the one \nthe President made clear he believed would be a cut in his national \nsecurity authority and said he would veto.\n  We came to the floor in a spirit of compromise, with my full \nencouragement. Senator Nelson and Senator Breaux began to see if we \ncould find some common ground with the White House and the folks on the \nother side of the aisle. And there was substantial movement. In fact, I \nthink we have been quite flexible in that regard. We may disagree, but \none thing I want to say is, at least as I interpret it, we have ended \nup with a compromise amendment which does not at all diminish the \nnational security authority of this President or any future President \nif it is passed.\n  With regard to civil service, it gives the President new authority to \nchange civil service law. It asks that, as we have done quite \nsuccessfully with the IRS--and it is done in the public sector all the \ntime--the best way to get changes in work rules is to not shove them \ndown the throats of workers; try to negotiate them.\n  So this bill says: Try to negotiate them with your workers. And if \nthat does not work, send it to the Federal Services Impasses Panel, \nwhich has seven members, all appointed by the current President. So it \nis not a hostile board.\n  In regard to the collective bargaining rights, we say now--and there \nis no appeal to the board I mentioned before. The compromise says the \nPresident has to make his case, incidentally, not just job by job; the \norder is he simply has to claim that the mission and responsibilities \nof the agency or subdivision have materially changed, as Senator Breaux\n\n[[Page S9380]]\n\nsaid, and the majority of the employees within the agency are involved \nin national security work. That is final.\n  Incidentally, there has been one court case, as Senator Breaux said--\nwe are going to get it, look at it, and maybe enter it in the Record--\nwhich said the substantive determination on a question of national \nsecurity is not reviewable by a court.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I didn't know we had the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Through the courtesy of the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. The Senator does not have the floor. That is OK. I will \nbe happy to yield to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I don't want to belabor this any longer. But I say to the \nranking member, there is only one case out of the 30 years where the \nPresident's authority was ever challenged to do what he did in moving \nemployees around. And in that case, which was a case in the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia, on the question of whether the \nPresident had proved the reason for making the decision that he made, \nthe court said--I will have it printed in the Record--\n\n       The executive order under review cited accurately the \n     statutory source of authority therefor, and purported to \n     amend an earlier order that indubitably was . . . proper. . . \n     .The act does not itself require or even suggest that any \n     finding be reproduced in the order.\n\n  I would say, in layman's language, that basically said: Look, once \nthe President says I am doing this because the mission and \nresponsibilities have materially changed, he does not have to make a \nfinding. That statement in itself is a declaration that the court looks \nto only. It does not require any supporting findings or any other \ndetermination other than the President citing the statute by which he \nhas made that decision. And that is the only decision we had on this \nissue by a court of appeals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that decision be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, International \n Council of U.S. Marshals Service Locals, 210 et al. v.

The \n     Act itself exempted several federal agencies from coverage; \n     n3 additionally Section [*725] 7103 (b)(1) authorized the \n     President, under specified conditions, to make further \n     exceptions:\n       The President may issue an order excluding any agency or \n     subdivision thereof from coverage under this chapter if the \n     President determines that--\n       (A) The agency or subdivision has as a primary function \n     intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national \n     security work; and\n       (B) The provisions of this chapter cannot be applied to \n     that agency or subdivision in a manner consistent with \n     national security requirements and considerations. n4\n       nl See Exec. Order No. 10,988, 3 C.F.R. 321 (1959-1963).\n       n2 Pub. L. No. 95-454, tit. VII, 92 Stat. 1111, 1191-1218 \n     (1978) (codified at 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 7101 et seq.

Sec. 7103(b)(1).\n       In 1979, President Carter issued Executive Order 12171 n5 \n     which, after paraphrasing Section 7103(b)(1), eliminated a \n     number of agencies and subdivisions from coverage. In 1986, \n     President Reagan promulgated Executive Order 12559, which \n     undertook to amend the 1979 order to exclude certain \n     subdivisions of the United States Marshals Service. n6 \n     Appelles then instituted an action in the District Court \n     attacking the legality of the latter order. The court \n     rejected their claim that federal marshals are not engaged in \n     protection of the national security, and consequently that \n     the order was invalid on this account, ruling instead that \n     judicial authority to reassess the facts underlying the order \n     was lacking. n7 The court concluded, however, that it \n     retained ``general power to ensure that the authority was \n     correctly invoked,'' n8 and that this necessitated \n     measurement of the order by the conditions specified in \n     Section 7103(b)(1). n9 The court held that inclusion in the \n     order of the President's determinations was a condition \n     precedent to lawful exercise of the power, n10 only in this \n     way, the court felt, could it be demonstrated [**4] that the \n     circumstances contemplated by the Act existed. n11 The court \n     further held that Executive Order 12559 was not saved merely \n     by the fact that it sought only to amend the 1979 order, \n     which did contain the recitation * * * necessary, n12 \n     Accordingly, the court granted summary judgment in favor of \n     appellees, n13 and appellants came here.\n       n5 3 C.F.R. 458 (1979).\n       n6 In relevant part, Exec.

In 1988, after the District Court ruled, the \n     President issued Executive Order 12632, which provides for \n     the same exclusions that Executive Order 12559 does, and \n     contains all that the court deemed essential. n14 Since \n     [*726] the 1988 order conforms fully to the court's standard, \n     the question areas whether a controversy still exists. \n     Appellants, while maintaining that the 1986 order remains \n     [**6] valid, assert that the 1988 order fully resolves the \n     dispute over validity of the 1986 order, and urge us to \n     vacate the District Court's judgment and dismiss the appeal. \n     n15\n       n14 Exec.

(filed Mar 28, 1988) at 2-5.\n       Important collateral consequences flowing from the 1986 \n     order lead us to the conclusion that the controversy remains \n     very much alive. Since issuance of the 1986 order, the \n     Marshals Service has unilaterally abrogated the collective \n     bargaining agreement as to affected deputy marshals, thereby \n     depriving them of grievance procedures and other benefits, \n     and has terminated checkoff of union dues, to the serious \n     financial detriment of the union. n16 On this account, \n     appellees have filed unfair labor practice charges with the \n     Federal Labor Relations Authority, n17 which is holding the \n     charges in abeyance pending the outcome of this appeal. n18 \n     Resolution of the charges depends up the validity of the 1986 \n     order--the precise question now before us.\n\n[[Page S9381]]\n\n       n16 Plaintiffs-Appellees' Response to Suggestion of \n     Mootness, AFGE v.

Appellants do not take issue with these unexceptional \n     holdings, and we merely observe that they land no assistance \n     in solving the problem confronting us. [**9]\n       [*727] Section 7103(b)(1) makes clear that the President \n     may exclude an agency from the Act's coverage whenever he \n     ``determines'' that the conditions staturoily specified \n     exist. n27 That section does not expressly call upon the \n     President to insert written findings into an exempting order, \n     or indeed to utilize any particular format for such an order. \n     The District Court, by mandating a presidential demonstration \n     of compliance wish the section, engrafted just such a demand \n     onto the * * *.\n       n27 See text supra at note 4.\n       We deem the familiar presumption of regularity decisive \n     here. It ``supports the official acts of public officers and, \n     in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts \n     presume that they have properly discharged their official \n     duties.'' n28 This presumption has been recognized since the \n     early days of the Republic. In the summer of 1812, President \n     Madison exercised a statutorily-conferred power to call forth \n     state militiaman ``whenever the United States shall be \n     invaded, or be in imminent danger of invasion from any \n     foreign nation or Indian tribe.'' n29 In Martin v. Mott, n30 \n     a militiaman objected on the ground that the order did not \n     show facially that the President [**10] had determined that \n     there was an imminent danger of invasion. p31 The Supreme \n     Court responded:\n       It is the opinion of the Court, that this objection cannot \n     be maintained. When the President exercises an authority \n     confided to him by law, the presumption is that it is \n     exercised in pursuance of law. Every public official is \n     presumed to act in obedience to his duty, until the contrary \n     is shown; and a fortiori this presumption ought to be \n     favorably applied to the chief magistrate of the Union. It is \n     not necessary to aver, that the act which he may rightfully \n     do, was so done. n32\n       n28 United States v. Chemical Found. 272 U.S. I, 14-15, 47 \n     S. Ct. 1, 6, 71 L. Ed. 131, 142-143 (1926).\n       n29 Act of Feb. 28, 1795, 1 Stat. 424.\n       n30 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 19, 6 L. Ed. 537 (1827).\n       n31 Id. at 32, 6 L. Ed. at 541.\n       n32 Id. 32-33, 6 L. Ed. at 541.\n       Over the many years since Martin v. Mott, the presumption \n     of regularity has been applied in a variety of contexts, n33 \n     and [*728] it is clearly applicable to the case at bar. The \n     executive order under review cited accurately the statutory \n     source of authority therefor, and purported to amend an \n     earlier order that indubitably was * * * not itself require \n     or even suggest that any finding be, reproduced in the order. \n     No more than the District Court have appellants suggested any \n     actual irregularity in the President's factfinding process or \n     activity. In these circumstances, we encounter no difficulty \n     in presuming executive regularity. We cannot allow a breach \n     of the presumption of regularity by an unwarranted assumption \n     that the President was indifferent to the purposes and \n     requirements of the Act, or acted deliberately in \n     contravention of them.\n       n33 The cases doing so are legion. The following are \n     typical: INS v. Miranda, 459 U.S. 14, 18, 103 S. Ct. 281, \n     283, 74 L. Ed. 2d 12, 16-17 (1982) (specific evidence is \n     required to overcome presumption that public officers have \n     executed their responsibilities properly); Citizens to \n     preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 415, \n     91 S. Ct. 814, 823; 28 L. Ed. 2d 136, 133 (1971) (where \n     statute prohibited approval by Secretary of Transportation \n     of federal financing for construction of roadways through \n     parks unless there was no feasible and prudent alternative \n     route, and Secretary approved financing for such a project \n     without making formal findings, Secretary's decisionmaking \n     process was entitled to presumption of regularity); \n     Michigan v. Doran, 439 U.S. 282, 290, 99 S. Ct. 530, 536, \n     58 L. Ed. 2d 521, 528 (1978) (in extradition hearing, \n     presumption of regularity insulates demanding state's \n     probable cause determination from review in asylum state); \n     Philadelphia & T. Ry. v. Stimpson, 39 U.S. (14 Pet.) 448, \n     458, 10 L. Ed. 535, 541 (1840) (where statute required \n     certain conditions to be met before corrected patent could \n     issue, signatures of President and Secretary of State on \n     corrected patent raised presumption that all requisite \n     conditions were satisfied, despite absence of recitals so \n     indicating on face of patent); Udall v. Washington, Va. & \n     Md. Coach Co., 130 U.S. App. D.C. 171, 175, 398 F.2d 765, \n     769, cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1017, 89 S. Ct. 620, 21 L. Ed. \n     3d 561 (1968) (Secretary of Interior's determination that \n     limitation of commercial bus service on portion of George \n     Washington Parkway was required to preserve area's natural \n     scenic beauty was entitled to presumption of validity, and \n     burden was upon challenger to overcome it); National \n     Lawyers Guild v.

[**12]\n       In ruling to the contrary, the District Court relied \n     heavily upon the prevailing opinion of the Supreme Court in \n     Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan. n34 There the Court, focusing on \n     what it regarded as an excessive statutory delegation of \n     legislative power to the President. n35 set for naught an \n     executive order issued pursuant to the National Industrial \n     Recovery Act by striking down the authorizing provision of \n     the statute, n36 The Court held in the alternative that even \n     if the statute was valid, the order would still be \n     ineffective because it did not set forth express findings on \n     the existence of conditions prerequisite to exercise of the \n     authority conferred. n37 The Court observed that to hold that \n     [the President] is free to select as he chooses from the many \n     and various objects generally described in the [relevant] \n     section, and then to act without making any finding with \n     respect to any object that he does select, and the \n     circumstances properly related to that object, would be in \n     effect to make the conditions inoperative and to invest him \n     with an uncontrolled legislative power. n38\n       n34 293 U.S. 388, 55S. Ct. 241, 79 L. Ed. 446 (1935).\n       n35 Id. at 414-430, 55 S. Ct. at 246-253, 79 L. Ed. at 456-\n     464. [**13]\n       n36 Id. at 430, 55 S Ct. at 252-253, 79 L. Ed. at 464.\n       n37 Id. at 431, 55 S. Ct. at 253, 79 L. Ed. at 464-465.\n       n38 Id. at 431-432, 55 S. Ct. at 253, 79 L. Ed. at 464-465.\n       Just what situations this declaration encompasses may to \n     many remain quite obscure. That one situation, however, is \n     beyond its ken is crystal clear. The majority opinion \n     cautioned that the Court was ``not dealing with .  .  . the \n     presumption attaching to executive action. .  .  . We are \n     concerned with the question of the delegation of legislative \n     power.'' n39 The Court cited approvingly several cases, \n     including importantly Martin v. Mott, in which the \n     presumption of regularity was applied. n40 Our\n\n[[Page S9382]]\n\n     proper course, then, is evident; we are to abide the Court's \n     admonition that was Panama Refining does is in applicable \n     here, and that, as in Martin v. Mott, the presumption of \n     regularity is pivotal. Indeed, the Supreme Court has never \n     given Panama Refining the interpretation it received in the \n     District Court, nor, so far as we can ascertain, has any \n     other court.\n       n39 Id. 293 U.S. at 432, 55 S Ct. at 253, 79 L. Ed. at 465.\n       n 40 Id. at 432 n. 15, 55 S Ct. at 253 n.15, 79 L. Ed. at \n     465 n.15. [**14]\n       We hold that Executive Order 12559 is effective, and has \n     been from the date of its promulgation. The judgment of the \n     District Court is accordingly reversed, and the case is \n     remanded for further proceedings consistent with this \n     opinion.\n       So ordered.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Is our Senator aware, while our colleague from Louisiana \ncites a court case that upheld the President's power to grant a waiver \nunder national security, that the Senator's own amendment changes the \ncriterion from national security to terrorism?\n  Mr. BREAUX. It does not.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That, in fact, the very standard that the court has upheld \nis a standard that he changes. It is clear to those who are looking at \nmaking this work that a standard based on terrorism is not as strong as \na standard based on national security. So I think what we are seeing, \nover and over again, is one discussion but another reality.\n  I just ask the Senator if he is aware that part of what is being done \nis a change from the standard that gives the President the ability to \nwaive on national security concerns to a standard to waive on terrorism \nconcerns, where there is no comparable litigation, and where there are \nno comparable precedents?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. In answer to that, the Senator is correct in that the \nNelson language does not mention national security in the section that \nI am looking at that I think is the operable section and requires that \nthe duty of the ``majority of the employees'' be engaged in \n``intelligence, counterintelligence, or investigative work,'' and that \nall of it, or any of it, must be ``directly related to terrorism \ninvestigation.''\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is right.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If it is not related to terrorism, the President does \nnot have the authority, the way this is drafted. But I suppose what I \nwonder is if, in effect, what we are saying--and the Senator is right; \nwe are comparing apples and oranges, it sounds like with this prior \ncase--but if what we are saying is that we want to make it so the \nPresident's actions are not judicially reviewable at all, why are we \nhaving this debate?\n  I assume it is because we have an additional hurdle in there that \nevery once in a while an honest President just couldn't make, such as \nthe job changing. If the President is going to say, I have the \nauthority, I can say whatever I want to say, I guess he could do that \nthen. But if the President really does want to go to the trouble of \ndetermining whether or not the jobs of a majority of the people inside \nof an agency have changed, then that would be a situation where the \nPresident could not morally make such a determination.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Is the Senator also aware that making the determination on \nthe basis of terrorism is very different than making the determination \non the basis of national security? In fact, the roots of the \nPresident's national security powers go back to the Constitution. It is \nunclear how the courts would interpret or define terrorism.\n  Let me ask the following question. I think the Senator made a \nrelevant point. If we all want the President to have national security \npowers, why are we having this debate? If you want to take the clothing \noff this amendment, is the Senator aware that in the last provision in \nthe amendment that it strikes a provision in the pending substitute \nthat guarantees that any power the President had under national \nsecurity the day before the terrorist attack, he would continue to have \nafter this bill? Is the Senator aware that provision is stricken by \nthis amendment?\n  Can the Senator imagine, if our colleagues really, sincerely want the \nPresident to have emergency powers, why they would want to strike that \nprovision?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. In answer to the Senator, I am aware of that. It is \nbecause if that section were in there, it would be inconsistent with \nthis section.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Just to make two quick points. No. 1, it is very clear \nthat the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment is a supplement and not \nreplacing the original section 7103(b)(1). We are not replacing the \nlanguage talking about national security.\n  The second point, the debate on the floor has been the question about \nhow difficult it would be for the President to make a showing that the \nmission and responsibilities of the agency have materially changed. I \nwould say very clearly that the only court case in 30 years that has \never challenged the President's authority in making this determination \nsaid very clearly that this section makes clear that the President may \nexclude an agency from the act's coverage whenever he determines that \nthe conditions statutorily specified exist. This section does not \nexpressly call upon the President to insert any written findings into \nhis exempting order or, indeed, to utilize any particular format for \nsuch an order.\n  That is as clear as you can say it. When the President says these \nconditions exist, that is all he has to show, period. That is the end \nof it.\n  I hope that will address the concerns of the ranking minority member \nabout the President having to make findings and do things that he is \nincapable of doing. This case, the only case interpreting this, says he \ndoesn't have to make any findings. It is left up to him. When he says, \nI have determined that these conditions exist, I can do it, that is not \nreviewable. The national security statute is still in place. It is \nstill there. It has not been removed.\n\n  Our amendment is an amendment to the existing 7103. The national \nsecurity language is still in place. It is not struck by our amendment \nin any way.\n  The President makes the determination and his determination is not \nreviewable by court based on the fact that these conditions do not \nexist. It is very clear.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, how in the world can we say that the \nNelson amendment is a supplement to the current law, when the current \nlaw says the President may, and the Nelson amendment says the President \nmay not? Square that one with me.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. In a moment. The current law says the President may \nissue an order if he determines that the agency or subdivision has a \nprimary function of intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, \nor national security work. The Nelson amendment says no agency shall be \nexcluded because of the President's authority, unless the determination \nis made that the mission and responsibility of the agency or \nsubdivision has materially changed.\n  You call that supplemental to, or whatever you want to call it, but \nit was not there before.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. For a majority of the employees, current law says the \nagency has a primary function. The amendment says the majority of the \nemployees within the agency have as their primary duty. The current law \nsays, intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national \nsecurity. The amendment says intelligence, counterintelligence, or \ninvestigative work directly related to terrorism.\n  You can call it anything you want on the Senate floor, but the fact \nis, the current law is designed to give the President authority. The \namendment is designed to limit the President's authority. It could not \nbe any simpler.\n  I yield for a question, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator retains the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX. For one moment, just to respond specifically to the \nlanguage in the existing statute that says the President can, if he \ndoes certain things. Our language says, he cannot do it unless he does \ncertain things. The\n\n[[Page S9383]]\n\nend result is exactly the same. Our language says that if the President \nmakes a determination that these things exist, he can do whatever he \nneeds to do in this area. The language in the existing statute simply \nphrases it differently, by saying the President can do this if he shows \nthe following. The end result is exactly the same.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. May I ask the Senator, if the end result is exactly the \nsame, why does he insist on proposing this amendment?\n  Mr. BREAUX. There are two different points to be made here. The first \npoint is, the way the language was drafted it was intended to do the \nsame thing by saying the President can take action if he does certain \nthings. The answer to that question is, absolutely, yes. It is phrased \ndifferently. One is in the negative. One is in the positive. But the \nend result is that the President can do these things if he shows the \nfollowing.\n  The amendment we have says, for the first time in history, you are \nnot talking about moving 5 people or 10 people or 100 people; you are \ntalking about moving thousands and thousands of people. Over 100,000 \npeople are going to be changed. At least we ought to show that the \nmajority of them have something to do with this issue. That is an \nadditional requirement. It is one that he determines.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Maybe we have finally settled it. I heard the phrase \n``additional requirement.'' You can argue that because this is such a \nmassive job, we ought to hamstring the President a little bit or you \ncan argue because this is such a massive job that we should not.\n  But the Senator is absolutely correct in that he has laid on an \nadditional requirement. That is the only thing I think we have been \ntrying to establish.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Let me say something first and then ask the question. \nThe effect of the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment is to add these two \ncriteria for a judgment by the President in the specific case of the \n43,000 currently unionized employees who will be moved to the new \nDepartment of Homeland Security. That is all.\n  The reason it does that is there is some apprehension, even though \nthey have been doing these jobs for years and no previous President has \nfound they are inconsistent with national security and being a member \nof the union, they want the President to make that determination. But \nhere is the point I want to make about the court case.\n  There is actually no lessening of the President's authority because \nthe underlying statute says in title 5 7103(b)(1):\n\n       The President may issue an order excluding any agency or \n     subdivision thereof from coverage under this chapter--\n\n  Which is the collective bargaining chapter.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Seventy-one?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. It is 7103(b)(1). Then it says:\n\n       if the President determines that--\n\n  And in the current statute which relates to the entire Federal \nworkforce, it says:\n\n       the agency . . . has as a primary function, intelligence, \n     counterintelligence, investigative, or national security \n     work, and the provisions of this chapter--\n\n  Collective bargaining--\n\n       cannot be applied to that agency . . . in a manner \n     consistent with national secur-\n     ity. . . .\n\n  The Nelson-Breaux-Chafee amendment adds two other factors solely with \nregard to the employees who will be transferred to the new Department: \nThe missions and responsibilities, not of the individual jobs but the \nagency or subdivision of change, and a majority of the employees within \nthe agency have as their primary duties activities related to \nterrorism.\n  Here is the point I want to make as I read it. That is why I think \nthere is not even a hair of difference between us in what we are \nsaying. The basic operative point here is the language in the current \nstatute--``if the President determines that.'' It is up to the \nPresident to determine the standards under the current law and the two \nstandards for employees transferred to the new Department that Nelson-\nChafee-Breaux adds. The Federal court has said the President's \ndetermination under this statute is not reviewable. That goes not just \nfor national security, it goes for the two basic underlying and the two \nadditional requirements that are added under this provision for \nemployees of the new Department.\n  This is not effectively appealable. In other words, Senators Nelson, \nChafee, and Breaux tried to come up with an amendment which responded \nto the concerns expressed by the White House and our colleagues on the \nfloor that in some way the committee's bill in this regard was \nlessening the national security powers of the President by subjecting \nit to an appeal to the Federal Labor Relations Authority. We cut that \nout now.\n  I must say, I believe because we are so interested in getting this \ndone we have been quite flexible on this side. I ask my colleagues on \nthe other side, particularly the Senator from Texas, to take a close \nlook at this because of the urgency of creating a homeland security \nagency. Let's try to find common ground and agree the President has \nessentially unassailable authority under this provision, exactly what \nhe wants. It gives a small degree of what might be called due process \nto Federal homeland security workers against an arbitrary action by a \nPresident.\n  Frankly, under this wording and based on that court decision, the \nodds are a President could act arbitrarily here, too, if he invoked \nnational security.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for yielding. I guess my question \nis: Does the Senator not agree with me?\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, let me pose a question to my friend from \nConnecticut. Is it the Senator's determination that this language he \nquoted under subsection (2) that ``The President may issue an order \nsuspending any provision of this chapter . . . if the President \ndetermines that the suspension is necessary in the interest of national \nsecurity,'' is it the Senator's understanding that would supersede the \nnew requirement that he find the responsibilities of the agency have \nmaterially changed?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Looking at that section--incidentally, the language, \nthe Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment amends decisions made under \n7103(b)(1). (b)(2) I think gives the President authority to suspend any \nprovision of the chapter specifically with respect to any installation \nor activity located outside the United States of America.\n  It is not diminished at all, not really affected at all.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. The Senator points out the provision I just quoted is \nwith respect to an agency or activity located outside.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. In responding to the Senator from Tennessee, my \nreading of that section (2) is simply to restate the President's \nauthority, not only with regard to employees of the Federal Government \nwithin the United States of America and the District of Columbia but \noutside the United States of America and the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, that is a big difference. I do not think \nit has anything to do with employees inside the United States of \nAmerica. I think that section only has to do with employees outside the \nUnited States of America.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I think that is right.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Which would leave us, once again, in a situation where \nthe President is having to make a new determination because there is \n``concern''--concern we did not have with regard to any of these other \nPresidents, but we have concern with this President at this time. One \ncan argue it is minimal. One can argue it is almost the same.\n  We are creating some interesting legislative history here. I wonder \nhow anybody can ever contest the President after this discussion, quite \nfrankly, but if that is the case, why in the world do we want to \nannounce to the world we want to spend 2, 3, 4 days arguing over \nwhether or not to diminish the President's authority a little bit or \nwhether or not to put up an additional hurdle before him, when he is \nsaying to us and the world--presumably, I do not know how onerous this \nis going to be; perhaps it will not be very onerous at all. It is just \nnot right. It is just not right to diminish the President's authority\n\n[[Page S9384]]\n\nor to put up additional requirements of him at this time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nmake a comment without the Senator from Tennessee losing the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have been here for an hour and a half \nnow listening to this debate, listening to the argument going back and \nforth, and the conclusion I think I hear from the Senator from \nLouisiana and the Senator from Connecticut is an interesting one. It \nmay not be the conclusion they really think they came to, but the \nconclusion I hear them saying, particularly in the final statements \nthat took place, is they put this in the amendment to give the labor \nunions a sense of security but, in fact, that security is not there, so \nwe can vote for the amendment with a clear conscience; that they did \nwhat the unions wanted them to do so they would not feel nervous about \nbeing put into this new Department, but reading their interpretation of \nthe law, they are saying it really does not make any difference.\n  The last comment from the Senator from Connecticut that even an \narbitrary and capricious action by a President--and he made it clear he \ndid not expect this President to do that, and I appreciate his \ngraciousness in that, but then in a hypothetical, an arbitrary or \ncapricious action by a President could still go unchecked under this \namendment and, therefore, we ought to embrace it.\n  If that is, in fact, the case--I will look at it very closely with \nsome help from people who are burdened with a legal education, as I am \nnot--if that is, in fact, the case, I think the Senator from \nConnecticut has just exposed himself to a little criticism from the \nunions.\n  How can he have misled them into thinking he was doing something \nsubstantive on their behalf and at their behest if, in fact, it is not \nsubstantive and the President would get everything he wants?\n  Of course, the same question arises from the White House. If, in \nfact, the White House is seeing no substantive change and this is more \nof a cosmetic kind of a thing, why are they threatening to veto?\n  So I am now going to leave the floor and go to lunch. I have some \ntime scheduled later in the afternoon when I will talk about something \nelse, but I have found this to be a very interesting exchange. Without \nin any way attempting to diminish the sincerity, integrity, or \nintelligence of those who have engaged in the debate on both sides, it \nstrikes me a little like the medieval debate about the number of angels \nwho can dance on the head of a pin.\n  If, in fact, as the Senator from Louisiana said and then the Senator \nfrom Connecticut summarized, the net effect of this amendment in this \narea is to not change the law or ultimately take any of the President's \npower away----\n  Mr. GRAMM. If that were the effect.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The question arises, why are we doing it? Either there \nhas been a misleading of the unions so they feel a false sense of \nsecurity that they do not really get or there is, in fact, some \nsubstantive change that we are supposed to not notice on this side of \nthe aisle.\n  As I say, I do not challenge the intelligence, the integrity, or the \nmotives of anybody who has engaged in this debate, but as a layman, \nstanding here for an hour and a half, listening to the debate go back \nand forth, I draw that conclusion. I find myself quite perplexed over \nthe intensity with which this battle has been fought if indeed that is \nwhere we are.\n  I see the Senator from Connecticut is on the floor, and I will be \nhappy to yield to him for whatever comment he may wish to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I want to respond, and then I will \nyield the floor. I know other Members in the Chamber wish to speak.\n  I appreciate what the Senator from Utah has said because I think he \nhas come to the nub of it. Part of what this dialogue has reflected is \nhow much people on our side, including the folks from the Federal \nworker organizations, want to get this bill passed. There has been a \nsubstantial change from the original wording of the committee bill, \nwhich did allow an appeal to the Federal Labor Relations Authority from \nthe decision of the Secretary--or administration in these cases.\n  Effectively what we have done is to add two more criteria for the \nPresident to base his decision on as to whether union membership is \ninconsistent with national security, but we have not diminished the \nPresident's authority to make that decision. In other words, the same \nhigh authority he has had, sustained by the court decision we have \ncited and the two criteria that are there now, he has that same power \nunder the two we have added.\n  The Senator asks: What have we done then? By adding two more \nstandards, what we have done is to establish a kind of protection \nagainst truly arbitrary use by some future President of this \nextraordinary power the statute gives. What is the protection against \narbitrary? The President has to make the case that he has determined, \nand let me read from the Nelson-Breaux-Chafee amendment: Mission and \nresponsibilities of the agency or subdivision has materially changed--\nand this is only with regard to these employees who have now been moved \nto this Department; the President's authority remains unchanged with \nregard to every other Department--and that a majority of employees \nwithin the agency or subdivision have jobs directly related to \nterrorism.\n  I agree with the Senator. I have forgotten the word he used, and I \nwish I could recall it, but the Senator is wondering now why we are \nspending all of this time arguing about this. In my opinion, we should \nnot. We should be adopting the whole bill and sending it to a \nconference committee so we can get it done soon and everybody, \nbeginning with the President, can claim a victory in the name of \nnational and homeland security.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Connecticut, the \nchairman of the committee, for his attitude and his approach to this. I \nwill, in good faith, go back and examine it. In honesty, though, I must \nindicate I am not sure examining it is going to change my position, for \nthis reason: The Senator from Connecticut has magnanimously, and I \nthink accurately, said he does not believe our current President will \nabuse this power, and he has referred to some future arbitrary \nPresident.\n  Nonetheless, he says there will be some kind of review. At the risk \nof sounding paranoid myself, I think that is enough of an opening, \nenough of a crack in the door, for some future union leader, who might \nnot have the same kind of motives that are being attributed to our \ncurrent President, to go through that opening and, for reasons totally \nunrelated to the mission of the Department, reasons totally unrelated \nto the protection of the American homeland, decide that he or she wants \nto pick a fight with the President and set in motion a series of \nhearings and activities within the civil service procedure.\n  I do not know how many other Members of this body have served in the \nexecutive branch and been involved in civil service procedures. I have. \nI went into the executive branch thinking I knew something about \npersonnel. I had hired and fired, I had been involved in difficult \nchallenges, and I thought I understood the process. I was the biggest \nbabe of all the babes in the woods when I got into that circumstance. I \nended up with an employee who was totally incompetent, totally \nunqualified for the position into which I innocently and foolishly \nplaced her. I immediately tried to get rid of her.\n  I served in the administration for 2 years. Then I left the \nadministration, and while I was in my private life, I got a phone call \nsaying I had been summoned to a civil service hearing on the case of \nthis woman X number of years after I had left the Government. I went to \nher hearing, and I testified in her hearing as to the situation. I was \nastounded that it was 3 or 4 years--whatever the amount was--after we \nhad initiated the action to remove her from the position for which she \nwas totally unqualified. It had dragged on that long. I had finished my \nservice in the executive branch. I was out in private\n\n[[Page S9385]]\n\npractice. I was called back in to testify, and it was made clear to me \nthat this hearing was by no means going to be dispositive of the case; \nit would go on beyond that.\n  If there are additional hurdles being placed on the President's \nauthority in this Department by this amendment, in all good faith, with \na sincere attempt on the part of my friends who are working on this \namendment to try to come to a resolution, my hesitancy stems from that \nexperience. If indeed some labor leader decides he or she wants to pick \na fight with the President and use those additional hurdles for some \nmotive unconnected with national security, I am not comfortable giving \nthem that opportunity, particularly when they do not have it now.\n  The argument is being made, they are being transferred into a new \nDepartment and so they need to be protected. The statement by the \nSenator from Connecticut, that I quoted back to him and he said I was \nprobably right, is this is being done to give them a sense of \nprotection and comfort but that substantively it is not any different. \nIt may very well be that at the end of the day, after it goes through \nthe courts, substantively it will not be any different. The position \ntaken by the Senators from Louisiana, Connecticut, and Nebraska will be \nexactly right. But if that day comes after 6 years of adjudication and \nfooling around, with a Department that must be almost at hair-trigger \ncapacity to deal with the threat, I am not going to accept that. That \nis my concern. To say at the end of the procedure the President will \nnot have lost any power, all he will have had to do is go through some \nadditional procedures to exercise his power and therefore nothing is \nthreatened, is to say we are not focusing on the mission of the \nDepartment.\n\n  The whole reason we are creating the Department is so we will have \nfaster response time, so we will have better coordination on a threat \nthat did not exist when these situations were created in the first \nplace.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield, with the understanding I do not \nlose the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I suggest the Senator from Utah makes a good \npoint in terms of not wanting this to go through an endless review \nprocess that will take years. It can take a substantial amount of time \nand tie in knots the entire operation. The reason that is unlikely, and \nmost likely impossible, is the court case, the one case in 30 years, \nwhere it is made clear that if the President performs by making all the \npoints that would be required by law, that is essentially \nnonreviewable.\n  All that is being proposed here is that there are two additional \nrequirements that can be met, as well, and if the President dots the \ni's and crosses the t's and in good faith makes a determination that \nthe court is not going to review it. It is important the court would \nnot review it if he did not dot all the i's or cross the t's. I expect \nthis President and the future President to do the right thing under the \nlaw.\n  That being the case, there is absolutely no reason to believe this \nwill be tied up in court or there will be endless appeals by those who \nfeel aggrieved by the determination. That is why it is important, \nwhether you transfer these individuals or you go with the status quo, \nthis body in the past and I think this body today has dealt with \nestablishing requirements that must be met so that when they are met, \ndue process has been achieved, the courts are not going to meddle in \nthis process, and they are not going to review the administrations of \nthe Congress when it comes to national security.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my friend from Nebraska. But he comes back to \nthe basic statement I made to the Senator from Connecticut. If in fact \nthis is not really changing anything, and in fact there will be no \nsignificant delays, and if in fact the President has not lost any \npower, why is the amendment being offered? Why don't you just say if, \nin fact, nothing is going to change, we will not change it? And the \nissue that has been raised again and again is that the Senator from \nTexas put that exact statement in his amendment, he and the Senator \nfrom Georgia, that says nothing in this bill shall diminish the \nexisting power of the President and the amendment before the Senate \nmakes it very clear that statement has to go.\n  There has to be, by definition, some diminution of the power of the \nPresident.\n  I remember in such few Supreme Court cases I have reviewed one \nsituation where the Court was confused what Congress was doing--\nsurprising the Court would ever be unclear what we do; it is always so \nclear--the Court came down on the one side of the case with this \ncomment. It said: We cannot assume that Congress committed a vacuous \nact. Therefore, they must have intended to have changed something or \nthey wouldn't have passed this.\n  That is where we are here. We must, if we adopt the amendment \nproposed by the Senator from Nebraska, be assuming some diminution of \nthe President's power. If not, why are we doing it?\n  Once again, I am perfectly willing to talk about diminution of the \nPresident's power if it is arbitrary and capricious and if it is \ndamaging to the due process of employees. But this Department is not \nthe place to experiment with that. This Department is the Department \nthat is geared for quick action, for quick protection of Americans \nunder attack, and of all places where the President's ability, the \nSecretary's ability to move quickly should not be hampered by \nadditional requirements, this is the place. This is the Department \nwhere that should not happen.\n  To turn that proposition on its head and say that the President's \npower is as it is in every other Department, but it will be slowed down \nin this Department, is something I don't understand.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. If I thought this would slow down the \nprocess, if I thought this was a diminution of the President's \nauthority to make determinations, I would not offer it.\n  It is important to distinguish between the threshold requirement and \nthe President's power. If you want to defeat this, people will say it \ndiminishes the President's power. It does not diminish the President's \nauthority to make determinations. It does not, through the court cases, \ndiminish the President's power and authority to make certain \ndeterminations.\n  In this particular situation, the threshold decision about whether or \nnot the President meets that decision without regard to the President's \npower to make the decision that there has been a material change, that \nclearly is a reasonable requirement in this particular situation \nbecause you are moving one group from their current situation to \nanother situation. The question will be, Is there a material change as \nit relates to those responsibilities that are set out? It does not \ndiminish the President's power or authority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will yield the floor. The Senator from Texas wants to \nget into this, and I am more than happy to facilitate that for him.\n  Let me close my statement with this comment. By virtue of my own \nbackground and my committee assignments, I happen to find myself in \nfront of groups made up of executives perhaps more often than not. I \nasked this question, whenever this subject comes up, to the executives \nthat are talking to me about this Department.\n  The first question: Have any of you ever been involved in a major \ncorporate merger? Immediately, the smiles start around the room as the \nunderstanding of the implications of that question get through to them. \nThey nod, yes.\n  I ask: Has it been a pleasant experience? In every case, the answer \nis no. Mergers are always difficult.\n  Here is a merger involving 170,000 employees gathered together from \nsome 22 different agencies, each with its own culture, background, \npersonnel procedures, and understanding. Anyone who thinks Government \nemployees live in a monolithic world, regardless of which agency they \nwork in, lives in ``Alice in Wonderland.'' Every agency has its own \nculture and its own way of doing things, and it is almost impossible to \nget them to deal with each other.\n  Then I say to them: If you were tapped by the President to be the \nchief executive officer of this new agency and you were told the \nemployees who came into the agency in the process of it being created \nbrought with them, by\n\n[[Page S9386]]\n\nlaw, all of the personnel procedures and activities they had in their \nprevious agencies, would you take the job?\n  I have not found a single volunteer yet. Basically, aside from the \nlegalities of this--which, again, as a layman I hear the lawyers \narguing back and forth--aside from the legalities, that is what drives \nme in this debate. I want to view this as an agency which is governable \nwhen it is created.\n  As I said on the floor before, I lived through the creation of the \nDepartment of Transportation and all of the difficulties connected with \nbringing those groups together--a big Department but, compared to this, \nrelatively small. I was at the shoulder of the second Secretary of \nTransportation, John Volpe, as he wrestled with those problems. I saw \nfirsthand how essential it was for him to have flexibility in a variety \nof ways which the organized government employees unions did not want to \ngive him. He got it in the creation of that Department by congressional \nmandate, and he was able to do what he was able to do by virtue of \nthat.\n\n  I was not around, but I can read about the creation of the Department \nof Defense, which was on the scale that we are talking about here. It \nis not beyond the importance of our understanding how significant this \nchallenge is going to be for us to recognize that the first Secretary \nof Defense committed suicide under the pressures of trying to make this \nall work. The Department of Defense probably never did work until after \nthe Goldwater-Nichols Act, some 15 or 20 years after it was formed.\n  Let us understand as we go forward that we should be erring on the \nside of giving the Secretary and the President more flexibility, more \nauthority, more ability to move quickly rather than less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I do not know how much you learn by having \nthis job, but one thing you learn is patience.\n  Let me say it is probably a good thing I didn't get the floor earlier \nbecause I would have gotten up and accused my colleagues of insulting \nmy intelligence. But now I realize that the authors of this amendment \nhave not the foggiest idea of what this amendment is about or what it \ndoes.\n  Let me just start. There are a lot of points I want to make, but let \nme just begin with some English points. Before we get to legal points \nor security points, let's just talk about the English language.\n  Our colleague from Nebraska said: I wouldn't do the amendment if I \nthought it limited the President's power.\n  I would like to ask him to read the words of his amendment, on page \n12, under the section that has to do with the President's labor-\nmanagement powers. Remembering the President has the power in the name \nof national security to not put people out of the unions. That is a \nmade-up term that the opponents of the President use over and over and \nover again. It is totally false. Nobody can take people out of unions. \nWhat it does is set aside work rules that inhibit the ability of the \nDepartment to do the job of providing national security. So the \nPresident has this exclusionary authority under the name of national \nsecurity.\n  Our colleague from Nebraska, Senator Nelson, says his amendment does \nnot reduce the President's power. Let me start with the English \nlanguage, and let me read line 10 on page 12. This is a heading, and \nthe heading is: ``Limitation On Exclusionary Power.''\n\n  If it is not limiting the President's power, what is it doing?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me make my point. I have listened here for 2 hours, \ntrying to get the floor.\n  If this is not limiting his exclusionary power, this is false \nadvertising. It does, in fact, go on and limit his power. But that is \nnot the end of it.\n  Then, on page 14, you have a new section heading, and what do you \nthink the first words of it are? ``Limitation Related To Position Or \nEmployees.''\n  Our colleague from Utah said he is not a lawyer and this is a hard \ndebate. I am not a lawyer either although I guess over the years you \nlearn how to read legal documents. But I do know a little bit about the \nEnglish language. When heading after heading after heading is about \nlimitation of power, you are talking about limiting power.\n  Let me just start from the beginning because our colleague from Utah \ncame over, listened to a lot of things that didn't make any sense to \nhim, and he made a point. The point was, either this amendment does \nnothing or the authors of the amendment are not explaining what the \namendment does.\n  I will--certainly to my satisfaction, hopefully to others'--convince \npeople that this amendment does a great deal. This is not some cosmetic \nchange, where members of organized labor are being deceived. It looks \nto me as if they wrote the amendment and they knew exactly what they \nwere doing. Let me start with just some obvious points.\n  Besides the fact that the amendment is full of sections with the word \n``limitations'' in the title, the amendment strikes the following \nlanguage from the pending Gramm-Miller substitute. Let me read the \nlanguage. You heard our colleague from Nebraska say we are not trying \nto take power away from the President. Let me read you the language \nthey strike.\n  The language reads as follows:\n\n     notwithstanding any other provision of this act . . .\n\n  I think people understand English. That means no matter what this act \nsays.\n  The language they strike says:\n\n     . . . nothing in this act shall be construed to take away the \n     statutory authority of the President to act in a manner \n     consistent with national security requirements and \n     considerations as existed on the day of the terrorist attack \n     on September 11, 2001.\n\n  In other words, no matter what else this amendment said, if it had \nnot struck this language, the President would have the same national \nsecurity power after this bill became law that he had on that horrible \nday, September 11. But guess what. This language is stricken by the \namendment of the Senators. If they were not changing the President's \npowers, why did they strike this provision? They struck this provision \nbecause they may not know they are changing the President's powers but \nthe people who wrote the amendment know they are changing the \nPresident's powers. And if they did not strike this provision, then \neverything they did in limiting his power would be nullified.\n  Let's just start with what they did. Let me remind my colleagues of \nsomething that the opponents of the President desperately want you to \nforget. The President, in terms of waiving these labor agreements that \nlimit his ability to hire new people, move people, and to put the right \nperson in the right place is also limited by these agreements that \nrestrict the ability to change policy concerning carrying firearms, to \nchange the physical makeup of inspection areas at customs, and to \ndeploy a Border Patrol agent in an area where there is no laundry.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator yield for a very brief question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield, but let me just get through my \nbasic points, and I will be happy to yield. I want some coherence to \nit.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. It is a factual question. I think the Senator is \nconfusing the situation.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me go ahead and yield if the Senator is going to talk.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator refers to the power of the President in \nreference to waiving elements of collective bargaining agreements. That \nis not affected by this section. I think it is the right to join unions \nor remain in unions the President can override here, not elements of \nthe collective bargaining agreement.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me reclaim my time. It is the collective bargaining \nagreement and elements of it that the whole waiver is about. And I will \nget back to that.\n  Let me go back to my point. The President did not ask for any \nadditional authority in the name of homeland security to waive \ncollective bargaining agreements. He never asked for additional power \nbecause every President since Jimmy Carter has had that power and every \nPresident since Jimmy Carter has used that power.\n  You might ask yourself, if the President never asked for that power, \nwhy are we debating it? Why are we debating the President's waiver \npower if he didn't even ask for new power?\n\n[[Page S9387]]\n\n  The reason we are debating it is the underlying Lieberman amendment \nand the amendment that is proposed by Senator Nelson take power away \nfrom this President that every President since Jimmy Carter has had.\n  We are in the remarkable circumstance that terrorists have attacked \nAmerica. They killed thousands of our people. We are writing a bill to \ngive the President the tools he needs to fight and win the war. The \nfirst provision in this bill is to take away from the President powers \nthat every President since Jimmy Carter has had. It almost sounds \nunbelievable. But believe it.\n  A second point that is interestingly enough even more unbelievable: \nUnder this bill and this amendment, the members of Government who are \nmoved into the Homeland Security Department would find themselves in a \nposition that the President, in the name of national security, has \nfewer powers in hiring the right person, putting them in the right \nplace, and moving them than he does at the Labor Department or the \nOffice of Personnel Management or any other part of the Government. \nInterestingly enough, this bill and their amendment limits the \nPresident's emergency powers--not for the Government as a whole but \nonly for the Department of Homeland Security.\n  My third point is that we have heard this talk about these court \nrulings. It is a very good point. But, unfortunately, it makes the case \nagainst their amendment. These court rulings are on the basis of \nnational security. The Constitution gives the President power as \nCommander in Chief.\n  When the President in the past has made a ruling based on national \nsecurity--Senator Breaux made the point, repeated by Senator Nelson--\nthose decisions have not been judicially reviewable or the court has \ndeemed them not to be judicially reviewable. That is a pretty \nsubstantial power. But it is a power rooted in the Constitution.\n  Guess what they do with this amendment. They change the President's \npower so the President has the power to move only in terms of their \nwaiver--not on the basis of national security but on the basis of \nterrorism.\n  Terrorism is not mentioned in the Constitution. Terrorism has not \nbeen litigated. Maybe it will be litigated and the power will be \nupheld. But the Office of Personnel Management, the experts in this \narea, the person who will probably be the Secretary, and the President \nof the United States, believe that changing the President's waiver \npower and basing it on terrorism rather than national security is a \ndiminution of his power.\n  If somebody didn't think so, why is it being done?\n  Let me go my fourth point. We have heard a lot of discussion but let \nme try to get down to the facts. Again, we are all entitled to our own \nopinions. We are not all entitled to our own facts.\n  There are 20,000 union members among the 170,000 people who are going \nto be moved into this Department. There are 20,000 other people who are \ncovered by collective bargaining. But they are not union members.\n  Under this amendment, rather than the President having his broad \nexemptive power to put the right persons in the right place at the \nright time, the President would now have to enter into negotiations. So \nwe set up the Department. We are trying to get moving. We are trying to \nprevent another attack. We are trying to prevent Americans from dying. \nThis is pretty serious business, in other words.\n  What does the new Secretary have to do? He shows up, and 170,000 \npeople are moved. He comes into his office. What is the first thing he \nhas to do under this amendment? Double the number of people at the \nprincipal ports of entry? No. Change the disposition of agents to keep \nnuclear weapons from being brought into New York Harbor? No.\n  The first thing the President has to do is to enter into binding \narbitration with a labor union that represents 20,000 of the 170,000 \npeople who work for the Secretary.\n\n  Under this amendment, 20,000 union members and their unions would \nnegotiate on behalf of 170,000 people, and 20,000 of them aren't even \nmembers of the union.\n  Talk about a power grab--this is an extraordinary power grab.\n  Before the Secretary can do anything, he has to enter into binding \narbitration with these 17 unions that are representing 20,000 of the \n170,000 people in this Department, and only 20,000 of them are union \nmembers. He has to enter into a binding arbitration with those unions \nthat will bind the work rules for 150,000 people who are not even union \nmembers.\n  What happens if the unions won't agree to the change in rules that \nwould change the disposition of people in the Department to try to \nprevent a terrorist attack? What happens? You have binding arbitration. \nSo here we are trying to protect people's lives, and rather than \nsending agents where we need them to go, we are in binding arbitration.\n  Then a panel, which has the historic role of making decisions about \nwhether a governmental department had the right to cancel a Christmas \nparty or not, is now going to be making a decision governing the \nrunning of the Homeland Security Department.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question on \nthat point?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I served in the Federal Government \nbureaucracy for about 15 years as a Federal attorney and as a U.S. \nattorney. Trust me, Federal employees, as Senator Bennett said, have \ntremendous rights.\n  I was rather shocked, in connection with some of the things Senator \nGramm has been saying, to read some recent developments.\n  After September 11, is the Senator aware that the Customs Service \nwanted to require its inspectors--management--at 301 ports of entry to \nwear radiation detection pagers to help detect attempts to import \nnuclear and radiological materials across our borders, and that the \nNational Treasury Employees Union--members of which are some of my good \nfriends--objected saying that wearing the pagers should be voluntary \nand fought to invoke collective bargaining on the issue, which would \nhave taken at least a year to resolve?\n  Mr. GRAMM. First of all, I have to say to my colleagues that I am not \naware of that case. But I am aware of the case at the Boston airport \nwhere Customs wanted to change the makeup of the inspection room to \nmake it more efficient, and the National Treasury Employees Union \nappealed it to the FLRA, and they sided against Customs and the changes \nwere not made.\n  I am also aware that when there was an effort by INS to put more \nagents at the airport at Honolulu because of the large number of \nflights coming in and more inspectors were needed. In this case, the \nlabor union representing the INS employees in Honolulu filed a case \nwith FLRA saying it violated their contract to hire more agents. Guess \nwhat. The FLRA ruled in their favor.\n  Maybe someday you could get it straightened out. But what happens if \nby not getting it straightened out in time somebody's mama or \nsomebody's child ends up being killed?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Is the Senator aware that after September 11 the \nCustoms Service signed a cooperative agreement with several foreign \nports because we are concerned about ports being used to ship weapons \nof mass destruction here, and the best way to do it is to identify that \nas a foreign port before it gets here--that they signed a cooperative \nagreement allowing our inspectors to preinspect cargo abroad before it \nsailed here.\n\n  The Customs Service wanted to send its best agents to these ports \nbecause these are sensitive foreign assignments, and the National \nTreasury Employees Union objected, saying that internal union rules \nshould determine who should be sent on these assignments, not the \nCustoms Service managers.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am aware of the case where an effort was made, in terms \nof foreign deployment, to pick the most able people because you have a \nlimited number of people. That decision was overridden by the FLRA. \nThey said you had to send the most ``senior'' people in terms of \nseniority.\n  I would say these are exactly the kinds of problems the President is \ntrying to deal with. The President is not trying to deny people the \nability to pay union dues, if they choose. The President is not trying \nto discriminate against people based on race, color,\n\n[[Page S9388]]\n\ncreed, national origin. The President is trying to put the best person \nin the best place at the right time. The Senator has just outlined \nseveral examples of where we have not been able to get the job done in \nthe past, and even where we have gotten the job done, that it has often \nbeen 14 months later.\n  The point is, these terrorists--and we know there are thousands of \nthem--are not taking a sabbatical while we are having this debate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield, in reference to Senator \nBennett's comments, merging these agencies is a difficult task. They \ncome with different backgrounds and legal prerogatives and cultures \nthat they have had. As a U.S. attorney, I represented every Federal \nagency in my district, which would include the Corps of Engineers, the \nCoast Guard, Treasury, Customs, the INS, the DEA, the FBI--every agency \nthat was there. They all have a little bit different rules.\n  If we are going to form a new agency, we ought not diminish the \nPresident's power because it is going to be difficult enough as it is \nto bring this thing together in a coherent whole.\n  I believe the Senator is making a good point. I have listened to the \ndebate that has gone on for some time. It seems to me quite clear the \namendments that have been offered--the objections that have been made \nto your bipartisan bill, the Gramm-Miller bipartisan bill--have been \ndesigned to diminish the Executive's ability to coordinate quickly that \nnew critical agency for our defense.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership on it. I think it is \nimportant. The President should not allow his office and the office of \nfuture Presidents to have an even more difficult time than we already \nhave with personnel.\n  For example, I have had many agency heads come to me and ask me about \ncriminal activity by Federal employees. And I would say: Why don't you \njust fire them? They would say: You don't know how hard it is. We have \na criminal case. Please prosecute this case; otherwise, we will be \nyears removing this person.\n  It is amazing sometimes for the public to learn how difficult it is \nto manage in a Federal agency. It is far more difficult than private \nagencies. In the end, it hurts good employees of which there are so \nmany of them out there. It keeps them from being promoted, and it \nundermines the ability of the agency to be effective.\n  I thank the Senator for his courageous leadership.\n  (Mrs. CLINTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, let me finish up my remarks because I \nhave spoken a long time.\n\n  Although I could give a lot of concrete examples, let me just give a \ncouple of them: Under current law, the President has the ability, by \ndeclaring a national emergency, to change the work rules for the Border \nPatrol. And every President since President Carter has had that power. \nThis amendment would take away these emergency powers from the \nPresident because under a current agreement which the Border Patrol \noperates, there cannot be any prolonged deployment of Border Patrol \nagents in areas that do not have a series of amenities, including \ndrycleaners.\n  Under existing law, the President would have the ability to declare a \nnational emergency and move Border Patrol agents to areas where there \nwas a critical threat. He would not have that power under this \namendment. Let me explain why.\n  In order for the President to be able to use his emergency powers, \nthe President would have to find, after the Department is created, that \nthe position and duties of the person had been materially changed. By \nthe way, you guessed it, the first word of the heading on page 14 of \nthis amendment is ``Limitation''--``imitation Relating To Positions Or \nEmployees''. Who are we limiting here? The President. Every one of \nthese headings on limitation represents a limitation of the President's \npower.\n  Let me give you an example. A Border Patrol agent is a Border Patrol \nagent, and after the creation of this Department, they will still be a \nBorder Patrol agent.\n  I asked that the amendment be changed to say that either the function \nhad changed or the threat had changed. That proposal has not been \naccepted.\n  What it would mean here is that if the President tried to use his \npowers to station a Border Patrol agent, on a prolonged basis, on one \nof the many areas along the border that did not have restaurants, \nchurches, or drycleaners, there could not be a waiver to station them \nin that area. Now, I represent more of the border than any other \nSenator besides my colleague from Texas and I know that there are many \nsuch areas.\n  The problem is that while they are doing the same thing, the threat \nis different. Before it was a bale of marijuana or a box of cocaine or \nan illegal alien we were talking about. Today we are talking about an \nanthrax capsule or a chemical weapons vial or a biological agent \nthermos or a nuclear device. But yet, under this amendment, the \nPresident would not have the power to make that necessary change.\n  Our colleagues say a Border Patrol agent is still a Border Patrol \nagent and nothing has changed.\n  Madam President, everything has changed. After 9/11, the world has \nchanged, but not the thinking of the President's opponents. It has not \nchanged.\n  So let me sum up by simply pointing out why this amendment is \nunacceptable to the President, why he has said he would veto a bill \nthat contained this amendment, and why we can't fight and win the war \non terrorism with this amendment as part of the law.\n  Now, there is no guarantee that we are going to be successful in \nstopping terrorism with a good plan, but General Eisenhower once said: \nA good plan does not guarantee success, but a bad plan does guarantee \nfailure.\n  This is what this amendment does. It takes away power that every \nPresident since President Carter has had and used. It sets a higher \nstandard for using national security powers in the one agency of \nGovernment that is designated to protect the homeland security than it \ndoes any other Department of Government. So OPM would still have the \nsame emergency powers that are denied to the President for homeland \nsecurity, but he would not have them here. The whole standard by which \nthe President could intervene is changed from national security to \nterrorism.\n  We take a system where we in essence say to the President: OK, you \nwant these 170,000 people brought together in one agency. We want you \nto give up national security power. If you will give it up, we will put \ntogether the Department. In other words, we will put it together if we \ncan take away your power to actually run it.\n  What this amendment would do is allow unions that have only 20,000 \nmembers out of the 170,000 people that will be brought into the agency, \nand it makes them the bargaining agent for all 170,000. We are going to \nhire somebody to fight terrorism. He is going to think he is coming in \nto fight terrorism, and he is immediately going to be in binding \narbitration. And then, if the unions won't agree to his plan, it goes \nto a labor board that has the historic function of deciding whether a \ndepartment can cancel Christmas parties or the color of uniforms or \nthings of that nature. We set up an unworkable system.\n  Finally, powers the President says he must have, powers related to \nlabor-management relations and appeals, are taken away. So the \namendment before us is no effort at compromise. I don't doubt the \ngoodwill of the people who have offered it. But the plain truth is, it \nis further away from where the President can go than the last time we \nwere discussing this issue.\n  There has been only one compromise, and that compromise is the Gramm-\nMiller substitute which made 25 changes in the President's bill and \npreserved for Congress the power of the purse. It also did restrict the \nPresident's emergency powers but in ways that made sense. We said the \nPresident can't be arbitrary and capricious. We said the President \ncannot discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, national \norigin, and the list goes on. But the bottom line is that we realized \nwe were fighting a war against vicious killers and the President needed \nthe power to get the job done.\n  We need to give the President that power. Our colleagues talk about \nthe President using that power. The way it is now restricted, the only \nthing the President can use the power for is to fight terrorism, to put \nthe right person in the right place at the right time.\n\n[[Page S9389]]\n\n  My point is, this amendment is not significantly different from the \nunderlying bill in that it takes away powers the President already has, \nand it does not give him the flexibility he needs. The President has \nsaid he would veto it.\n  In the end, if we want to get a bill, the logical thing we should do \nis try to reach a compromise. I do not see this as a compromise. I \ndon't see anything in it that is a compromise. It takes power away from \nthe President he has today. I believe it is totally unacceptable.\n  I have given the authors of the amendment, in working with the White \nHouse, the changes they would have to make for the President to be able \nto accept it. I hope they will consider them. But the problem is, in \norder to give the President the power he needs to fight and win the war \non terrorism, you have to change business as usual in Washington.\n  If there has ever been an amendment that was committed to the status \nquo of business as usual, don't change anything, this is it. The \namendment and the underlying bill are really based on the premise that \ngovernment is to serve the people who work for the government, not to \nserve the people of this country, and the rights of these workers, as \nwe have defined them in a bill that is now over 50 years old in its \nfundamental components. This is the equivalent of operating a horse and \nbuggy on an interstate highway. When we are talking about protecting \nthe lives of our people and homeland security, this amendment and the \nunderlying bill still hew too much to the idea business as usual is \nmore important than an effective program to help the President fight \nand win a war on terrorism.\n\n  We are apparently going to have a cloture vote tomorrow. That cloture \nvote is going to fail. It is a gimmick and a game being played to try \nto deny the President the right to have an up-or-down vote on his \nproposal. Our colleagues who oppose the President have every right \nunder the rules of the Senate to do what they are doing. I am not \ncomplaining about it. I am just trying to be sure people understand. If \nthey can invoke cloture, they could put the President's program into a \nstraitjacket where he does not get a straight up-or-down vote, where \nthe first vote will be on this amendment which basically cuts the heart \nout of the President's program so people who oppose the President never \nhave to vote up or down on the President's program.\n  Our colleagues who oppose the President have the right to do this. I \nam not complaining about it. It is completely within the rules of the \nSenate. But I don't believe under the circumstances it is defensible.\n  Basically, those of us who support the President are going to resist. \nWe are going to deny cloture, and we are going to continue until the \nPresident gets an up-or-down vote.\n  I don't think this is going to confuse anybody. I know sometime later \ntoday and probably in the morning, someone is going to stand up and \nsay: Well, don't the people who support the President want to bring the \ndebate to an end and give the President a vote?\n  I don't believe people are going to be deceived. It is easy to give \nthe President a vote. All you have to do is to set a time when the \nPresident's proposal can be voted on. That is all you have to do.\n  Under these circumstances, we are not going to let business-as-usual \npractices in the Senate prevail. We are not going to let the President \nbe denied an up-or-down vote on his proposal.\n  It may be those who oppose the President will be successful. It may \nbe they can defeat the President. It may be they can pass a bill the \nPresident has sworn to veto. It may be they can prevent the President \nfrom having a Department of Homeland Security in this Congress. They \nmay do that. But what they cannot do is deny the President a vote.\n  There was earlier a unanimous consent request propounded concerning \nallowing a vote on the pending amendment. So no one is confused, I \nwould like to ask unanimous consent that at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, there \nbe an up-or-down vote, yes or no, on the President's program, which is \nthe Gramm-Miller substitute.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas retains the floor. Has he given up the floor?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have spoken beyond my limit of knowledge. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, while the Senator from Texas is on \nthe floor, I want to renew a unanimous consent proposal I made earlier \nwhen he was off the floor which would give him the up-or-down vote he \nwants on the President's proposal. It is highly unusual. He is asking \nto deprive the Senate of the opportunity to amend. No one is \ninfallible, but to give him the offer.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately upon the \ndisposition of Senator Nelson's amendment, Senator Gramm be recognized \nto offer a further second-degree amendment, which is the text of the \nPresident's proposal as contained in amendment No. 4738, and that the \nSenate then vote immediately on his amendment.\n  That should give the Senator from Texas what he wants--an up-or-down \nvote on the President's proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, getting to \namend the President's proposal before he gets a chance to have a vote \nis not giving the President an opportunity for an up-or-down vote. I \nhave to object, though I will say we are going to have a vote on the \nPresident's proposal. Why not set it for 11 o'clock on Tuesday? Let's \nhave the vote. If you can defeat the President, then you will make many \nspecial interests in Washington happy. If you cannot, we will have a \nbill. But at least we will settle the issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. So my question back to the Senator from Texas is why \ndeprive the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from Rhode Island and \nthe Senator from Louisiana the opportunity to have a vote on their \namendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator will yield, I will respond. Madam \nPresident, it is obvious to a blind man that there have to be some \npeople on the side of the aisle of the Senator from Connecticut who do \nnot want to vote against the President's homeland security bill, and if \nyou can amend it first with an amendment confusing people as to what \nyou are really doing, then they are off the hook. You all are not doing \nthis because it is fun. Obviously, you have your plan in mind. I have \nmine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Texas objecting?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, does the Senator from Texas \nunderstand that under the unanimous consent request I have proposed the \nvote would be on the President's proposal, the Gramm-Miller substitute, \nunamended, second degree?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I have a lot of problems, but one of them \nis not not understanding. I understand perfectly that if people could \nbe convinced--there is no sense getting into the details. I think we \nhave overdone it. The President wants an up-or-down vote on his bill, \nand we are going to hold out for that vote. If you can defeat the \nPresident, you have defeated the President. But we want an up-or-down \nvote, and the way we have things structured in a parliamentary sense, \nyou would have to get cloture on their amendment to vote on it, and you \nare not going to be able to get it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I regret the objection of the Senator \nfrom Texas, and I fear what it reflects is an understanding that, \nprimarily because of the courage of the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. \nChafee, who has created a common ground compromise preserving the \nPresident's national security powers and giving some, frankly, minimal \ndue process to homeland security workers, that our friends on the other \nside do not have the votes anymore because they do not have the votes. \nThey are going to filibuster effectively the adoption of a homeland \nsecurity bill as amended by the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment.\n\n[[Page S9390]]\n\n  The Senator from Texas himself has said that 95 percent of his \nproposal is the same as our underlying committee proposal. The biggest \ndifference between us is with regard to the rights of the homeland \nsecurity workers and the right of the President to maintain national \nsecurity powers. This compromise does it. I am disappointed--\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield so I can agree with him?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.--and I fear the White House is now blocking the early \nadoption by the Senate of legislation that would create a Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will, for a question.\n  Mr. GRAMM. It is true our bills are 95 percent the same. It is like \nyou are giving the President this nice, new, shiny truck, only yours \ndoes not have a steering wheel. That is the fundamental difference. \nThere is only 5 percent. It is like the plane that does not have the \nbolt that holds the tail on. That is the fundamental difference.\n  Look, we are not holding it up. We are ready to vote. Set the vote \nfor Tuesday. Let's have an up-or-down vote and see where we are.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, in responding to the Senator, the \nvehicle that we would give the President has a great steering wheel. \nAbout the only thing that is probably changed is the color of the \nplastic on the rear lights. The differences, as elucidated in previous \ndebate, are so minimal as to certainly be not worth blocking the \ncreation of a Department of Homeland Security which is urgently needed \nbecause the terrorists are still out there.\n  I see my friend from Nebraska on the floor. He is a lead sponsor of \nthe amendment. He has been waiting a while to speak. I will yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, the Senator from Texas has \nmade a number of points that I think I will try to respond to as \nbriefly as I possibly can but at the same time respond to the \nsuggestions.\n  First of all, I am new to this Washington-style posturing and spin \ndoctoring, but I think I am getting the hang of it--maybe slowly, but I \nam beginning to get the hang of it.\n  I agree that we are not entitled to our own set of facts. We may have \ninterpretations, we may even have our own thoughts about a set of \nfacts, but we are not entitled to characterize those facts differently \njust because we choose.\n  When one looks at a letter or a statement, the statement and/or the \nletter will speak for itself. I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord a letter from Governor Ridge, dated September 5, 2002, to \nSenator Lieberman in which he says:\n\n       . . . the President seeks for this new Department the same \n     management prerogatives that Congress has provided other \n     departments. . . .\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, September 5, 2002.\n     Senator Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Chairman, Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: During the past several months you \n     and I have engaged in both public advocacy and private \n     efforts to create a Department of Homeland Security. I have \n     read your article in Tuesday's Washington Post and would like \n     to respond to some of the observations and conclusions. You \n     and I agree that the events of September 11, 2001 tragically \n     underscore the critical need to reorganize a significant \n     portion of the Executive Branch of government and to create a \n     Department whose primary responsibility is securing the \n     homeland. I certainly agree with your observation that never \n     before has there been government ``disorganization so \n     consequential and the case for change so compelling.''\n       It is critical to our mutual effort however, to do more \n     than simply realign the many departments and agencies \n     included in the Senate measure under one new Cabinet-level \n     department. This new department must be equipped with the \n     flexibility and agility to respond effectively to threats \n     against this country and to move people and resources in \n     response to those threats. The President has made it clear \n     that the bill as presently written fails to achieve these \n     critical objectives in several ways.\n       In your article you refer to the President's concerns with \n     your bill as ``detours,'' ``secondary'' issues, and \n     ``unnecessary roadblocks.'' I am at a loss to understand why \n     the President's insistence that, as Commander-in-Chief, he be \n     the final arbiter of this country's national security \n     interests is a ``detour'' in this debate. Similarly, I am \n     puzzled as to why his resolve that his new Secretary be given \n     the flexibility to move people and resources in response to \n     terrorist threats is being characterized as a ``secondary'' \n     issue. In fact these very issues are critical to the success \n     of this new Department.\n       The Administration believes that the new Secretary must \n     have the freedom to put the right people in the right job, at \n     the right time, and to hold them accountable. He or she must \n     have the freedom to manage and the freedom to reorganize. One \n     of the inescapable truths of this new war on terrorism is \n     that we know that we cannot conduct ``business as usual.'' I \n     was surprised at your assertion that ``the president's pleas \n     for additional `flexibility' would give his administration \n     unprecedented power to undercut the civil service system, \n     rewrite laws by fiat and spend taxpayers' money without \n     congressional checks and balances.'' This is simply \n     inaccurate. Senator, the President seeks for this new \n     Department the same management prerogatives that Congress has \n     provided other departments and agencies throughout the \n     Executive Branch. For example: budget transfer authority \n     ranging from one to seven percent is granted in various \n     forms to several departments, including the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, the Department of Agriculture, \n     and the Department of Energy; reorganization authority was \n     granted with the establishment of the Department of Energy \n     and Education and government-wide reorganization authority \n     was previously enjoyed by every President until 1984; and, \n     personnel flexibility is currently enjoyed by the Federal \n     Aviation Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, and \n     the Transportation Security Administration.\n       Furthermore, the new Department of Homeland Security, as \n     well as its new Secretary, will be fully accountable to \n     Congress and subject to especially intensive reporting \n     requirements and Congressional oversight.\n       Your conclusion that ``the President and the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security would, in fact, have more flexibility to \n     run an efficient, effective and performance-driven department \n     than the law now provides'' is contrary to the literal \n     language of the bill itself. As written the Senate bill \n     places severe restrictions on the Secretary's ability to \n     manage the Department and fails to provide the authority that \n     the Secretary needs to effectively secure the homeland. \n     Through a variety of separate provisions, the Senate \n     legislation clearly prohibits the new Secretary from \n     reorganizing, reallocating or delegating most of the agency \n     functions in the new Department. It would preclude, for \n     example, even the most basic consolidation of Federal \n     inspectors at our border entry.\n       Moreover, the idea that ``With the powers in existing law \n     and new ones added in our bill, the administration would be \n     able to promptly hire new talent, swiftly move employees \n     around, discipline and fire poor performers'' is seriously \n     misleading. While the Senate bill introduces very narrow \n     changes to the personnel system, such modest reforms and \n     corrections are woefully inadequate to meet the President's \n     basic goal of creating a workforce at the Department of \n     Homeland Security with the flexibility, mobility, and agility \n     needed to protect our nation from multiple and constantly \n     changing threats. In fact, the Senate bill leaves in place a \n     50-year-old, rigid, statutorily mandated, and unalterable \n     personnel system. This kind of organizational rigidity in the \n     face of an agile and aggressive enemy is unacceptable to the \n     Administration.\n       Your op-ed also mistakenly claims that the Senate bill \n     would allow the President to ``remove employees from \n     collective bargaining units when national security is at \n     stake.'' In fact, the Committee proposal includes language on \n     Federal Labor Relations which would significantly restrict \n     the President's existing, government-wide authority to \n     prohibit collective bargaining for reasons of national \n     security. The bill would in effect deny the President this \n     authority over the Department of Homeland Security--an \n     illogical result given that the President will continue to \n     have the authority for every other department and agency of \n     the Federal government. As every President since Jimmy Carter \n     has shown, there are times where the needs of national \n     security must take precedence over collective bargaining. \n     Each of these Presidents--both Democrats and Republicans--has \n     used this authority precisely and with restraint. It is \n     unfathomable--and again simply unacceptable--that the Senate \n     would choose a time of war to weaken the President's \n     authority to protect national security.\n       While we continue to have considerable substantive \n     disagreements with the measure presently before the Senate, \n     as you begin the debate to establish the Department of \n     Homeland Security, we must keep in mind the common goal of an \n     accountable, effective agency with the resources and \n     authorities necessary to protect the American people. At the \n     end of the day, we must resolve out differences to reflect \n     our mutual obligation to protect our special interest--\n     America.\n           With Respect,\n                                               Governor Tom Ridge,\n                                        Homeland Security Advisor.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, he points out the Internal \nRevenue Service, which is exactly what we have included in this \namendment, hardly opposing the President unless, Heaven forbid, \nDirector Ridge opposes the President. He suggested it.\n\n[[Page S9391]]\n\n  Then, Madam President, I do not need to enter--it is already a matter \nof record--the remarks of the good Senator from Texas in which he \nsuggested that the current situation might be remedied by including the \nIRS formula that was included in the reorganization of the IRS.\n  I would not suggest for a minute that he opposes the President.\n  We have had some explanations or recharacterizations of what these \ndocuments mean. The recharacterization does not change the language, \ndoes not change the meaning, but now what seems to have changed is the \ngoalposts have been moved, the rules have been changed, and now in good \nfaith we proposed what we thought the White House and others, who were \nsuggesting we ought to do it differently, we thought, what they were \nasking for.\n  As with mischaracterizations, I think anybody today watching us would \nfeel as if they have been watching a little bit of ``Alice in \nWonderland.'' This is the only place I can imagine where if you have an \namendment, you are an opponent of the President. I am not an opponent \nof the President. I do not oppose the President. I am here trying to \nfind a way to close the gap.\n  I would like to find the steering wheel for the car of the good \nSenator from Texas so that it is 100 percent complete, not 95 percent \ncomplete, as the example he gave before.\n  I am intrigued by mischaracterization, but I am not persuaded by it, \nand nor will my colleagues be persuaded by it as well.\n  The Senator from Texas referred to page 12 of our amendment and read \nfrom it the language he said was now taking away authority of the \nPresident. The title is: ``Limitation on Exclusionary Authority.'' He \nsays we are excluding the President's authority. The truth is, this is \njust a reference to existing law, and it has to have some sort of a \nheading.\n\n  Let's move away from the heading and see what this particular \nprovision does. It says no agency that is transferred to the Department \nwill be excluded from the coverage of chapter 71 of title 5, United \nStates Code 7103(b)(1).\n  What does that have reference to? The President's authority. It says \nthe agency will not be exempt from the President's authority.\n  What is that President's authority this has reference to? It says \nthat the President may issue an order excluding any agency or \nsubdivision thereof from coverage under this chapter if the President \ndetermines the agency or subdivision has as their primary function \nintelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or national security \nwork, and the provisions of this chapter cannot be applied to that \nagency or subdivision in a manner consistent with national security \nrequirements and considerations.\n  It also says that the President may issue an order suspending any \nprovision of the chapter or activity if somebody is located outside of \nthe United States and the District of Columbia. The truth is, this \nreference incorporates the President's current authority. It does not \nexclude it. It does not change it. It does not limit it.\n  What I agree with, which the Senator does point out, is it does then \nset some additional tests the President ought to apply in making a \ndetermination. That is not limiting authority. That is saying these are \nthe tests that ought to be considered and have to be considered before \nthe order is issued. The President has the same authority as before, \nbut now it has a reference to dealing with there being a material \nchange in the responsibility.\n  The good Senator has also made a suggestion maybe we ought to look at \nwording that says ``or the threats have changed.'' When the good \nSenator suggests a change to the existing law, he is not opposing the \nPresident, but when we make a suggestion, we are opposing. I think we \nhave to use the same terminology and say we are both trying to improve \nthe existing situation.\n  If the Senator from Texas makes a suggestion we add language, I am \nnot going to suggest he is opposing the President. I am not even going \nto suggest he is opposing me. He is trying to make something he \ndisagrees with better, but it does not make us opponents.\n  What we have heard today is a lot of discussion with a lot of \nhyperbole and changing the rules as we go along. Of course, I think \nanybody watching from the outside looking in will not be misled by this \nkind of spin-doctoring or this kind of labeling.\n  My hope is we can set aside partisan discussions and talk about the \nessence of what it is we are about. What we are about is finding a way \nto close the gap.\n  I have said to the Senator from Texas, and I say it again, if there \nis language--and we are looking at his suggestion there--that will make \nthis clearer and stronger, we are very much in favor of considering \nthat. But I do not think it will make either of us opponents of the \nPresident if we agree on that language, which is different from the \ncurrent Gramm-Miller bill that is referred to as the President's bill.\n  So I think we must, in fact, put aside who is opposing and let us \nstart talking about how we can amend, improve and close the gap so the \ngood Senator's car will have its steering wheel and he can drive \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I had a brief conversation privately with the Senator from \nOklahoma, and while the Senator from Texas is in the Chamber, I say we \nhave a vote scheduled for 3:45 this afternoon. It would seem to me the \nmost logical and sensible thing to do, since we have been told by \nseveral people on the other side of the aisle we are not going to get \ncloture tomorrow when we vote an hour after we come in, instead of \nhaving the vote at 3:45 on the cloture that is now set we should have \nit on the amendment the Senator from Texas said we will not get cloture \non, which makes more sense.\n  If we are not going to get it tomorrow, it would seem it would be in \neveryone's best interest, with all the things going on in Washington \ntomorrow, we have the vote today and allow people who are concerned \nabout some of the things that might take place tomorrow in the District \nto be able to go to their home in the suburbs or in the District or \nback to the States.\n  If the Senator is right that we will not get cloture--and if, in \nfact, we did get cloture, it would allow a lot of people not to be here \nbecause the 30 hours runs and, of course, we have one hour at a pop. I \nam not going to formally ask at this time, but I ask the distinguished \nRepublican assistant leader to see what he could do about working that \nout. It seems to me it would be in the best interest of the Senate and \nit would be in the best interest of those we are trying to work to some \nfinality in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I will be happy to work with him on \ntrying to schedule things that are convenient for all colleagues.\n  I rise today to make a few comments I really wish I did not have to \nmake. Yesterday, the majority leader of the Senate made a very strong, \nimpassioned speech. I missed most of it, but I caught a lot of it last \nnight on ``Nightline.'' I caught a transcript of it and then I saw it \nagain. I will read part of it. Senator Daschle said: I can't believe \nany President or administration would politicize the war. But then I \nread in the paper this morning, now even the President, the President \nis quoted in the Washington Post this morning as saying that the \nDemocratic--the Democratic-controlled Senate is not interested in the \nsecurity of the American people.\n  Senator Daschle was reading from The Washington Post. Unfortunately, \nthough, he did not quote The Washington Post correctly and he certainly \ndid not quote the President of the United States correctly.\n  It is a very strong accusation saying the President of the United \nStates would politicize the war and he quotes the President of the \nUnited States, but he quoted the President of the United States \ninaccurately.\n  One, we should keep politics off the floor of the Senate, \nparticularly when we are talking about issues of very significant \nimportance such as war, war resolutions, or a resolution dealing with \nIraq, which has been a troublesome spot for the United States. We have \nhad several debates and discussions on Iraq. We should not be playing\n\n[[Page S9392]]\n\npartisan politics. I do not think we should be attacking the President \nof the United States on a quote in the Washington Post, which may or \nmay not be accurate. The way it was stated by Senator Daschle was \ninaccurate, and I will read the President's quote from the Washington \nPost which was alluded to, and then I will again read Senator Daschle's \nquote and we will see directly they are not the same.\n\n  What the President said when he was in New Jersey on September 24 \nwas:\n\n       So I asked the Congress to give me the flexibility \n     necessary to be able to deal with the true threats of the \n     21st century by being able to move the right people to the \n     right place at the right time, so we can better assure \n     America we're doing everything possible. The House responded, \n     but the Senate is more interested in special interests in \n     Washington and not interested in the security of the American \n     people. I will not accept a Department of Homeland Security \n     that does not allow this President, and future Presidents, to \n     better keep the American people secure.\n\n  The President goes on to say:\n\n       And people are working hard in Washington to get it right \n     in Washington, both Republicans and Democrats. See, this \n     isn't a partisan issue. This is an American issue. This is an \n     issue which is vital to our future. It'll help us determine \n     how secure we'll be. Senator Gramm, a Republican, Senator \n     Miller, a Democrat, are working hard to bring people \n     together. And the Senate must listen to them.\n\n  That is what the President said, and to take out of that a statement \nthat says the Democratic-controlled Senate is not interested in the \nsecurity of the American people, is not what the President said. If \nsomeone is making a statement that receives a lot of attention, there \nmust have been notification to the press this is going to be a very \nimportant statement, and to make a statement misquoting the President \nof the United States on an issue like this and accuse him of \npoliticizing the war, when the issue was homeland security, I think is \na real injustice to the President of the United States and to the \nquality and flavor of debate we should be having in the Senate.\n  We should not be politicizing a debate dealing with war and talking \nabout international repercussions. And there are repercussions when we \nmake speeches, particularly when the Democrat leader makes a speech. I \ncannot help but think the headlines that came out as a result of his \nspeech brought about some comfort for those who really oppose the \nUnited States policies or those who are opposed to formulating an \ninternational coalition the administration is presently trying to put \ntogether in the United Nations, in Europe, and in the Middle East.\n  This President, like his father, was trying to build an international \ncoalition. I can't help but think when they read that the Democrat \nleader of the Senate is accusing the President of politicizing the war \nand misquoting the President, that gives them a lot of ammo. That gives \nthem a lot of justification for Saddam Hussein or others to say: See, I \ntold you they are just politicizing this war. They want to do this for \npolitical purposes, when that was not what the President said.\n  Again, when I first heard of this I thought, well, let me find out \nwhat the President said. I am a friend of the President's. I am willing \nto defend him, but I wanted to see what he had to say. I know the \nPresident very well and I said, I can't believe he would say Senate \nDemocrats are not concerned about national security because that is not \nfactual.\n  But then when I read these comments, not only did he not say it, he \ndidn't say anything close to it. Then in the next sentence down he \nsaid:\n\n       And people are working hard in Washington to get it right \n     in Washington, both Republicans and Democrats.\n\n  I wish Senator Daschle would have read that. I wish he would have \nread that he compliments both Senator Gramm, a Republican, and Senator \nMiller, a Democrat, and he never once said what was said on the floor \nyesterday. He never once said Senate Democrats are not interested in \nnational security. He didn't say it. But that was the attack that was \nmade yesterday.\n  I just think of the international repercussions, and I am thinking of \nthis enormous challenge to build an international coalition, one that \nPresident Bush 1 was able to do in 1990 and 1991, an enormous \ncoalition, but it was not easy to build. It is a coalition, I might \nmention, that was put together, and very successfully, in 1991, that \ndissipated over the next 8 years and is now gone. So President Bush, \nthis President Bush at the present time, is trying to rebuild the \ncoalition. Then to be attacked by the majority leader, misquoting him, \nI think is very inappropriate.\n  I also wish to make a comment about Vice President Gore.\n  Before I do that, I want to read another. The President made two \nspeeches. I scanned both. I didn't want to misstate what the President \nsaid. I like to be factually accurate. If I ever misquote anybody, it \nwill be a mistake.\n  So I read the President's speech that he made at another event. This \ngoes to the same subject. I believe this was made on September 25th.\n\n       Right now in the Senate the Senate feels like they want to \n     micromanage the process, not all Senators but some Senators. \n     They feel they have to have a pile of books this thick that \n     will hamstring future administrations how to protect our \n     homeland. I am not going to stand for it.\n       I appreciate John's vote on a good homeland security bill. \n     And the Senate must hear this, because the American people \n     understand it. They should not respond to special interests--\n     they ought to respond to this interest: protecting the \n     American people from a future attack.\n\n  Again, he didn't say anything about the Democrat Senate not \nsupporting national security.\n  But there was a real political statement made the other day. That was \nby former Vice President Al Gore. Again, I would like to think that \nPresidents and former Presidents and former Vice Presidents wouldn't \nundercut the existing President and Vice President on the floor--while \nthey are trying to build coalitions. That is exactly what the former \nVice President did. Former Vice President Gore, in speaking to, a group \nof Democrats or a group of people in San Francisco, had a lot of \noutlandish things to say.\n\n  I read--well, he is trying to garner support from the political left \nor right, and I guess he has that right to do so. But I would think he \nwould have the dignity to try to maintain the dignity of the Office of \nVice President and not undermine an existing administration that has a \ndifficult challenge to try to rebuild a coalition. This is one of the \nthings Vice President Gore said on September 23:\n\n       To begin with, to put things first, I believe we ought to \n     be focusing on efforts first and foremost against those who \n     attacked us on September 11 and who have thus far gotten away \n     with it.\n\n  For Vice President Gore to say that is grossly irresponsible, and is \nvery inconsistent, I might say, with some of the things he had to say \nin the past.\n  It is very troubling to me, when I look at the previous \nadministration and what they did or didn't do in response to previous \nacts of terrorism, for him to be blaming this administration for not \nbeing aggressive enough in fighting the war on terrorism, and I see \nterrorist attacks that happened during Vice President Gore's \nadministration, President Clinton's administration, and I look at the \nresponse they had against terrorism and I say, Where is it?\n  For him to be critical of this President when this President has made \nan aggressive effort to combat terrorism and basically eliminating it--\ngoing into Afghanistan, helped in liberating the Afghan people, \ndispersing al-Qaida, going after and rounding up and killing hundreds \nof terrorists--for the Vice President to be critical of this \nadministration is mind-boggling.\n  I remember when the U.S. Embassies were bombed in Kenya and Tanzania \non August 7, 1998; 224 people were killed, including 12 Americans, \nalmost all of those were employees of the United States. Five thousand \npeople were wounded.\n  And what did we do? Well, we lobbed a few cruise missiles hoping \nmaybe we would get Bin Laden and then we didn't do anything else. That \nwas in August of 1998. Yet we didn't do anything, after that for the \nnext couple of years; the previous administration did nothing.\n  And then the U.S.S. Cole was attacked on October 12, the year 2000; \n17 U.S. sailors were killed; 39 were wounded. The entire ship could \nhave sunk.\n  What did we do? Nothing.\n  President Clinton said:\n\n       If, as it now appears this was an act of terrorism, it was \n     a despicable and cowardly act. We will find out who was \n     responsible and\n\n[[Page S9393]]\n\n     hold them accountable. If their intention was to deter us \n     from our mission in promoting peace and security in the \n     Middle East, they will fail utterly.\n\n  President Clinton, as a result of the bombings of the U.S. Embassies, \non August 7 of 1998 said:\n\n       These acts of terrorist violence are abhorrent. They are \n     inhuman. We will use all the means at our disposal to bring \n     those responsible to justice no matter what or how long it \n     takes.\n\n  That was President Clinton's remarks, and I would assume Vice \nPresident Gore would agree with those remarks, but we didn't do \nanything. And we didn't follow up. We did lob a few cruise missiles, \nbut we didn't stay after Bin Laden. We could have. We could have sent \nsome special forces. We could have sent some airplanes over there. We \ncould have been very aggressive in trying to hunt down the people who \nkilled hundreds of people in those two attacks, but we didn't do it. We \nflat didn't do it. As a result, some of the people who planned those \ntwo activities also planned and carried out the airplane bombings in \nthe World Trade Center and the Pentagon and in the fields of \nPennsylvania--probably headed towards the Capitol--because we didn't \nfollow up. We didn't pursue them as aggressively as we should have in \n1998, 1999, 2000.\n\n  Then to have the former Vice President be critical of this \nadministration, that has moved aggressively to combat terrorism and go \nafter the terrorism--I am very troubled by that. Very troubled by it, \nindeed. We are all entitled to our opinions. We are all entitled to \nstate what we think should be done. But I happen to be one who believes \nthat when you are in a war, you should be working together and not try \nto undermine the President of the United States.\n  I am afraid, as a result of both the comments that were made by the \nmajority leader and the comments that were made by the former Vice \nPresident, I think it does undermine our united efforts to combat \nterrorism and to go after those people who are directly responsible.\n  Finally, I want to make a couple of other comments. In dealing with \nthe bill we have before us, Senator Gramm has mentioned that he has an \namendment, supported by the President, endorsed by Senator Miller. I \ncompliment them for their work on this issue. Unfortunately, the \namendment tree is filled. I don't want to get too bogged down in the \nparliamentary jargon, but I am looking at this tree. I want to read a \nquote Senator Daschle once said in June. He said:\n\n       I announced at the very beginning of my tenure as majority \n     leader I will never fill the tree to preclude amendments. I \n     am going to hold to that promise.\n\n  That was made on June 10. I happen to be one who doesn't like filling \nthe tree, either. But this tree is filled and why is it filled? It is \nto deny people a vote, the Senator from Texas and Georgia having a \nright to a vote on their amendments next. They want to obscure it so we \nvote on other amendments first.\n  Then the issue of cloture--we are going to have a vote tonight or we \nare going to have a vote tomorrow. Well, the purpose of cloture is to \ndeny them the vote and it is to falsely allude to--maybe people on this \nside of the aisle are filling the tree, which is false. We are not \nfilibustering the Interior bill.\n  I said that several times, and I happen to consider myself a person \nof my word. I will let you know if I am filibustering a bill. The \nSenator from Nevada knows me pretty well. I will let him know if I am \nfilibustering a bill. He will know it. No one is filibustering this \nbill. Well, ``We are going to file cloture.'' They know they have to \nget 60 votes for cloture. They won't have it today and they won't have \nit tomorrow.\n  The Senators from Texas and Georgia introduced the President's \npackage. It has been modified to accommodate a lot of Senators and to \nmake sure we don't have anything that would be intrusive against public \nemployees. It has a lot of protections in it. It is a well-thought-out \namendment and is very similar to many of the adoptions made in the \nHouse of Representatives. They are entitled to their vote. Will cloture \ndeny them that opportunity? This amendment would not be germane \npostcloture. It would fall.\n  I have said repeatedly that they are entitled to their vote, and they \nare going to get their vote.\n  I urge my colleagues, we could do a lot better in legislating if we \ndidn't fill trees, if we didn't file cloture every other day, and if we \nworked together to come up with a reasonable alternative to allow \npeople to vote on this alternative, to vote on the Gramm-Miller \nalternative, to vote on other alternatives and be finished with the \nbill.\n  The same thing with the Interior bill--if we had a vote on the \nvarious proposals dealing with fire. Let us vote. That is what we are \npaid to do. Let us vote. I urge my colleagues, let us not use the floor \nof the Senate to be accusing this President of politicizing the war; \nthe Vice President as well. I think that undermines the Senate and is \nnot worthy of debate in the Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I just want to say this: I agree with what the Senator said \nin respect to the appropriations bills. We had this talk--those of us \nwho agreed on appropriations bills. He is ready to vote on them. So am \nI.\n  I hope the leadership will attempt to get some of the other \nappropriations bills up. Let us see who is holding up appropriations \nbills. We have to do the Health and Human Services bill. We have that. \nWe have all of these bills backed up, and not a single one of the 13 \nappropriations bills has been sent to the Senate.\n  I thank the Senator for making that point. He is ready. Let us vote \non those bills.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee. I do know that when we have appropriations we have disputes \non amendments. The way to dispose of those amendments is not to file \ncloture because it won't work. The way to dispose of those amendments \nis to, if you do not like it, move to table it, or accept it. Maybe you \naccept it, or drop it. But you deal with the amendment.\n  I am embarrassed that we have been on two bills for 4 weeks and we \nhave made so little progress. We have spent the entire month of \nSeptember, and the end of the fiscal year is next month, and we haven't \npassed one appropriations bill this month.--not one. We have only had \nthree or four votes on each bill--both the Interior bill and the \nhomeland security bill. That is pretty pathetic progress.\n  As a result, we have only passed three appropriations bills out of \nthe Senate. It is maybe one of the worst records we have had in a long \ntime. That is not acceptable.\n  I can't help but think if the majority or minority would get together \nand say let us bring up these bills, move them quickly; let us table \nnongermane amendments; let us get our work done; that it would help \nmake the process work a lot better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I, as every Senator who serves here, came \nto the Senate for the purpose of being a public servant and to try to \ndo things that help our respective States and the country. That is why \nwe are here. People at home, in many instances, are somewhat jaundiced \nof the process. They think things we do here are political in nature \nand in the negative sense, and that we are really not here for the good \nof the country. I don't want to believe that. But there were times when \neven I became suspect about what is going on here.\n  Tom Daschle, the majority leader of the Senate, came to the floor \ntwice yesterday. He was concerned because blazed across the country in \nthe newspapers is something that has not been said once, but during the \nlast month the President of the United States has said on six different \noccasions--four times at fundraisers--that the Senate--specifically on \noccasion Senate Democrats--weren't concerned about national security.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I just want to correct the record and say I have \nscrutinized the President's speech. And I have never seen where this \nquote--I just gave it to the clerk--this quote comes from Monday. I \nlooked at the President's speech. I have the President's speech. I will \nenter it into the Record.\n\n[[Page S9394]]\n\nBut it did not say the Democratic-controlled Senate is not interested \nin the security of the people.\n  Again, we have to be factually accurate. If we are going to quote the \nPresident of the United States and accuse him of politicizing the war, \nlet us have an accurate quote. You can't take only part of a newspaper, \nthe part that says the Democrat Senate--I guess what was not in quotes. \nBut it was read on the floor like it was quotes; like it was a direct \nquote from the President. The President did not say that. Even the \nWashington Post didn't say it. You can't say, well, the Washington Post \nhad it wrong; that the Washington Post inferred that he meant the \nDemocrat Senate. But that is not what he said.\n  When it is something of this significance, when it has international \nrepercussions, and when it can undermine our efforts in trying to get \ncountries such as Egypt, Jordan, Germany, Italy, and others to be on \nour side; to say the President said the Democratic-controlled Senate is \nnot interested in national security, when he didn't say it, is a real \ninjustice.\n  Mr. REID. Folks listen. Listen. Six times within the past month--four \ntimes at fundraisers--the President said the same thing.\n  When the majority leader came to the floor, he said a number of \nthings.\n  First of all, he quoted correctly that at a fundraiser, Dowd, one of \nthe Republican pollsters, was quoted, and I quote:\n\n       Number-one driver for our base motivationally is this war.\n\n  Then, of course, we go to Karl Rove. Karl Rove, prior to the \nPresident being elected, no one knew who he was. We in Nevada knew him \nbecause he is from Nevada. But now everybody knows Karl Rove because he \nis known as the President's closest confidant. Of course, in June a \nfloppy disk was found at Lafayette Park, right across from the White \nHouse. No one has denied that Karl Rove said what was on this floppy \ndisk. Basically, it said focus on the war. There is the key point that \nshould be centered on White House desire to maintain a positive issue \nenvironment. That positive issue environment is focus on the war and \nnot on the stumbling economy.\n\n  Then we go to Andrew Card. Andrew Card said from a marketing point of \nview, you don't introduce new products in August.\n  Then we have the Vice President, and then we have the President. OK. \nNow.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. No. I will not.\n  Today, the Republican National Committee--of course, who leads the \nRepublican National Committee? It is the President of the United \nStates. Just like when we have a Democratic President, he is the leader \nof the Democratic National Committee. We have e-mail now. For some \npeople, e-mail is not what we are used to. But we have an e-mail. Who \nwas this e-mail sent to? It was sent to GOP team leaders. And it also \ngives you information if you want to become a GOP team leader. Who do \nyou get to become one? We know how. Money.\n  What does this say? Maybe this is what this is all about--\nfundraising; seeing if they can raise some more money for the midterm \nelections.\n\n       Tell Your Senators to support President Bush's Homeland \n     Security. Democrat Senators Put Special Interests Over \n     Security.\n\n  Among other things, this said the Senate is more interested in \nspecial interests in Washington and not the security of the American \npeople.\n  It goes on to say.\n\n       This bipartisan approach is stalled in the Senate because \n     some Senate Democrats have chosen to put special interest, \n     Federal Government employee unions, over the security of the \n     American people.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will not yield until I finish. Just be patient.\n  Madam President, this is what it is all about--raising money for the \nmidterm elections and accusing me of being not for the interests of \nthis Nation.\n  I was the first Democrat to publicly support this President's father. \nI came to this floor right here--first Democrat--to say go to Iraq and \ndo what you have to do. And to accuse me of not being for the Nation's \nsecurity--as Senator Daschle pointed out, back here is a man who is \nmissing an arm that was blown off when he was in the Second World War. \nAs he said, he was a very young man. Max Cleland came in. He has one \narm. He is missing both legs and an arm. He is not for the security of \nthis Nation?\n  Talk to Fritz Hollings, a man nearly 80 years old, who was in World \nWar II as an officer and fought in combat.\n  Danny Akaka. Now, most of us here don't have Congressional Medals of \nHonor like Dan Inouye has. And let us not forget John Kerry and Tom \nCarper. But vicariously I have served in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives trying to do what I could to have this a secure nation. \nAnd to have anyone accuse me of not being for a secure nation is \naccusing me of not being patriotic. That is not right.\n  They can accuse me of being too liberal on an issue, too conservative \non an issue, being a big spender, not spending enough, but don't accuse \nme--I didn't come back here to be called names. That is what I am being \ncalled.\n  Now, you can criticize Tom Daschle all you want, but, remember, the \nAmerican people know he is right. You can't do what has been done.\n  We want to pass homeland security. This is a good man, Senator \nLieberman. He is one of the most conservative people we have in the \nDemocratic caucus. He started working on this bill before September 11. \nDoes he not want this bill? Of course he wants this bill.\n  We are being told we can't have cloture. Why did we file cloture? \nBecause for 4 weeks we have been trying to pass a bill for this \nPresident, whose chairman of the Republican National Committee is \nsending out this trash.\n  So I think we should debate the issues. I am proud of Tom Daschle for \nstanding up and bringing attention to what is going on.\n  What is going on? That the No. 1 driver for the Republicans is the \nwar. It should not be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CARPER). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will just repeat to my colleague, you \nmay find a quote from the RNC, and I am sure we could finds things from \nthe Democratic National Committee to be quite partisan. What I stated \nwas that the President did not state what was alluded to yesterday on \nthe floor when the majority leader said that, quote: the Democratic \nSenate is not interested in the security of the American people.\n  That is what he said. I am just saying, quite frankly, the President \nof the United States did not say it. I reviewed the entire speech.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that speech printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   President Calls on Congress to Act\n\n     Army National Guard Aviation Support Facility, Trenton, NJ, \n         September 23, 2002\n       The President: Thanks a lot for coming out this morning. It \n     is my honor to be--it is my honor to be back in New Jersey. I \n     want to thank you all for coming out. I want to thank the \n     people of the New Jersey Army and Air National Guard for your \n     hospitality. (Applause.) I'm here to talk about how best to \n     make America a stronger country, a safer country, and a \n     better country for all of us.\n       There is an old bridge over the Delaware River that says: \n     Trenton makes, the world takes. (Applause.) It talks about \n     the work ethic of the people of this part of our country, it \n     talks about the creativity, it talks about the true strength \n     of America. The true strength of America are our fellow \n     citizens. The strength of our country is the people of \n     America. And I'm honored to be with such hardworking people. \n     (Applause.)\n       Congress can help. Congress needs to work hard before they \n     go home. Congress needs to get some things done, which means \n     a homeland security department, a budget that reflects our \n     priorities. They've got to make sure they don't overspend \n     your money. They've got to remember, everything they do must \n     go to make sure America is a stronger and safer and better \n     place. (Applause.)\n       I want to thank Brigadier General Glenn Rieth for opening \n     up this hangar and for inviting me to this base. I want to \n     thank all the Guard personnel who serve the United States of \n     America. I want to thank you for your service, I want to \n     thank you for your sacrifice. (Applause.) I want to thank \n     your governor for being here today. I appreciate Governor \n     McGreevey being at the steps of Air Force One. I'm thankful \n     for his hospitality. I appreciate him coming to say, hello, \n     and I'm honored he's here today to hear this speech. \n     Governor, thank you for coming.\n       I appreciate members of the congressional delegation. \n     Congressmen Ferguson, Saxton and Smith from New Jersey, thank \n     you all\n\n[[Page S9395]]\n\n     for being here. (Applause.) I want to thank Bob Prunetti who \n     is the Mercer County Executive, for greeting me here, as \n     well. And I want to thank you all for coming.\n       Here's what's on my mind: I want our people to work here in \n     America. Any time somebody who wants to work can't find a \n     job, it means we've got a problem in this country. And we \n     will not rest until people can find work. A stronger America \n     means a strong economy. A stronger country means that our \n     good, hardworking Americans are able to put food on the table \n     for their families.\n       Now, we're making progress. Listen, interest rates are low, \n     inflation is low, we've got the best workers in the world. \n     We've got the best, hardest workers and smartest workers in \n     the world. We've got the ingredients for growth. But what has \n     taken place so far is not good enough for me. And I hope it's \n     not good enough for the Congress. What's happening in the \n     economy is not good enough for a stronger America. And \n     Congress can help.\n       Listen, I come from the school of thought that says, if \n     you've got an economic problem--and remember, for the first \n     three quarters of my administration we were in negative \n     growth; the stock market started to decline in March of 2000; \n     economic growth started to show down in the summer of 2000; \n     we were in recession in the first three quarters of 2001.\n       In order to make sure the country was stronger, I pulled \n     this page out of the economic textbook, the page that says, \n     if you let people keep more of their own money, they're going \n     to spend it on a good or a service. If they spend it on a \n     good or a service, somebody will produce the good and \n     service. And if somebody produces a good or service, some \n     American is more likely to find work. The tax relief came \n     right at the right time for economic growth and jobs. \n     (Applause.)\n       And if Congress wants to help in job creation, they need to \n     make the tax relief permanent. They need to make the tax \n     relief permanent so our New Jersey small businesses and \n     entrepreneurs can plan for the future. After all, most growth \n     of new jobs comes from small businesses all across America.\n       Congress also must understand they've got to pass an energy \n     bill. You see, an energy bill will be good for jobs. An \n     energy bill will be good for national security. We need an \n     energy bill that encourages consumption [sic], encourages new \n     technologies so our cars are cleaner, encourages new \n     renewable energy sources, but at the same time encourages \n     increase of supply here at home, so we're less dependent on \n     foreign sources of crude oil. (Applause.)\n       Congress needs to get some work done before they go home. \n     And one of the most important things they can do is to pass \n     an anti-terrorism insurance bill. See, we need an insurance \n     bill to cover potential terrorist acts, so that hard hats in \n     America can get back to work. And I want a bill on my desk \n     that says we care more about the working people and less \n     about the trial lawyers. We want a bill that puts the hard \n     hats back to work, not enriches the trial lawyers here in \n     America. (Applause.)\n       In order to make sure our country is stronger and our \n     economy grows, Congress must be wise with your money. Notice \n     I said ``your money.'' When it comes time to budgeting and \n     appropriations, which means spending, sometimes in Washington \n     they forget whose money they're talking about. You hear them \n     talking about the government's money. No,the money in \n     Washington is not the government's money, the money in \n     Washington is your money. And we better be careful about how \n     we spend your money. And if Congress overspends, it's going \n     to a problem for making America's economy continue to grow. \n     And so my message to Congress is: remember whose money you're \n     spending.\n       Now, one of the problems we have is that any time you're \n     worried about spending, you set a budget. That's what you do. \n     The Senate hasn't been able to do so. They don't have a \n     budget, which means it's likely they're going to overspend. \n     See, every idea in Washington is a good idea. Everybody's \n     idea sounds good, except the price tag is generally in the \n     billions. In order to make sure the country is stronger, we \n     need fiscal responsibility in Washington, D.C. We need to \n     make sure that Congress does not overspend. Without a budget, \n     they're likely to overspend.\n       They set deadlines on you, when it come to paying our IRS, \n     paying your taxes. There ought to be a deadline on them in \n     order to get a budget passed and to get bills passed. Now, \n     because they haven't been able to move, they're going to send \n     my desk soon what looks like what they call a temporary \n     spending bill. And that temporary spending bill should not be \n     an excuse for excessive federal spending. The temporary \n     spending bill ought to remember whose money they're spending. \n     A temporary spending bill ought to be clean, so that we don't \n     overspend as the economy is trying to continue to grow. What \n     we need in Washington is fiscal responsibility, fiscal \n     sanity. We need to set priorities with your money. And the \n     most important priority I have is to defend the homeland; is \n     to defend the homeland from a bunch of killers who hate \n     America. (Applause.)\n       It's very important for the school children here to listen \n     to what I'm about to say. You're probably wondering why \n     America is under attack. And you need to know why. We're \n     under attack because we love freedom, is why we're under \n     attack. And our enemy hates freedom. They hate and we love. \n     They hate the thought that this country is a country in which \n     people from all walks of life can worship an almighty God any \n     way he or she fits. They hate the thought that we have honest \n     and open discourse. They hate the thought that we're a beacon \n     of liberty and freedom.\n       We differ from our enemy because we love. We not only love \n     our freedoms and love our values, we love life, itself. In \n     America, everybody matters, everybody counts, every human \n     life is a life of dignity. And that's not the way our enemy \n     thinks. Our enemy hates innocent life; they're willing to \n     kill in the name of a great religion. (Applause.) And as long \n     as we love freedom and love liberty and value every human \n     life, they're going to try to hurt us. And so our most \n     important job is to defend the freedom, defend the homeland--\n     is to make sure what happened on September the 11th doesn't \n     happen again, we must do everything we can--everything in our \n     power--to keep America safe.\n       There are a lot of good people working hard to keep you \n     safe. There are people at the federal level and at the state \n     level, a lot of fine folks here at the local level, doing \n     everything we can to run down every lead. If we find any kind \n     of hint, we're moving on it--all within the confines and all \n     within the structure of the United States Constitution. We're \n     chasing down every possible lead because we understand \n     there's an enemy out there which hates America.\n       I asked the Congress to work with me to come up with a new \n     Department of Homeland Security, to make sure that not only \n     can this administration function better, but future \n     administrations will be able to deal with the true threats we \n     face as we get into the 21st century. A homeland security \n     department which takes over the hundred different agencies \n     and brings them under one umbrella so that there's a single \n     priority and a new culture, all aimed at dealing with the \n     threats.\n       I mean, after all, on our border we need to know who's \n     coming into America, what they're bringing into America, are \n     they leaving when they're supposed to be leaving America. \n     (Applause.) Yet, when you look at the border, there are three \n     different federal agencies dealing with the border: there is \n     Customs and INS and Border Patrol. And sometimes they work \n     together and sometimes they don't--they don't. They've got \n     different work rules. They've got different customs. \n     Sometimes they have different strategies. And that's not \n     right.\n       So I asked Congress go give me the flexibility necessary to \n     be able to deal with the true threats of the 21st century by \n     being able to move the right people to the right place at the \n     right time, so we can better assure America we're doing \n     everything possible. The House responded, but the Senate is \n     more interested in special interests in Washington and not \n     interested in the security of the American people. I will not \n     accept a Department of Homeland Security that does not allow \n     this President, and future Presidents, to better keep the \n     American people secure. (Applause.)\n       And people are working hard in Washington to get it right \n     in Washington, both Republicans and Democrats. See, this \n     isn't a partisan issue. this is an American issue. This is an \n     issue which is vital to our future. It'll help us determine \n     how secure we'll be.\n       Senator Gramm, a Republican, Senator Miller, a Democrat, \n     are working hard to bring people together. And the Senate \n     must listen to them. It's a good bill. It's a bill I can \n     accept. It's a bill that will make America more secure. And \n     anything less than that is a bill which I will not accept, \n     it's a bill which I will not saddle this administration and \n     future administrations with allowing the United States Senate \n     to micro-manage the process. The enemy is too quick for that. \n     We must be flexible, we must be strong, we must be ready to \n     take the enemy on anywhere he decides to hit us, whether it's \n     America or anywhere else in the globe. (Applause.)\n       But the best way to secure our homeland, the only sure way \n     to make sure our children are free and our children's \n     children are free, is to hunt the killers down, wherever they \n     hide, is to hunt them down, one by one, and bring them to \n     justice. (Applause.)\n       As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't matter how long it \n     takes. See, we're talking about our freedom and our future. \n     There's no cave deep enough, as far as I'm concerned; and \n     there's no cave deep enough, as far as the United States \n     military is concerned, either. I want you all to know, if you \n     wear the uniform of our great country, I'm proud of you. I've \n     got confidence in you. I believe that you can handle any \n     mission. (Applause.)\n       No, it's a different kind of war than our nation has seen \n     in the past. One thing that's different is oceans no longer \n     keep us safe. The second thing is, in the old days, you could \n     measure progress by looking at how many tanks the enemy had \n     one day, and how many he had the next day, whether or not his \n     airplanes were flying or whether or not his ships were \n     floating on the seas. It's a different kind of war. And \n     America has begun to adjust its thinking about this kind of \n     war.\n       See, this is the kind of war where the leaders of the enemy \n     hide. They go into big cities--or as I mentioned, caves--and \n     they send youngsters to their suicidal death. That's the kind \n     of war we're having. It's not measured in equipment \n     destroyed, it's going to be measured in people brought to \n     justice. And we're making progress. I had made it clear to \n     the world that either you're with us or you're with the \n     enemy, and that doctrine still stands. (Applause.) And as a \n     result of the hard work by our United States military an the \n     militaries and law enforcement officers of other countries, \n     we've arrested or\n\n[[Page S9396]]\n\n     brought to justice a couple thousand or more. Slowly but \n     surely, we're finding them where we think they can hide.\n       We brought one of them in the other day. He thought he was \n     going to be the 20th hijacker, or at least he was bragging \n     that way. I don't know if he's bragging now. But, see, he \n     thought he was immune, he thought he was invisible, he \n     thought he could hide from the long arm of justice. And like \n     many--about the like number haven't been so lucky as the 20th \n     hijacker. They met their fate.\n       We're getting them on the run, and we're keeping them on \n     the run. They're going to be--as part of our doctrine, we're \n     going to make sure that there's no place for them to alight, \n     no place for them to hide. These are haters, and they're \n     killers. And we owe it to the American people and we owe it \n     to our friends and allies to pursue them, no matter where \n     they try to hide.\n       And that's why I asked the Congress for the largest \n     increase in defense spending since Ronald Reagan was the \n     President. I did so because I firmly believe that any time we \n     commit our troops into harm's way, you deserve the best pay, \n     the best training and the best possible equipment. \n     (Applause.) I also asked for a large increase because I \n     wanted to send a clear signal to the rest of the world that \n     we're in this for the long haul; that there is no calendar on \n     my desk that says, by such and such a day we're going to \n     quit, that by such and such a day we will all have grown \n     weary, we're too tried, and therefore we're coming home.\n       That's not the way we think in America. See, we understand \n     obligation and responsibility. We have a responsibility to \n     our children to fight for freedom. We have a responsibility \n     to our citizens to defend the homeland. And that only means--\n     not only means dealing with real, immediate threats, it also \n     means anticipating threats before they occur, before things \n     happen. It means we've got to look out into the future and \n     understand the new world in which we live and deal with \n     threats before it's too late.\n       And that's why I went into the United Nations the other \n     day. And I said to the United Nations, we have a true threat \n     that faces America; a threat that faces the world; and a \n     threat which diminishes your capacity. And I'm talking about \n     Iraq. That country has got a leader which has attacked two \n     nations in the neighborhood; a leader who has killed \n     thousands of people; a leader who is brutal--see, remember, \n     we believe every life matters and every life is precious--\n     a leader, if there is dissent, will kill the dissenter; a \n     leader who told the United Nations and the world he would \n     not develop weapons of mass destruction, and for 11 long \n     years has stiffed the world.\n       He looked at the United Nations and said this is a paper \n     tiger, their resolutions mean nothing. For 11 years he has \n     deceived and denied. For 11 years he's claimed he has had no \n     weapons and, yet, we know he has.\n       So I went to the United Nations and said, either you can \n     become the League of Nations, either you can become an \n     organization which is nothing but a debating society--or you \n     can be an organization which is robust enough and strong \n     enough to help keep the peace; your choice.\n       But I also told them that if they would not act, if they \n     would not deal with this true threat we face in America, if \n     they would not recognize that America is no longer protected \n     by oceans and that this man is the man who would use weapons \n     of mass destruction at the drop of a hat, a man who would be \n     willing to team up with terrorist organizations with weapons \n     of mass destruction to threaten America and our allies, if \n     they wouldn't act, the United States will--we will not allow \n     the world's worst leaders to threaten us with the world's \n     worst weapons. (Applause.)\n       I want to see strong resolutions coming out of that U.N.; a \n     resolution which says the old ways of deceit are gone; a \n     resolution which will hold this man to account; a resolution \n     which will allow freedom-loving countries to disarm Saddam \n     Hussein before he threatens his neighborhood, before he \n     threatens freedom, before he threatens America and before he \n     threatens civilization. We owe it to our children and we owe \n     it to our grandchildren to keep this nation strong and free. \n     (Applause.)\n       And as we work to make America a stronger place and a safer \n     place, we always must remember that we've got to work to make \n     America a better place, too--a better place. And that starts \n     with making sure every single child in America gets a great \n     education. (Applause.) Make sure that every child--make sure \n     that we focus on each child, every child. It says we expect \n     and believe our children can learn to read and write and add \n     and subtract. As a society, we will challenge the soft \n     bigotry of low expectations.\n       We believe every child can learn, every child matters, and \n     therefore we expect to be told whether or not the children \n     are learning to read and write and add and subtract. And if \n     we find they're not, if we find there are certain children \n     who aren't learning and the systems are just shuffling \n     through as if they don't matter, we must challenge the status \n     quo. Failure is unacceptable in America. Every child matters, \n     and no child should be left behind in this great country. \n     (Applause.)\n       A better America, a better America is one which makes sure \n     that our health care systems are responsive to the patient \n     and make sure our health care systems, particularly for the \n     elderly, are modern. We need prescription drug benefits for \n     elderly Americans. The Medicare system must be reformed, must \n     be made to work so that we have a better tomorrow for all \n     citizens in this country. (Applause.)\n       A better America is one that understands as we're helping \n     people go from dependency to freedom, from welfare, we must \n     help them find work. A better America understands that when \n     people work, there is dignity in their lives. A better \n     America is America which understands the power of our faith-\n     based institutions in our country. It's in our churches and \n     synagogues and mosques that we find universal love and \n     universal compassion. (Applause.)\n       You now what's really interesting about what's taking place \n     in America is this: the enemy hit us, but out of the evil \n     done to America is going to come some incredible good, \n     because of the nature of our soul, the nature of our being. \n     On the one hand, I believe we can achieve peace. Oh, I know \n     the kids hear all the war rhetoric and tough talk, and that's \n     necessary to send a message to friend and foe alike that \n     we're plenty tough, if you rouse this country, and we're \n     not going to relent.\n       But we're not going to relent because my desire is to \n     achieve peace. I want there to be a peaceful world. I want \n     children all across our globe to grow up in a peaceful \n     society. Oh, I know the hurdles are going to be high to \n     achieving that peace. There's going to be some tough \n     decisions to make, some tough action for some to take. But \n     it's all aimed at making America safe and secure and \n     peaceful, but other places around the world, too. I believe \n     this--I believe that if our country--and it will--remains \n     strong and tough and we fight terror wherever terror exists, \n     that we can achieve peace. We can achieve peace in the Middle \n     East, we can achieve peace in South Asia. We can achieve \n     peace.\n       No, out of the evil done to America can come a peaceful \n     world. And at home, out of the evil done to our country can \n     come some incredible good, as well. We've got to understand, \n     in America there are pockets of despair and hopelessness, \n     places where people hurt because they're not sure if America \n     is meant for them, places where people are addicted. And \n     government can help eradicate these pockets by handing out \n     money. But what government cannot do is put hope in people's \n     hearts or a sense of purpose in people's lives. That's done \n     when neighbor loves neighbor. That's done when this country \n     hears the universal call to love a neighbor just like you'd \n     like to be loved yourself.\n       No, out of the evil done to America is coming some \n     incredible good, because we've got citizens all across this \n     land--whether they be a part of our faith-based institutions \n     or charitable institutions--citizens all across this land who \n     have heard the call that if you want to fight evil, do some \n     good. if you want to resist the evil done to America, love \n     your neighbor; mentor a child; put your arm around an elderly \n     citizen who is shut-in, and say, I love you; start a Boy \n     Scout or Girl Scout troop; go to your Boys and Girls Clubs; \n     help somebody in need.\n       No, this country, this country has heard the call. This \n     country is a country full of such incredibly decent and warm-\n     hearted and compassionate citizens that there's people all \n     across New Jersey and all across America who without one \n     government act, without government law are in fact trying to \n     make the communities in which they live a more responsive and \n     compassionate and loving place.\n       Today I met Bob and Chris Morgan, USA Freedom Corps \n     greeters, who coordinate blood drives right here in New \n     Jersey for the American Red Cross. Nobody told them they had \n     to do that. There wasn't a law that said, you will be a part \n     of collecting blood. They decided to do it because they want \n     to make America more able to address emergency and help \n     people in need. Whether it's teaching a child to read, \n     whether it's delivering food to the hungry or helping those \n     who need a--housing, you can make a huge difference in the \n     lives of our fellow Americans.\n       See, societies change one heart, one conscience, one soul \n     at a time. Everybody has worth and everybody matters. No, out \n     of the evil done to America is going to come a compassionate \n     society. (Applause.) Now this great country will show the \n     world what we're made out of. This great country, by \n     responding to the challenges we face will leave behind a \n     legacy of sacrifice, a legacy of compassion, a legacy of \n     peace, a legacy of decency for future generations of people \n     fortunate enough to be called an American.\n       There's no question in my mind--I hope you can tell, I'm an \n     optimistic fellow about our future. I believe we can overcome \n     any difficulty that's put in our path. I believe we can cross \n     any hurdle, climb any mountain, because this is the greatest \n     nation on the face of the earth, full of the most decent, \n     hardworking, honorable citizens.\n       May God bless you all, and may God bless America. Thank \n     you, all. (Applause.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. I read the speech.\n  Read the next paragraph. I have read the one paragraph. Read the next \nparagraph. The Senator from West Virginia will be interested in this. I \nwill read the two relevant paragraphs again:\n\n       The House responded, but the Senate is more interested in \n     special interests in Washington and not interested in the \n     security of the American people.\n\n  He didn't say the Democrats in the Senate. He didn't say what was \nstated on the floor. Let's be factual. Let's be honest. Let's say \nexactly what was\n\n[[Page S9397]]\n\nsaid. Let's not construe and say something else.\n  Let me go on. The President said:\n\n       I will not accept a Department of Homeland Security that \n     does not allow this President, and future Presidents, to \n     better keep the American people secure.\n       And people are working hard in Washington to get it right \n     in Washington, both Republicans and Democrats.\n\n  That is in the President's speech. That doesn't sound very partisan \nto me.\n\n       See--\n\n  This is again the President:\n\n       See, this isn't a partisan issue. This is an American \n     issue. This is an issue which is vital to our future. It'll \n     help us determine how secure we'll be.\n       Senator Gramm, a Republican, Senator Miller, a Democrat, \n     are working hard to bring people together.\n\n  That is not a partisan speech. That is not flailing all Senate \nDemocrats. That is not accusing all Senate Democrats as being \nunpatriotic. Quite far from it.\n  So to stand on the floor and say, well, the President said that six \ntimes in the last few days, I don't believe is factually accurate. And \nto send signals to our allies and our adversaries that this is \npoliticizing the war, or that some people think we might be, is \npoliticizing the war, and it is wrong. And it sends the wrong signal. \nIt sends all kinds of wrong signals, and it shouldn't be done.\n  If you are going to quote the President of the United States, not his \nelection committee, not some mysterious tape that shows up someplace, \nbut if you are going to quote the President of the United States, you \nought to quote him accurately. And that was not done. And it is \nprobably one of the harshest attacks I have ever seen on a sitting \nPresident of the United States in my 22 years in the Senate--the \nharshest. And at a time when we are in the process of trying to build \nan international coalition, the timing could not be much worse.\n  Also, I am bothered that people would say: Well, he said it. I'm just \nsure he did.\n  Well, he didn't say it. And if somebody has a quote--an accurate \nquote--that shows I am incorrect, I will stand here and say, oops, I'm \nwrong, because I believe more than anything my integrity means more to \nme than whatever somebody else says. I want to be factually accurate.\n  Before I came down yesterday to the floor, I said: Give me a \ntranscript of the speech. I wanted to see exactly what it said. I \ndidn't want to say: It didn't sound like something President Bush would \nsay to me. And I have heard him give many campaign speeches. I know him \npretty well. That doesn't sound like him. Where is it in his speech? \nOh, he didn't say that.\n  He even went on to say both Democrats and Republicans are working to \npass a good bill. And he never castigated all Senate Democrats as being \nunpatriotic or not interested in national security--he didn't say it.\n\n  Surprisingly enough, just because something is in the Washington Post \ndoes not make it right. The Washington Post was not even quoted \naccurately. I mean, come on now. This is a serious issue.\n  I want to conclude with a statement.\n  The Senate of the United States is a great institution, and I don't \nthink it behooves us to quote a flier from the Republican National \nCommittee, or the Democrat National Committee, and play a lot of \npolitics, and say let's see what we can pull out of these documents. We \nare talking about a quote from the President not these fliers and \nstatements from other people.\n  I can pull out more quotes right now from President Clinton and Vice \nPresident Gore stating their efforts to repudiate Saddam Hussein, the \nneed for strong enforcement of resolutions, and on and on, that they \nnever enforced--that they never enforced.\n  There were 16 resolutions passed in the United Nations dealing with \nIraq, and the previous administration talked tough, lobbed a few bombs, \na few cruise missiles, but we never enforced them. The net result is \nthere have been no arms control inspections going on in Iraq for the \nlast four years.\n  It is a lot more dangerous today than it was four years ago.\n  When I read these previous statements, both by President Clinton and \nVice President Gore, about how we have to get tough against Iraq, and \nthen we didn't do anything, it makes me wonder: Wait a minute, what is \ngoing on?\n  So now we are saying we should adopt a resolution that is not too far \ndifferent than what we adopted unanimously in 1998 with almost no \ndebate, and people are acting like: Wait a minute, the sky is falling. \nOr they try to move an issue from homeland security into the war on \nIraq. I don't know if that is deliberate or just a mistake, but there \nis a real problem there. You can't be sending mixed signals to our \npotential adversaries and/or our potential allies, when we are trying \nto get people on our side, and misquote the President of the United \nStates on something that important.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Of course, I am working with colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle and with the White House to see that we can fashion a \nstrong resolution giving the President authority to take whatever \nactions are necessary in Iraq.\n  But will the Senator from Oklahoma help me understand, what did the \nPresident mean when he said, at a fundraiser for Mr. Forrester, in New \nJersey, Monday: ``And my message to the Senate is: You need to worry \nless about special interests in Washington and more about the security \nof the American people''? At a welcome ceremony in Trenton, Monday, he \nsaid: ``The House responded, but the Senate is more interested in \nspecial interests in Washington and not interested in the security of \nthe American people.''\n  At a meeting with Cabinet members on Tuesday, the President said: \n``My message, of course, is that--to the senators up here that are more \ninterested in special interests, you better pay attention to the \noverall interests of protecting the American people.''\n  Then, finally, on Tuesday, at a fundraiser for Mr. Thune, from South \nDakota: ``I appreciate John's vote on a good homeland security bill. \nAnd the Senate must hear this, because the American people understand \nit: They should not respond to special interests. They ought to respond \nto this interest: protecting the American people from a future \nattack.''\n  So I say the problem here is we have a disagreement about how to best \nprotect homeland security workers or whether to protect them, and also \nhow to preserve the authority of the President over national security. \nThat is a good-faith dispute which we are having.\n  But I think the concern is that the President was questioning the \npatriotism of those who do not agree with him on that issue.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to respond to my colleague. I actually \nread both of those quotes. I put one in the Record. I will put both \nquotes in the Record so the American people can see this.\n\n  I read the President's comments. You only read one line. I read three \nparagraphs--he never said, ``The Democrats in the Senate are not \ninterested in national security.'' That was the maddening quote. He \nnever said it--never said it. Yet it was accepted that he said it. That \nis wrong. It was stated on last night's TV, stated in this morning's \nfloor debate. I heard one or two people say he impugned the integrity \nof the entire Democratic caucus. No, he didn't. Read what the President \nsaid. He even complimented Democrats. He said both Republicans and \nDemocrats are working hard to pass a good bill.\n  There are consequences to words. Words are important. I read the \nPresident's statements both at the Forrester event and the Thune event. \nThey were not offensive, and they never stated what was said on the \nfloor of the Senate. They were misconstrued somehow, some way. That is \nunfortunate because there are consequences to our words.\n  There are some people who listen. There are headlines. I haven't read \nwhat the European papers have said, but I don't look forward to that \nbecause I am afraid it sends the wrong signals.\n  I do agree with my colleagues, we should improve the quality of \ndebate in the Senate. If we ever quote anybody, we should quote them \naccurately. We should never impugn the motives or integrity of any \nMember. That has happened more frequently around here than it should. \nNor should we impugn\n\n[[Page S9398]]\n\nthe motives or integrity of the President of the United States. \nCertainly if we are going to quote the President, an equal branch of \nGovernment, we should do it accurately. That wasn't done in this case.\n  I don't think we should be reading from campaign flyers because we \ncould do that all day long. We don't want to turn this into a political \nbrawl. We want to legislate. We need to pass a Department of Homeland \nSecurity bill. We need to work out the issues. There is a legitimate \ndebate, a difference of whether or not we should change the President's \npower or authority in dealing with employees. Should he have a national \nsecurity waiver? Every President, going all the way back--most people \nsaid since Jimmy Carter--I believe to John F. Kennedy, has had a \nnational security waiver in dealing with employees. The President of \nthe United States needs flexibility to put people in, do different \nthings.\n  Senator Gramm has shown me a complaint filed by a union that was \nupset because of higher notification status--they didn't negotiate that \nwith the union. That is absurd. The President should not have to \nnegotiate with the union; if he feels compelled to issue a higher \nsecurity threat to the Nation's people, he should not have to negotiate \nthat with the union. One union has already filed a complaint, I guess \nbefore the NLRB, about that.\n  Again, I will not impugn the integrity or the motives or the \npatriotism of a colleague because they may have a difference with me on \nthat particular issue.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. BYRD. I want to inquire as to how long the Senator believes he \nwill be needing the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will conclude very shortly.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not complaining.\n  I would also like to quote George Romney, who used to be Governor of \nMichigan.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I remember George Romney.\n  Mr. BYRD. Here is what he said: I didn't say that I didn't say it. I \nsaid that I didn't say that I said that. I want to make that perfectly \nclear.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee for his enlightening the debate.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  Again, I want to help restore the dignity and integrity of Senate \ndebate. I want to help repair some of the damage that might have been \ndone between the legislative branch and the executive branch. It is \ncritically important. I say this mindful that I used to be one of the \nleaders when there was a Democrat in the White House. I didn't agree \nwith President Clinton many times, and I stated so on the floor with \ngreat energy many times. I may have crossed the line sometimes. I am \nnot sure. But I think it is very important that we respect the office \nof the President of the United States and that we not misquote the \noffice of the President of the United States, nor that we ever misquote \ncolleagues.\n  I am very insistent that we be accurate in our positions, our \nstatements, our numbers, our quotes. If not, it is demeaning to the \nbody.\n  Vice President Gore's speech to a San Francisco group was very \ndemeaning to the office of the former Vice President because I think it \nundercuts the existing administration's dealing with some problems that \nwere left by the previous administration.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator respond to a question briefly?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I agree with everything the Senator has said. We have \nso much important work to do. We ought to go about it, even when there \nare differences of opinion, not impugning--to use his term--each \nother's motives.\n  Would the Senator not agree that the processes of government would \nalso be made not only more productive but more respectable if the \nPresident himself would not impugn the motives of Members of Congress \nof either party when they disagree with him?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will tell my friend and colleague, I just read the \nquotes. I don't think he was impugning our motives. He did not say \nSenate Democrats. If there is anything else from this dialog and \nspeech, I hope the press and others will realize, the President never \nsaid, ``Senate Democrats aren't interested in national security.'' That \nis a misquote, and I am afraid a misquote that has done some damage. \nHopefully, it can be repaired.\n  I listened to the President. I don't think I have heard him impugn \nthe motives of colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The deputy majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want printed in the Record this statement \nfrom this e-mail, the title of which is ``Urgent: Effectively defending \nour homeland at stake.'' This was sent out today. It quotes the \nPresident of the United States, George W. Bush. It says:\n\n       The House responded, but the Senate is more interested in \n     special interests in Washington and not interested in the \n     security of the American people.\n\n  That is a quote, supposedly, that the Republican National Committee \nsent out quoting President Bush. It goes on further in another \nparagraph to say:\n\n       This bipartisan approach is stalled in the Senate because \n     some Senate Democrats have chosen to put special interest, \n     federal government employee unions over the security of the \n     American people.\n\n  I want that in the Record. That is what is sent out today as a \nfundraiser from the Republican National Committee, the leader of which \nis the President of the United States, George W. Bush.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the document in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Effectively Defending Our Homeland at Stake!\n\n\n   Tell Your Senators to Support President Bush's Homeland Security; \n         Democrat Senators Put Special Interests Over Security.\n\n       ``I asked Congress to give me the flexibility necessary to \n     be able to deal with the true threats of the 21st century by \n     being able to move the right people to the right place at the \n     right time, so we can better assure America we're doing \n     everything possible. The House responded, but the Senate is \n     more interested in special interests in Washington and not \n     interested in the security of the American people. I will not \n     accept a Department of Homeland Security that does not allow \n     this President, and future Presidents, to better keep the \n     American people secure.'' --PresidentGeorge Bush, September \n     23, 2002.\n       President Bush has called on the Senate to pass the \n     bipartisan plan by Senators Gramm and Miller that creates a \n     homeland security agency with the flexibility and freedom to \n     manage the needs to keep America safe. This bipartisan \n     approach is stalled in the Senate because some Senate \n     Democrats have chosen to put special interest, federal \n     government employee unions over the security of the American \n     people. Instead of providing President Bush with the power he \n     needs to protect the homeland, these Senate Democrats would \n     strip the Presidency of a vital national security tool every \n     President since John F. Kennedy has had--the power to suspend \n     collective bargaining agreements during times of national \n     emergency. Learn why this is critical to our homeland \n     defense: http://www.gopteamleader.com/myissues/view issue \n     asp?id=3;\n       This week the Washington Post exposed why some Democrat \n     Senators have put special interests over our national \n     interests by reporting that ``lawmakers are loath to cross \n     them just weeks before critical elections,'' saying that \n     Democrats have received ``$50 million in donations in this \n     cycle'' alone. Tell these Democrat Senators that our homeland \n     security is more important than partisan politics and that \n     they need to support the bipartisan bill endorsed by \n     President Bush. We need a single homeland security agency \n     that:\n       Protects the President's existing National Security \n     authority over the federal workforce:\n       Gives the new Secretary of Homeland Security the \n     flexibility and freedom to manage to meet new threats;\n       Protects every employee of the new department against \n     illegal discrimination, and builds a culture in which federal \n     employees know they are keeping their fellow citizens safe \n     through their service to America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Did the Senator want me to yield to him?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I wanted to put something in the Record.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield to the distinguished Senator without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we were debating homeland security at one \npoint earlier today. A perfect example of the kind of problem I am \nconcerned about has just come to my attention. That is a complaint that \nhas been filed\n\n[[Page S9399]]\n\nby the National Treasury Employees Union against a system that we are \nall familiar with. When there is concern about a potential terrorist \nattack, the Government has set up threat priorities. Green is a low \nthreat, blue is a guarded threat, yellow is an elevated threat, orange \nis a high threat, and red is a severe threat.\n  We have just gotten word that the National Treasury Employees Union--\nand I want to put this in the Record--has filed a complaint basically \ncontending that this system of ratings violates their union contract \nbecause the Department was required to negotiate with them before it \nsent out a warning system.\n  I also want to put in the Record the statement from the White House \nrelease on it that said:\n\n       In effect, the union is saying that the Customs Service has \n     no right to implement the President's homeland security \n     direction without entering into lengthy negotiations. And \n     since the Customs Service went ahead anyway, it is now suing \n     the Customs Service in the Federal Labor Relations Authority.\n\n  This is a case that just happened that we ought to be looking at as \nwe write this bill.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding. To save money for the taxpayers, we \nproduced one document on one side of the paper, and the other document \non the other side of the paper. So when we put it in the Record, look \non both sides of the paper. I ask unanimous consent that these \ndocuments be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  United States of America, Federal Labor Relations Authority--Charge \n                           Against an Agency\n\n       1.

This began a formal 135 day comment \n     period.\n       July 26: Attorney General Ashcroft and Governor Ridge \n     reported to the President that the system was ready to put \n     into effect.\n       July 28: The White House directed all agencies to conform \n     their protective security conditions to the new five tiered \n     system.\n       August 20: The Commission of Customs, Judge Rob Bonner, \n     complied with this directive from the President by issuing a \n     Customs Alert Protective Measures directive to the entire \n     customs Service (Attachment B).\n       September 10: The President decided to raise the threat \n     level from yellow (level 3) to orange (level 4).

Mr. President, amidst the wall-to-wall reporting on Iraq \nthat has become daily grist for the Nation's news media, a headline in \nthis morning's USA Today leaped out from the front page: ``In Iraq's \narsenal, Nature's deadliest poison.''\n  The article describes the horrors of botulinum toxin, a potential \nweapon in Iraq's biological warfare arsenal. According to the Journal \nof the American Medical Association, botulinum toxin is the most \npoisonous substance known. We know that Saddam Hussein produced \nthousands of litres of botulinum toxin in the run up to the Gulf war. \nWe also know where some of the toxin came from. Guess. The United \nStates, which approved shipments of botulinum toxin from a nonprofit \nscientific specimen repository to the government of Iraq in l986 and \nl988.\n  I recently asked Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld about these \nshipments during an Armed Services Committee hearing a week ago. I \nrepeat today what I said to him then: In the event of a war with Iraq, \nmight the United States be facing the possibility of reaping what it \nhas sown?\n  The threat of chemical and biological warfare is one of the most \nterrifying prospects of a war with Iraq, and it is one that should give \nus serious pause before we embark on a course of action that might lead \nto an all-out, no-holds-barred conflict.\n  Earlier this week, British Prime Minister Tony Blair released an \nassessment of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program which \ncontained the jolting conclusion that Iraq could launch chemical or \nbiological warheads within 45 minutes of getting the green light from \nSaddam Hussein.\n  The British government assessment, while putting Iraq's chemical and \nbiological capabilities in starker terms than perhaps we have seen \nbefore, closely tracks with what U.S. officials have been warning for \nsome time: namely, Saddam Hussein has the means and the know-how to \nwage biological and chemical warfare, and he has demonstrated his \nwillingness to use such weapons. By the grace of God, he apparently has \nnot yet achieved nuclear capability.\n  On the matter of biological warfare, Gen. Richard Myers, Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee last week that many improvements have been made to the \nprotective gear worn by American soldiers and to the sensors used to \ndetect chemical or biological agents.\n  But according to the USA Today article on botulinum toxin, U.S. \ntroops would be just as vulnerable to botulinum toxin today as they \nwere during the Gulf war.\n  This is what the article states:\n\n       There's still no government-approved vaccine, and the only \n     antitoxin is made by extracting antibodies from the blood of \n     vaccinated horses using decades-old technology.\n\n  Last year's anthrax attack on the U.S. Senate gave all of us in this \nChamber firsthand experience with biological warfare and new insight \ninto the insidious nature of biological weapons. And that attack--hear \nme now--involved only about a teaspoon or so of anthrax sealed in an \nenvelope. The potential consequences of a massive bioweapons attack \nagainst American soldiers on the battlefield boggle the imagination.\n  My concerns over biological warfare were heightened last week when I \ncame across a report in Newsweek that the U.S. Government had cleared \nnumerous shipments of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa to the \nGovernment of Iraq in the mid-1980s, at a time when the U.S. was \ncultivating Saddam Hussein as an ally against Iran. The shipments \nincluded anthrax and botulinum toxin.\n  Moreover, during the same time period, the Centers for Disease \nControl, CDC, was also shipping deadly toxins to Iraq, including vials \nof West Nile fever virus and Dengue fever.\n  This is not mere speculation. I have the letters from the CDC and the \nAmerican Type Culture Collection laying out the dates of shipments, to \nwhom they were sent, and what they\n\n[[Page S9400]]\n\nincluded. This list is extensive and scary anthrax, botulinin toxin, \nand gas gangrene to name just a few. There were dozens and dozens of \nthese pathogens shipped to various ministries within the Government of \nIraq.\n  Why does this matter today? Why do I care about something that \nhappened nearly 20 years ago when Saddam Hussein was considered to be a \npotential ally and Iran's Ayatollah Khomeni was public enemy No. 1 in \nthe United States? I care because it is relevant to today's debate on \nIraq. This is not yesterday's news. This is tomorrow's news.\n  Federal agencies have documents detailing exactly what biological \nmaterial was shipped to Iraq from the United States. We have a paper \ntrail. We not only know that Iraq has biological weapons, we know the \ntype, the strain, and the batch number of the germs that may have been \nused to fashion those weapons. We know the dates they were shipped, and \nthe addresses to which they were shipped.\n  We have in our hands--now get this--the equivalent of a Betty Crocker \ncookbook of ingredients that the U.S. allowed Iraq to obtain and that \nmay well have been used to concoct biological weapons. At last week's \nArmed Services Committee hearing, Secretary Rumsfeld said he has no \nknowledge of any such shipments, and doubted that they ever occurred. \nHe seemed to be a little affronted at the very idea that the United \nStates would ever countenance entering into such a deal with the devil.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld should not shy away from this information. On the \ncontrary, he should seek it out if he does not know it. Let's find out. \nNo one is alleging that the United States deliberately sneaked \nbiological weapons to Iraq under the table during the Iran-Iraq war. I \nam not suggesting that. I am confident that our Government is not that \nstupid. It was simply a matter of business as usual, I suppose. We \nfreely exchange information and technology including scientific \nresearch with our friends. At the time, I suppose, Iraq was our friend. \nIf there is any lesson to be learned from the Iraq experience, it is \nthat we should choose our friends more carefully, see further down the \nroad and exercise tighter controls on the export of materials that \ncould be turned against us. Today's friend may be tomorrow's enemy.\n  This is not the first time I have advocated stricter controls on \nexports. In fact, I added an amendment to the 1996 Defense \nAuthorization Act that was specifically designed to curb the export of \ndual-use technology to potential adversaries of the United States.\n  In the case of the biological materials shipped to Iraq, the Commerce \nDepartment and the CDC have lists of the shipments. The Defense \nDepartment ought to have the same lists so that the decisionmakers will \nknow exactly what types of biological agents American soldiers may face \nin the field. Doesn't that make sense? Shouldn't the Defense Department \nknow what is out there, so that the generals can know what counter-\nmeasures they might need to take to protect their troops?\n  I believe the answer to those questions is yes, and so I am sending \nthe information I have to Secretary Rumsfeld. He said he did not have \nany such information so I am going to send it to Secretary Rumsfeld. No \nmatter how repugnant he finds the idea of the U.S. even inadvertently \naiding Saddam Hussein in his quest to obtain biological weapons, the \nSecretary should have this information at hand, and should make sure \nthat his field commanders also have it.\n  The most deadly of the biological agents that came from the U.S. were \nshipped to the government of Iraq by the American Type Culture \nCollection, ATCC, a non-profit organization that provides biological \nmaterials to industry, government, and educational institutions around \nthe world. According to its own records, the ATCC sent 11 separate \nshipments of biological materials to the government of Iraq between \n1985 and 1988. The shipments included a witches brew of pathogens \nincluding anthrax, botulinum toxin, and gangrene.\n  Meanwhile, the CDC was shipping toxic specimens to Iraq--including \nWest Nile virus and dengue fever--from January 1980 until October 13, \n1993.\n  The nexus between the U.S.-approved shipments of pathogens and the \ndevelopment of Iraq's biological weapons program is particularly \ndisturbing. Consider the following chain of events: In May of 1986, the \nATCC reported the first shipments of anthrax and botulinum toxin to \nIraq. A second shipment including anthrax and botulinum toxin was sent \nto Iraq in September of 1988.\n  At approximately the same time that the first shipment was sent in \nApril of 1986, Iraq turned from studying literature on biological \nwarfare to experimenting with actual samples of anthrax and botulinum \ntoxin. The turning point, according a report to the United Nations \nSecurity Council from the U.N. weapons inspection team, came when \n``bacterial strains were received from overseas'' and delivered to an \nIraqi biological weapons laboratory.\n  In April of 1988, the U.N. weapons inspectors reported that Iraq \nbegan research on the biological agent Clostridium perfringens, more \ncommonly known as gas gangrene. Clostridium perfringens cultures were \namong the materials shipped to Iraq by the ATCC in both 1986 and 1988.\n  These are only a few examples of the pathogens that Iraq is known to \nhave imported from the United States. It is not known how many of these \nmaterials were destroyed following the Persian Gulf war, or how many \nIraq continues to possess, whether they are still viable, or whether in \nits pursuit of biological weapons, Iraq has developed ways to extend \nthe shelf life of toxic biological agents. There is much that we do not \nknow about Iraq's biological warfare program. But there are two \nimportant facts in which we can have great confidence: Iraq has \nbiological weapons, and Iraq obtained biological materials from the \nUnited States in the 1980s.\n  I asked Secretary Rumsfeld, at last week's Armed Services Committee \nhearing, whether we might be reaping what we have sown in Iraq, in \nterms of biological weapons. The question was rhetorical, but the link \nbetween shipments of biological material from the United States and the \ndevelopment of Iraq's biological weapons program is more than just an \nhistorical footnote.\n  The role that the U.S. may have played in helping Iraq to pursue \nbiological warfare in the 1980s should serve as a strong warning to the \nPresident that policy decisions regarding Iraq today could have far \nreaching ramifications on the Middle East and on the United States in \nthe future. In the 1980s, the Ayatollah Khomeni was America's sworn \nenemy, and the U.S. Government courted Saddam Hussein in an effort to \nundermine the Ayatollah and Iran. Today, oh, how different. Saddam \nHussein is America's biggest enemy, America's greatest enemy, America's \nmost dangerous enemy, and the U.S. is said to be making overtures today \nto Iran.\n  The Washington Post reported today that the President is expected to \nauthorize military training for at least 1,000 members of the Iraqi \nopposition to help overthrow Saddam Hussein. The opposition groups \ninclude the Kurds in the north, and the Shiite Muslims in the south.\n  The decision to provide military training to Iraqi opponents of \nSaddam Hussein would mark a major change in U.S. policy, ending a \nprohibition on lethal assistance to the Iraqi opposition. It is not a \ndecision that should be undertaken lightly.\n  Although administration officials told the Post that initial plans \ncalled for modest steps that would allow members of the Iraqi \nopposition to provide liaison to the local population and perhaps guard \nprisoners of war, the officials did not shut the door on providing \ntraining and equipment for more lethal activities.\n  ``Nobody is talking about giving them guns yet,'' one official was \nquoted as saying. ``That would be a dramatic step, but there are many \ndramatic steps yet to be taken.''\n  Has the administration adequately explored the potential \nramifications of creating ethnic armies of dissidents in Iraq? Could \nthe U.S. be laying the groundwork for a brutal civil war in Iraq? Could \nthis proposed policy change precipitate a deadly border conflict \nbetween the Kurds and Turkey? Could we perhaps be setting the stage for \na Shiite-ruled Iraq that could align itself with Iran and result in the \ndomination of the Middle East by hard-line Shiite Muslims along the \nlines of the Ayatollah Khomeni?\n\n[[Page S9401]]\n\n  These are legitimate questions. They are troubling questions. And \nthey should be carefully thought through before we unleash an open-\nended attack on Iraq. We had better think about these questions. We \nbetter ask these questions. The administration had better listen and so \nhad the American people.\n  There are many outstanding questions that the United States should \nconsider before marching in lockstep down the path of committing \nAmerica's military forces to effect the immediate overthrow of Saddam \nHussein. The peril of biological weapons is only one of those \nconsiderations, but it is an important one.\n  Has it been thought out? Has it been discussed? Has the \nadministration said anything to Congress about this, whether or not the \nadministration has explored these questions? Here are the questions. \nDon't say they were not asked. The more we know now, the better off our \ntroops will be in the future.\n  Decisions involving war and peace--the most fundamental life and \ndeath decisions--should never be rushed through this Senate. I say that \nagain. Decisions involving war and peace--the most fundamental of life \nand death decisions--they affect your sons and daughters out there, \nyour blood. Such decisions should never be rushed through, never be \nrushed through or muscled through in haste.\n  Our Founding Fathers understood that and they wisely vested in the \nCongress--not in the President, not in any President, Democrat or \nRepublican--the power to declare war.\n  We are going to discuss this. There is going to be a discussion of \nit. It is not going to be rammed through all that fast.\n  Congress has been presented with a Presidential request for \nauthorization to use military force against Iraq. We now have the \nresponsibility to consider that request, consider it carefully, \nconsider it thoroughly, and consider it on our own timetable. I urge my \ncolleagues to do just that and avoid the pressure--avoid the pressure \nto rush to judgment on such an important and vital and far-reaching and \nmomentous matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1646, \njust received from the House; that the report be considered and agreed \nto; that the correcting resolution, H. Con. Res. 483 at the desk be \nagreed to; the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action or debate; and that any statements related to this \nmatter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The report is printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nSeptember 23, 2002.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate the \nconference report on H.R. 1646, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act \nfor fiscal year 2003.\n  The bill contains two divisions. Division A is the State Department \nAuthorization Act, and contains authorization of appropriations for the \nDepartment of State, and other foreign policy programs, and also \ncontains several policy provisions. Division B contains the Security \nAssistance Act, which provides authorizations and legal authorities \nunder the Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act.\n  This bill includes several important items, including the completion \nof a project that Senator Helms and I began in 1997, the legislation to \nauthorize payment of our back dues to the United Nations in exchange \nfor reform in that organization. The conference\n\n[[Page S9402]]\n\nreport would facilitate the final installment of $244 million in \narrears to the UN and other international organizations. I salute the \nformer Chairman of the Committee, Senator Helms, for initiating this \nproject six years ago and for sticking with it. It has made a material \ndifference in improving the relationship between the United States and \nthe United Nations.\n  The bill includes two other provisions important to continuing the \nimprovement of our relationship with the United Nations. First, the \nbill clears the way for the payment of nearly $80 million in new \narrears which have accumulated in the last few years. Second, the bill \nauthorizes the payment of our dues to the UN at the beginning of the \ncalendar year, rather than the current system whereby we pay our dues \nat the start of the U.S. fiscal year. That late payment of our dues is \ndetrimental, not only to UN operations, but to U.S.-UN relations. I \nhope the Administration will embrace this provision and request the \nnecessary funds in the fiscal year 2004 budget.\n  Further, the bill authorizes funding at levels equal to or exceeding \nthe President's budget request for the Department of State, embassy \nsecurity, contributions for international organizations and \ninternational peacekeeping, and international broadcasting. The United \nStates is a great power, and it has substantial responsibilities around \nthe world, In order to meet those responsibilities, it must have a \nwell-funded and well-equipped diplomatic corps. And if we are going to \ndeploy our diplomats around the world, we must protect them. We cannot \nprovide perfect security for our people, but we can and must take all \nreasonable precautions against known dangers. In 1999, Congress \nprovided an authorization of $4.5 billion over five years--or $900 \nmillion per year, for embassy construction and security. This bill adds \nan additional $100 million to this authorization for fiscal year 2003.\n  Division B of this bill is the Security Assistance Act of 2002. It \nincludes: foreign military assistance, including Foreign Military \nFinancing and International Military Education and Training; \ninternational arms transfers; and many of our arms control, \nnonproliferation and antiterrorism programs.\n\n  This division includes some significant initiatives. For example, \nseveral provisions are designed to streamline the arms export control \nsystem, so as to make it more efficient and responsive to competitive \nrequirements in a global economy, without sacrificing controls that \nserve foreign policy or nonproliferation purposes. This is a vital \nenterprise. U.S. industry depends upon the efficient processing of arms \nexport applications, and U.S. firms lose contracts when the U.S. \nGovernment cannot make up its mind expeditiously.\n  At the same time, however, an ill-advised export license could lead \nto sensitive equipment getting into the hands of enemies or of unstable \nregimes. So there is a tension between the need for efficiency and the \nneed not to make a mistake that ends up putting U.S. lives at risk. \nThis bill addresses that tension providing funds for improved staffing \nlevels, information and communications to enable the State Department \nto make quicker and smarter export licensing decisions. It also raises \nmodestly the prior notice thresholds for most arms sales to our NATO \nallies, Australia, New Zealand or Japan. On the other hand, this bill \nadds a prior notice requirement for some sales of small arms and light \nweapons and strengthens the prior notice requirement for changes in the \nUnited States Munitions List.\n  Division B includes several new nonproliferation and antiterrorism \nmeasures. For example, the ban on arms sales to state supporters of \nterrorism, in section 40(d) of the Arms Export Control Act, is \nbroadened to include states engaging in the proliferation of chemical, \nbiological or radiological weapons.\n  This bill requires the President to establish an interagency \nmechanism to coordinate nonproliferation programs directed at the \nindependent states of the former Soviet Union. This provision is based \non S. 673, a bill introduced by Senator Hagel and me with the co-\nsponsorship of Senators Domenici and Lugar. It will ensure continuing, \nhigh-level coordination of our many nonproliferation programs, so that \nwe can be more confident that they will mesh with each other. The need \nfor better coordination has been cited in several reports, including \nlast year's report of the Russia Task Force of the Secretary of Energy \nAdvisory Board, chaired by former Senator Howard Baker and former White \nHouse counsel Lloyd Cutler.\n  This bill encourages the Secretary of State to seek an increase in \nthe regular budget of the International Atomic Energy Agency, beyond \nthat required to keep pace with inflation. Because the IAEA's budget \nfor 2003 has already been adopted, this bill authorizes an increase in \nthe U.S. voluntary contribution to IAEA programs. This organization is \nvital to our nuclear nonproliferation efforts, its workload is \nincreasing, and now it has begun a major program to locate and secure \n``orphaned'' radioactive sources that could otherwise show up in a \nterrorist's radiological weapon.\n  Subtitle XIII-B of this bill is the ``Russian Federation Debt for \nNonproliferation Act of 2002,'' a provision that Senator Lugar and I \nintroduced, with the support of Senator Helms. This subtitle authorizes \nthe President to offer Soviet-era debt reduction to the Russian \nFederation in the context of an arrangement whereby the savings to \nRussia would be invested in agreed nonproliferation programs or \nprojects. Debt reduction is a potentially important means of funding \nthe costs of securing Russia's stockpiles of sensitive nuclear \nmaterial, chemical weapons and dangerous pathogens, of destroying its \nchemical weapons and dismantling strategic weapons, and of helping its \nformer weapons experts to find civilian careers and resist offers from \nrogue states or terrorists.\n\n  Three months ago, the Bush Administration persuaded the G-8 countries \nto take a significant step: they agreed to what is known as ``10 plus \n10 over 10,'' a commitment to provide the Russian Federation $10 \nbillion in U.S. nonproliferation assistance and $10 billion in \nassistance from the other G-8 members over the next 10 years. This \njoint willingness to provide $20 billion opens new possibilities in \nRussian nonproliferation. It also sends a message to Moscow that \nworking with the West or nonproliferation will be more profitable than \nselling dangerous technology to Iran.\n  The G-8 agreement included the important possibility of the leading \neconomic powers using debt reduction to finance this assistance, and \nthe Administration worked with us to ensure that this subtitle gives \nthe President the flexibility he would need if he chose to use debt \nreduction. Pursuant to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, he must \nstill obtain appropriations for the cost of reducing any debt pursuant \nto this section. I have every hope, however, that we will see the day \nwhen both the United States and several of our allies use debt \nreduction to increase our nonproliferation assistance to Russia.\n  In closing, I thank my colleagues on the conference committee, \nparticularly Chairman Hyde and Representative Lantos in the other body, \nand Senator Helms, for their cooperation in putting together this bill.\n  I would also like to recognize the hard work of all the staff on both \nthe House and Senate committees, who did much of the preliminary work \nto prepare the bill for consideration by the conference committee. \nEqually important, I want to recognize the invaluable contributions and \ntireless efforts of the Deputy Legislative Counsel in the Senate, Art \nRynearson. Mr. Rynearson labored many hours, including all of this past \nweekend, to assist the Committee staff in preparing and refining the \nlegislative language in the conference report. This report would not \nhave been ready for consideration at this time without his hard work.\n  This conference report is important to the operation of our U.S. \nforeign policy agencies. It has received strong approval in the other \nbody. I urge its approval by the Senate.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this legislation is the culmination of a \nbipartisan effort begun early in the 107th Congress. Senator Biden \nchaired our conference committee and was a tremendous leader in \nfinalizing the bill and ensuring its bipartisan support. I thank him \nfor his leadership of the committee and his friendship over the past 30 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S9403]]\n\n  Given the strange events of the 107th Congress, this bill in fact had \nbipartisan authorship. We provided a first draft of this legislation to \nSenator Biden in May 2001, when the Senate leadership changed hands. \nThe bill approved by the conference committee is similar to that draft \nin many respects. It contains important details that advance our \nnational interest and reflect shifts in priorities that followed the \nterrorist attacks on our country of September 2001.\n  The bill allows for the payment of our U.N. assessments in a manner \nthat encourages that organization to embrace improved financial \npractices and to complete the reforms that were initiated at our \ninsistence, including the critical issue of appropriate representation \nof American personnel in U.N. positions.\n  This bill accomplishes a number of other important objectives. It \nreaffirms Congress's strong support for Israel as an important ally in \na turbulent region by recognizing the right of Israel to name Jerusalem \nas its own capitol and by financial backing to ensure its national \nsecurity. It promotes stability in the Taiwan Straits by reaffirming \nour insistence that any resolution of that long-standing conflict must \nbe peaceful and based on the freely expressed assent of the people of \nTaiwan.\n  We have, I hope conclusively, clarified the status of the American \nInstitute in Taiwan by requiring that the American flag be flown just \nas proudly over that Institute as it is over all American diplomatic \nfacilities.\n  The legislation recognizes the importance of maintaining pressure on \nthe repressive Castro regime in Cuba and moves us toward the goal of \nliberating the Cuban people. It does this by specifically authorizing \ncontinued radio broadcasting to Cuba.\n  The bill provides Secretary Powell with additional authorities to \nmeet the increasing need for effective American diplomacy in the \npresent crisis and to enhance the capacity of Diplomatic Security \nagents. It also makes equitable pay, personnel and travel adjustments \nfor the benefit of State Department personnel.\n  We also extended indefinitely the reporting requirement on \ninternational child abductions, reflecting our dissatisfaction with the \nlack of success in reuniting American parents with their children when \nthey are kidnapped overseas by the other parent. We established new \nreporting obligations that ensure that Congress is notified when \nindividuals who have previously engaged in terrorist activities are \ngranted visas for entry into the United States.\n\n  The progress that Russia has made toward becoming a real democracy \nhas been painful but necessary. This bill emphasizes the establishment \nin Russia of a free press and the rule of law as indispensable \ninstitutions in a functioning democracy. These institutions would focus \npublic attention on dangerous activities that are ignored or condoned \nby government officials. I expect that these institutions, once firmly \nestablished, would have a restraining effect on highly questionable \nactivities, such as Russian support for the Iranian nuclear program, \nand help curtail the proliferation of weapons technology and expertise, \nnuclear know-how is just as dangerous as nuclear material. This bill \nalso encourages the Russian Government to make serious contributions to \nnonproliferation efforts in order to give them a stake in these efforts \nand complement our efforts in Russia.\n  The Tibet Policy Act in this bill culminates the Senate's decades-\nlong support for the Tibetan people. It bolsters Administration efforts \nby specifying investment guidelines to invigorate the Tibetan economy \nwhile preserving the distinct identity of the people. Most notably, \nthis will end any dispute over the importance of the Special \nCoordinator for Tibet by legally mandating such a position.\n  The Security Assistance portion of this bill contains several \nimportant provisions, particularly those regarding the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. While I support the overarching framework \nof the Russian debt-for-nonproliferation provision in Title XIII, I \nharbor deep concerns about continued Russian proliferation to such \nstate sponsors of terrorism as Iran. Thus, the Title includes a \nprovision that places restriction on this debt reduction authority by \nrequiring the President to certify that the Russian Federation has made \nand continues to make ``material progress'' in stemming the flow of \nsensitive goods, technologies, material, and know-how related to \nweapons of mass destruction to states that are international sponsors \nof terrorism. In this era of uncertainty, it is critical that we \naddress this threat. Following in this vein, the Iran Nonproliferation \nAct of 2000 has been amended to require additional information be \nprovided in required reports on transfers of weapons or weapons-related \ntechnologies to Iran.\n  With nonproliferation and disarmament issues taking a front seat in \nthis bill, a provision has been included to allow development \nassistance to be spent for the destruction of surplus stockpiles of \nsmall arms, light weapons and other munitions in developing countries. \nThis is indeed an important activity for developing countries as they \nemerge from periods of civil war or ethnic conflict.\n  The Security Assistance title of this bill also recognizes that South \nAsia is a critical theater of operations in our war against terrorism, \nand encourages the U.S. Government to continue to work on issues of \nnuclear and missile proliferation in this region. To this end, this \nsection states that it shall be the policy of the United States, \nconsistent with its obligations under the Treaty on the \nNonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to encourage and work with the \nGovernments of India and Pakistan to achieve a specific set of \nnonproliferation objectives by September 30, 2003. The Administration \nmust continue to make this a high priority in its key foreign policy \nobjectives.\n\n  Title XI affirms strong support for the profoundly important \nresponsibilities of the Verification and Compliance Bureau to promote \ncompliance analysis and enforce countries' compliance with their legal \nand political nonproliferation commitments. The title authorizes a \nlarger budget than requested for this Bureau, including $1.8 million \nfor additional personnel to adequately staff the mission of this \ncritical Bureau and to improve verification capabilities. This Bureau \nis essential to ensuring that treaties and agreements are more than \nsimple parchment, and should be adequately funded to carry out its \nmission.\n  Furthermore, I am happy to support a Title XII provision that \nprovides the President with the authority to enter into bilateral or \nmultilateral agreements for post-undergraduate flying and tactical \nleadership training at facilities in Southwest Asia. This is critical \naddition for our war against terrorism, as it enables the United States \nto maintain a positive influence in the region and enables our forces \nto have access to training and range facilities. Additionally, Title \nXIV recognizes the important work of the Office of Defense Trade \nControls, and supports additional authorities so that it can achieve a \ngreater level of efficiency in processing munitions licenses.\n  Finally, every Senator knows that no bill is possible without many \nlong hours and hard work by staff. I can't tell these young men and \nwomen often enough what a great service they do for the Senate and for \nthe country. I am particularly grateful to Patti McNerney, the \nCommittee's Republican Staff Director, Rich Douglas, the Chief \nRepublican Counsel, Senior Staff Members Mark Lagon and Mark Esper, \nRepublican Counsel Jeff Gibbs, and Professional Staff Members Carolyn \nLeddy and Maurice Perkins. I am grateful for the work of the rest of \nthe Committee's Republican Staff: Skip Fischer, Walter Lohman, Jed \nRoyal, Jose Cardenas, Brian Fox, Susan Williams, David Merkel, Kelly \nSiekman, Sara Battaglia, Philip Griffin, Lester Munson, Kris Klaich, \nHannah Williams, and Sarah Bardinelli.\n  The cooperative efforts and hard work of the Democratic Committee \nstaff members, especially Brian McKeon, the Committee's Chief Counsel, \nEd Levine, and Jofi Joseph, as well as the current and former staff \ndirectors, Tony Blinken and Ed Hall.\n  Last--but by no means least--I note that Art Rynearson, the Deputy \nLegislative Counsel of the Senate, has done his usual superb job of \nputting this conference report into proper legislative form. I say \nthank you to all.\n\n[[Page S9404]]\n\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con.

Under the order previously entered, there are \n15 minutes equally divided between the two managers of the bill.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  One of my favorite expressions is: Only in America, this great \ncountry of ours. I was thinking, as we approach this debate on the \nmotion to invoke cloture, that only in the Senate, the great \ndeliberative body we are, would we find Members about to do what I fear \nthey are going to do, which is to vote against a proposal that they \nthemselves have made because they want to vote on it without anyone \nelse having a right to amend it. That is where we are.\n  We have had a good debate. We have the Gramm-Miller substitute \namendment to the underlying Senate Governmental Affairs Committee \nproposal that created the Homeland Security Department. Senator Gramm \nand Senator Miller said their proposal and ours are 95 percent the \nsame. We have a disagreement about how to protect homeland security \nworkers in the new Department and still retain the authority of the \nPresident over national security.\n  Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Senator John Breaux of Louisiana, \nworking together with Senator Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, have \nfound common ground. They presented and crafted an amendment that gives \na little bit of reassurance against arbitrary action to the Federal \nworkers before they have their union rights, collective bargaining \nrights, taken away because the President determines those rights are in \nconflict with national security. It gives the President some new \nauthority to reform the civil service system but encourages him to try \nto negotiate those changes with the unions. If that does not work out, \nthen it is decided by a board, where the President appoints all the \nmembers. This achieves some due process and fairness for homeland \nsecurity workers but does not diminish the final word of the President \nof the United States at all.\n  In short, with all respect, I say to my colleagues who support Gramm-\nMiller but who are going to oppose the end of a filibuster of Gramm-\nMiller, they do not know how to accept a yes to the question they have \nasked. The Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment says yes to the question they \nhave asked: How can we create a Department of Homeland Security, retain \nthe authority of the President, and still protect some fairness and due \nprocess for homeland security workers?\n  What they are asking for is an up-or-down vote on the Gramm-Miller \nproposal, the President's proposal, denying us, apparently--the \nmajority of us, now 51--the right to vote on an amendment which, \nincidentally, is pretty much the exact same amendment Congresswoman \nConnie Morella, a Republican of the House, was allowed by the \nRepublican leadership of the House to put on the President's proposal. \nWe can at least offer the same courtesy and rights to three bipartisan \nMembers of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nNebraska requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has up to 4 minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nConnecticut for this opportunity to speak on this amendment.\n  Quite frankly, I think my colleague from Connecticut is absolutely \nright, and I ask my friends on both sides to take yes for an answer \nbecause I truly think this amendment will be the kind of yes that has \nbeen sought in the past.\n  I am puzzled, as I think perhaps anybody watching and many of us here \ntoday are puzzled, by the characterization of this amendment as being \nin opposition to the President. Anytime you are trying to close the \ngap, anytime you are trying to bring about a resolution of compromise, \nit is hardly an exercise in opposition. I think, if anything, we should \nbe looked at as friends of the process in trying to bring this \ntogether.\n  To also suggest cloture would be inappropriate now is also very \nstartling because I always thought cloture was how we finally brought \nthe end of debate to get a vote for or against legislation to move it \nforward. Right now it seems the vote against cloture is to stall and \nhave more opportunity for debate.\n  So if people are a bit puzzled, I can only appreciate that fact \nbecause I am puzzled, too.\n  In this exercise, I have learned a lot about the spin as opposed to \nthe appropriate characterization of letters or of comments on the \nfloor. I thought we were giving Governor Ridge and Senator Gramm \nexactly what they were asking for because that is the way I read \nSenator Gramm's comments. I presided the day he was presenting them, \nand I thought I understood him. I am surprised to find out I did not \nunderstand what he was saying. I am surprised I cannot read a letter \nfrom Governor Ridge in which he says the same management authority that \nis now provided in the IRS model is what we are after. We provide that \nin this amendment. Now we find that is not the case, either.\n  This is a puzzling day for me. It is perhaps puzzling others who are \nwatching it, because when it appears yes cannot be taken for an answer, \nI do not know what kind of an answer will be appropriate. If there is \nother language, I have said I will take a look at it, but I do not \nthink the answer is no language. In fact, what we have is an \nopportunity to present something that ought to close the gap, fill in \nthe last 5 percent, so we have 100 percent legislation that does what \nthe President needs to be able to do and also protects national \nsecurity.\n  National security is lost in this debate over nits and little \ndifferences of opinion about this piece of the amendment or that piece \nof the amendment. We can close them, but we have to be able to be in a \nposition to know when they are closed and when enough will be enough.\n  Right now I would not know even how to begin to try to close this if \nit remains open, but it seems to me we can vote for cloture and then \nlet's have the opportunity to finish this bill, get an up-or-down vote, \nas has been requested, move on and make national security the important \npoint it is and have a Homeland Defense Department.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Burns is under the time controlled by \nSenator Thompson. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I congratulate my friends from Nebraska and Connecticut \nwho were just talking. It seems like yesterday we came to this body. \nYou didn't get my goat, either.\n  We have all been involved in conferences. Anytime we pass legislation \nin this body and then it is passed in the House, we go to conference. \nIn conference is where we settle our differences. It usually comes down \nto one or two items where there starts to be an impasse.\n  Basically, those one or two items were not dealt with in the \namendment of my friend from Nebraska. It is still there and even adds \nanother layer or hurdle for the President to jump in the management of \nthis Department before a final decision can be made on the movement of \nmoney or personnel and their responsibilities in this particular \nnational security Department.\n  We have not dealt with the two very important ones, and nobody puts \nit better than the ranking member of the committee of jurisdiction. So \nI caution Senators this is a bold attempt to find a compromise, but \neven though you pass their amendment, it does not deal with the heart \nof this debate.\n\n[[Page S9405]]\n\n  So whenever Senators start looking at this, they should look into it \ndeeply, and they will find a compromise was attempted, but it did not \nget us to where we should be if they think the President should have \nthe flexibility to manage money and personnel in this very important \nnew Department we are creating.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this \nbipartisan substitute, and I am here to urge its adoption as the most \neffective way to create a new Department of Homeland Security to \nprotect our Nation from the threat of terrorism.\n  I take this opportunity to highlight four important provisions of the \nbipartisan substitute that are significant improvements to the \ncommittee-endorsed legislation before the Senate.\n  These provisions address the use of appropriated funds, presidential \nreorganization authority, and the status of the Coast Guard within the \nDepartment.\n  Section 738 of the bipartisan substitute includes the appropriations-\nrelated language that the committee endorsed to maintain the \nappropriate checks and balances between the legislative and executive \nbranches with respect to the use of appropriated funds.\n  It improves on that language by authorizing an appropriation of $160 \nmillion, and general transfer authority of $140 million, to begin \noperating the new Department. Both amounts would be subject to \nreasonable Congressional oversight and decisions.\n  Section 739 requires the submission of a multi-year spending plan for \nthe Department so that Congress and the American people can fully \nunderstand, and support, the magnitude of funds needed to conduct an \neffective homeland defense.\n  Senator Collins and I authored the Coast Guard language in the \nbipartisan substitute--Section 761. This language preserves the non-\nhomeland security missions of the Coast Guard and its capabilities to \nperform those missions.\n  The language also ensures that the Coast Guard Commandant can report \ndirectly to the homeland security secretary without being required to \nreport through any other official of the Department.\n  I believe this language improves upon the Committee bill by removing \nthe Coast Guard from the Directorate of Border and Transportation \nProtection--the new directorate--and by making it a freestanding \norganization--still the Coast Guard--operating within the department \nand answering directly to the Secretary.\n  This action ensures that there is no ambiguity about the independent \nand distinct status of the Coast Guard within the Department, or about \nthe Commandant's direct reporting authority. He will report directly to \nthe Secretary.\n  Finally, Section 734 provides the President with the authority to \npropose further reorganization plans for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and to have those plans considered by the Congress under \nexpedited procedures.\n  This language guarantees that Congress will play a significant role \nin deciding any further reorganizations, and that these proposals will \nbe debated and acted upon without delay.\n  I would like to discuss the use of appropriated funds.\n  The improved appropriations related language and reorganization plan \nlanguage in the bipartisan substitute recognize that the need to \nestablish the new Department can be addressed while still preserving \nthe Constitution, especially with respect to maintaining Congress's \n``power of the purse.''\n  That ``power'' is the primary way Congress holds the executive branch \naccountable for the use of funds, and it ensures that Congress has a \ncentral role in determining how hard-earned tax dollars will be \nexpended.\n  Section 738 of the bipartisan substitute reinforces existing law on \nhow appropriated funds are used and how property is disposed of. It \nrequires congressional approval of any plans to modify or eliminate any \nof the organizations being transferred to the new Department.\n  Congress must approve, in advance, the reallocation of transferred \nfunds away from their originally intended purposes.\n  Accordingly, the proposed statutory language preserves the statutory \nand administrative requirements needed to ensure that any funds made \navailable to the new Department are used effectively and efficiently \nand according to the will of the people as reflected through their \nelected Senators and Representatives.\n  Our amendment demonstrates that the necessary funding mechanisms and \nflexibility already exist to enable the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity to perform its mission.\n  These procedures are embodied in the appropriations process, which \ncan provide the funds needed for the Department without delay through a \ncombination of new appropriations, supplementals, or reprogramming \nactions.\n  We already have the opportunity to consider new appropriations to \ncreate the Department in several of the funding bills working their way \nthrough the congressional process at this very moment. These bills will \nbe considered in some format before September 30 or at least before we \nrecess for the election period.\n  Funds to continue the operations of the organizations transferring to \nthe Department also will be provided in these appropriations measures.\n  The bipartisan substitute underscores the importance of providing in \nthe appropriations process the $160 million in new appropriations and \nthe $140 million in general transfer authority.\n  These allocations total $300 million, which is a very large sum of \nmoney. This amount should be more than enough to create the new \nDepartment and to provide for any initial staffing, equipment, and \nother expenses.\n  I pledge to do my very best to provide these amounts in the \nappropriations process as needed.\n  The bipartisan substitute reaffirms the regular appropriations \nprocess and that it will work to allocate the needed start-up funding \nand to prevent disrupting the ongoing operations of the transferred \norganizations.\n  With regard to reorganization authority the originally proposed \nlegislation for the Department of Homeland Security would have granted \nthe new Secretary almost unlimited authority to establish, consolidate, \nalter, or discontinue any organizational units within the Department \nafter giving Congress 90 days notice.\n  Under the Constitution, Congress has the responsibility to \nappropriate funds by law for the executive branch departments, \nagencies, and other organizations that have constitutional \nresponsibilities to execute our laws.\n  Congress should not allow the many agencies transferring to the \nDepartment to be altered, merged, disbanded, or replaced solely and \nunilaterally by executive branch fiat.\n  We have the responsibility to ensure that the people's elected \nSenators and Representatives are part of the process of creating, \nmodifying, or disbanding the organizations that spend the people's \nhard-earned tax dollars.\n  Congress's constitutional role in our system of Government is to set \npriorities for the use of appropriated funds and to oversee their use \nto ensure that these funds are expended effectively and efficiently.\n  The creation of a new and effective Department of Homeland Security \nis a shared responsibility between the executive and legislative \nbranches. For the Department to be successful, both branches of \nGovernment--really each branch of Government--must cooperate with each \nother.\n  Congress and the executive branch should forge a relationship that is \nbased on the mutual trust and shared compromise that the Framers of the \nConstitution envisioned in creating a system of checks and balances. \nSuch a relationship is necessary for the effective functioning of the \nFederal Government.\n  In section 734, the bipartisan substitute preserves Congress's \nrightful role in this process by requiring that both the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives approve any proposed reorganization plans \nunder expedited procedures.\n  With regard to submission of a multi-year homeland security budget \nplan, section 739 of the bipartisan substitute requires the submission \nof a multiyear, homeland security spending plan with each budget \nrequest for the new Department, beginning with the fiscal year 2005 \nrequest.\n  This section will enable the Congress and the executive branch to \nfully understand the annual and multi-year\n\n[[Page S9406]]\n\nfunding requirements to make our homeland secure.\n  It will assist us in determining the most appropriate funding levels \nto protect the American people from terrorist threats.\n  The recommended statutory language requires that the Future Years \nHomeland Security Program be structured as, and include the same type \nof information and level of detail as, the Future Years Defense Program \nrequired by law to be submitted to Congress by the Department of \nDefense.\n  We have a section preserving the Coast Guard's mission performance. \nFinally, section 761 of the bipartisan substitute is highly important \nlanguage Senator Collins and I authored to maintain the structural and \noperational integrity of the Coast Guard, the authority of the \nCommandant, the nonhomeland security missions of the Coast Guard, and \nthe service's capabilities to carry out these missions even as it is \ntransferred to the new Department.\n  In addition to transferring the Coast Guard as an independent, \ndistinct entity reporting directly to the Secretary, the language \nstates that the Secretary may not make any substantial or significant \nchange to any of the non-homeland security missions and capabilities of \nthe Coast Guard without the prior approval by Congress in a subsequent \nstatute.\n  The President may waive this restriction for no more than 90 days \nupon his declaration and certification to the Congress that a clear, \ncompelling, and immediate state of national emergency exists that \njustifies such a waiver.\n  The language further directs that the Coast Guard's authorities, \nfunctions, assets, organizational structure, units, personnel, and \nnonhomeland security missions shall be maintained intact and without \nreduction after the transfer unless the Congress specifies otherwise in \nsubsequent acts. This language does permit the Coast Guard to replace \nor upgrade any asset with an asset of equivalent or greater \ncapabilities.\n  It also states that Coast Guard missions, functions, personnel, and \nassets--including ships, aircraft, helicopters, and vehicles--may not \nbe transferred to the operational control of, or be diverted to the \nprincipal and continuing use of, any other organization, unit, or \nentity of the Department except under limited conditions.\n  Upon the transfer of the Coast Guard to the Department, the \nCommandant shall report directly to the Secretary and not through any \nother official of the Department.\n  The inspector general of the Department shall annually assess the \nCoast Guard's performance of all its missions with a particular \nemphasis on examining the nonhomeland security missions. The detailed \nresults of this assessment shall be provided to Congress annually.\n  None of the conditions in the recommended language shall apply when \nthe Coast Guard operates as a service in the Navy under section 3 of \ntitle 14, United States Code.\n  The Coast Guard's nonhomeland security missions--and the service's \ncapabilities to accomplish them--are as vital to the 30 coastal and \nGreat Lakes States as are its homeland security missions and \ncapabilities.\n  No state is better than Alaska for demonstrating the importance of \nthe Coast Guard's nonhomeland security missions.\n  The United States has a coastline of 96,000 miles. Alaska has a \ncoastline of 47,300 miles, or almost 50 percent, of our Nation's total.\n  Alaska's fisheries are a billion dollar industry that delivers food \nto tables all across America and around the world. We harvested 5 \nbillion pounds of seafood last year.\n  The Coast Guard plays an indispensable role in protecting and \nsupporting this industry, and in promoting the safety of its \nparticipants. Just this summer, the Coast Guard dispatched additional \nassets to the maritime boundary line in the Bering Sea to guard against \nintrusions by Russian trawlers.\n  The Coast Guard's nonhomeland security missions are marine safety, \nsearch and rescue, aids to navigation, living marine resources--\nincluding fisheries law enforcement, marine environmental protection, \nand ice operations. They all are critical to the well-being of \nAlaskans, and we rely on the Coast Guard virtually every day for \nprotection and assistance in these mission areas.\n  The service's homeland security missions are ports, waterways and \ncoastal security, drug interdiction, migrant interdiction, defense \nreadiness, and other law enforcement.\n  The language in the bipartisan substitute is intended to assure that \nthe important homeland security priorities of the new Department will \nnot eclipse the Coast Guard's crucial nonhomeland security missions and \ncapabilities.\n  This language modifies the committee provisions to reflect \nsuggestions made by the Commandant and his senior staff after they \nanalyzed the original language at my request.\n  Our additional language allows the Coast Guard to conduct joint \noperations more effectively with other entities in the Department, to \nassign a limited number of Coast Guard military members or civilian \nemployees to these entities for liaison, coordination, and operational \npurposes, and to replace or upgrade assets or change non-homeland \nsecurity capabilities with equivalent or greater assets or \ncapabilities.\n  With the Bipartisan Substitute, I believe the Coast Guard will be in \nan even stronger position to carry out both its vital non-homeland \nsecurity missions and its important homeland security responsibilities.\n  Finally, there have been claims that the improved statutory language \nI have highlighted today still may restrict the President's flexibility \nto establish and operate the new Department.\n  It is my understanding that the White House was a key participant in \nthe crafting of the Bipartisan Substitute, and that any significant \nlanguage was reviewed for acceptability by the President's advisors.\n  The President has stated repeatedly that he supports the language in \nthe Bipartisan Substitute.\n  In his Radio Address to the Nation last Saturday, September 21, the \nPresident specifically stated that the Bipartisan Substitute would, and \nI quote, ``provide the new Secretary of Homeland Security much of the \nflexibility he needs to move people and resources to meet new \nthreats.''\n  I ask unanimous request to insert into the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks the recent statements by the President and his spokesman \nthat strongly endorse the bipartisan substitute.\n  I also ask unanimous request that an explanation of the start-up \nfunding authorized in the bipartisan substitute be inserted in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1).\n  Mr. President, the bipartisan substitute underscores Congress's \nlegitimate role in the ongoing process to meet our Nation's homeland \nsecurity requirements responsibly and effectively. It is a significant \nimprovement over the committee legislation which I did vote for.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt it without delay.\n  I thank my friend from Texas, Senator Gramm, for working with us so \nclosely in adopting the portions of the bill from the substitute I just \ndescribed. I thank the leadership for their cooperation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         President Endorses Gramm-Miller Bipartisan Substitute\n\n       President urges Congress to pass Iraq resolution promptly, \n     September 24, 2002, White House:\n       It's time to get a homeland security bill done, one which \n     will allow this President and this administration, and future \n     Presidents--give us the tools necessary to protect the \n     homeland. And we're working as hard as we can with Phil Gramm \n     and Zell Miller to get this bill moving. It's a good bill. \n     It's a bill that both Republicans and Democrats can and \n     should support.\n       President Bush calls on Congress to act on Nation's \n     priorities, September 23, 2002, Army National Guard Aviation \n     Support Facility, Trenton, New Jersey, September 23, 2002:\n       Senator Gramm, a Republican, Senator Miller, a Democrat, \n     are working hard to bring people together. And the Senate \n     must listen to them. It's a good bill. It's a bill I can \n     accept. It's a bill that will make America more secure. And \n     anything less than that is a bill which I will not accept, \n     it's a bill which I will not saddle this administration and \n     future administrations with allowing the United States Senate \n     to micro-manage the process. The enemy is too quick for that. \n     We\n\n[[Page S9407]]\n\n     must be flexible, we must be strong, we must be ready to take \n     the enemy on anywhere he decides to hit us, whether it's \n     America or anywhere else in the globe.\n       Radio address by the President to the Nation, September 21, \n     2002:\n       In an effort to break the logjam in the Senate, Senator \n     Miller and Republican Senator Phil Gramm have taken the lead \n     in crafting a bipartisan alternative to the current flawed \n     Senate bill. I commend them, and support their approach. \n     Their proposal would provide the new secretary of homeland \n     security much of the flexibility he needs to move people and \n     resources to meet new threats. It will protect every employee \n     of the new department against illegal discrimination, and \n     build a culture in which federal employees know they are \n     keeping their fellow citizens safe through their service to \n     America.\n       I ask you to call your senators and to urge them to vote \n     for this bipartisan alternative. Senators Miller and Gramm, \n     along with Senator Fred Thompson, have made great progress in \n     putting the national interest ahead of partisan interest.\n       Press briefing by Ari Fleischer, September 19, 2002:\n       Mr. Fleischer. The President today is going to announce his \n     support for a bipartisan compromise, the Miller-Gramm \n     compromise.\n\n\n        basis of cost estimate included in bipartisan substitute\n\n       The authorization of $160 million to begin departmental \n     operations is based primarily on a CBO cost estimate. That \n     estimate is the best estimate we have.\n       OMB's position is that no new funds are needed because \n     start-up costs will be paid with funds diverted from agencies \n     transferred to the Department.\n       However, the transferred agencies will need these funds to \n     accomplish their missions.\n       Also, Congress should not relinquish its authority and \n     oversight over funding reallocations in the Executive Branch.\n       Most of the CBO's estimate for FY03 would be spent on one-\n     time costs to hire, house, and equip key personnel to manage \n     the new Department.\n       There are four major cost categories:\n       $50 million for salaries and other personnel expenses;\n       $50 million to rent new space or renovate existing space \n     for about 500 personnel;\n       $50 million for a basic computer network and \n     telecommunications system; and\n       $10 million to plan for a more sophisticated computer/\n     communications system to operationally integrate major \n     agencies in the Department.\n       The 140 million estimate for general transfer authority was \n     created by Committee staff to give the Department a $300 \n     million total for first year operations.\n       The personnel costs assume that the new management team and \n     its support structure will be phased in over the next two \n     years.\n       These include the Secretary, his Deputy, the Under and \n     Assistant Secretaries, and key managers such as the General \n     Counsel and Inspector General.\n       It also includes ``corporate'' personnel, such as those \n     needed for policy development, legislative affairs, and \n     budget and finance activities.\n       The office space estimate is based on GSA experience in \n     housing new agencies.\n       The basic computer, date processing, and telecommunications \n     systems will perform the Department's administrative \n     functions--budgeting, accounting, personnel records, etc.\n       A more sophisticated and interoperatble computer and \n     communications network to integrate the major operational \n     entities, such as the Coast Guard, INS, Customs, Secret \n     Service, and the Border Patrol, may cost more than $1 billion \n     in later years.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \nlabor provisions in the Gramm-Miller substitute amendment. This \napproach to homeland security undermines longstanding labor protections \nand a national commitment to the right to organize.\n  This amendment seems to rely on the unsupported premise that workers \nrights are somehow incongruous with national security. There is no \nobjective basis for that view. In fact, I would argue labor protections \nare directly in our national interest.\n  The people of the United States trust federal employees to stand at \nthe frontlines in the war on terrorism and protect our nation against \nthe myriad vulnerabilities that we may confront in the years to come. \nBorder guards, INS workers, and customs agents are people who have the \npatriotic interest of our nation at heart. They guard our waterways and \nnow protect our airports. Just as we are emphasizing the United States' \nincreasing reliance on these workers, it would demonstrate tremendous \nchutzpah for the United States to remove essential labor protections \nand question the commitment and responsiveness of these workers to our \nnational challenges. Working Americans have often sacrificed much to \nsave our nation and to subject them to political and unchecked \nmanagerial discretion is an abdication of America's long held belief in \nthe political independence of our government operations.\n  But that is precisely what this amendment would do: eliminate hard \nfought labor protections as America calls on its employees to take on \neven greater responsibilities in the War on Terrorism.\n  For instance, in the name of management flexibility, the substitute \namendment being considered here would eviscerate the civil service \nsystem, and I fear put all Americans at risk.\n  The new Department we are discussing today should not be a Republican \nDepartment or a Democratic Department but an American Department from \nstart to finish. There is no room for partisan politics when it comes \nto defending the American people. This cabinet department is being \ncreated for security, a truly nonpartisan objective and its operation \nafter its creation should stay that way.\n  In the event that this substitute amendment is accepted by the \nSenate, employees of the Department of Homeland Security whose views \nare out of sync with the official line could be dismissed or \ntransferred with little of no justification. This would have a chilling \neffect on the ability of employees in this critically important \ndepartment to perform their jobs with the competence and creativity \nthat everyone would expect.\n  Furthermore, this amendment could undermine vital whistleblower \nprotections designed to ensure that the Congress and the American \npublic are kept aware of severe problems that might develop in the new \nDepartment. The so-called ``management flexibility'' provisions would \nhave the effect of silencing criticism in official forms, criticism \nthat is desperately needed to improve America's ability to defend its \nborders and protect its people. In fact, incentives to leak critical \nviews would be drastically increased as official forms would no longer \nbe easily available.\n  Let us be clear: the primary supporters of this amendment have never \nbeen supportive of the various labor protections provided to government \nemployees. They never liked the civil service system, despite the fact \nthat it prevents bureaucratic decisions from getting mired in politics. \nThey oppose the application of Davis-Bacon laws to the new Department, \ndespite the fact that requiring federal government contractors to pay \nthe prevailing wage encourages higher quality work. And they oppose \ncollective bargaining agreements, despite the fact that the underlying \nlegislation allows broad authority for the president to waive \ncollective bargaining rights for job activities directly related to \nnational security. The driver behind this amendment appears to be a \npolitical and philosophical view opposing the concepts embedded in the \nright to organize, not in protecting national security.\n  The fact is, that this Governmental reorganization provided opponents \nof labor rights with a golden opportunity to undermine the very \nprotection that they have long opposed. This is not a new approach to a \nnew situation, but an old familiar refrain from opponents of labor \npolicies that empower our federal employees. Supporters of this \namendment claim the whole purpose of the change is to increase \nmanagement flexibility in the interests of national security, but make \nno mistake: this debate is about an ideological opposition to \nfundamental components of American labor law.\n  With all the waiver authority provided the President in Senator \nLieberman's bill, it is difficult to see just how this legislation \nwould tie the hands of the President. Few reasonable analyses believe \nit will.\n  When tragedy struck on September 11, thousands of firefighters and \npolice officers rushed to the world trade center. They risked life and \nlimb to save their fellow Americans. Their union membership did not \nmake them any less patriotic. Union membership of law enforcement and \nfirefighters across the nation is unquestioned and standard procedure. \nTheir collective bargaining rights did not undermine national security. \nAnd their work rules did not stop them from demonstrating a high level \nof professionalism on that horrific day or any other day.\n  Mr. President, I for one, do not believe we should allow American \nworkers to lose hard-fought labor protections while we are asking them \nto take\n\n[[Page S9408]]\n\non even greater responsibilities and to assimilate into a new \ndepartment. Clearly the authors of the Gramm-Miller amendment disagree.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Gramm-Miller amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I will be brief. By using cloture, this is \nan effort to put us into a straitjacket that will guarantee the \nPresident will not get an up-or-down vote on his program.\n  Now one may be against the President; they may believe there are some \npriorities higher than the life and safety of our citizens. I do not. \nBut whether one agrees with the President or not, when thousands of our \ncitizens have been killed, when we are at war with terrorism, the \nPresident of the United States has the right to have an up-or-down vote \non his program. That is what we insist on. We will not get that if \ncloture is voted for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Could I inquire as to how much time we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three and a half minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, before we vote, it is important we \nunderstand the parameters of the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment. Two \npoints: One has to do with the President's national security authority, \nand the other has to do with flexibility. This amendment is purported \nto be a compromise. Senator Gramm has worked diligently, and he and \nSenator Miller have made about 25 changes. They have a compromise that \nis a good one and one the President supports. The compromise \nrepresented by the Nelson-Chafee-Breaux amendment is not really a good \ncompromise, with all due respect to those who have made this effort, \nbecause of those two areas I mentioned. With regard to the President's \nnational security authority, it changes the current law which says if \nthe President makes a determination the primary function of an agency \nhas to do with national security, he can act under that law to protect \nthe national security.\n  The changes in the Nelson amendment would make it so the President \nwould have to make a determination the activity involved would have to \nbe related to terrorist activities, and then this additional \nrequirement that the new position to which the people in the agency \nhave been transferred, the majority of those people have essentially \nhad a change in the function of their job and those things are \nreviewable by courts.\n  I understood my friend from Louisiana to say and debate awhile ago \nthis court case we were all talking about basically did not give any \njudicial review. Maybe I misunderstood him because when I look at the \ncase, it is quite clear there is judicial review under current law and \nunder the Nelson amendment. However, under current law, the President \nonly has one hurdle. He has to make a determination with regard to \nnational security.\n\n  Under the Nelson amendment, he has to make a determination with \nregard to terrorism, but he also has to make a determination with \nregard to the nature of the actual work being carried out by the \nvarious employees--the President of the United States. Two challenges \nnow can be made to the President's activity. Now when you go to court, \nthe President has a rebuttable presumption of regulator. There is still \njurisdiction there, there is still an additional hurdle. Why in the \nworld do we want to impose an additional hurdle for this President that \nwe have not imposed on prior Presidents? That is No. 1.\n  Second, with regard to flexibility, the House sent over six areas of \nflexibility. The Nelson amendment takes two of those areas off the \ntable altogether. The Nelson amendment says the new Secretary cannot \ntouch the labor-management chapter. It says the new Secretary cannot \ntouch the appeals chapter. Both are areas we know need changing. Both \nare areas we know need improvement. We cannot even negotiate with \nregard to those areas. They are totally off the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I appreciate the attentiveness of the Chair. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas has asked us to \nconsider what is best for the security of the American people. What is \nbest for the security of the American people is to quickly adopt \nlegislation that creates a Department of Homeland Security to protect \nthem, and not to maintain a stubborn insistence that before you are \nwilling to do that, the President must have an up-or-down vote on his \nproposal. That is something on which the Republican House did not \ninsist. They gave Members the opportunity to introduce amendments, \nincluding one just like this.\n  I urge my colleagues, vote for cloture. Let's adopt this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The majority leader asked me to announce this is the last \nvote today. The next vote will occur at approximately 5 or 5:30 on \nMonday afternoon.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The cloture motion having been presented\n\n[[Page S9409]]\n\nunder rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Gramm-\n     Miller amendment No. 4738:\n         Joseph Lieberman, Max Baucus, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, \n           Dianne Feinstein, Tim Johnson, Patrick Leahy, Jeff \n           Bingaman, Jack Reed, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jim \n           Jeffords, Debbie Stabenow, Daniel K. Akaka, Harry Reid, \n           Maria Cantwell, Byron L. Dorgan, Herb Kohl.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the \nFreedom of Information Act compromise that Senators Bennett and Leahy \nand I were able to achieve and which is included in both the Lieberman \nand Gramm-Miller amendments.\n  One of the primary functions of the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity, DHS, will be to safeguard the nation's infrastructure, much \nof which is run by private companies. The DHS will need to work in \npartnership with private companies to ensure that our critical \ninfrastructure is secure. To do so, the homeland security legislation \nasks companies to voluntarily provide the DHS with information about \ntheir own vulnerabilities; the hope being that one company's problems \nor solutions to its problems will help other companies with problems \nthey may be having with their own critical infrastructure.\n  Some companies expressed concern that current law did not adequately \nprotect their confidential business information that they are being \nasked to provide to the new DHS from public disclosure under the \nFreedom of Information Act. They argued that without a specific \nstatutory exemption they would be less likely to voluntarily submit \ninformation to the DHS about critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. \nHowever, the Freedom of Information Act and the case law developed with \nrespect to it already provide the protections these companies seek.\n  The language of our amendment protects from public disclosure the \nrecords of concern to these companies while preserving the existing \nrights of public access under FOIA. The amendment would protect from \npublic disclosure any record furnished voluntarily and submitted to DHS \nthat: No. 1, pertains to the vulnerability of and threats to critical \ninfrastructure, such as attacks, response and recovery efforts; No. 2, \nthe provider would not customarily make available to the public; No. 3, \nare designated and certified by the provider as confidential and not \ncustomarily made available to the public.\n  The amendment makes clear that records that an agency obtains \nindependently of DHS are not subject to the protections I just \nenumerated. Thus, if the records currently are subject to disclosure by \nanother agency under FOIA, they will remain available under FOIA even \nif a private company submits the same information to DHS. The language \nalso allows the provider of voluntarily submitted information to change \na designation and certification and to make the record subject to \ndisclosure under FOIA. The language requires that DHS develop \nprocedures for the receipt, designation, marking, certification, care \nand storage of voluntarily provided information as well as the \nprotection and maintenance of the confidentiality of the voluntarily \nprovided records.\n  The amendment defines the terms ``critical infrastructure'' and \n``furnished voluntarily.'' ``Critical infrastructure'' is the same as \nthat found in the USA Patriot Act. The term ``furnished voluntarily'' \nexcludes records that DHS requires an entity to submit and that are \nused to satisfy a legal obligation or requirement or obtain a grant, \npermit, benefit, or other government approval. This means that records \nused to satisfy a legal obligation or requirement or to obtain a grant, \npermit, benefit or other government approval are ineligible for \nprotection under this amendment. In addition, this language does not \npreempt state or local openness laws. Finally, the language requires \nthe General Accounting Office to prepare a report tracking the \nvoluntarily submitted information to DHS, the number of FOIA requests \nfor voluntarily submitted information and whether those requests were \ngranted or denied, and recommendations for improving the collection and \nanalysis of information held by the private sector.\n  It is important to protect the public's right to access information \nas the White House's recent national strategy for homeland security \npoints out. The White House report also notes that any limitation on \npublic disclosure must be done ``without compromising the principles of \nopenness that ensure government accountability.'' I agree. We must move \ncautiously when enacting any legislation to withhold information that \nis not already exempt from disclosure under FOIA and national security \nclassifications.\n  The principles of open government and the right-to-know of the people \nare cornerstones upon which our country was built. We cannot and will \nnot hastily and foolishly sacrifice them in the name of protecting \nthem. This compromise achieves the balancing that is needed between \nopenness and security. I thank Senators Bennett and Leahy for their \nwork on developing this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in the wake of the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, bipartisan support in the Senate grew for the concept of \na Cabinet-level officer with a new department to coordinate homeland \nsecurity. In fact, Chairman Lieberman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and Senator Specter must be commended for their hard work and \nprescience in introducing legislation within weeks of the attacks to \ncreate a new Department of Homeland Security.\n  The administration initially differed with this approach. Instead, \nthe President invited Governor Ridge to serve as the Director of a new \nOffice of Homeland Security. I invited Governor Ridge in October, 2001, \nto testify before the Judiciary Committee about how he would improve \nthe coordination of law enforcement and intelligence efforts, and his \nviews on the role of the National Guard in carrying out the homeland \nsecurity mission, but he declined.\n  Without Governor Ridge's input, the Judiciary Committee continued \noversight work that had begun in the summer of 2001, before the \nterrorist attacks, on improving the effectiveness of the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, the lead Federal agency with responsibility for \ndomestic security. This task has involved oversight hearings with the \nAttorney General and with officials of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. In the \nweeks immediately after the attacks, the Committee turned its attention \nto hearings on legislative proposals to enhance the legal tools \navailable to detect, investigate and prosecute those who threaten \nAmericans both here and abroad. Committee members worked in partnership \nwith the White House and the House to craft the new antiterrorism law, \nthe USA PATRIOT Act, which was enacted on October 26, 2001.\n  We were prepared to include in the new anti-terrorism law provisions \ncreating a new cabinet-level officer heading a new Department of \nHomeland Security but did not, at the request of the White House. \nIndeed, from September, 2001 until June, 2002, the Administration was \nsteadfastly opposed to the creation of a Cabinet-level Department to \nprotect homeland security. Governor Ridge stated in an interview with \nNational Journal reporters on May 30 that if Congress put a bill on the \nPresident's desk to make his position statutory, he would ``probably \nrecommend that he veto it.'' That same month, the White House spokesman \nalso objected to a new Department and told reporters, ``You still will \nhave agencies within the federal government that have to be \ncoordinated. So the answer is: Creating a Cabinet post doesn't solve \nanything.''\n  In one respect, the White House was correct: Simply moving agencies \naround among Departments does not address the problems inside agencies \nsuch as the FBI or the INS--problems like outdated computers; hostility \nto employees who report problems; lapses in intelligence sharing; lack \nof translation and analytical capabilities; along with what many have \ntermed, ``cultural problems.'' The Judiciary Committee and its \nsubcommittees have been focusing on identifying those problems and \nfinding constructive solutions to fix them. To that end, the Committee \nunanimously reported the FBI Reform Act, S.1974, to improve the FBI, \nespecially at this time when the country needs the FBI to be as \neffective as it can be in the war against terrorism. Unfortunately, \nthat bill has\n\n[[Page S9410]]\n\nbeen stalled on the Senate floor by an anonymous Republican hold.\n  The White House made an abrupt about-face on June 6, 2002, on the \nissue of whether our national security could benefit from the creation \nof a new Department of Homeland Security. This was the same day that \nthe Judiciary Committee was continuing its oversight responsibility and \nwas scheduled to hear from FBI Director Robert Mueller and FBI Special \nAgent Coleen Rowley, who was highly critical of the manner in which FBI \nHeadquarters handled the investigation of Zacarias Moussaoui.\n  Thirty minutes before the nationally televised testimony from an FBI \nagent about intelligence failures before the September 11 terrorist \nattacks, word emerged from the White House that the President had \nchanged his position and announced that he supported the formation of a \nnew Homeland Security Department along the lines that Senator Lieberman \nand Senator Specter had suggested, though the draft of the President's \nproposal was not yet completed. Indeed, press reports that day indicate \nthat ``Administration officials said the White House hoped to use the \nreorganization to deflect attention from the public backbiting that \nbroke out among federal agencies as Congress began investigating \nintelligence failures surrounding the Sept. 11 attacks.'' Washington \nPost, June 6, 2002, at 12:52 PM.\n  Two weeks later, on June 18, 2002, Governor Ridge transmitted a \nspecific legislative proposal to create a new homeland security \ndepartment. It should be apparent to all of us that knitting together a \nnew agency will not by itself fix existing problems. In writing the \ncharter for this new department, we must be careful not to generate new \nmanagement problems and accountability issues. Yet the Administration's \nproposal would have exempted the new department from many legal \nrequirements that apply to other agencies. The Freedom of Information \nAct would not apply; the conflicts of interest and accountability rules \nfor agency advisors would not apply. The new Department head would have \nthe power to suspend the Whistleblower Protection Act, the normal \nprocurement rules, and to intervene in Inspector General \ninvestigations. In these respects, the Administration asked us to put \nthis new Department above the law and outside the checks and balances \nthese laws are put there to ensure.\n  Exempting the new Department from laws that ensure accountability to \nthe Congress and to the American people makes for soggy ground and a \ntenuous start--not the sure footing we all want for the success and \nendurance of this endeavor.\n  Specifically, the administration's June proposal contained, in \nsection 204, a new exemption requiring nondisclosure under the Freedom \nof Information Act, FOIA, of any ``information'' ``voluntarily'' \nprovided to the new Department of Homeland Security by ``non-Federal \nentities or individuals'' pertaining to ``infrastructure \nvulnerabilities or other vulnerabilities to terrorism'' in the \npossession of, or that passed through, the new department. Critical \nterms, such as ``voluntarily provided,'' were undefined.\n  The Judiciary Committee had an opportunity to query Governor Ridge \nabout the Administration's proposal on June 26, 2002, when he testified \nin his capacity as the Director of the Transition Planning Office for \nthe proposed Department of Homeland Security. At that hearing, a number \nof Senators made clear that the President should not play politics with \nthe proposal to create a new Department. One senior Republican member \nof the Judiciary Committee put it bluntly that action on the new \nDepartment should take place ``without political gamesmanship,'' I \nshare that view.\n  We all wanted to work with the President to meet his ambitious \ntimetable for setting up the new department. We all know that one sure \nway to slow up the legislation would be to use the new department as \nthe excuse for the Administration to undermine or repeal laws it did \nnot like or to stick unrelated political items in the bill under the \nheading of ``management flexibility.'' We all want the same end goal of \nan efficiently operating Homeland Security Department, but as the same \nsenior Republican member of the Judiciary Committee advised at the June \n26 hearing, for the sake of getting the new department underway, \n``[t]here may well be areas of debate or issues that we in Congress \nneed to save for another day.''\n  At that hearing, I cautioned the administration not to use the \nproposal for the new Department of Homeland Security to: No. 1, \nincrease secrecy in government by creating a huge new exemption to the \nFreedom of Information Act for private sector security problems; No. 2, \nweaken whistleblower protections for dedicated Government workers who \nhelp fight Government waste, fraud and abuse; or No. 3, cut wages and \njob security for hardworking Government employees.\n  Governor Ridge's testimony at that hearing is instructive. He \nappeared to appreciate the concerns expressed by Members about the \nPresident's June 18th proposal and to be willing to work with us in the \nlegislative process find common ground to get the legislation done. On \nthe FOIA, he described the Administration's goal to craft ``a limited \nstatutory exemption to the Freedom of Information Act'' to help ``the \nDepartment's most important missions [which] will be to protect our \nNation's critical infrastructure.'' Governor Ridge explained that to \naccomplish this, the Department must be able to ``collect information, \nidentifying key assets and components of that infrastructure, evaluate \nvulnerabilities, and match threat assessments against those \nvulnerabilities.''\n  The FOIA already exempts from disclosure matters that are classified; \ntrade secret and commercial and financial information, which is \nprivileged and confidential; various law enforcement records and \ninformation, including confidential source and informant information; \nand FBI records pertaining to foreign intelligence or \ncounterintelligence, or international terrorism. These already broad \nexemptions in the FOIA are designed to protect national security and \npublic safety.\n  Indeed, the head of National Infrastructure Protection Center, NIPC, \ntestified over 5 years ago, in September, 1998, that the private \nsector's FOIA excuse for failing to share information with the \nGovernment was, in essence, baseless. He explained the broad \napplication of FOIA exemptions to protect from disclosure information \nreceived in the context of a criminal investigation or a ``national \nsecurity intelligence'' investigation, including information submitted \nconfidentially or even anonymously. This is from the Senate Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information, \n``Hearing on Critical Infrastructure Protection: Toward a New Policy \nDirective,'' on March 17 and June 10, 1998. The FBI also used the \nconfidential business record exemption under (b)(4) ``to protect \nsensitive corporate information, and has, on specific occasions, \nentered into agreements indicating that it would do so prospectively \nwith reference to information yet to be received.'' NIPC was developing \npolicies ``to grant owners of information certain opportunities to \nassist in the protection of the information (e.g., by sanitizing the \ninformation themselves) and to be involved in decisions regarding \nfurther dissemination by the NIPC.'' In short, the former \nadministration witness stated:\n\n       Sharing between the private sector and the government \n     occasionally is hampered by a perception in the private \n     sector that the government cannot adequately protect private \n     sector information from disclosure under the Freedom of \n     Information Act (FOIA). The NIPC believes that this \n     perception is flawed in that both investigative and \n     infrastructure protection information submitted to NIPC are \n     protected from FOIA disclosure under current law.\n\n  Nevertheless, businesses have continued to seek a broad FOIA \nexemption. I expressed my concern that an overly-broad FOIA exemption \nwould encourage government complicity with private firms to keep secret \ninformation about critical infrastructure vulnerabilities, reduce the \nincentive to fix the problems and end up hurting rather than helping \nour national security. In the end, more secrecy may undermine rather \nthan foster security.\n  Governor Ridge seemed to appreciate these risks and said he was \n``anxious to work with the Chairman and other members of the committee \nto assure that the concerns that [I had] raised are properly \naddressed.'' He assured us that ``[t]his Administration is ready to\n\n[[Page S9411]]\n\nwork together with you in partnership to get the job done. This is our \npriority, and I believe it is yours as well.''\n  Almost before the ink was dry on the Administration's earlier \nproposal, on July 10, the Administration proposed to substitute a much \nbroader FOIA exemption that would (1) exempt from disclosure under the \nFOIA critical infrastructure information voluntarily submitted to the \nnew department that was designated as confidential by the submitter \nwithout the submitter's prior written consent, (2) provide limited \ncivil immunity for use of the information in civil actions against the \ncompany, with the likely result that regulatory actions would be \npreceded by litigation by companies that submitted designated \ninformation to the department over whether the regulatory action was \nprompted by a confidential disclosure, (3) preempt state sunshine laws \nif the designated information is shared with state or local government \nagencies, (4) impose criminal penalties of up to one year imprisonment \non government employees who disclosed the designated information, and \n(5) extend antitrust immunity to companies that joined together with \nagency components designated by the President to promote critical \ninfrastructure security.\n  Despite the Administration's promulgation of two separate proposals \nfor new FOIA exemption in as many weeks, in July, Governor Ridge's \nOffice of Homeland Security released The National Strategy for Homeland \nSecurity, which appeared to call for more study of the issue before \nlegislating. Specifically, this report called upon the Attorney General \nto ``convene a panel to propose any legal changes necessary to enable \nsharing of essential homeland security information between the \ngovernment and the private sector.''\n\n  The need for more study of the Administration's proposed new FOIA \nexemption was made amply clear by its possible adverse environmental, \npublic health and safety affect. Keeping secret problems in a variety \nof critical infrastructures would simply remove public pressure to fix \nthe problems. Moreover, several environmental groups pointed out that, \nunder the Administration's proposal, companies could avoid enforcement \naction by ``voluntarily'' providing information about environmental \nviolations to the EPA, which would then be unable to use the \ninformation to hold the company accountable and also would be required \nto keep the information confidential. It would bar the government from \ndisclosing information about spills or other violations without the \nwritten consent of the company that caused the pollution.\n  At the request of Chairman Lieberman for the Judiciary Committee's \nviews on the new department, I shared my concerns about the \nAdministration's proposed FOIA exemption and then worked with Members \nof the Governmental Affairs Committee--and in particular, with Senator \nLevin and Senator Bennett--to craft a more narrow and responsible \nexemption that accomplishes the Administration's goal of encouraging \nprivate companies to share records of critical infrastructure \nvulnerabilities with the new Department of Homeland Security, without \nproviding incentives to ``game'' the system of enforcement of \nenvironmental and other laws designed to protect the nation's public \nhealth and safety.\n  I commend Chairman Lieberman and Senators Levin and Bennett and their \nstaffs for diligently working with me to refine the FOIA exemption in a \nmanner that satisfies the Administration's stated goal, while limiting \nthe risks of abuse by private companies or government agencies.\n  Specifically, section 198 on ``Protection of Voluntarily Furnished \nConfidential Information'' of the Lieberman Amendment to H.R. 5005 \nreflects the compromise solution we reached with the Administration and \nother Members interested in this important issue. This section exempts \nfrom the FOIA certain records pertaining to critical infrastructure \nthreats and vulnerabilities that are furnished voluntarily to the new \nDepartment and designated by the provider as confidential and not \ncustomarily made available to the public. This provision improves on \nthe Administration's July 18 proposal in the following ways:\n  First, section 198 limits the FOIA exemption to ``records'' submitted \nby the private sector, not ``information'' from the private sector. \nTherefore, if companies provide information to the new Department that \nis documented in an agency-created record, that record will be subject \nto the FOIA and not exempt simply because private sector information is \nreferenced or contained in the record. Moreover, this section makes \nclear that portions of records that are not covered by the exemption \nshould be released pursuant to FOIA requests, unlike the Administration \nproposals which would have allowed the withholding of entire records if \nany part is exempt.\n  Second, section 198 limits the FOIA exemption to records pertaining \nto ``the vulnerability of and threats to critical infrastructure (such \nas attacks, response, and recovery efforts)'' not all ``critical \ninfrastructure information.''\n  Third, section 198 does not provide any civil liability or antitrust \nimmunity that could be used to immunize bad actors or frustrate \nregulatory enforcement action.\n  Fourth, section 198 limits the FOIA exemption to records submitted to \nthe new Department of Homeland Security, as in the administration's \ninitial June 18 proposal, since the stated goal of the exemption is to \nhelp that Department provide a centralized function of collection, \nreview and analysis of critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. Records \nsubmitted by private companies to other agencies are not covered by the \nnew exemption, even if the same document is also submitted to the new \nDepartment.\n  Fifth, section 198 does not preempt state or local sunshine laws.\n  Sixth, section 198 narrowly defines ``furnished voluntarily'' to \nensure that records submitted by companies to obtain grants, permits, \nlicenses or other government benefits are not exempt, but are still \nsubject to the FOIA process.\n  This section is a significant improvement over both versions of the \nAdministration's proposed new FOIA exemptions.\n  Unfortunately, other critical areas that were mentioned at the June \n26 hearing with Governor Ridge, on which he assured us he would work \nwith us to find common ground, remain stumbling blocks. The \nAdministration has threatened a veto over the issue of ``management \nflexibility.'' At the same time we are seeking to motivate the \ngovernment workers who will be moved to the new Department with an \nenhanced security mission, the Administration is insisting on \nprovisions that threaten the job security for these hardworking \ngovernment employees. The Administration should not use this transition \nas an excuse to cut the wages and current workplace security and rights \nof the brave employees who have been defending the nation. That is not \nthe way to encourage retention or recruitment of the vital human \nresources on which we will need to rely, and it is a sure way to \ndestroy the bipartisanship we need.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of an amendment \nthat I have offered to assist Federal employees who have been injured \non the job. My good colleagues, Senator Warner of Virginia and Senators \nClinton and Schumer of New York, join me in this important effort. This \nprovision was inspired by Mrs. Louise Kurtz, a Federal employee who was \nseverely injured in the September 11 attack on the Pentagon. She \nsuffered burns over 70 percent of her body, lost her fingers, yet \nfights daily in rehabilitation and hopes to return to work one day. \nCurrent law does not allow Mrs. Kurtz to contribute to her retirement \nprogram while she is recuperating and receiving Office of Worker's \nCompensation Programs disability payments. As a result, after returning \nto work she will find herself inadequately prepared and unable to \nafford to retire because of the lack of contributions during her \nrecuperation period.\n  As Mrs. Kurtz's situation reveals, Federal employees under the \nFederal Employees Retirement System who have sustained an on-the-job \ninjury and are receiving disability compensation from the Department of \nLabor's Office of Worker's Compensation Programs are unable to make \ncontributions or payments into Social Security or the Thrift Saving \nPlan. Therefore, the future retirement benefits from both sources are \nreduced.\n\n[[Page S9412]]\n\n  The provision I have offered corrects this shortfall in the Federal \nEmployees Retirement System, FERS. By increasing a Federal employee's \nFERS direct benefit by 1 percent for a period of extended convalescence \nresulting from a work related injury, the future reductions on Social \nSecurity and Thrift Savings Plan, TSP, benefits that result from the \ninability to make contributions during periods of disability are \noffset.\n  The retirement program for Federal Employees Retirement System \nemployees has three distinct parts: Social Security, Federal Employees \nRetirement System Defined Benefits, and Thrift Savings Plan. Social \nSecurity taxes and benefits are the same for all participants. The \nFederal Employees Retirement System Defined Benefit and the Thrift \nSavings Plan are similar to defined benefit and 401(k) plans in the \nprivate sector. Unlike the impact on Social Security and the Thrift \nSavings Plan, periods during which an individual is receiving Office of \nWorker's Compensation Programs disability payments have no impact when \ncalculating the length of service for determining the Federal Employees \nRetirement System Defined Benefit retirement payments. To explain how \nthe provision will work, I offer the following illustration.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the goal of the Federal Employees \nRetirement System is to provide retirement pay totaling about 56 \npercent of their ``high three'' annual salary. Under the old Civil \nService Retirement System, a direct benefit plan, two percent of a \nperson's salary was set aside to provide the retirement benefit of 56 \npercent employees did not pay into Social Security or a vested savings \nplan. Under Federal Employees Retirement System, one percent of a \nperson's salary is set aside to provide the Federal Employees \nRetirement System Direct Benefit retirement payment of 26 percent of \ntheir ``high three'' annual salary with Social Security and Thrift \nSavings Plan retirement pay contributing the remaining 30 percent for a \ntotal of 56 percent. But increasing the Federal Employees Retirement \nSystem Direct Benefit calculation by one percentage point for extended \nperiods of disability, one can adequately offset reduction in Social \nSecurity and Thrift Savings Plan payments resulting from the lack to \npayments into the systems during periods of disability caused by one \nthe job injuries.\n  Louise Kurtz has earned our appreciation for the role she and her \nhusband Michael have played in identifying this shortfall in Federal \nEmployees Retirement System and in persevering in getting legislation \nintroduced to address the problem. Indeed, Mrs. Kurtz continues to \nserve the American public even while recuperating from injuries \nsustained in the terrorist attack upon the Pentagon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Wisconsin and \nNevada.\n  I rise to offer a unanimous consent request for the Senate to \nconsider the partial-birth abortion bill that passed the House \nrecently. We have been working diligently for the past 18 months, since \nthe Supreme Court decision, to craft a partial-birth abortion bill that \nmeets the constitutionality muster of the Nebraska decision. We think \nwe have accomplished that, and I would argue that the House agrees with \nus.\n  The House recently passed this legislation 274 to 151. I understand \ntime is short, and we have held this bill at the desk. I am hopeful and \nhave been working to try to get a unanimous consent agreement that we \ncan bring up this legislation for debate and discussion. We are willing \nto do it on a very limited time agreement, limited amendments, or as \nmany amendments as the other side thinks is necessary.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. It is one the President \nsaid he would sign. It is one that received an overwhelming bipartisan \nvote in the House. I believe it will have a very strong bipartisan vote \nin the Senate.\n  While I understand this unanimous consent will be objected to this \nevening, I am hopeful we can continue to work together to try to bring \nup this very important piece of legislation that has been voted on here \nat least in the last three sessions of Congress with very strong \nmajorities. Unfortunately, it was vetoed by President Clinton. We now \nhave a President who will sign it. We have language that will meet \nconstitutional muster. We will continue to work and seek the unanimous \nconsent request to bring this up.\n  I now offer that request. I ask unanimous consent that at a time \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar \nNo. 521, H.R. 4965, a bill to prohibit the procedure commonly known as \npartial-birth abortion. I further ask unanimous consent that there be \none relevant amendment on each side, with 1 hour of debate equally \ndivided on each amendment, and that there be 2 hours for debate equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees; provided further \nthat following the use or yielding back of time, the bill be read the \nthird time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill, \nwith no further intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania is absolutely right. Time is so critical. Separate \nand apart from the time involving this matter, there are a number of \nSenators who have spoken to me personally about their objection to \nproceeding to this matter, if it came to the floor while I was here. \nSenator Feinstein was the last to have spoken to me in this regard.\n  I note an objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to comment on the \nadministration's ``discussion draft'' of a resolution authorizing the \nuse of force against Iraq.\n  This proposal is unacceptable. The administration has been talking \nabout war in Iraq for quite some time now. Surely they had the time to \ndraft a more careful, thoughtful proposal than the irresponsibly broad \nand sweeping language that they sent to Congress.\n  Apparently the administration put forward such broad language as a \nnegotiating tactic--asking for everything in the hopes of getting \nmerely a lot.\n  But we are not haggling over a used car. We are making decisions that \ncould send young Americans to war and decisions that could have far-\nreaching consequences for the global campaign against terrorism and for \nAmerica's role in the world in the twenty-first century.\n  To put forth such irresponsible language is to suggest that the \nPresident actually wants the authority to do anything he pleases in the \nMiddle East--and that suggestion is likely to raise tensions in an \nalready explosive region. To pepper the resolution with so many \ncompletely different justifications for taking action signals a lack of \nseriousness of purpose, and it obscures the nature of the mission on \nthe table. And then to insist on immediate action while remaining \nlargely incapable of pointing to any imminent threat and unwilling to \nflesh out the operation actually being proposed reveals a troubling \napproach to our national security.\n  The administration has a responsibility to define what the threat is. \nIs it a link between the Iraqi Government and al-Qaida, or is it Iraq's \npursuit of weapons of mass destruction?\n  So far I certainly would conclude that there is insufficient evidence \nto support the first charge about al-Qaida, but the administration \nkeeps using it whenever they feel like without information. Why? Are \nthey trying to gloss over the real possibility that this focus on Iraq, \nif not managed with diplomatic skill, will, indeed, do harm to the \nglobal campaign against terrorism?\n  The threat we know is real--Iraq's pursuit of weapons of mass \ndestruction or WMD--is unquestionably a very serious issue. What is the \nmission? Is the mission on the table disarmament or is it regime \nchange? Has anyone heard a credible plan for securing the weapons of \nmass destruction sites as part of a\n\n[[Page S9413]]\n\nmilitary operation in Iraq? Has anyone heard any credible plan for what \nsteps the United States intends to take to ensure that weapons of mass \ndestruction do not remain a problem in Iraq beyond the facile ``get rid \nof Saddam Hussein'' rallying cry?\n  Saddam Hussein is a vile man with a reckless and brutal history, and \nI have no problem agreeing that the United States should support regime \nchange. I agree with those who assert that Americans, Iraqis, and the \npeople of the Middle East would be much better off if he were no longer \nin power. But he is not the sole personification of a destabilizing WMD \nprogram. Once Hussein's control is absent, we have either a group of \nindependent, self-interested actors with access to WMD or an unknown \nquantity of a new regime. We may face a period of some chaos, wherein a \nviolent power struggle ensues as actors maneuver to succeed Saddam.\n  Has anyone heard the administration articulate its plan for the day \nafter? Is the administration talking about a long-term occupation? If \nwe act unilaterally, that could mean a vast number of Americans on the \nground in a region where, sadly, we are often regarded as an \nimperialistic enemy.\n  Given the disarray in Afghanistan and the less than concerted \nAmerican response to it, why should anyone believe that we will take \nIraq more seriously? Certainly, it is undesirable for the United States \nto do this alone, to occupy a Middle Eastern country, and make our \ntroops the target of anti-American sentiment.\n  Of course, Mr. President, I am sure you and I would agree, none of \nthese concerns is a rationale for inaction. Let me repeat that. None of \nthese concerns is a rationale for inaction. This is not about being a \nhawk or a dove. This is not about believing that Saddam Hussein is \nsomehow misunderstood. He is a monster. Iraq's weapons programs are \nreal, and only a fool would believe that the United States should \nsimply hope for the best and allow recent trends to continue.\n  Equally, Mr. President, only a person lacking in wisdom would send \nAmerican troops wading into this mire with a half-baked plan premised \non the notion that the Iraqis will welcome us with open arms; that \nsomehow the WMD threat will disappear with Saddam, and that U.S. \nmilitary action to overthrow the Government of Iraq will somehow bring \nthe winds of democratic change throughout the entire Middle Eastern \nregion.\n  We do not make decisions crucial to our national security on a leap \nof faith. Congress is the body constitutionally responsible for \nauthorizing the use of our military forces in such a matter. We cannot \nduck these tough issues by simply assuring our constituents that \nsomehow the administration will ``work it out.'' That is not good \nenough. We must not fail to demand a policy that makes sense.\n\n  Let me be clear about another important point: Maybe a policy that \nmakes sense involves the United Nations, but maybe it does not. It is \nless important whether our actions have a formal U.N. seal of approval. \nWhat is important is whether or not action has international support. \nMore important still is whether or not action will promote \ninternational hostility toward the United States.\n  In the context of this debate on Iraq, we are being asked to embrace \na sweeping new national doctrine. I am troubled by the administration's \nemphasis on preemption and by its suggestion that, in effect, \ndeterrence and containment are obsolete. What the administration is \ntalking about in Iraq really sounds much more like prevention, and I \nwonder if they are not using these terms, ``preemption'' and \n``prevention'' interchangeably. Preemption is knowing that an enemy \nplans an attack and not waiting to defend oneself.\n  Prevention is believing that another may possibly someday attack, or \nmay desire to attack, and justifying the immediate use of force on \nthose grounds. It is the difference between having information to \nsuggest that an attack is imminent and believing that a given \ngovernment is antagonistic toward the United States and continues to \nbuild up its military capacity.\n  It is the difference between having intelligence indicating that a \ncountry is in negotiations with an unquestionably hostile and violent \nenemy like al-Qaida to provide them with weapons of mass destruction \nand worrying, on the other hand, that someday that country might engage \nin such negotiations.\n  Of course, prevention does have an important role in our national \nsecurity planning. It certainly should. We should use a range of tools \nin a focused way to tackle prevention--diplomatic, sometimes \nmultilateral, economic. That is one of the core elements of any foreign \npolicy, and I stand ready to work with my President and my colleagues \nto bolster those preventive measures and to work on the long-term \naspects of prevention, including meaningful and sustained engagement in \nplaces that have been far too neglected.\n  Unilaterally using our military might to pursue a policy of \nprevention around the world is not likely to be seen as self-defense \nabroad, and I am not at all certain that casting ourselves in this role \nwill make the United States any safer. Would a world in which the most \npowerful countries use military force in this fashion be a safer world? \nWould it be the kind of world in which our national values could \nthrive? Would it be one in which terrorism would wither or would it be \none in which terrorist recruits will increase in number every day?\n  Announcing that we intend to play by our own rules, which look as if \nwe will make up as we go along, may not be conducive to building a \nstrong global coalition against terrorism, and it may not be conducive \nto combating the anti-American propaganda that passes for news in so \nmuch of the world.\n  Fundamentally, I think broadly applying this new doctrine is at odds \nwith our historical national character. We will defend ourselves \nfiercely if attacked, but we are not looking for a fight. To put it \nplainly: Our country historically has not sought to use force to make \nover the world as we see fit.\n  I am also concerned this approach may be seen as a green light for \nother countries to engage in their own preemptive or preventive \ncampaigns. Is the United States really eager to see a world in which \nsuch campaigns are launched in South Asia or by China or are we willing \nto say this strategy is suitable for us but dangerous in the hands of \nanybody else?\n  The United States does have to rethink our approach to security \nthreats in the wake of September 11, but it is highly questionable to \nsuggest that containment is dead, that deterrence is dead, particularly \nin cases in which the threat in question is associated with a state and \nnot nonstate actors, and it is highly questionable to embark on this \nsweeping strategy of preventive military operations.\n  So as we seek to debate Iraq and other issues critical to our \nnational security, I intend to ask questions, to demand answers, and to \nkeep our global campaign against terrorism at the very top of the \npriority list. This Senate is responsible to all of the citizens of the \nUnited States, to the core values of this country, and to future \ngenerations of Americans. We will not flinch from defending ourselves \nand protecting our national security, but we will not take action that \nsubordinates what this country stands for. It is a tall order, but I am \nconfident that America will rise to the occasion.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Strom Thurmond will go down in the history of our Nation \nas an extraordinary citizen and an extraordinary patriot.\n  Few people can match his record of achievements:\n\n       He was commissioned as an officer in the United States Army \n     Reserve nearly 80 years ago. In 1959, he retired as a major \n     general after serving 36 years in reserve and active duty.\n       On D-day, June 6, 1944, Lieutenant Colonel Thurmond boarded \n     an Army CG4A glider and flew behind enemy lines into \n     Normandy.\n       He served as Governor of South Carolina. Later, he was a \n     candidate for President of the United States, receiving the \n     third-largest independent electoral vote in U.S. History.\n       In 1954, he was elected to the U.S. Senate as a write-in \n     candidate. Today, he is the oldest and longest serving Member \n     of the Senate.\n\n  I have been privileged to know and work with Senator Thurmond for \nnearly 40 years. I wish to thank him for his wealth of wisdom. I will \nalways cherish his friendship.\n  But Senator Thurmond is not only my colleague and friend, he is also \nmy brother-in-arms. During World War II, anti-tank gunners from my \nregiment, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, assaulted southern France \nin 1944. Like Senator Thurmond, they went into battle aboard gliders \nwithout armor. Glider-borne assaults were extremely dangerous and \nrisky; some would even say they were suicidal missions. However, they \nwere a necessary component of the United States' invasion and \nliberation of Nazi-occupied France.\n  Senator Thurmond demonstrated rare courage, patriotism, and \nleadership as gliderman of the 82nd Airborne Division. Most glider \ndescents were ``controlled crashes,'' and that was the case when \nSenator Thurmond's glider landed in Normandy. Although he was injured, \nhe managed to safely lead his men to the 82nd Airborne Division \nheadquarters at daybreak. The 82nd went on to accomplish its difficult \nobjective of seizing and securing key positions in enemy territory.\n  I am pleased to report that Senator Thurmond's distinguished military \nservice will be honored with the naming of a new section of the \nAirborne and Special Operations Museum in Fayetteville, NC. The \nThurmond Wing will house an exhibit dedicated to the courageous combat \ngliderman of World War II.\n  As a Senator, Strom Thurmond has often taken positions that were not \nuniversally supported. Yet one could always be certain that his \ndecisions were honest. He is passionate in his beliefs, and his \ncommitment to serving his constituents has been exemplary. At the end \nof our service in the Congress, we, his fellow Senate Members, can only \nhope that we will be able to say we have served our people with the \ndiligence and devotion that Senator Thurmond has served his people. \nIndeed, Senator Thurmond can leave this Chamber and say, with \nconfidence and without hesitation, that he has faithfully served the \npeople of South Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/26/senate-section/article/S9414-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred April 20, \n2001 in Brighton, MI. Two white men assaulted a black state trooper who \nwas dancing with a white woman. The assailants, who did not believe \nthat the state trooper should be dancing with a white woman, attacked \nthe trooper and yelled racial slurs.

Mr. President, earlier this week the Violence Policy \nCenter, VPC, released a new study entitled ``The Drop in Federally \nLicensed Firearms Dealers in America.'' It found that the number of gun \ndealers holding Type 1 Federal Firearms Licenses, FFLs, a basic license \nto sell guns, dropped 74 percent from 245,628 in January 1994 to 63,881 \nin April 2002 or more than 181,000. The State of Michigan experienced \nthe third largest reduction in the U.S., a drop of 75 percent from \n12,076 dealers in 1994 to 3,016 in 2002.\n  According to the study, the decrease is the result of licensing and \nrenewal criteria contained in the Brady Law and 1994 Federal crime \nbill. These changes were designed to reduce the number of private, \nunlicenced gun dealers who operate out of their homes and garages. I \nvoted for the Brady Bill and Federal crime bill, and I am pleased that \nthey appear to be working the way Congress intended. The study also \nsuggests that enhanced enforcement and prosecution of gun laws at the \nfederal, state, and local level have had a significant impact.\n  The drop in gun dealers is an important step in the effort to reduce \nfirearms violence in the U.S. But despite this decline, private, \nunlicenced dealers are still supplying guns to gangs, drug dealers, and \nstreet criminals. In light of their findings, the Violence Policy \nCenter proposed several recommendations to keep guns out of the hands \nof criminals. One of the VPC recommendations is to close the loophole\n\n[[Page S9415]]\n\nwhich allows dealers to shift firearms from their business inventory to \ntheir personal collections and then sell those guns without performing \na background check. This proposal deserves serious consideration to \nevaluate whether it will help to keep guns out of the hands of \ncriminals and those prohibited under law from possessing a gun.\n  I urge my colleagues to support commonsense gun safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/26/senate-section/article/S9415-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DeWINE NEXT GENERATION LIGHTING INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the DeWine amendment \nto the Interior appropriations bill and am pleased to rise in support \nof it. The Next Generation Lighting Initiative is a research initiative \ndesigned to promote new, alternative, highly efficient technology for \nlighting to save energy and money, and reduce emissions. It would \nleapfrog over current technology. We use essentially the same light \nbulbs that Thomas Edison invented over 90 years ago. If successful, the \nNext Generation Lighting Initiative would make available new solid-\nstate lighting that would be ten times more efficient than today's \nincandescent light bulbs. The concept is similar to fuel cells that \nalso would leapfrog to a technology of the future and reduce our \ndependence on the traditional internal combustion engine.\n  I joined 22 other Senators in signing a letter to Appropriations \nChairman Byrd and Ranking Member Burns to support $30 million in \nincreased funding for this new lighting technology research initiative.\n  The current Interior appropriations bill provides $4 million for this \nInitiative. The amendment being offered today would increase this \nfunding to $10 million. While a sizable increase, this $10 million \nwould still be only 33 percent of what we had initially sought.\n  Specifically, the increased funding is needed to overcome pre-\ncompetitive research hurdles associated with white light illumination \nfrom solid-state devices. It is important to fund new, clean energy \ntechnologies to provide sustainable economic development for the \nfuture.\n  Lighting consumes about 20 percent of the energy generated in the \nUnited States. Over the next 20 years, this new next generation \nlighting technology could reduce global electricity usage for lighting \nby 50 percent and reduce total global electricity consumption by 10 \npercent.\n  Many groups and Members support increased funding for this important \ninitiative. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Ohio and New \nMexico for their work on this effort, and the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee for his assistance and for his good work on \nthis bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/26/senate-section/article/S9415-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN LAKE CHAMPLAIN BASIN PROGRAM ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to have joined with Senator \nJeffords, as well as Senators Leahy and Schumer, in introducing the \n``Daniel Patrick Moynihan Lake Champlain Basin Program Act of 2002.''\n  I thank Chairman Jeffords, with whom I have the honor and pleasure of \nserving on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, for \nintroducing this legislation and naming it in tribute to my \npredecessor, New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Senator Jeffords \nis a great Chairman, a great environmental leader, and a great \nsupporter of this natural and cultural resource that our states share--\nthe Lake Champlain Basin and the Champlain Valley. I am proud also to \nbe a sponsor of legislation authored by Senator Jeffords to establish \nthe Champlain Valley National Heritage Partnership.\n  The Lake Champlain Basin is a unique and beautiful region, bounded by \nthe Green Mountains of Vermont and the Adirondack Mountains of New \nYork. It is a place of majestic mountain peaks; deep, blue waters; and \nabundant cultural, historic, and natural resources. The Lake is the \nsixth largest natural freshwater lake in the United States, and home to \na many species of fish, birds and other wildlife.\n  We need to protect and enhance the environmental integrity and the \nsocial and economic benefits of the Lake Champlain basin. And that is \nprecisely what we aim to do through this legislation, which will \nauthorize $55 million over the nest 5 years for this purpose.\n  That this legislation and this program are being named after Senator \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan is a most fitting tribute. Senator Moynihan \nwas, and still is, a great advocate of Lake Champlain and the Champlain \nValley, whether supporting the rich heritage and history of the area, \nor protecting the environmental quality of the Lake and Basin.\n  Senator Moynihan appreciates that the environmental quality of the \nLake and basin are key to the vitality of the area as a whole, and \nworked tirelessly during his tenure to protect the health of the basin. \nNaming the Lake Champlain Basin Program Act and the program itself \nafter Senator Moynihan is a fitting tribute to his efforts to ensure \nthat this natural treasure will survive for generations to come.\n  As we all remember, it was in 1990 that Senator Moynihan joined with \nSenator Jeffords, as I am joining with him today, in sponsoring the \ninvaluable Lake Champlain Special Designation Act. The act outlined an \nunprecedented collaboration among broad interest groups to protect the \nenvironmentally sensitive Lake Champlain basin, as well as spark \nrecreational activity and economic revitalization in the basin area. \nUnder the act, the Lake Champlain Management Conference was created and \ncharged with developing a comprehensive plan for pollution prevention \nand water quality restoration.\n  The legislation that we are introducing builds upon the Lake \nChamplain Special Designation Act of 1990, in which Senator Moynihan \nplayed a key role during the 101st Congress. It also builds upon the \nplan that came out of that 1990 legislation, entitled ``Opportunities \nfor Action.'' The plan was approved by the Lake Champlain Steering \nCommittee earlier this year and is the guiding document for this new \nlegislation, which will provide new and important resources for \ncountries in Vermont and for Clinton, Essex, Franklin, Hamilton, Warren \nand Washingotn counties in New York State.\n  This is important environmental legislation, but it is also important \neconomic development legislation for key areas of upstate New York. \nTherefore, I am proud to sponsor this legislation with Chairman \nJeffords, and to name this legislation after my illustrious and \nesteemed predecessor, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/26/senate-section/article/S9415-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9415-S9416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SUPPORT OF RENEWABLE FUELS PROVISION\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to urge the House-Senate Energy \nBill conferees to resist any efforts from House Republican conferees to \nalter or weaken the renewable fuels standard that was included in the \nSenate energy bill. The new standard was crafted in a consensus manner \nand supported by a strong majority in the Senate. It must remain intact \nin the conference report.\n  Earlier this Congress, I introduced a bill with Senator Chuck Hagel \nof Nebraska, the Renewable Fuels for Energy Security Act of 2001, S. \n1006, to ensure future growth for ethanol and biodiesel through the \ncreation of a new, renewable fuels content standard in all motor fuel \nproduced and used in the United States. The framework of this bill was \nincluded in the Senate energy bill, requiring that 5 billions gallons \nof transportation fuel be comprised of renewable fuel by 2012, nearly a \ntripling of the current ethanol production. While the House of \nRepresentatives version of the bill did not include a renewable fuels \nstandard, this issue was thoroughly debated on the Senate floor during \nconsideration of the energy bill. Several amendments were offered to \nweaken or eliminate the renewable fuels standard but all of those \nefforts were soundly defeated. And for good reason: increased renewable \nfuel production lessens our dependence upon foreign oil, strengthens \nenergy security, increases farm income, creates jobs, helps the \nenvironment, helps our international balance of trade, and would lower \nannual federal farm payments by $6.6 billion.\n  In addition, the new standard boosts economic growth in rural \nAmerica. I do not need to convince anyone in South\n\n[[Page S9416]]\n\nDakota and other rural States of the benefits of ethanol to the \nenvironment and the economies of rural communities. Farmer-owned \nethanol plants in South Dakota, and in neighboring States, demonstrate \nthe hard work and commitment being expended to serve a growing market \nfor clean domestic fuels.\n  In South Dakota, six ethanol plants are operating to produce \napproximately 116 million gallons per year. Four other ethanol projects \nare under construction, with a combined capacity to produce an \nadditional 139 million gallons of ethanol annually.\n  Increasingly, modern ethanol plants in South Dakota are equipped to \nproduce 40 million gallons of ethanol per year, such as the plants \noperating in Wentworth, Watertown, and near Milbank, as well as the \nproposed sites under construction in Chancellor and Groton. The \neconomic benefits of one, 40 million gallon ethanol plant are \nsignificant, including an increase of household income for the \ncommunity by $20 million annually.\n  The bill has other important provisions, including an orderly phase-\ndown of MTBE use and removal of the oxygen content requirement for \nreformulated gasoline, RFG. The new standard has strong bipartisan \nsupport and is the result of long and comprehensive negotiations \nbetween farm groups, the oil industry and environmentalists. It is the \nfirst time that a substantive agreement has been reached on this issue.\n  Including the Senate-passed renewable fuels standard in the \nconference will go a long way towards increasing the Nation's domestic \nenergy supply and making it more secure in the future. However, after \nno renewable fuels provision was included in the House energy bill, \nHouse Republican conferees, have chosen to introduce an unworkable \nalternative at the eleventh hour that has received no debate and has no \nconsensus.\n  This is not acceptable. The conference should adopt the Senate-passed \nstandard immediately. After a long debate, a consensus has been reached \non this issue, demonstrating bipartisan support for a broader, deeper \nand more diverse energy portfolio, one that ensures we have clean, \nreliable and affordable domestic sources of energy. Let's move forward \nand enact the Senate language into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/26/senate-section/article/S9416-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               HOME SAFETY MISHAPS COST AMERICANS DEARLY\n\n Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, this morning on the National Mall \na report entitled ``State of Home Safety in America'' was unveiled by \nDavid Oliver, Executive Director of the Home Safety Council. The study, \nconducted by Dr. Carol Runyan of the University of North Carolina at \nChapel Hill and recognized by Dr. Sue Binder of the Center for Disease \nControl and Prevention, paints a picture of far too many Americans \nbeing hurt by unintentional injuries and deaths in this nation.\n  For instance, the study found that: Unintentional injuries are the \nfifth leading cause of death in the United States. Unintentional \ninjuries in the home result in nearly 20,000 deaths and 13 million \nmedical visits. Unintentional home injuries cost nearly $380 billion \neach year and account for an estimated 10 percent of all visits to \nemergency rooms.\n  The Home Safety Council, a not-for-profit organization devoted to \nhome safety, has already been working to educate Americans on the risks \nthey face every day in their own homes. The Great Safety Adventure is a \ntraveling hands-on educational experience that teaches basic life \nskills to help children, families and communities.\n  Americans need to know the risks that exist in their homes and what \nthey can do to prevent home injuries. This study will be an important \nresource for all Americans and will be a benchmark for examining future \ntrends in home injury prevention.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this monumental effort to educate \nand save American lives by informing our constituents of the risks \npresent in their homes and the steps they can take to prevent \nunintentional home injuries and keep families safe. More details are \navailable through the Home Safety Council's Web site, \nwww.homesafetycouncil.org.\n  For commissioning this important study and for raising the issue of \nhome safety in the Congress, I congratulate the Home Safety Council and \nits distinguished board of directors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/26/senate-section/article/S9416-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9416-S9417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO THE GRADUATES OF THE BOSTON DIGITAL BRIDGE FOUNDATION \n                          TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay \ntribute to the impressive achievements of those who have graduated this \nyear as part of the Boston Digital Bridge Foundation's Technology Goes \nHome and TechBoston programs.\n  This evening at Franklin Park in Dorchester, MA, the City and the \nBoston Digital Bridge Foundation are hosting ``Evening on the Bridge \n2.0,'' a celebration honoring the graduates of these two programs.\n  Working with businesses, universities, schools, government, families \nand community-based organizations, the Boston Digital Bridge Foundation \norganizes and facilitates partnerships to link Boston public school \nstudents and their parents to the Internet. These programs have helped \nover 5,000 Boston Public School students and their families.\n  Technology Goes Home is a ten-week technology training program for \nlow-income families. It has a rigorous selection process and a \ncommunity service requirement at the completion of the program. Upon \ngraduating from the program, each family receives a new computer, \nprinter and Internet access.\n  TechBoston provides advanced technology courses for Boston Public \nSchool students at the middle and high-school level. They teach high-\ntech skills essential for success in careers and post-secondary \neducation. Currently, over 2,500 Public School Students are enrolled in \nthese classes.\n  Technology skills are no longer a luxury for students, they are a \nnecessity. Without knowledge of computers and the Internet, today's \nstudents will have great difficulty competing in tomorrow's economy. \nWhen used effectively in the classroom and at home, modern technology \ncan help level the playing field and open extraordinary new horizons \nand opportunities for all students and their parents.\n  That's why we are so strongly committed to the Boston Digital Bridge \nFoundation. The City is at the cutting edge of education technology and \nhas become a national model, thanks to the leadership of Mayor Thomas \nM. Menino and the skillful work of the community partners involved in \nthese two innovative programs. Over 4,000 participants in six Boston \nneighborhoods, every high school, and ten middle schools are enrolled \nin the programs.\n  We are all proud of the remarkable progress that Boston has made in \nhelping to close the digital divide. A coalition of leaders in \nbusiness, labor, education and government has worked successfully \ntogether to connect all of Boston public schools to the Internet, and \nis in the process of bringing this technology home to all Boston Public \nSchool families.\n  Dozens of large and small organizations have made donations to these \nprograms. America Online, AT Broadband, the Barr Foundation, the Bill \nand Melinda Gates Foundation, the Boston Redevelopment Authority, \nFleetBoston Financial, Hewlett-Packard, HiQ Computers, Intel, Keane \nInc., Lexmark, Microsoft, PARTNERS+simons, Sallie Mae Foundation, 3Com, \nVerizon and Xintra and others have done more than their share, donating \nproducts and services to schools, including wiring, network equipment, \ncomputers and other supplies. All the equipment donated by these firms \nis new, and Verizon and America Online have donated free Internet \naccess. This kind of participation has become a model for the nation.\n  Thanks to the Boston Digital Bridge Foundation and its supporters, we \ncan now guarantee that Boston Public School students and their families \nhave access to the Internet and the opportunities that it creates. We \nare doing all we can to see that every student in every Boston \nneighborhood will soon have the same opportunity.\n  I commend these Boston families and students for their efforts and \naccomplishments in expanding employment opportunities, improving school \ngrades,\n\n[[Page S9417]]\n\nand strengthening their community. To all involved, it is a job well \ndone.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the memory \nof Carl Thompson, one of the founders of Wisconsin's modern Democratic \nParty. I was proud to know Carl, and had the pleasure of serving with \nhim in the Wisconsin State Senate. Wisconsin was lucky to have him as a \nleading voice for progressivism in our State.\n  Carl was the youngest delegate at the founding convention of the \nState Progressive Party in Wisconsin. From those early days he never \nwavered from his commitment to an honest Government that truly served \nthe interests of the people.\n  Twice the Democratic candidate for Governor, Carl spent a lifetime \ndedicated to serving Wisconsin, whether he was running for the State's \ntop office or serving 30 years in the Wisconsin State Senate. He also \nserved as a member of the State's Labor and Industry Review Commission.\n\n[[Page S9418]]\n\n  When I served with Carl in the 1980s, I was struck, as was everyone \nwho knew Carl Thompson, by his dedication to the great State of \nWisconsin, and to the people he served. He was a powerful advocate for \nveterans' housing, and was one of the State's leading voices on the \nimportance of preserving our First Amendment freedoms. Carl Thompson \nwas also a great storyteller with a wonderful wit and sense of humor.\n  I am deeply saddened by Carl Thompson's passing, but I know that his \nleadership has left a lasting mark on the Wisconsin Democratic Party, \nand our State. He will be remembered for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/26/senate-section/article/S9418-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:17 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2982.

A House joint memorial that was adopted by the \n     Legislature of the State of Washington relative to the \n     National Guard; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial 4017\n\n       Whereas, Within days of the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks in New York City and Washington D.C., the nation's \n     governors activated National Guard soldiers and airmen to \n     augment security at 422 of the nation's international \n     airports; and\n       Whereas, In true state-federal partnership, National Guard \n     forces are providing aerial port security under the command \n     and control of the sovereign states, territories, and the \n     District of Columbia and the federal government is funding \n     such duties ``in the service of the United States'' under \n     Title 32 U.S.C., Section 502(f), hereinafter referred to as \n     ``Title 32 duty''; and\n       Whereas, Title 32 duty has been used, inter alia, for more \n     than twenty years for National Guard full-time staffing, for \n     National Guard support for local, state, and federal law \n     enforcement agencies under Governors' Counter-Drug Plans for \n     more than twelve years, for National Guard Civil Support Team \n     technical assistance for local first responders for more than \n     two years, and for aerial port security following the attacks \n     of September 11. Of particular note, the National Guard \n     Counter-Drug Program has long included Title 32 support for \n     United States Customs, Border Patrol, and Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service activities at United States Ports of \n     Entry; and\n       Whereas, In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, \n     increased security and inadequate federal staffing have \n     limited the flow of persons, goods, and services across our \n     nation's borders. These factors have contributed to a serious \n     weakening of the American and Canadian economies, especially \n     in states such as Washington; and\n       Whereas, The governors of northern tier border states wrote \n     President Bush in November 2001 offering to provide Title 32 \n     National Guard augmentation for United States Customs, Border \n     Patrol, and Immigration and Naturalization Service operations \n     at United States ports of entry. Such relief could have been, \n     and still can be, effected within days of acceptance by the \n     federal government; and\n       Whereas, There is still no relief at our borders due to \n     inaction on the governors' offer of Title 32 National Guard \n     assistance and conflicting Department of Defense proposals to \n     federalize the National Guard or otherwise enhance border \n     security with active duty military personnel instead of Title \n     32 National Guard members; and\n       Whereas, Federalizing the National Guard under Title 10 \n     U.S.C. would degrade the combat readiness of units from which \n     Guardsmen would be mobilized, interfere with effective state \n     force management, and prevent personal accommodations for \n     soldiers and their civilian employers; and\n       Whereas, Stationing federal military forces at the United \n     States-Canada border would be an unprecedented unilateral \n     action by the United States; and\n       Whereas, The nation's border states need prompt relief \n     which can best be provided by Title 32 National Guard forces \n     being deployed to assist lead federal agencies at the borders \n     ``in the service of the United States,'' but under continued \n     state command and control; and\n       Whereas, The Washington State Legislature opposes \n     federalization of the National Guard or assignment of federal \n     military forces for United States border security: Now, \n     therefore,\n       Your Memorialists respectfully pray that Congress assures \n     prompt augmentation of\n\n[[Page S9419]]\n\n     lead federal agencies at the borders by accepting the \n     governors' offer of National Guard forces under state command \n     and control pursuant to 32 U.S.C. Sec. 502(f); be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of \n     Congress from the State of Washington.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-309. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Alabama relative to ratifying the Seventeenth \n     Amendment to the United States Constitution; to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary.\n\n                       House Joint Resolution 12\n\n       Whereas, the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution provides as follows:\n       ``Amendment XVII.\n       ``[Popular Election of Senators]\n       ``The senate of the United States shall be composed of two \n     senators from each state, elected by the people thereof, for \n     six years; and each senator shall have one vote.

The Congress and President of the United States are \n     respectfully memorialized to make a wholehearted national \n     effort to encourage people and organizations to celebrate \n     ``National Grandparents Day'' by planning appropriate \n     programs, ceremonies and activities that commemorate and \n     honor the wonderful and vital contributions that grandparents \n     make to the lives of their families.\n       2.

This House urges the President of the United States and \n     the Administrator of the United States Environmental \n     Protection Agency to not weaken federal Clean Air Act \n     requirements.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to Amtrak; to the Committee \n     on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                          Assembly Resolution\n\n       Whereas, President David Gunn of the National Rail \n     Passenger Corporation, Amtrak, has warned that without a loan \n     guarantee of $200 million or similar federal support, Amtrak \n     will run out of operating funds in the near future and will \n     have to shut down operations; and\n       Whereas, While Federal support appears to be forthcoming to \n     provide a short-term reprieve for Amtrak that will permit it \n     to continue operations until October 1, 2002, such short-term \n     support begs the question of the long-term support for the \n     continuation of national rail passenger service; and\n       Whereas, The Federal Government under the Constitution of \n     the United States has the responsibility for the regulation \n     of interstate commerce and has taken on the responsibility by \n     legislation for the creation of an Interstate Highway System \n     and a national airport system, both of which receive \n     substantial financial support from federal appropriations; \n     and\n       Whereas, With the formation of Amtrak, the Congress of the \n     United States emphasized the importance of a federal \n     commitment to a national rail passenger system, but now the \n     President of the United States and the federal administration \n     have begun to weaken the federal commitment in favor of \n     actions by the individual states; and\n       Whereas, The United States is one Nation and can ill afford \n     a fragmented and decentralized national rail passenger \n     transportation system; and\n       Whereas, The dismantling of Amtrak will not only deprive \n     the Nation as a whole of a national rail passenger system but \n     will create an intolerable burden on the individual states, \n     with the Northeastern states in particular being forced to \n     assume responsibility for a $12 billion maintenance backlog \n     on the Northeast Corridor; and\n       Whereas, The cost of continuing Amtrak and providing for \n     proper maintenance and repair of its infrastructure is modest \n     compared to the enormous sums spent for the support of the \n     Nation's highways and aviation system; and\n       Whereas, In a time of national emergency, a national rail \n     passenger system plays an important role in the national \n     security of the United States, as manifested by the fact that \n     during the September 11, 2001 crisis, the rail system was the \n     only functioning practical interstate transportation \n     operation nationally; and\n       Whereas, The dismantling of the Amtrak system would have a \n     disastrous effect on the greater New York-New Jersey \n     metropolitan region, leading to the overburdening of an \n     already heavily burdened road system, the paralysis of the \n     local rail transportation system affecting local commuting \n     into and out of New York City, exacerbating problems of air \n     pollution, leading to economic decline or stagnation which \n     would deleteriously affect federal tax revenues from one of \n     the most productive and vibrant economic regions of the \n     country: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. The General Assembly of the State of New Jersey, for the \n     public policy reasons stated in the preamble of this \n     resolution, memorializes the Congress and the President of \n     the United States to enact a long-term solution to the \n     Nation's rail crisis by providing for the continuation of \n     national passenger rail service by Amtrak.\n       2. Duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the Speaker of the General Assembly and attested by the Clerk \n     thereof, shall be transmitted to the President and Vice \n     President of the United States, the Speaker of the United \n     States House of Representatives, the Majority and Minority \n     leaders of the United States Senate and the United States \n     House of Representatives, and all other members of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-321. A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to the cable television \n     industry; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                          Assembly Resolution\n\n       Whereas, The ``Cable Communication Policy Act of 1984'' \n     totally deregulated the cable television industry and \n     specifically prohibited the States from regulating either \n     cable rates or cable programming; and\n       Whereas, Subsequent to the 1984 deregulation of the cable \n     industry, rapidly escalating cable rates and declining levels \n     of service led to the passage of the ``Cable Television \n     Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992'' which \n     essentially restored governmental rate regulation of the \n     cable industry; and\n       Whereas, The federal ``Telecommunications Act of 1996'' was \n     adopted to promote greater competition as a means of \n     addressing the cable industry's problems and eliminated most \n     of the ``Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition \n     Act of 1992'' by the end of 1999, including the phasing out \n     of federal price controls over cable rates; and\n\n[[Page S9422]]\n\n       Whereas, Following passage of the federal \n     ``Telecommunications Act of 1996,'' cable programming service \n     rates have increased by over 60 percent, or of which increase \n     zero percent is attributable to State law, and which 60 \n     percent increase represents about seven times the aggregate \n     rate of inflation for the past three years, according to the \n     New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, and federal price \n     controls over most cable rates were terminated on March 31, \n     1999; and\n       Whereas, The cable rate increases over the past several \n     years once again indicate that a competitive free market \n     fails to restrain the predatory practices that occur when \n     cable television companies enjoy de facto monopolies \n     unregulated by the areas they serve; and\n       Whereas, In light of the cable rate increases of the past \n     few years, it is appropriate for Congress to reconsider the \n     deregulation of the cable television industry as enacted by \n     the federal ``Telecommunications Act of 1996'' and the \n     ``Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984'' and permit States \n     to fully regulate the cable television industry, including \n     the regulation of cable television rates, in order to curb \n     the anti-consumer practices of the cable company, monopolies; \n     and\n       Whereas, It is altogether fitting and proper for this \n     House, as representatives of the residents of this State, \n     which itself established a regulatory framework for cable \n     television in the 1972 ``Cable Television Act,'' to call upon \n     Congress to reconsider the deregulation of the cable \n     television industry as enacted by the federal \n     ``Telecommunications Act of 1996'' and the ``Cable \n     Communications Policy Act of 1984'' and permit States to \n     fully regulate the cable television industry, including the \n     regulation of cable television rates: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. The Congress of the United States is respectfully \n     memorialized to reconsider the deregulation of the cable \n     television industry and permit States to fully regulate the \n     cable television industry.\n       2.

A Resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to a tax \n     credit for companies for the cost of converting from \n     groundwater to reclaimed water and to provide interest free \n     loans to municipalities to construct waste water treatment/\n     reclamation projects; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 27\n\n       Whereas, the Federal Energy Policy Bill is being debated in \n     Congress and energy and electricity production are vital to \n     Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, merchant power plants and other energy producers \n     currently using groundwater should be encouraged to change to \n     alternative sources; and\n       Whereas, the largest producers of waste water in the state \n     are municipalities and many of those rural municipalities are \n     facing tougher standards from the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency to update their waste water treatment \n     systems yet these municipalities lack funding to do so; and\n       Whereas, by creating a market for the reclaimed water, the \n     municipalities could justify the loans to build the waste \n     water treatment facilities; and\n       Whereas, currently, companies have no incentive to spend \n     the money necessary to convert to surface water or waste \n     water because it is cheaper to mine the pure drinking water \n     from the ground and allowing a tax credit to business to \n     convert to reclaimed water would allow the companies to \n     ultimately save money and to update their water collection/\n     cooling systems;\n       Whereas, updating company technology would benefit the \n     overall efficiency of the industrial facility and the \n     environment; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana farmers would also benefit from \n     increased water resources necessary for irrigation; and\n       Whereas, in order for a municipality to get the interest \n     free loan, the municipality must agree to sell the reclaimed \n     water to industry and other buyers at a cost lower than \n     industry pays to mine groundwater: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to provide a tax credit to \n     companies for the cost of converting from groundwater to \n     reclaimed water and provide interest free loans to \n     municipalities to construct waste water treatment/reclamation \n     projects; be it further\n\n[[Page S9424]]\n\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation of the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-330.

The House of Representatives urges the Congress \n     of the United States and the President to support and enact \n     legislation that would establish a federal/state partnership \n     to use the knowledge and skills of the local county veterans \n     service officers to assist the United States Department of \n     Veterans Affairs in eliminating the veterans claims \n     processing backlog in order that America's veterans can take \n     advantage of the benefits that the United States has \n     authorized for them for their faithful and loyal service to a \n     grateful nation.\n       Section 2.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to expand \nthe loan forgiveness and loan cancellation programs for teachers, to \nprovide loan forgiveness and loan cancellation programs for nurses, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I, along with my good friend from \nAlaska, Senator Stevens, am introducing legislation that will help \nbolster two critical components of Iowa's and the Nation's economic \nfuture: healthcare and education.\n  Across Iowa and America, we face a critical and worsening shortage of \nnurses and teachers. By 2010 there will be a shortage of 725,000 \nnurses. By 2020, that shortage will increase to 1.2 million as the baby \nboomers begin to retire and need more care.\n  It's much the same case for teachers. In Iowa, 40 percent of our \nteachers will be eligible to retire in the next 10 years. And 17 \npercent of Iowa first year teachers leave the classroom after only one \nyear. This is almost twice the national average. We'll need more than 2 \nmillion teachers nationwide just to replace the teachers that retire or \nleave the profession.\n  Clearly, a shortage of nurses or teachers will have a profound impact \non the quality of education for our children and the quality of health \ncare for every Iowan. We have to do more to attract young people to \nthese difficult yet rewarding careers.\n  One reason young people aren't taking on teaching or nursing is \nbecause they're buried in college loan debt. According to the ``Burden \nof Borrowing'', a report by the United States Public Interest Research \nGroup, 64 percent of students graduated in 1999-2000 with Federal \neducation loan debt. Further, the average student loan debt has nearly \ndoubled over the past eight years to $16,928. Young people simply can't \npursue careers that are critical to Iowa's and America's future because \ntheir college debt causes them to enter into unmanageable repayment \nplans.\n  Earlier this year, I spoke with college students from schools across \ncentral Iowa. Many of these students will walk away from college with a \ndiploma in one hand and a $20,000 student loan bill in the other. When \nstudents loan debt keeps our kids from becoming Iowa's next teachers \nand nurses there's something very wrong with America's priorities.\n  That's why I, along with my good friend from Alaska, Senator Stevens, \nam introducing a plan to offer up to $17,500 of loan forgiveness to \nstudents who go into teaching or nursing for at least 5 years. Under \nour plan, students would get needed relief from loan debt and Iowa and \nAmerica would get its next generation of nurses and teachers. That's a \ngood investment in education, health care, and our nation's future.\n  I think we've got a good chance of moving this proposal forward. \nPresident Bush has proposed a similar plan aimed just at teachers in a \nfew subject areas. However, I am aware that school districts throughout \nthe United States are faced with problems attracting and retaining \nteachers in more than just the areas of special education, math and \nscience. Since the White House has embraced the general approach, I am \nhopeful they'll also support our broader plan for teachers and nurses. \nIt's a common sense proposal that's focused on Iowa and America's \nfuture.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support for our legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                  American Nurses Association,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 30, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: I write on behalf of the American \n     Nurses Association (ANA) to express gratitude and support for \n     your intent\n\n[[Page S9428]]\n\n     to introduce legislation to provide loan forgiveness and loan \n     cancellation programs for registered nurses.\n       ANA is the only full-service association representing the \n     nation's registered nurses through its 54 constituent member \n     nurse associations. The ANA represents registered nurses of \n     all educational preparation in all practice settings.\n       ANA supports your legislation because it aims to address \n     the impending nursing shortage. This shortage is projected to \n     soon reach crisis proportions, just as the baby boom \n     population begins to place great demands on the health care \n     system.\n       A reason for the emerging nurse shortage is a decreasing \n     number of young people entering the nursing profession. As \n     you may well be aware, enrollments in nursing programs have \n     dropped by 17 percent since 1995. Current projections show \n     that the number of nurses per capita will fall 20 percent \n     below requirements by 2020. Your legislation will help \n     reverse the trend and encourage entry into the profession.\n       As nurses are the largest single group of health care \n     professionals in America, the nurse shortage threatens the \n     very fabric of our health care delivery system. An adequately \n     prepared and supported nursing workforce is essential for the \n     health of our nation.\n       ANA thanks you for your strong support of nursing issues \n     and for introducing this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Rose Gonzalez,\n     Director, Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Americans for Nursing\n\n\n                                              Shortage Relief,\n\n                                                  August 19, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Stevens: The undersigned members \n     of the ANSR Alliance (Americans for Nursing Shortage Relief) \n     strongly support your draft bill to amend the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 and increase nursing education loan \n     opportunities within the Department of Education. As \n     delineated in the bill, this positive move to bring more \n     individuals into the nursing profession and support the \n     creation of nurse educators will be accomplished through loan \n     cancellation and forgiveness after five years of service in a \n     clinical setting or at an accredited school of nursing. We \n     greatly appreciate your understanding of the need for \n     multiple programs throughout the federal government to \n     alleviate the critical nursing shortage that is facing us \n     today and which will continue to do so unless we stem its \n     growth.\n       A key issue in ensuring public access to high quality \n     nursing services is the growing faculty shortage and \n     implications for the preparation of new nursing \n     professionals. The median age of nurse faculty is 52 years \n     old, and the impending retirement of seasoned faculty over \n     the next decade will significantly impact the ability of \n     schools and universities to sustain quality nursing \n     educational programs that prepare an adequate supply of \n     nurses to meet the Nation's needs. The educational incentives \n     described in the proposed legislation hold promise as \n     effective tools to insure monies are available to train \n     critically needed nurse faculty.\n       The ANSR Alliance thanks you for your commitment to \n     advancing an innovative solution to help alleviate the \n     nursing shortage in the United States. We look forward to \n     working with you to ensure passage of this important piece of \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely yours,\n       American Academy of Ambulatory Care Nursing.\n       American Academy of Nurse Practitioners.\n       American Association of Colleges of Nursing.\n       American Association of Critical Care Nurses.\n       American Association of Nurse Anesthetists.\n       American College of Nurse-Midwives.\n       American College of Nurse Practitioners.\n       American Nephrology Nurses Association.\n       American Organization of Nurse Executives.\n       American Society of Pain Management Nurses.\n       American Society of Perianesthesia Nurses.\n       American Society of Plastic Surgical Nurses.\n       Association of Faculties of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners.\n       Association of periOperative Registered Nurses.\n       Association of State and Territorial Directors of Nursing.\n       Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal \n     Nurses.\n       Emergency Nurses Association.\n       National Alaska Native American Indian Nurses Association.\n       National Association of Clinical Nurse Specialists.\n       National Association of Neonatal Nurses.\n       National Association of Orthopaedic Nurses.\n       National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners.\n       National Association of School Nurses.\n       National Black Nurses Association, Inc.\n       National Conference of Gerontological Nurse Practitioners.\n       National Council of State Boards of Nursing, Inc.\n       National League for Nursing.\n       National Nursing Centers Consortium.\n       National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculties.\n       National Student Nurses' Association, Inc.\n       Nurses Organization of Veterans Affairs.\n       Oncology Nursing Society.\n       Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates, Inc.\n       Society of Pediatric Nurses.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    American Council on Education,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2002.\n     Re support of the Teacher and Nurse Support Act of 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin, On behalf of the American Council on \n     Education (ACE) and the organization listed below, I thank \n     you for introducing legislation to expand and extend loan \n     forgiveness and cancellation programs for teachers and \n     nurses. We are grateful to you for working so hard to \n     alleviate the financial burden of America's students, \n     particularly our teachers and nurses. These highly valued but \n     underpaid professionals are educated and prepared in our \n     institutions. We will work with you in building support for \n     these good measures and we will wholeheartedly support your \n     bill when it comes up for consideration.\n       Providing financial incentives to nursing and teaching \n     students via federal loan programs is one of the best ways to \n     attract and retain talented individuals to pursue academic \n     study and careers in these important fields.\n       As individuals retire and the vacancies for nurses and \n     teachers grow, the United States will need to replace and \n     supplement these essential vocations with qualified \n     personnel. These types of programs and incentives are \n     especially helpful for individuals who choose to dedicate \n     their time and energy to careers that are rarely financially \n     lucrative.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this important \n     issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       David Ward,\n                                                        President.\n       On behalf of:\n       American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education.\n       American Association of Colleges of Nursing.\n       American Association of State Colleges and Universities.\n       American Council on Education.\n       Association of American Universities.\n       Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities.\n       National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher \n     Education.\n       National Association of College and University Business \n     Officers.\n       National Association of Independent Colleges and \n     Universities.\n       National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant \n     Colleges.\n       The State PIRGs' Higher Education Project.\n       United States Student Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 2002.\n     Senator Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the National Education \n     Association's (NEA) 2.7 million members, we would like to \n     express our support for the Teacher and Nurse Support Act of \n     2002.\n       We are very pleased that your legislation seeks to address \n     the nation's growing teacher shortage by providing student \n     loan forgiveness for individuals who enter the profession. \n     New teacher quality standards coupled with a national teacher \n     shortage make attracting and retaining quality teachers even \n     more important, particilary in high-poverty areas. \n     Unfortunately, too many of today's students rely on loans in \n     order to afford higher education. The resulting debt burden \n     often limits career choices and prevents many talented \n     students from pursuing careers in public service, including \n     as teachers.\n       By expanding loan forgiveness and targeting it more toward \n     teachers in high poverty schools, rather than toward limited \n     academic disciplines, your bill will help encourage talented \n     individuals to enter the teaching profession and to bring \n     their skills to schools with the greatest need. In addition, \n     by providing for mandatory spending, the bill will ensure \n     that teachers who qualify will receive the loan forgiveness \n     they need.\n       We thank you for your leadership on this important issue \n     and look forward to continuing to work with you in support of \n     children and public education.\n           Sincerely,\n     Diane Shust,\n       Director of Government Relations.\n     Randall Moody,\n       Manager of Federal Policy and Politics.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \n        Sarbanes, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Torricelli, Mr.\n\n[[Page S9429]]\n\n        Durbin, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Reed, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Biden, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Corzine, Mr. Reid, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Leahy, and \n        Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 3009. A bill to provide econonmic security for America's workers; \nread the first time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce, on behalf of \nmyself and a large and bipartisan group of my colleagues, the Emergency \nUnemployment Compensation Act of 2002. I want to especially acknowledge \nthe hard, really the relentless work, in particular of Senator Clinton \nand Senator Kennedy on this issue. They care deeply about the plight of \nhard-working men and women in their States and around the country, who \nare struggling, through no fault of their own, to deal with the effects \nof our flagging economy. I commend their work.\n  We cannot have a secure Nation if we do not address issues of our \neconomic security as well.\n  Working men and women around the country and in Minnesota, blue \ncollar and white collar, are hurting.\n  The economy, battered by corporate accountability scandals, \nplummeting stock prices, and now flagging consumer confidence, is \ndeteriorating.\n  And the jobs simply are not there. Minnesota has lost more than \n40,000 jobs in the past 18 months. There are currently 123,000 \nMinnesotans unemployed. In the second quarter of this year, unemployed \nworkers in Minnesota looking for jobs outnumbered unfilled jobs by 2-1.\n  The national picture is no different. Nationally, more than 2 million \njobs have been lost over the last 18 months. We have more than 8 \nmillion men and women out of work. This is the only Administration in \nthe past 50 years that has presided over a decline in private sector \njobs.\n  What's more, long term unemployment is up sharply. Nationally, nearly \n1 in five of the 8 million unemployed workers have been out of work for \n6 months or more. Between May and July of this year, around 900,000 \nworkers exhausted the extended unemployment benefits made available \nthrough the unemployment insurance extension in March. By the end of \n2002 we expect over 2 million workers to exhaust these benefits.\n  In Minnesota, through the end of July, over 17,000 workers had \nexhausted the benefits that we temporarily extended back in March of \nthis year, with thousands more likely to exhaust in the future.\n  That is why we are announcing today the introduction of the \n``Economic Security Act of 2002.'' It does the following: Extends, \nthrough July 2003, the temporary extended benefits program, due to \nexpire on December 31st. Provides another 13 weeks of extended benefits \nfor workers running out of benefits in all states and another 20 weeks \nin high unemployment states.\n  This mirrors the benefit extensions signed into law by Bush, Sr.\n  The triggers used to determine ``high unemployment'' are: A 4 percent \nAdjusted Insured Unemployment Rate (AUIR) or a 6 percent Total \nUnemployment Rate (TUR).\n  The AUIR and the TUR are exactly the same triggers used in the early \n90's. The levels are different to reflect the new reality of a \nsignificantly lower natural unemployment rate. [In the 90's we used a 5 \npercent AUIR and a 9 percent TUR, virtually no states would trigger at \nthese levels today].\n  In the 90's we extended benefits 5 times, by large bi-partisan votes. \nThree of those votes (91-2; 94-2; and 93-3) were during Bush 1.\n  And the need is even greater now. By year's end we expect 2.2 million \nworkers to have exhausted. In 1992, for a comparable period, there were \nonly 1.4 million workers who exhausted benefits.\n  The need is urgent--we should pass this measure immediately.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, on September 12, 2001, hundreds of \nthousands of New Yorkers woke up to a changed world, thousands had lost \nfamily, friends and co-workers to the terrorist attacks of September 11 \nand hundreds of thousands more New Yorkers had lost their jobs. America \nwatched the scenes of New York and felt pride in the firefighters, the \npolice officers, the emergency workers, and the construction workers \nwho had all fled to Ground Zero to help with recovery.\n  The images that our Nation did not see as prominently were the faces \nof the hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who were left jobless. \nThere were the workers whose jobs were literally destroyed when the \nTwin Towers collapsed, the janitors, the doormen, the waiters and \nwaitresses, the secretaries, and messengers. Or, the workers who did \nnot work in lower Manhattan, but who felt the ripple effect of the so-\ncalled frozen zone, primarily the hotel workers and small businesses \nowners.\n  In the months following September 11, these individuals streamed into \nmy office and called on the phone pleading for my assistance. At first, \nNew York was able to offer displaced workers needed assistance through \nregular unemployment insurance, UI. And, for those workers who did not \nqualify for regular UI, either because they worked for a small business \nor they were new employees, they were able to receive Disaster \nUnemployment Assistance, DUA, provided through the Federal Emergency \nManagement Administration, FEMA.\n  In September 2001, the unemployment rate in New York City was 6.3 \npercent. And, in the period following September 2001, this rate began \nto spike up such that we experienced unemployment rates that we had not \nseen since the recession of the early 1990s. In December 2001, the \nunemployment rate rose to 7.4 percent, 2.4 percent above the national \naverage for the same period. In March 2002, the unemployment rate \nclimbed to 7.5 percent and in June 2002 it reached 8 percent. New York \nCity lost 150,000 jobs in the aftermath of September 11 and the City is \nnot expected to rebound until 2004. New York City was not alone, New \nYork State saw a climbing unemployment rate for the same period. In \nSeptember 2001, the unemployment rate in the state was at 5.2 percent; \nit went up to 5.7 percent in December 2001, to 5.9 percent in March \n2002, and to 6.1 percent in June 2002.\n  Once it became clear that the economy was not going to recover \nquickly and that it was going to take New York State and New York City \nyears to rebuild the economy, I immediately began to fight for the \nextension of Unemployment Insurance and Disaster Unemployment \nAssistance so that New Yorkers could receive a small bit of short-term \neconomic security while they searched for jobs. On November 1, 2001, I \nintroduced a bill to extend Disaster Unemployment Assistance for an \nadditional 13-weeks and, at the same time, I urged the Congressional \nLeadership to include an extension of regular unemployment insurance in \nthe economic stimulus package.\n  After sustained work on these bills, I was pleased in March 2002 to \njoin my colleagues in voting for an economic stimulus package that \nincluded a 13-week extension of Unemployment Insurance and, in the same \nmonth, I was pleased that we passed the bill to extend Disaster \nUnemployment Assistance for 13 more weeks.\n  These extensions, however, were short-lived. The economy continued to \nweaken with corporate scandals and little job growth.\n  In June, I started to hear from thousands of my constituents who were \nstill out of work and concerned that their extended unemployment \nbenefits would soon run out. They were frightened and unsettled and \nlooking to me to help. I saw that this was a serious problem for many \nNew Yorkers so I introduced a bill on July 19, 2002, to provide for \nanother 13-week extension of unemployment insurance. This bill, S. \n2714, garnered eight co-sponsors. I also introduced a companion bill, \nS. 2715, to extend Disaster Unemployment Assistance. Six of my \ncolleagues joined me in co-sponsoring it. I also worked with my \ncolleagues on the House to introduce a companion bill. Rep. Charlie \nRangel, from New York City, introduced H.R. 5089, which received 34 co-\nsponsors, including fourteen members of the New York Congressional \ndelegation.\n  The need to help struggling workers in New York and throughout the \nNation, however, was not breaking through. On September 13, 2002, I \nmade my case for the need to extend unemployment insurance through an \nop-ed in the New York Times, which I would like to submit for the \nRecord today. In this article, I refer to Felix Batista, a\n\n[[Page S9430]]\n\nfather of four who lost his job as a result of September 11 and has not \nbeen able to get back on his feet. Felix came to Washington to testify \nat a HELP Committee hearing on September 12, 2002, and told his story \nto all the members of the Committee. I was pleased to meet with him and \nthe hundreds of other unemployed New Yorkers who came to town to ask \nthat Congress extend unemployment benefits.\n  On September 15, 2002, I appeared on Meet the Press with Tim Russert \nand again mentioned the dramatic rise in long-term unemployment and the \nneed to extend benefits and help those who are suffering as a result of \nthe economy. Last week, I delivered a floor statement on this bill to \nagain reinforce the message that I have been trying to get out to all \nof my colleagues. And yesterday, I worked with Senator Kennedy to \norganize a press conference to draw attention to this issue. There, I \nintroduced Vera Matty, a former executive assistant at BMG who lost her \njob last November as a result of the recession.\n  Today, 24 of my colleagues and I are introducing a bill to extend \nUnemployment Insurance for another 13 weeks and 20 weeks for states \nlike New York that are suffering from high unemployment. In addition, \ntoday the Environment and Public Works Committee approved my bill to \nextend Disaster Unemployment Assistance for another 13 weeks. I am \npleased that the EPW Committee is taking action on this bill, S. 2715, \nand I hope that the Senate will move quickly to approve it.\n  New Yorkers are suffering. We have suffered a double blow as a result \nof September 11 and the recession. And September 20, 2002 there was an \narticle in the New York Times stating that New York City's poverty rate \nis growing for the first time in five years.\n  This economy was in a recession on September 10. It was devastated on \nSeptember 11 and the people who have exhausted their unemployment \nbenefits need our help now.\n  Too many Americans are out of work and having a hard time providing \nfor their families. Too many have lost their jobs and watched their \npensions and retirement securities disappear because of the illegal and \nunethical and inexplicable behavior of corporate executives. And \ndespite their steadfast efforts to find work and their overwhelming \ndesire to get back to work, they remain out of work and struggle to \nmake ends meet.\n  In New York, there are 135,000 New Yorkers who have exhausted their \nbenefits. Across the country, the number of people who have been \nunemployed for 6 months or longer has almost doubled from 900,000 to \n1.5 million in the last year. And that number is expected to increase \nto 2.2 million by December.\n  And what has Congress done to ease Americans financial burden during \nthese uncertain times? We have extended benefits only once. Contrast \nthat with the recession of the early 90's when Congress extended \ntemporary benefits five times. This year, even in the wake of massive \nterrorist attacks on our own soil, we have extended benefits only once, \nand once is not enough.\n  Congress must extend unemployment insurance and disaster unemployment \nassistance, each for an additional 13 weeks. With more people losing \ntheir benefits every day, these extensions have to be passed before \nCongress adjourns.\n  Extending unemployment insurance is not just the right thing to do; \nit is also the smart thing. According to a 1999 Department of Labor \nstudy, unemployment insurance stimulates the economy. Every dollar \nspent on unemployment insurance adds $2.5 to the Gross Domestic \nProduct. Unemployment Insurance acts as a stimulus because it puts \nmoney into the hands of people who are likely to spend it immediately? \nThey have to buy food. They have to pay rent. They have to pay their \ncar payments. So the money goes right into the economy, and it provides \na stimulus.\n  Today, the outlook for job seekers is grim. When President Bush took \noffice back in January of 2001, there was approximately 1 job seeker \nfor every job. In just a little over a year, those numbers have changed \nto nearly 1 job opening for every 3 applicants. The number of people \nwho cannot find jobs for six months or longer, has grown by almost 90 \npercent in the past year.\n  In fact, the share of the unemployed today who have been without work \nfor more than 26 weeks exceeds that of the recessions of the early 90s \nand the early 80s. But only looking at the unemployment rate does not \npaint a complete picture of the economy. My constituents describe an \nendless job search--the hopeless feeling that comes from looking for a \njob for months and months without success.\n  Two years ago, America was on the right track when it came to the \neconomy: 22 million new jobs, budget surpluses, and historic growth. \nFor reasons that escape me, we threw all that good work away. Now we're \nback into deficits. We're not creating jobs. And we're not taking care \nof the unemployed.\n  It's time for us to extend benefits just as we did during the \nrecession in the early 90's, and stimulate the economy. People are \nhurting and they are running out of benefits and they need Congress to \nact now. We must not adjourn until we pass these needed extensions of \nunemployment insurance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article of September \n20, 2002 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 20, 2002]\n\n                          Helping the Jobless\n\n                      (By Hillary Rodham Clinton)\n\n       For 23 years, Felix Batista rode the elevator up 106 floors \n     to work as a member of the wait staff at the Windows on the \n     World restaurant. On Sept. 11, everything changed. Mr. \n     Batista was on vacation with his family, and that decision \n     saved his life. That day, he lost 73 coworkers and his job.\n       While the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks has \n     come and gone, in New York the needs born out of that tragedy \n     remain. Each step that we take--whether it is investing $20.9 \n     billion for cleanup and recovery or financing programs to \n     track the health of rescue workers and volunteers at ground \n     zero--will bring New York closer to recovery.\n       But today, the city's unemployment rate has skyrocketed to \n     8 percent. Across the state, 553,000 New Yorkers are out of \n     work, with company layoffs and plant closings happening \n     everywhere from Niagara Falls to Rochester. Now 135,000 New \n     Yorkers like Mr. Batista have exhausted their unemployment \n     benefits and are struggling to pay their bills.\n       At this time last year, 800,000 Americans had been out of \n     work for six months or longer. That number has nearly doubled \n     to 1.5 million and it is expected to increase to more than 2 \n     million by December.\n       Congress must act quickly to extend unemployment insurance \n     and disaster unemployment assistance, each for an additional \n     13 weeks. With more people losing their benefits every day, \n     these extensions have to be passed before Congress adjourns.\n       During the recession of the early 90's, Congress extended \n     temporary benefits five times. This year, even in the wake of \n     massive terrorist attacks on our own soil, we have extended \n     benefits only once, and once is not enough.\n       The economy was already in a recession on Sept. 1. It was \n     devastated on Sept. 11, and is stalled now. Some forecasters \n     say we are experiencing a ``jobless recovery''--one in which \n     stockbrokers, electricians, insurance agents, computer \n     technicians, textile workers and restaurant workers have \n     formed lines many blocks long to attend job fairs. New \n     revelations about corporate irresponsibility and illegality \n     have added more doubt to an already weakened economy.\n       Extending unemployment insurance would put money into the \n     hands of the very people who will turn right around and put \n     it back into our economy. In 1999, the Department of Labor \n     found that when unemployment insurance is extended, every \n     dollar in benefits generates $2.15 in gross domestic product. \n     Giving more purchasing power to the more than 8 million \n     Americans who are currently unemployed would be a powerful \n     stimulus for our economy.\n       After Sept. 11, it was clear we needed a serious push for \n     homeland security. Now we need to restore a measure of \n     economic security to all Americans, and extending \n     unemployment benefits is a responsible and affordable way to \n     do so.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 3011. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to establish \nprograms to encourage economic growth in the United States, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the MEGA Safe \nAct. Maximum Economic Growth for America Through Safety Improvements.\n  Safer roads save lives. Improving traffic and roadway safety is one \nof the biggest challenges facing the government today. Traffic deaths \nare consistently one of the top ten causes of deaths each year. \nAccidents involving motor vehicles affect all of us.\n\n[[Page S9431]]\n\n  This bill is only a beginning in our Nation's efforts to curb roadway \naccidents and deaths, in a way that best addresses the needs of our \nStates.\n  A large cause of accidents is the poor quality of signs in and around \ncrosswalks, school and bicycle crossings. Highway signs marking \npedestrian, bicycle, and school zone crossings help to alert motorists \nto the increased risks associated with these locations.\n  This bill establishes a grant program to improve safety at \npedestrian, school and bicycle crossings by marking them with \nfluorescent yellow-green, signs. FYG signs are currently the most \nreflective signs available.\n  The Secretary of Transportation is directed to set aside $25 million \neach fiscal year from the Surface Transportation Program to finance \nthese safety improvement grants. The funds may be obligated for \neligible projects located on any public road.\n  I've been hearing from County Commissioners from Montana as well as \nother States, about how much they need direct funding for local roads. \nThese localities are hard pressed for funds and many of these roads are \nunsafe. This bill would establish a pilot program, at $200 million \nannually from fiscal year 2004-2009, to address safety on rural local \nroads. Funds could be used only on local roads and rural minor \ncollectors, roads that are not Federal-aid highways.\n  The program does not affect distribution of funds among States, as \nfunds will be distributed to each of the 50 States in accord with their \nrelative formula share under 23 U.S.C. 105. Funds could be used only \nfor projects or activities that have a safety benefit. By January 1, \n2009 the Secretary of Transportation is to report on progress under the \nprovision and whether any modifications are recommended.\n  This bill takes a different approach to the issue of aggressive \ndriving. Rather than sanctioning drivers who display aggressive \nbehavior, this section seeks to lessen that negative behavior by \nremoving some of the frustration that causes that behavior.\n  This section applies to all Federal interstates. It names the left \nlane as the ``National Passing Lane.'' It requires all vehicles to use \nthe left lane for passing only. It further requires that all drivers \nallow other vehicles to pass them in the left lane. I believe that one \nof the big frustrations of drivers in this country is being held up by \nsomeone going slow in the left lane. It contributes to driver \naggression and to congestion. The MEGA Safe Act seeks to alleviate \nthat.\n  An amount of no less than $1 million will be given to each State each \nyear of the bill, 6 years, to educate the driving public about this new \nlaw and the proper behavior.\n  Each State will decide how to best enforce this law, for example, \nenforcement of ticketable offenses such as if a driver does not allow \nanother to pass or the driver is holding up the left lane with a line \nof cars behind him.\n  Additionally, the bill funds a study to make recommendations on \ninstituting measures that will help the federal government and states \nteach motorists and truck drivers how to effectively share the road \nwith each other.\n  Recently the American Automobile Association, AAA, unveiled a study \nthat shows that the majority of highway crashes that involved trucks \nare caused by the car or cars involved.\n  MEGA Safe would give $1 million to the American Trucking \nAssociations, ATA, and AAA to issue a report making recommendations on \nhow the Federal and State governments can better teach car drivers and \nmore carriers how to share the road.\n  It requires a preliminary report in a year and the final report a \nyear later.\n  Finally, the MEGA Safe Act would address Work Zone Safety by ensuring \nthat, for each project that uses Federal funds, a trained and certified \nperson would be given the responsibility for assuring that the traffic \ncontrol plan is effectively administered. This would help reduce the \nnumber of deaths occurring in work zone safety areas.\n  The MEGA Safe Act is by no means a comprehensive safety proposal, but \nI believe that these ideas are a good foundation for our safety \npolicies as we embark on the Reauthorization of TEA 21.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 3012. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom income and employment taxes and wage withholding property tax \nrebates and other benefits provided to volunteer firefighters and \nemergency medical responders; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today with my colleague \nSenator Lieberman to introduce legislation that would amend the \nInternal Revenue Code to exclude property tax abatements, provided by \nlocal governments to volunteer firefighters and emergency medical \nresponders, from the definition of income and wages. Last week, \nCongressman John Larson of Connecticut, the chief author of this \nproposal, introduced identical legislation in the House.\n  This bill would allow local governments around the country the \nopportunity to provide incentives, such as property tax abatements, to \ntheir volunteer firefighters and emergency medical responders. These \nincentives will help local governments recruit local volunteer \nfirefighters and emergency medical responders in order to ensure their \ncommunities are adequately prepared to respond to emergencies.\n  Police officers, firefighters, and emergency service workers are \nAmerica's front-line defenders in the face of fires, medical \nemergencies, terrorist threats, incidents with hazardous materials and \nother emergencies. Many of them are salaried employees of their \nrespective State or local government. Many of them are volunteers, as \nwell. Many States and localities lack adequate resources to recruit \nthese vital public servants and therefore to fully respond to the full \nrange of possible threats this country faces.\n  Many small towns cannot afford full-time paid firefighters, therefore \na majority of municipalities and counties throughout the country depend \non volunteer firefighters and volunteer emergency service workers to \ncover their front lines. Every day, volunteers throughout the country \nmake a commitment, on top of their work schedules, to put their lives \non the line for their communities. Volunteer firefighters comprise 75 \npercent of firefighters in our country. Unfortunately, statistics show \nthat the number of volunteer firefighters and emergency responders have \nbeen declining over the years at an alarming rate. The number of \nvolunteer firefighters around the country has declined by 5 to 10 \npercent since 1983, while the number of emergency calls made has \nsharply increased.\n  Many local governments recruit and retain volunteer firefighters and \nemergency service workers by offering volunteers a property tax \nabatement that directly reduces their property taxes. For example, \nConnecticut enacted a law in 1999 allowing municipalities to offer \nabatements of up to $1,000 per year on local taxes to firefighters, \nemergency medical technicians, paramedics or ambulance drivers. This \nabatement has helped local fire department in their volunteer \nrecruitment efforts throughout the state.\n  Despite these successful recruitment efforts, the IRS recently ruled \nthat property tax abatements to volunteers should be treated as wages \nand income. This ruling would pose real hardship on firefighters and \nthe communities where they live and work, in Connecticut and in many \nother States, as well. While State and local governments are working to \nincrease incentives to volunteer, this ruling would undermine those \nefforts. Some may argue that volunteering for the community should be \nwithout any compensation, including abatements. However, the reality is \nthat when both heads of household hold full-time employment, it is \noften too difficult for them to take time away from their families \nwithout some form of compensation. A $1,000 property tax break is not a \nlarge request for the great service these men and women provide to our \ncommunities. These men and women risk their lives for others. The least \nwe can do is allow states and towns to offer them modest incentives to \nserve. For some, counting this abatement as income may put them in a \nhigher tax bracket, therefore forcing them to pay substantially more in \ntaxes. Also, because of the extra paperwork required and costs due to \nthe IRS decision, some municipalities are having to reconsider \nproviding abatement programs. For many towns and municipalities it \nwould be entirely too expensive to have to both pay FICA taxes,\n\n[[Page S9432]]\n\nand lose property tax revenues. Municipalities across the nation have \nenough trouble recruiting volunteer firefighters and emergency medical \npersonnel without also having to face obstacles from the IRS.\n  This ruling undermines the good intentions and creative efforts of \nmany localities. If our municipalities are willing to forgo their local \ntax revenues in order to ensure they have enough volunteer firefighters \nand emergency service providers to protect their communities, and if \nmembers of the community are doing their part by volunteering, then we, \nthe Federal government, should do our part and support local efforts to \nensure that all our communities have adequate protection.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation \nso that we can ensure that state and local governments have the \nflexibility to design and implement recruiting and retention programs \nthat benefit not only the volunteer firefighters and emergency medical \nproviders, but also the communities they protect.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 3013. A bill to amend the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to extend \nand modify the reimbursement of State and local funds expended for \nemergency health services furnished to undocumented aliens; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to once again join my good \nfriend from Arizona, Senator Kyl, in introducing a bill to address a \ncritical issue affecting our State, and other border States. Today we \nare introducing the Local Emergency Health Services Reimbursement Act \nof 2002 in order to provide appropriate Federal reimbursement to States \nand localities whose budgets are disproportionately affected by the \nemergency health costs associated with illegal immigration.\n  Arizona and other border States now face a medical and financial \ncrisis. A report released today by the U.S./Mexico Border Counties \nCoalition found that our Nation's border hospitals spent close to $190 \nmillion in 2000 to provide health care to illegal immigrants--$31 \nmillion of which was spent by hospitals in Arizona alone. Clearly, the \nstaggering cost of providing medical care to illegal immigrants further \nburdens an already challenged medical system.\n  The Federal Government maintains the sole authority to control \nimmigration in this country. Despite that fact, the Federal Government \noften fails to take financial responsibility for the costs associated \nwith immigration. Much of the financial burden has shifted to State and \nlocal governments.\n  Compounding the problem, Federal law requires hospital emergency \nrooms to accept and treat all patients in need of medical care, \nregardless of immigration status. Unfortunately, this mandate does not \nensure that these hospitals receive adequate compensation for the care \nthey provide. Recently, this growing problem in the Southwest has been \nexacerbated by the increasingly desperate measures taken by \nundocumented aliens to cross our border with Mexico.\n  The Local Emergency Health Services Reimbursement Act of 2002 would \nmodify and extend federal funding to the States, local governments, and \nhealth care providers for medical costs that arise from the \nuncompensated treatment of illegal immigrants. Such funding previously \nflowed to all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and several U.S. \nterritories. In fiscal year 2000 alone, approximately 360 local \njurisdictions across the United States applied for these Federal \nmonies. However these funds expired in 2001, and States and local \ngovernments are now suffering as a result.\n  I have long worked to bolster enforcement against illegal immigration \nalong our Southwest border, and I will continue to do so. However, I \nbelieve that States and local communities should not be left to foot \nthe bill for what is a Federal responsibility. Although our bill gives \nspecial consideration to States with unusually high concentrations of \nillegal aliens and States with high concentrations of apprehended \nundocumented aliens, it would benefit communities across the Nation. As \nmy colleagues know, illegal immigrants who successfully transit our \nSouthwest border rapidly disperse throughout the United States. \nAlthough this situation is most critical in our border regions, if left \nunaddressed, it will surely become a national emergency. I hope the \nSenate will act expeditiously on this important legislation to \nalleviate those pressures by compensating State and local governments \nand health care providers for the costs they incur as unwitting hosts \nto undocumented aliens.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3013\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

However, \n     if the statute, regulation, or other action has vested the \n     functions in the agency from which it is removed under the \n     reorganization plan, the function, insofar as it is to be \n     exercised after the plan becomes effective, shall be deemed \n     as vested in the agency under which the function is placed in \n     the plan.\n       (2) Pending legal proceedings.--A suit, action, or other \n     proceeding lawfully commenced by or against the head of an \n     agency or other officer of the United States, in his official \n     capacity or in relation to the discharge of his official \n     duties, does not abate by reason of the taking effect of a \n     reorganization plan under this section.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of computers and the Internet is rapidly \n     transforming societal interactions and the relationships \n     among citizens, private businesses, and the Government.\n       (2) The Federal Government has had uneven success in \n     applying advances in information technology to enhance \n     governmental functions and services, achieve more efficient \n     performance, increase access to Government information, and \n     increase citizen participation in Government.\n       (3) Most Internet-based services of the Federal Government \n     are developed and presented separately, according to the \n     jurisdictional boundaries of an individual department or \n     agency, rather than being integrated cooperatively according \n     to function or topic.\n       (4) Internet-based Government services involving \n     interagency cooperation are especially difficult to develop \n     and promote, in part because of a lack of sufficient funding \n     mechanisms to support such interagency cooperation.\n       (5) Electronic Government has its impact through improved \n     Government performance and outcomes within and across \n     agencies.\n       (6) Electronic Government is a critical element in the \n     management of Government, to be implemented as part of a \n     management framework that also addresses finance, \n     procurement, human capital, and other challenges to improve \n     the performance of Government.\n       (7) To take full advantage of the improved Government \n     performance that can be achieved through the use of Internet-\n     based technology requires strong leadership, better \n     organization, improved interagency collaboration, and more \n     focused oversight of agency compliance with statutes related \n     to information resource management.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this division are the \n     following:\n       (1) To provide effective leadership of Federal Government \n     efforts to develop and promote electronic Government services \n     and processes by establishing an Administrator of a new \n     Office of Electronic Government within the Office of \n     Management and Budget.\n       (2) To promote use of the Internet and other information \n     technologies to provide increased opportunities for citizen \n     participation in Government.\n       (3) To promote interagency collaboration in providing \n     electronic Government services, where this collaboration \n     would improve the service to citizens by integrating related \n     functions, and in the use of internal electronic Government \n     processes, where this collaboration would improve the \n     efficiency and effectiveness of the processes.\n       (4) To improve the ability of the Government to achieve \n     agency missions and program performance goals.\n       (5) To promote the use of the Internet and emerging \n     technologies within and across Government agencies to provide \n     citizen-centric Government information and services.\n       (6) To reduce costs and burdens for businesses and other \n     Government entities.\n       (7) To promote better informed decisionmaking by policy \n     makers.\n       (8) To promote access to high quality Government \n     information and services across multiple channels.\n       (9) To make the Federal Government more transparent and \n     accountable.\n       (10) To transform agency operations by utilizing, where \n     appropriate, best practices from public and private sector \n     organizations.\n       (11) To provide enhanced access to Government information \n     and services in a manner consistent with laws regarding \n     protection of personal privacy, national security, records \n     retention, access for persons with disabilities, and other \n     relevant laws.\n\n   TITLE XXXI--OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT \n                                SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 3101.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of computers and the Internet is rapidly \n     transforming societal interactions and the relationships \n     among citizens, private businesses, and the Government.\n       (2) The Federal Government has had uneven success in \n     applying advances in information technology to enhance \n     governmental functions and services, achieve more efficient \n     performance, increase access to Government information, and \n     increase citizen participation in Government.\n       (3) Most Internet-based services of the Federal Government \n     are developed and presented separately, according to the \n     jurisdictional boundaries of an individual department or \n     agency, rather than being integrated cooperatively according \n     to function or topic.\n       (4) Internet-based Government services involving \n     interagency cooperation are especially difficult to develop \n     and promote, in part because of a lack of sufficient funding \n     mechanisms to support such interagency cooperation.\n       (5) Electronic Government has its impact through improved \n     Government performance and outcomes within and across \n     agencies.\n       (6) Electronic Government is a critical element in the \n     management of Government, to be implemented as part of a \n     management framework that also addresses finance, \n     procurement, human capital, and other challenges to improve \n     the performance of Government.\n       (7) To take full advantage of the improved Government \n     performance that can be achieved through the use of Internet-\n     based technology requires strong leadership, better \n     organization, improved interagency collaboration, and more \n     focused oversight of agency compliance with statutes related \n     to information resource management.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this division are the \n     following:\n       (1) To provide effective leadership of Federal Government \n     efforts to develop and promote electronic Government services \n     and processes by establishing an Administrator of a new \n     Office of Electronic Government within the Office of \n     Management and Budget.\n       (2) To promote use of the Internet and other information \n     technologies to provide increased opportunities for citizen \n     participation in Government.\n       (3) To promote interagency collaboration in providing \n     electronic Government services, where this collaboration \n     would improve the service to citizens by integrating related \n     functions, and in the use of internal electronic Government \n     processes, where this collaboration would improve the \n     efficiency and effectiveness of the processes.\n       (4) To improve the ability of the Government to achieve \n     agency missions and program performance goals.\n       (5) To promote the use of the Internet and emerging \n     technologies within and across Government agencies to provide \n     citizen-centric Government information and services.\n       (6) To reduce costs and burdens for businesses and other \n     Government entities.\n       (7) To promote better informed decisionmaking by policy \n     makers.\n       (8) To promote access to high quality Government \n     information and services across multiple channels.\n       (9) To make the Federal Government more transparent and \n     accountable.\n       (10) To transform agency operations by utilizing, where \n     appropriate, best practices from public and private sector \n     organizations.\n       (11) To provide enhanced access to Government information \n     and services in a manner consistent with laws regarding \n     protection of personal privacy, national security, records \n     retention, access for persons with disabilities, and other \n     relevant laws.\n\n   TITLE XXXI--OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT \n                                SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 3101.

NATIONAL DEFENSE RAIL CONNECTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) A comprehensive rail transportation network is a key \n     element of an integrated transportation system for the North \n     American continent, and federal leadership is required to \n     address the needs of a reliable, safe, and secure rail \n     network, and to connect all areas of the United States for \n     national defense and economic development, as previously done \n     for the interstate highway system, the Federal aviation \n     network, and the transcontinental railroad;\n       (2) The creation and use of joint use corridors for rail \n     transportation, fiber optics, pipelines, and utilities are an \n     efficient and appropriate approach to optimizing the nation's \n     interconnectivity and national security;\n       (3) Government assistance and encouragement in the \n     development of the transcontinental rail system successfully \n     led to the growth of economically strong and socially stable \n     communities throughout the western United States;\n       (4) Government assistance and encouragement in the \n     development of the Alaska Railroad between Seward, Alaska and \n     Fairbanks, Alaska successfully led to the growth of \n     economically strong and socially stable communities along the \n     route, which today provide homes for over 70% of Alaska's \n     total population;\n       (5) While Alaska and the remainder of the continental \n     United States has been connected by highway and air \n     transportation, no rail connection exists despite the fact \n     that Alaska is accessible by land routes and is a logical \n     destination for the North American rail system;\n       (6) Rail transportation in otherwise isolated areas is an \n     appropriate means of providing controlled access, reducing \n     overall impacts to environmentally sensitive areas over other \n     methods of land-based access;\n       (7) Because Congress originally authorized 1,000 miles of \n     rail line to be built in Alaska, and because the system today \n     covers only approximately half that distance, substantially \n     limiting its beneficial effect on the economy of Alaska and \n     the nation, it is appropriate to support the expansion of the \n     Alaska system to ensure the originally planned benefits are \n     achieved;\n       (8) Alaska has an abundance of natural resources, both \n     material and aesthetic, access to which would significantly \n     increase Alaska's contribution to the national economy;\n       (9) Alaska contains many key national defense \n     installations, including sites chosen for the construction of \n     the first phase of the National Missile Defense system, the \n     cost of which could be significantly reduced if rail \n     transportation were available for the movement of materials \n     necessary for construction and for the secure movement of \n     launch vehicles, fuel and other operational supplies;\n       (10) The 106th Congress recognized the potential benefits \n     of establishing a rail connection to Alaska by enacting \n     legislation to authorize a U.S.--Canada bilateral commission \n     to study the feasibility of linking the rail system in Alaska \n     to the nearest appropriate point in Canada of the North \n     American rail network; and\n       (11) In support of pending bilateral activities between the \n     United States and Canada, it is appropriate for the United \n     States to undertake activities relating to elements within \n     the United States.\n       (b) Identification of National Defense Railroad-Utility \n     Corridor.--\n       (1) Within one year from the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Transportation, the State of Alaska and the \n     Alaska Railroad Corporation, shall identify a proposed \n     national defense railroad-utility corridor linking the \n     existing corridor of the Alaska Railroad to the vicinity of \n     the proposed National Missile Defense facilities at Fort \n     Greely, Alaska.

I thank my \ncolleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, ranking member Arlen \nSpecter, for his commitment to our Nation's veterans.\n  The Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2002 \ndirects the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase, as of December \n1, 2002, the rates of veterans' disability compensation, as well as \ncompensation for eligible dependents and surviving spouses.

President, as chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I urge the Senate to pass\n\n[[Page S9555]]\n\nS. 2237, the proposed ``Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2002,'' as \nmodified by a manager's amendment which I developed with the \ncommittee's ranking member, Senator Specter. I will describe the \nprovisions of the amendment in a moment.\n  The pending omnibus measure would touch many parts of veterans' \nlives, from increasing pensions for those who have earned the Medal of \nHonor to ensuring that veterans' appeals get more than a cursory \nreview. I thank Ranking Member Specter and his staff for their \nsignificant contributions to a bill I believe will substantially \nimprove the benefits provided to those who have served our Nation.\n  S. 2237 as reported, which I will refer to as the ``committee bill,'' \nimproves numerous veterans' benefits. I will highlight some of the \nprovisions of which I am most proud.\n  Congress last year authorized VA to offer special monthly \ncompensation to women who had lost one or both breasts, including \nthrough surgery, as a result of their military service. VA subsequently \nreleased regulations that limited eligibility for this benefit to women \nwho had suffered complete loss of all breast tissue through simple or \nradical mastectomy. Even if such a restriction does not influence \nmedical decisions, it fails to acknowledge that tissue-sparing \ntreatments still create physical, emotional, and financial challenges \nto returning to health. Section 101 of the Committee bill would extend \neligibility for benefits to women veterans who have experienced \nservice-connected loss of half or more of a breast's tissue.\n  The number of claims that veterans submit for hearing loss and \ntinnitus grows each year, and hearing disorders now account for two of \nthe most commonly claimed disabilities. In order to settle these \nclaims, VA staff must determine whether a veteran's hearing loss is as \nlikely to be linked to noise exposure during service as to other \ncauses, a tough decision made even harder by incomplete medical records \nand uncertain clinical evidence. Aging veterans--many of whom received \nno hearing evaluation upon discharge from service--now struggle to \nprove that their hearing problems resulted from damage suffered decades \nago, while VA battles a staggering backlog of claims. Not only must \nveterans with hearing loss wait for assistance, but all veterans must \naccept the delays that arise as VA sorts through an enormous number of \nhearing loss claims without a clear scientific standard on past \nexposures.\n  Section 103 of the committee bill would help VA and veterans \nunderstand whether service in certain military specialties might be \nassociated with an increased risk of hearing loss later in life. The \ncommittee bill would require VA to contract with an independent \nscientific organization, such as the National Academy of Sciences, to \nreview evidence on acoustic trauma during military service. Experts \nwould be asked to consider the types of noise exposure that could \ncontribute to hearing disorders, and to determine whether \nservicemembers' hearing loss would be immediate or cumulative. The \nscientists would also determine when the audiometric data collected by \nthe military services became adequate for VA to assess individual \nexposures during subsequent hearing loss claims.\n  The committee bill would also require that VA review its own records \non hearing loss or tinnitus in veterans, and estimate the cost of \nadjudicating these claims under the current system. With this \ninformation, Congress and VA should be in a better position to decide \nwhether evidence warrants service connection of hearing loss or \ntinnitus for certain veterans, so that their claims can be decided as \nquickly and fairly as possible.\n  We currently provide a special pension of recipients of the Medal of \nHonor to recognize, in some small measure, their extraordinary heroism. \nCongress has periodically increased this pension to keep pace with \ninflation and the needs of its recipients, but these increases have \nbeen irregular in amount and frequency. For some recipients, delays \nbetween the dates of the recipient's act of valor and the actual \nawarding of the Medal of Honor have resulted in lower aggregate amounts \nof special pension, based only on differences in the timing of the \nofficial recognition.\n  Section 104 of the committee bill would increase the Medal of Honor \nspecial pension from $600 to $1,000. Beginning next year, the pension \namount would be adjusted annually with inflation. Finally, it would \nprovide for a one-time, lump-sum payment in the amount of pension the \nrecipient would have received between the date of the act of valor and \nthe date that the recipient's pension actually commenced. I want to \nthank Senators Specter and Hutchinson for their leadership on this \nissue, and for assisting the committee in reaffirming our commitment to \nthese heroes.\n  Section 401 of the committee bill would extend certain protections \ncurrently offered to National Guard members called up for national \ndefense to include those who may have been called up for homeland \nsecurity activities but not federalized. The Soldiers and Sailor's \nCivil Relief Act of 1940, SSCRA, protects active duty servicemembers \nand their families from evictions, foreclosures, and certain legal \njudgements while they serve the Nation in federally funded national \ndefense missions. However, SSCRA protections do not cover National \nGuard members called up under title 32 of the United States Code, which \nplaces the servicemembers under the command of their State Governors.\n  Following the events of September 11, many National Guard members \nactivated under title 32 guarded commercial airports at the request of \nthe Federal Government, serving for 4 to 6 months. Although they served \na national mission, their title 32 status denied them \nSSCRA protections. Furthermore, the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2003, as passed by the Senate, specifically allows \nNational Guard members to be called up for full-time homeland security \nduty under title 32. Should this provision be enacted into law, it is \nlikely that National Guard members will be called upon more frequently \nto serve in this status.\n\n  Section 401 of the committee bill would expand SSCRA protections to \ninclude National Guard members serving full-time for homeland security \npurposes under title 32 upon an order of the Governor of a State, by \nrequest of the head of a Federal law enforcement agency, and with the \nconcurrence of the Secretary of Defense. As America relies increasingly \non the National Guard and reservists to support its all-volunteer \nforces, we must be sure that all of our servicemembers can focus on \ntheir duties when they leave home to serve their Nation.\n  Sections 501 and 502 of the committee bill would ensure that veterans \nreceive a full judicial review when appealing claims denied by VA.\n  A long-standing tenet of veterans law is that the veteran receives \nthe ``benefit of the doubt.'' This ``benefit of the doubt'' rule is \nunique in administrative law and states that when the evidence in \nsupport of benefits is in equipoise the benefit of the doubt must be \ngiven to the veteran, recognizing the tremendous sacrifices made by the \nmen and women who have serve in our Armed Forces. A number of veterans \nservice organizations have expressed concern that the current appellate \nprocess is overly deferential to VA findings of fact that are adverse \nto veteran claimants. Specifically, these groups argue that the \n``clearly erroneous'' standard applied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nVeterans Claims, CAVC, when reviewing Board of Veterans' Appeals, BVA, \ncases results in veteran claims receiving only cursory review on \nappeal, not allowing for full application of the ``benefit of the \ndoubt'' rule.\n  Section 501 of the committee bill would change the standard of review \nthe CAVC applies to BVA findings of fact from ``clearly erroneous'' to \n``unsupported by substantial evidence'' with an explicit reference to \nVA's application of the ``benefit of the doubt'' provision. This would \nclearly instruct the court to perform a searching review of BVA \nfindings of fact, yet allow the CAVC to give deference to BVA findings \nbased on specific evidence.\n  Section 502 of the committee bill would improve appellate review of \nveterans claims by expanding the Federal Circuit's authority to review \nCAVC decisions based on rules of law that are not derived from a \nspecific statute or regulation. This change would allow the Federal \ncircuit to review comprehensively any CAVC decisions of law that \nadversely affect appellants.\n\n[[Page S9556]]\n\n  Section 503 of the committee bill would allow nonattorney \npractitioners admitted to practice before the CAVC without the \nsignature of a supervising attorney, such as veterans service \norganization representatives, to be awarded fees under the Equal Access \nto Justice Act. Currently, attorneys and nonattorney practitioners \nsupervised by attorneys who represent claimants that satisfy certain \nstatutory requirements may receive compensation for their services \npursuant to the EAJA. This would allow well-deserved compensation to \norganizations that provide invaluable assistance to veterans.\n  The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000, VCAA, required VA to take \nvery specific steps to help veterans prepare their benefits claims, \nsuch as informing claimants of medical or lay evidence or helping them \nobtain evidence necessary to substantiate a claim. The Federal circuit, \nin two recent decisions--Dyment v. Principi and Bernklau v. Principi--\nfound that certain provisions of the VCAA pertaining to VA's duty to \nassist cannot be applied retroactively to claims pending at the time of \nenactment. Section 504 states explicitly that VA's duty to assist will \nbe applied retroactively to cases that were ongoing either at the \nvarious adjudication levels within VA or pending at the applicable \nFederal courts prior to the date of VCAA's enactment.\n  Section 504 of the committee bill would make it clear that VA's duty \nto assist can be applied retroactively to cases that were either \nongoing within VA or pending at the applicable Federal courts prior to \nthe date of VCAA's enactment. This clarification would give full force \nto the congressionally mandated duty to assist claimant veterans, and \nprovide crucial assistance to the men and women who sacrified so much \nin service to our Nation.\n  I now turn to the manager's amendment, which would modify a section \nof the committee bill on evaluating service-connected hearing loss.\n  Section 102 of the committee bill, as modified by the manager's \namendment, would address an issue of fairness for veterans who have \nboth service-connected and non-service-connected hearing loss. \nCurrently, when evaluating veterans' service-connected disabilities in \npaired organs or extremities--such as kidneys, lungs, feet, or hands--\nVA is authorized to consider any degree of damage to both organs, even \nif only one resulted from military service. However, total deafness in \nboth ears is required for special consideration of hearing loss.\n  The committee bill would eliminate the ``total deafness'' \nrequirement, allowing VA to consider partial non-service-connected \nhearing loss in one ear when rating disability for vetearns with at \nleast 10 percent compensable service-connected hearing loss in the \nother ear. This change would mirror exceptions made for other \n``paired'' organs and extremities and would help ensure fair \ncompensation for veterans whose hearing has been more greatly impaired \nby service than it would have been had they not served.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support these improvements to \nveterans benefits. In light of our increased military commitments--\nabroad and on American soil--this represents a critical bipartisan \ncommitment to our Nation's Veterans.\n  The committee amendment, in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The amendment to the title was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2237), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n                                S. 2237\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
