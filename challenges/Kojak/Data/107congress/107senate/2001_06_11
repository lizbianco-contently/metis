Mr. President, I am grateful for the \nopportunity to address a couple of topics that have been in my heart.\n  I had the privilege of being here Friday afternoon to hear Senator \nByrd\n\n[[Page S6020]]\n\nexplain the legislation he was offering to try to get our arms around \nthe problem of global warming. It was in Senator Byrd's presentation to \nthe Senate that he shared with us that a vast majority of the \nscientific community in fact has recognized that the Earth's \ntemperature is warming and that, indeed, man is contributing to that \nwarming through the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere, \nthus causing a greenhouse effect.\n  I was so moved by Senator Byrd's presentation, after which he then \nintroduced the legislation, in light of the fact that this present \nadministration had set aside the Kyoto accords and is going about in \nits own way to try to address the problem.\n  Senator Byrd offered this legislation, sponsored by himself and \ncosponsored by Senator Stevens, as a means to try to accelerate and \nfocus world attention on this phenomenon; to use Senator Byrd's words, \nthat something out there in fact is happening.\n  I was moved to speak after Senator Byrd's presentation. What I shared \nwas an experience of looking at global warming from the perspective of \nmy past life as the elected insurance commissioner of Florida, \nrecognizing that it would have devastating effects upon a State such as \nFlorida with such an extensive coastline. The rise of the seas would \nhave an immediate effect upon most of our population which is along the \ncoast. The warming of the atmosphere would cause increased frequency \nand ferociousness of storms, particularly the storms that are a part of \nour life still in Florida known as hurricanes, and the rising \ntemperature for the tropical and subtropical climes would likewise have \nthe result of increasing pestilence and disease.\n  I was then moved to remember in my mind's eye the view I had out the \nwindow of the spacecraft Columbia on the 24th flight of the space \nshuttle, looking back at planet Earth, how beautiful it is and yet how \nfragile it looks. It is gorgeous. It is a blue and white ball suspended \nin the middle of nothing. Space is nothing. It is an airless vacuum \nthat goes on and on for billions and billions of light years. In the \nmidst of that void is this wonderful creation we call home, planet \nEarth.\n\n  I described to Senator Byrd Friday that on the first day, you are \nlooking at nation states. On the second day, you are looking at \ncontinents. On the third day, you are looking at the whole planet. That \nis the perspective you have. The first time you look out, you are \nlooking for home. You are looking for Florida, and then you are looking \nfor America. Then in a few days you are looking for home, and there it \nis, planet Earth, blue because of the oceans, white because of the \nclouds.\n  If you look at the land mass, it is usually a dull brown except in \nparts where there are the contrasts of colors, such as the Horn of \nAfrica, the bright, almost orange-reddish sands of eastern Africa set \noff against the bright blue waters of the Indian Ocean.\n  I am saying all of this because I wanted to add to the comments I \nmade on Friday about global warming. I was struck with the beauty of \nthis creation, but I was also struck with how fragile it looked. I \ncould see how we are not being good stewards. I could see the \ndestruction of the rain forests, and then I could look to the east and \nsee the mouth of the Amazon. The waters of the Atlantic were discolored \nfor hundreds of miles with the silt that resulted from the destruction \nof the trees hundreds of miles upriver. I would look at the rim of the \nEarth, a bright blue band. But on closer inspection, you could see the \nthin film enveloping the Earth that sustains all of our life known as \nthe atmosphere.\n  I came away from that experience of 6 days in outer space with a \nprofound sense that I needed to be a better steward of what God has \ngiven us in this beautiful, colorful planet called Earth.\n  That is what I was moved to think of when Senator Byrd introduced his \nlegislation concerning global warming; that we better be serious and \nlisten to the scientific community, saying that things are changing, \nthat people in States such as mine along the coast of this country had \nbetter be wary of the immediate effects upon the consequences of global \nwarming, and that we should be better stewards of what we have been \ngiven by our creator, if, in fact, we are doing what we ought to do.\n  I have often let my imagination wander with regard to space travel. I \nfirmly believe that in my lifetime, certainly in the lifetime of a lot \nof our young friends, we will see an international mission from planet \nEarth to another planet, probably Mars. When we get there, are those \ndry river beds that we see in our telescopes? And if they are, what \nhappened to that water? And if we find, in fact, that there was water, \nthen there likely was life. And if there was life, to what degree did \nit develop; was it civilized? And if it was civilized, what happened? \nWhat can we learn so that we can be better stewards of our civilization \non planet Earth?\n  Senator Byrd, as he so eloquently expressed his concerns and interest \nand, therefore, the offering of the legislation to study the problem, \nwas most timely. The President is on his way to Europe tonight to \ndiscuss this issue with the many leaders of Europe, their concern that \nhe unilaterally disregarded the Kyoto accords. If we are not going to \nhave the Kyoto accords for the nations of the world to come together to \ndo something about the rise of the greenhouse effect on planet Earth, \nthen we better get together with some other kind of protocol quickly. \nSenator Byrd and Senator Stevens are offering that kind of leadership \nas a way. It is just one suggestion, but it is an important suggestion. \nIt is timely.\n  I took this moment to offer those thoughts and, again, to say my \nprofound appreciation to the great Senator from the State of West \nVirginia for what he has offered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. NELSON of Florida assumed the chair.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/11/senate-section/article/S6020-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6020-S6021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what has taken place in the Senate over the \npast few weeks, the change from a Republican majority to a Democrat \nmajority, is really not about which party is in charge or which party \nis the majority. I believe the history books will be written that it is \nabout the truly important issues to the citizens of Nevada, Florida, \nand citizens all over the country.\n  The education of our children, for example, is at the top of any \nlist. Three of my grandchildren are of school age. As I stand here \ntoday, Mattie, Savannah, and Ryan are in school--one of them here in a \nsuburb of Washington; two of them in Las Vegas. They are each sitting \nin their classrooms. They are so fortunate that they have great \nteachers. They have teachers who are dedicated to putting information \nin their heads and making them feel good about themselves.\n  As a grandfather, I want to do all I can to ensure that they receive \nthe best education possible and that my other seven grandchildren--and \nI have two additional ones on the way, so that is 12 grandchildren--\nwill also have the same opportunities and maybe even better \nopportunities than my three grandchildren who are in school today.\n  As a Senator representing the State of Nevada, I want to do \neverything I can as a Member of this national legislative body to make \nsure that not only my grandchildren but every child in America has an \nopportunity to be educated in the best way they can. We all have that \nobligation.\n  Millions of children across the country are, at this very moment, \nacquiring a foundation that will provide them with enormous \nopportunities. They are acquiring an education. There are also lots of \nchildren in America who are not being educated in the way they should \nbe educated.\n  Nevada is an interesting example. We have one school district, Clark \nCounty School District, where Las Vegas is.\n  It is the sixth largest school district in America and fast \napproaching the fifth largest. There are 240,000 children in that \nschool district. We have to build, to keep up with the growth, one new \nschool every month. This year, we will dedicate about 15 schools. We \nhold the record in America. One year, we dedicated 18 new schools. The \nsuperintendent of schools has said he is not a superintendent of \n``instruction,'' but a superintendent of ``construction.''\n  We need help in this very large school district. We need help. There \nare a number of ways we have tried to get aid to school districts for \nconstruction, not only to build new schools but to rehabilitate old \nschools.\n  The average school in the U.S. today is about 45 years old. We need \nto do\n\n[[Page S6021]]\n\nbetter in helping large school districts such as Las Vegas. Also, we \nhave schools in Nevada that are one-room schools. I went to school in a \ntwo-room school. There are schools in Nevada today that have one room, \nwith five or six students. They also have to be part of what we are \ntrying to do to improve education. Millions of children across the \ncountry may not realize it, but their parents and friends realize, and \nwe realize, that there is nothing more important in their lives than to \nbe educated.\n  So it is with fitting coincidence that the change in the leadership \nin the United States Senate occurs at the very time we are debating the \neducation bill. Whether you are a Republican, or a Democrat, or an \nIndependent, education is a nonpartisan issue. It should be a \nnonpartisan issue. If it is partisan, it is too bad. The education bill \nis an example of what Senators can accomplish when we work for the good \nof the country in a nonpartisan manner, joining together to ensure that \nevery student has a chance to succeed. This bill is a true example of a \nnonpartisan success story. We hope it ends successfully this week. It \nbegan as the President's bill, was honestly and openly debated under \nSenator Lott and the Republican majority, and now it will be completed \nunder the leadership of Senator Daschle and the Democratic majority.\n  We all have to work together. I work together with my Republican \ncolleague from Nevada, John Ensign, in a way that I hope will serve as \na model for the rest of this Chamber. In 1998, John Ensign and I were \ninvolved in a historically close race. I won by 428 votes. People \nthought that John Ensign--when Senator Bryan retired and he ran for the \nSenate--and I would be in a very bitter relationship here in the \nSenate. But we decided for our own well-being, for the well-being of \nthe State of Nevada, and for this country, that we should join together \nand show people that Democrats and Republicans from States evenly \ndivided as ours is--no matter how the State is divided--can work \ntogether to set an example. John and I don't have to vote alike on \neverything, but we can work together so that we have a harmonious \nrelationship. We are doing that. We are going to get better. We are \npretty good now, but we are going to get better.\n  We have sent the President the judges that John Ensign nominated, and \nI say ``we'' because I appreciate John Ensign submitting those names to \nme. He has agreed to give me 25 percent of the judges we get in Nevada. \nI told him that is one more than I deserve. I appreciate that. It is an \nact of generosity on his part and also an act that depicts our \nrelationship. So the mere fact that people have bitter battles on this \nfloor does not mean they can't work together tomorrow for the common \ngood.\n  So I believe that from the 240,000 students in Clark County to the \none-room schoolhouse in Nye County, all students deserve a quality \neducation. We need to work together to finish this bill in a \nnonpartisan way for the children of Nevada. If we get in here in the \nnext couple of days and there are difficult issues we have to resolve, \nwe have to understand that we can take these issue by issue.\n\n  The overall responsibility we have is to come up with a good \neducation bill. Now, I am personally disappointed that we are not going \nto have as much money as I think we should. We have to work with the \ntools we have, and we are going to do that. The education bill is \nlegislation about which each Member of this Chamber should leave \nfeeling good about. So it is my hope and that of Majority Leader \nDaschle that this legislation is the first of many written not by one \nparty, but by Republicans and Democrats.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed using \nas much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/11/senate-section/article/S6021-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6021-S6022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, later this afternoon we will turn to the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  I wish to take just a couple of minutes to talk about a couple of \namendments to the education bill that I have offered with colleagues. \nThese amendments have not yet been voted on but I expect both will be \napproved.\n  Education is very important. I am pleased it appears we will now \nfinish this bill. This Congress has a responsibility to address the \nissue of education in a thoughtful way. We understand there are plenty \nof challenges in our educational system. We have schools that don't do \nas well as we would like. At the same time, I want to be sure to say \nthere are a lot of wonderful schools in this country and a lot of great \nteachers who are educating our children.\n  More Americans have completed a high school education today than at \nany other time in history. At a time when we talk about the \ndeficiencies in education, 84 percent of the American people are now \ncompleting a high school education. In France, only 52 percent of \nadults have a high school education. In the United Kingdom, 68 percent. \nIn Japan, 70 percent.\n  With respect to virtually every aspect of life in this country, one \ncan take something and hold it to a light and say, isn't this ugly, and \none can find a perfection that is ugly. But generally with respect to \neducation, I ask this question: If public education in this country has \nnot worked, how is it we have reached this position in our lives? The \nUnited States has done so much for so many over so long a period of \ntime. The progress that has been made is remarkable.\n  I came to the Congress many years ago to initially serve in the House \nof Representatives. I have told my colleagues a story about going into \nthe office of the oldest Member of the House at the time named Claude \nPepper, a great public servant. He was then in his eighties, and his \noffice was virtually a museum of posters and photographs. Two pictures \nin particular that were hanging behind his desk in his office stuck out \nto me. One was a picture of Orville and Wilbur Wright making the first \nairplane flight. It was autographed to Congressman Claude Pepper by \nOrville Wright before he died. It was autographed to Claude Pepper: \nWith deep admiration, signed Orville Wright. Beneath that picture was a \npicture of Neil Armstrong stepping on the Moon, and it was autographed \nby Neil Armstrong to Congressman Claude Pepper.\n  I was struck by that. Here are two pictures: Of the first Americans \nto fly and then the first American to fly to the Moon. I thought about \nthe relatively short timeframe that is represented by those pictures. \nWhat a breathtaking advance in technology and learning that allowed us \nto build aircraft that not only left the ground in airplanes that were \nprimitive, but also flew all the way to the Moon for a lunar landing.\n  What is that about? It is about education. We achieved these \nadvancements in America's classrooms. Those young scientists and \nengineers and mathematicians, the young talents all across this \ncountry, starting 1st grade someplace, went through high school, and \nwent to college. They created progress in so many areas. Yes, in space, \nbut also in medicine and so many areas this country has progressed.\n\n  Education is critically important. I wanted to say it at the front \nend. Those who somehow criticize our public educational system as a \nsystem that has failed America, in my judgment, are dreadfully wrong. \nThis public system of education has empowered every young child in this \ncountry to be the best he or she can be. We have challenges, no doubt \nabout it, and we should deal with those challenges.\n  I propose a couple of things to deal with some challenges. I propose \nwe have school report cards. Every young person in school occasionally \ncomes home with a report card; that child's school and the teachers \nevaluate how students are doing and they grade them and give them a \nreport card. Parents and taxpayers get no such report card that \nevaluates how the school is doing. What is their tax money buying? What \nis the level of achievement of that school? What kind of progress are \nthose students making? How effective is this school at promoting \nlearning among its students?\n  My proposal is to give parents a school report card that provides the \nopportunity to understand how a school is doing versus a neighboring \nschool, how a school in this county is doing\n\n[[Page S6022]]\n\nversus schools in another county, or how schools in this State compare \nto those in another State, so parents and taxpayers can hold a school \naccountable.\n  We need a school report card that is reasonably standardized across \nthe country. Thirty-seven States have created school report cards, but \nthere content varies widely and most parents have never ever seen one. \nI think we ought to be about the business of asking for report cards on \nthe progress of our schools. I understand the report card language has \nbeen included as part of the underlying Manager's amendment, and I \nthink that provision will represent some progress.\n  The second amendment I offer with my colleague, Senator Enzi from \nWyoming, who will be here later today, is an amendment that talks about \nestablishing technology academies in the public school system. I am not \ntalking about setting up separate buildings. I am talking about \nproviding some assistance to allow public schools that want to offer an \nin-depth curriculum in technology to do so. Those young students who \nare adept at technology and want to pursue technology-related careers \ncan, through a technology academy curriculum, come out of that school \nsystem with a much stronger background and be able to fill some of the \njobs that go wanting in this country.\n  Last year we had a debate about increasing the number of H-1B visas \nto meet our country's need for technology workers. Why do we need \npeople coming into this country from other countries to perform that \nwork? Because our schools are not producing the right kind of trained \nindividuals in sufficient quantity to eliminate the need for the H-1B \nvisas. So I supported those new visas. But it seems to me a smart thing \nfor us to do is to strengthen the depth and breadth of the technology \ncurriculum in those schools that want to do that. That allows those \nstudents who want to go into a technology job to be prepared for the \nfuture.\n  Technology, obviously, is very important. The increase in information \ntechnology and telecommunications, the breathtaking advances in those \nfields, are quite remarkable. I come from a State that is a rural \nState. In the past, we have always been far from markets and therefore \ndisadvantaged. But with information technology, with one click of a \nmouse, North Dakota is as close to the Hudson River as Manhattan. \nDistance is dead.\n  If distance is dead, opportunity is born, especially if you come from \na rural State. And if that is the case, then let us develop technology \nacademies through the incentive I would provide in this amendment with \nmy colleague, Senator Enzi, to allow public schools to strengthen their \ncurriculum in technology. Those students who want to move in that \ndirection and fill those jobs that are now going unfilled ought to have \nthat opportunity by coming out of our school system much better \nprepared to do so.\n  Those are two amendments I will be offering. My understanding is the \nfirst will be accepted as part of the underlying Manager's amendment, \nand the second will be adopted by a voice vote. I appreciate that. I \nthink both of them will improve this bill.\n  Let me also say my colleague, Senator Enzi, will, I believe, come to \nthe floor to speak about the technology academy amendment at some later \npoint in the debate.\n  Finally, let me say this. Thomas Jefferson, in a famous quote, said \nabout education:\n\n       Those who believe that a country can be both ignorant and \n     free believe in that which never was and never can be.\n\n  Education is critical to the success of this country and its future. \nEducation is just critical. It is the root of virtually everything \nelse, the seedbed for progress in every other area. If we talk about \ndefense, talk about social progress--everything we talk about has its \nroots in education. The issue of education is not complex. Education \nworks when you have three elements: A teacher who understands how to \nteach, a student who wants to learn, and a parent involved in that \nstudent's education. When all those are present, education works, and \nworks very well.\n  When it works well and where it works well, which is in many school \ndistricts across our country, I am enormously proud of what we are \ndoing. I have sat in schoolrooms with dirt floors in the country of \nHaiti, for example, where a very small percentage of the children are \ngetting educated in a very primitive way. I have sat in schoolrooms \nacross the world in other countries, and wondered why these children \nwill not have the opportunity they should have.\n  But I have also visited many classrooms in our country, and I would \nsay from those experiences that I am enormously proud of what we have \ndone. I am proud this country is the country that says every young \nchild, regardless of origin, regardless of parentage, regardless of how \nmuch money they might have, is going to have an opportunity to be \neverything he or she can be. That is the way our school system works. \nThat is not true in some other countries. Some countries pare the \nchildren down very quickly and send them down different routes and \ndifferent paths, saying to some, you are not eligible to be on the path \ngoing towards college, you are going to go somewhere else. That is not \nthe way we do things in our country. In our country, every young child \nsees that flame of opportunity that beckons: You can do it.\n\n  I spoke at a college commencement ceremony this weekend with hundreds \nand hundreds of graduates. I looked out at those graduates who came \nfrom every corner, every conceivable background. Every single one who \nwas announced was accompanied by a hoot, a howl, a hurrah, and a yeah \nfrom the audience because those families understood this is a big day \nand big achievement. So, too, is education success for our country. \nThat is why I am pleased we are going to finish this bill and very \npleased the two amendments I have offered will be included.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes to \nspeak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, we are in morning \nbusiness until 2:30, so if he needs a few minutes after 2:30?\n  Mr. ALLARD. No, I just need 2 minutes now. I thought I might be \nencroaching on time set aside for the Democrats.\n  Mr. REID. You have, on your own, 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Colorado \nAvalanche for bringing the Stanley Cup back to Colorado. With a 3-1 \nvictory in game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals on Saturday night over the \ndefending world champion New Jersey Devils, the Colorado Avalanche are \nchampions once again. The Avalanche won their first cup in 1996 after \narriving in Denver from Quebec.\n  The tough game seven victory capped an incredible season for the \nAvalanche. They won the President's Trophy which is awarded to the team \nwith the most points at the end of the regular season. Captain Joe \nSakic lead the way by having an MVP type season with 118 points and 54 \ngoals. He scored another 13 goals in the playoffs to lead everyone in \nthat catagory. With 52 wins in the regular season and securing home ice \nthroughout the playoffs, the Avalanche started their long march towards \nthe cup.\n  After a first-round sweep of the Vancouver Canucks, the Avs faced the \nLos Angeles Kings which proved to be their toughest task aside from the \nfinals. It took a 5-1 victory in game 7 of the Western Conference semi-\nfinals to get to the Conference finals against the St. Louis Blues. \nWith the scare of losing to Los Angeles behind them, the Avalanche came \ntogether in the Conference Finals and rolled over the St. Louis Blues \nin five games. The next hurdle would prove to be their toughest. The \nColorado Avalanche had to face the defending champion New Jersey Devils \nto whom they had lost twice in the regular season.\n  Head Coach Bob Hartley had his Avalanche hitting on all cylinders in \nthe first game of the Stanley Cup Finals and defeated the Devils 5-0. \nThat would\n\n[[Page S6023]]\n\nprove to be the only easy win in the entire series. The defending \nchampion Devils defended their title well and the series was back and \nfourth the rest of the way until the game 7 win two weeks later. With \nConn Smythe trophy winner Patrick Roy leading the way the Avs have \nbrought the Stanley Cup back to the Rocky Mountains.\n  Roy, who won the Conn Smythe trophy, which is awarded to the most \nvaluable player in the playoffs, is no stranger to awards. Roy won his \nfirst playoff MVP award 15 years ago, for the Montreal Canadiens. He \nbecame the first three-time winner of the award, and holds not only the \nall-time regular-season wins record, but his 212 playoff wins are tops \nas well. The great play of Roy and Sakic should not overshadow the play \nof the rest of the team, players like Alex Tanguay who scored the game \nwinning goal on Saturday and Chris Drury who had the game winner of \ngame 6 in New Jersey. Milan Hejduk had a great year and had 23 points \nin the playoffs, second only to Sakic. Rob Blake and Adam Foote did a \ntremendous job during the Avs quest for the cup as well. Up and down \nthe roster for the Avalanche from Stephan Yelle to Eric Messier \ncontributions were evident.\n  The team really came together when superstar Peter Forsberg had \nemergency surgery to remove a ruptured spleen after the game 7 victory \nover the Los Angeles Kings. Forsberg, who is considered by many to be \nthe best all around player in the National Hockey League, had 14 points \nin 11 games before being sidelined for the Conference Finals and the \nStanley Cup Finals. With Forsberg out, the team really stuck together \nand put forth quite an effort. The effort displayed on the ice was most \nevident by one player who waited 22 years to win a Stanley Cup.\n  Ray Bourque came to Colorado last year after playing his entire 20 \nyear career in Boston for the Bruins in hopes of winning his first \nStanley Cup. The 40 year old is one of the best defenseman to ever lace \nup the skates and he has a spot waiting for him in the Hall of Fame. \nThe only thing eluding him during his illustrious career was Lord \nStanley's Cup. Saturday night, I along with the rest of the country saw \nwhat pure joy feels like when number 77 hoisted the Cup above his head. \nAfter 1,826 games Ray Bourque can finally call himself a World \nChampion.\n  I congratulate Ray Bourque and the entire World Champion Colorado \nAvalanche organization on a sensational year.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I recognize the members of the \nWorld Champion Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League and \ntheir outstanding Stanley Cup Finals victory this past weekend.\n  The Colorado Avalanche has proven the value of dedication, \npreparation and execution as they played through the regular hockey \nseason, becoming the 2000-01 Presidents' Trophy winner, which is \nawarded annually to the NHL club that compiles the league's best \nregular season record, into the playoffs and in the Stanley Cup finals. \nAs defenseman Ray Bourque declared in the playoffs this was Mission \n16W, 16 wins to win the championship.\n  Most folks know how great of a team the Avalanche proved to be in \nwinning its second cup in six seasons. In addition, the Colorado \nAvalanche players and the entire organization overcame injuries to key \nplayers and pulled together to win the championship. Their younger \nplayers, the next generation of all-stars for the Avalanche, also \ndeserve additional praise for their contributions when they had to step \nup and take leadership roles. Great teams are measured by sustained \nsuccess and the Colorado Avalanche has proven they are one of the \npremier teams in the NHL. For the second time since coming to Colorado \nin 1995, the Colorado Avalanche has won Lord Stanley's Cup. A total \nteam effort was exemplified by the Colorado Avalanche this season.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to recognize several members of the \nColorado Avalanche organization for their outstanding achievements \nduring this past season. Specifically, Owner E. Stanley Kroenke, \nPresident and General Manager Pierre Lacroix and Head Coach Bob Hartley \nfor their proven ability to assemble the necessary players and develop \npowerful lines that consistently provide victories for this franchise; \nCaptain Joe Sakic, one of the best team leaders in the game today and a \ntop scoring threat in the NHL; Goalie Patrick Roy, the anchor of the \ndefense and the first player to win the Conn Smythe Trophy three times, \nwhich is awarded to the most valuable player of the playoffs; and \ndefenseman Ray Bourque, whose 22 season quest for the cup is finally \nover.\n  These people are the most recognizable names in the Avalanche's \norganization and are major contributors to the team's success. But, the \ntotal team effort is what made the Avalanche victorious. The entire \nteam worked together, went after and achieved a common goal. Each team \nmember deserves to be recognized: Peter Forsberg, Dan Hinote, Steve \nReinprecht, Stephane Yelle, Chris Dingman, Chris Drury, Eric Messier, \nVille Nieminen, Alex Tanguay, Milan Hejduk, Scott Parker, Shjon Podein, \nDave Reid, Rob Blake, Greg de Vries, Adam Foote, Jon Klemm, Bryan Muir, \nNolan Pratt, Martin Skoula, David Aebischer, Jacques Cloutier, and \nBryan Trottier.\n  The Avalanche's defense also proved they are in an elite class. When \npush came to shove, the defense only allowed 11 goals in the seven NHL \nfinal games against the New Jersey Devils, a team that is consistently \none of the strongest teams in the league. Defense wins championships, \nand the Avalanche's defense proved this to be true.\n  It is a special honor for me to make this Senate floor statement to \nhonor the Colorado Avalanche. Today I invite my Senate colleagues to \njoin me in congratulating the Colorado Avalanche in bringing Lord \nStanley's Cup back to the Centennial State.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This \nafternoon, sometime after 5 o'clock, we will proceed to vote, as I \nunderstand it, on the Landrieu amendment, followed by the Bond \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield time as necessary to the Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 476\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the acting manager. I thank the \nChair.\n  I want to talk about an amendment that I introduced some time ago and \nwhich we will vote on later this afternoon. The amendment itself is not \nvery difficult and not very complex. It doesn't have a major change. \nBut it represents a watershed development in education. Parents for a \nlong time have marveled at how fast their children learn when they are \nvery young and how they pick up things--not just things off the floor \nbut how they learn language and how they learn many other things.\n  Research has verified what all of us have known instinctively for a \nlong time--that the first years of life are absolutely crucial in the \ndevelopment of a child's intelligence, habits, and the entire approach \nto life. The early years have a significant bearing on development and \nespecially on the learning of each child. Infant brain development \noccurs very rapidly. The sensations and experiences of this time go a \nvery long way towards shaping the baby's mind in a way that has a long-\nlasting impact on all aspects of the child's life.\n  You can think, if you have been a parent, or if you are parents, \nabout how fast they learn in the first 3 years. A baby learns to walk, \nto talk, and to interact with others.\n  As a matter of fact, an astounding figure I heard was that half a \nchild's mature intelligence is developed by 3 years of age. During \nthose first 3 years that a child learns, it absorbs so much that it is \nhalf of what he or she is going to know for the rest of their life.\n  The early months of growth, understanding, reasoning, and learning \ncan never be brought back or redone again. Once they are gone, they are \ngone. The early years of a child's development are not just rehearsal. \nThat is the whole show. That is the opening act. That sets the stage \nand the pace of their entire life's path.\n\n  Parents and families are key to the early development of a child. \nThrough the amendment that I offer today, we seek to focus on support \nof parents and family education for young children.\n  This amendment provides a clarification to title VI, part A of the \nsubstitute. It simply states that early childhood and early childhood \nparent education are eligible for funding and that early childhood \nmeans zero, or birth, to 5 years of age. The amendment is no new money, \nand it doesn't authorize any new program.\n  People think learning begins at kindergarten. By kindergarten \nchildren are halfway through their learning process in their entire \nlife. Who best to teach that child in the first 3 formative years than \nthe parents? We must focus on the early years of a child's life as well \nas on the years of formal schooling. We can emphasize and champion this \nearly involvement.\n  My amendment proposes to do just that by supporting successful early \nchildhood programs and initiatives that are working at local and State \nlevels throughout this country.\n  We spend so much time talking about how to improve our public \nschools, which we must do, and this bill attempts to do that. We talk \nabout improving school performance for students, reducing violence in \nschools, and all of that we must do. But I think we can reduce the \namount of time we spend trying to fix, repair, and cure these problems \nif we get the job done right at the first stage.\n  A key to this successful prevention is parental involvement at the \ntime most essential in the child's development. The organization, which \nin my State of Missouri has been doing an outstanding job--and it is \nbeing done nationwide--is something called Parents as Teachers. I will \nrefer to it as PAT.\n  It is an early childhood education program and family support program \ndesigned to empower all parents, regardless of their income levels, to \ngive their child the best possible start in life. PAT is now in all 50 \nStates and 6 foreign countries.\n  My involvement with Parents as Teachers began in 1979. Then \ncommissioner of elementary and secondary education, Arthur Mallory, who \nworked for me the previous term when I had been Governor, came to talk \nto me about a very interesting and challenging program they had begun \nbased on the work of some of the researchers and scholars who had \nlooked at the Head Start Program. He said they were finding out that \nwhat a parent does in those first 3 years was vitally important as they \nstimulate the child's learning intelligence. Curiosity is the basis of \nit. That was 1979.\n  I started talking about that and ran a successful campaign for \nGovernor in 1980. In 1981, our first son was born. You talk about an \nold dog trying to learn new tricks. I had just bought a new car, and \nthey gave me a manual about that thick of what to do with the new car. \nWe came home from the hospital with a new baby. They gave us a supply \nof diapers and told us to be sure to use a child's seat. I said that is \na little bit mistaken as to the emphasis we ought to put on preparing \nchildren and making sure that parents are ready for the challenge of \nraising a child.\n\n  We had, fortunately, access to many initiatives that had been \ndeveloped in this program, The program was not statewide at the time. \nIt was, in fact, in the initial stages. The scholars, including Dr. \nBurton White, had written several thoughtful books. We read those \nbooks. We learned from them what was supposed to be happening. The \ninteresting thing was it made it a lot easier for us to work with our \nson to understand what he was doing.\n  I recommended it to the Missouri General Assembly. They did not pass \nit in 1981. They didn't pass it in 1982. They did not pass it in 1983. \nBut being stubborn, I came back in 1984, and we pointed out to them \nthat this not only prepared the child for learning--my director of \ncorrections came before the committee giving testimony on the bill and \nsaid this was the most important thing we could do for the long-term \nfuture of our State: reduce the population of our corrections system by \ngetting parents involved and making sure that children were off to a \ngood learning start; making sure that parents were responsible for \ntheir children.\n  In 1982, I set up something called the Children's Trust Fund \nCommission to help reduce child abuse. We had 25 eminent children's \nleaders from the ministry, education, and health around the State who \nstudied how to prevent child abuse. They came back in 1984 with the \nunanimous recommendation to adopt Parents as Teachers to help the \nfamilies know how to deal with the challenges of raising a child.\n  I have always had a theory that if you have a toddler in your house, \nat some point if that toddler doesn't drive you absolutely nuts, \neither, A, the toddler is not normal, or, B, you are not normal. \nParents as Teachers can teach how you can constructively use that \ncuriosity, that enthusiasm, and that burgeoning intelligence and shift \nit in the right direction.\n  Fortunately, after a bit of cajoling, a little wheeling and dealing, \nand a few side deals that I will not mention here, the Missouri General \nAssembly adopted Parents as Teaches as the statewide program in 1984.\n  It has gone statewide. Each year it is a voluntary participation \nprogram, available in all 500-plus school districts in Missouri. And \n150,000 families, with 200,000 children, participate in the program.\n\n[[Page S6025]]\n\n  Now the program is working throughout the country. The State of \nTennessee has 20 program sites, Massachusetts has 7 program sites, \nNevada has 13 program sites, Mississippi has 32 program sites, South \nDakota has 20 Parents as Teachers Program sites; our neighbors in \nKansas have 222 program sites; Illinois has 132 program sites.\n  As I said, PAT is a voluntary participation program. It is tailored \nto empower parents to know how to deal constructively with their \nchildren. Sometimes it is included as part of Even Start, another title \n1 program. PAT and Head Start in Missouri have a great partnership to \nensure that all children get off to a great start.\n  Some said at the beginning, why, this is a good program for people on \nMedicaid or people on TANF, and other programs. And that is true. But \nit is a program that works for every family, the so-called \n``successful'' family, with two working parents--two professionals, \nworking full time, who never have enough time for their families. But \nwith this program they know how to use that time constructively.\n  As a father, I never looked forward to playing the typical father \nrole, which is where somebody says: If you don't behave, when your \nfather gets home, you're really going to get it. I did not intend to be \na father so I could be the one to bring out the hairbrush. There was a \npaddle when I got home. But Parents as Teachers taught me what I could \ndo constructively to help my child be more curious and begin the \nlearning process.\n  Studies and reports have shown that PAT children at age 3 are \nsignificantly more advanced than the comparison children in language, \nproblem solving, and social development. Often, through participation \nin PAT, learning problems or developmental delays or disabilities are \nidentified and treated early.\n  This is one of the great things. They have screening in the program, \nand they identify minor hearing defects which can, if not corrected, \nput a child behind as much as a year by the time that child reaches \nfirst grade.\n  I had an eyesight problem when I was little. It wasn't identified \nuntil I was in the sixth grade. It was too late to help it then. Each \nyear the program has been in effect, they have identified that eye \nproblem; they have been able to correct it because they identified it \nbefore the child reached 2 years of age.\n  Some people, when opposing Parents as Teachers, say it is subversive; \nthat the Government is trying to come in and take over the children. \nThe Government is not trying to come in and take over the children. But \nthere is a subversive element that I have learned; that is, once you \nteach a parent how to do a better job with the child's learning \nintelligence, you get that parent hooked on the child's education. A \nparent goes in thinking: Gee, this will help me control my child. The \nparent comes out being involved, supporting and participating in the \nchild's education. And most people will tell you that the most \nimportant thing a parent can do is to stay involved with the child's \neducation.\n  We all know we can have all the programs in the world and can provide \nall the funding possible, but one of the main ingredients on which we \nmust focus to assure a child's success in school is parental \ninvolvement.\n\n  Earlier this year I received a copy of a report from the Missouri \nDepartment of Elementary and Secondary Education. The report was \nentitled ``School Entry Assessment Project.'' Some of the findings \nreally piqued my interest.\n  The findings of the report are as follows:\n  No. 1, when Parents as Teachers is combined with any other \nprekindergarten experience for high-poverty children, the children \nscore above average on all scales when they enter kindergarten.\n  No. 2, the highest performing children participate in PAT and \npreschool or center care. Among children who participate in PAT and \nattend preschool, both minority and nonminority children score above \naverage. Children in both high-poverty and low-poverty schools who \nparticipate in PAT and attend preschool score above average when they \nenter kindergarten.\n  No. 3, among children whose care and education are solely home-based, \nthose whose families participate in PAT score significantly higher.\n  No. 4, special needs children who participate in PAT and preschool, \nin addition to an early childhood special education program, are rated \nby teachers as being similar in preparation to the average child.\n  Finally, Head Start children who also participate in PAT and other \npreschool activities score at average or above when they enter \nkindergarten.\n  These findings sum it all up. PAT works. PAT works for children \nraised in households of all income levels. PAT works for children who \nare homeschooled, children who have special needs.\n  My amendment, which I urge my colleagues to support, makes certain \nthat priority is given to programs such as PAT and other early \nchildhood and parent education programs.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thirteen seconds. I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nspeak in favor of the amendment for about 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Tennessee withhold?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Tennessee needs part of our time, he is \nwelcome to 8 minutes of it. Senator Kennedy has approved that.\n  Mr. FRIST. That will be fine. I will proceed under the time from the \nother side of the aisle, and we will be able to stay on schedule, I \nthink, for our next amendment that is coming up in about 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment put \nforward by the Senator from Missouri. I think it concentrates on two \nimportant areas, and both of them include involving parents in the \neducation of their children.\n  It really concentrates, at least to my mind, on two points. No. 1, \nnobody really cares more about a child than the parents of that child. \nWhen we talk about local control and big government, where decisions \nshould be made, and educational choice, I think the people who care the \nmost should be most involved in making the decisions and in \nparticipating in the child's education. That is what this amendment \ndoes. It shines that spotlight as local as you can go: on the child and \nparental involvement.\n\n  No. 2, the amendment, again, shines an important spotlight on the \nscience of education. Medical science in some ways reveals how people \nlearn: how children learn, how adults learn. As the Senator from \nMissouri has outlined so well, the early development of the brain, as \nwe have recently discovered, is an important factor in determining how \nwe learn in grades 1-3, grades 3-8, and, in truth, how we learn the \nrest of our lives.\n  So I think, very appropriately, the amendment points that spotlight \non those two things: No. 1, parents care the most about their child and \ntherefore should be involved, and, No. 2, it takes into account the \nfact that we know more about how people learn from a scientific \nphysiologic anatomic standpoint than we did before.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Missouri looks at an underlying \npart of the BEST bill, the bill that sits on each Member's desk. This \nbill already contains an important section on parental involvement. \nHowever, this amendment brings greater focus on parental involvement.\n  There are basically two changes. First of all, it does not involve \nnew money. It does not involve the authorization of a new program. It \naddresses title VI, part A, as the Senator said, for those people who \nwould like to actually look at the underlying bill. It says, funds \nprovided under this section can be used for early education and for \nencouraging greater parental involvement through the Parent's as \nTeachers Program or other early childhood parent education programs. \nThe Senator from Missouri is the father of the Parent's as Teachers \nProgram which has\n\n[[Page S6026]]\n\nbeen enacted in all 50 States; as he said, 20 such programs exist in \nTennessee; it has a proven track record.\n  A very important part of the amendment is the science of education. \nThough some regard this aspect as technical, I believe it is an \nimportant clarification. The language is changed so instead of simply \nstating that parents of preschool-aged children should be involved, the \nlanguage is changed to include parents of children from birth through \nthe age of 5.\n  This is important because, when referring to preschool-aged children, \nmost people and much of the literature which is written on this subject \nfocus on children who are 3 to 5 years of age. The Bond amendment \nextends the definition of preschool-aged to the birth of the child.\n  This is very important because we now know from recent scientific \nfindings the importance of early brain development through educational \nexperiences and involvement during the early years. I personally, as a \nphysician and scientist, appreciate that.\n  Further, the Bond amendment allows at least half of the funds \nprovided for part A to be used for the Parents as Teachers or other \nearly childhood parent education programs. The Parents as Teachers \nprogram is used in all 50 States and has a proven track record. Let's \nfocus on that program and invest in that program, but also recognize \nthat it alone isn't the answer. As we learn more, other programs will \ncome along. This amendment allows up to 50 percent of the money to be \nused in those other programs as well.\n  I applaud the Senator from Missouri for granting states flexibility \nin implementing these programs. We should not assume that we have all \nthe answers in the programs we have supported. Let's give State and \nlocal schools the flexibility they need to meet their individual needs.\n  To put it all in perspective, the Census Bureau in 1995 told us there \nwere 14.4 million children under the age of 5 who were in some kind of \nchild care arrangement program. Between 1991 and 1999, the percentage \nof 4-year-olds enrolled in some kind of pre-primary, either center-\nbased or kindergarten, education program increased from 60 percent up \nto 90 percent. For 3-year-olds, participation rates between 1991 and \n1999 were relatively unchanged. Clearly there is a lot of work to do.\n  At the same time--again, the Senator from Missouri spelled this out \nfor us--the data indicates that some children need more assistance to \nget ready to learn when they enter kindergarten than is presently being \nprovided today.\n  As we go forward and look at the whole education arena from the year \n2001 forward, we must be forward-thinking and focus on the problems of \nearly childhood education and development.\n  In closing, President Bush's Early Reading First Program, which \nintends to leave no child behind, focuses on this same concept. \nChildren must be taught pre-reading skills and pre-math skills during \nthe entire preschool period so they will be ready for reading and \nmathematics. Again, this is all centered on preparing people how to \nlearn.\n  The President's Early Reading First Program, now part of this bill, \nS. 1, permits States to receive funding to implement research-based \nreading programs in existing preschool programs and Head Start Programs \nthat feed into participating elementary schools.\n  I commend the Senator from Missouri for introducing this amendment. \nIt expands and improves our underlying early education programs. It \ntakes the initiative put forth on early learning by the President of \nthe United States and improves it.\n  The amendment itself is not a new program and will not require new \nfunds. It clarifies that early childhood and early childhood parent \neducation is important and needs to be emphasized even more in title \nVI, part A of this bill.\n  I look forward to supporting the amendment which will be voted on \nlater this afternoon, sometime after 5 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if my two friends will remain on the floor \nfor a unanimous consent request, I have checked with both managers of \nthe bill, Senator Kennedy and Senator Frist. We would like to reverse \nthe order of the votes this afternoon. The way the unanimous consent \nagreement is written, it provides for the Bond vote being second. We \nwould like to have the Bond vote first and Senator Landrieu second.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would be honored.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, are we going to try to do the vote at 5:15? \nAre we going to stick with that?\n  Mr. REID. Give or take a few minutes.\n  Mr. President, I make that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator from New Mexico will yield \nfor a unanimous consent request--not a unanimous consent--we just want \nto make sure that all the time on the Bond amendment has been yielded \nback. We had time remaining so it is now yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. REID. We yield that back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back. The Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Reid are located in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we will in a moment have an opportunity \nto listen to the Senator from Louisiana on a very important amendment, \nbut I want to add my voice of support for Senator Bond's amendment, the \nParents as Teachers Program, to the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct.\n  One of the things we have tried to do in this legislation is \nencourage efforts that are taking place locally that have demonstrated \nsuccess. Parents as Teachers has been an enormous success in my State \nof Massachusetts. I was not here when Senator Bond commented favorably \nabout the programs in Massachusetts. I am grateful for his recognition \nof those programs. I underline to my colleagues how valuable and \nimportant these programs are and what a difference they make to so many \nchildren in this country.\n  We have 20 programs in Massachusetts, as Senator Bond has mentioned, \nand they provide training and support to new mothers. We need to take \nadvantage of the potential for learning during a child's early years, \nwhether it is part of Head Start or a stand-alone program. This program \ngives families the support they need to help the children meet their \ntrue potential.\n  As we have seen in the most recent studies by the Academy of Sciences \nthis last year about a child's development in the very early years, \nthis is a time of enormous potential, encouraging development of the \nbrain and also character that will suit them in academic achievements.\n  The Carnegie Commission studies in this area are enormously powerful \nand persuasive, the basis of some of the work that has been done to \nencourage Congress to support the early learning programs which were \nadopted last year. We have seen the results in support of the Head \nStart Program. It only spends a small fraction of its money on this \nkind of support, but there have been very important results.\n  The Early Start Program, which is the first 3 years of Head Start, \nonly has about 10 or 12 percent of the total Head\n\n[[Page S6027]]\n\nStart Program funding. Again, it is very limited. Nonetheless, the \nbenefits that come from it are profound. This program is one I am \nhopeful can be replicated not only in my State but around the country \nbecause it has a very dramatic impact on the children and has a very \npositive impact on the parents as well. It well deserves our support \nand inclusion in the bill.\n  As has been pointed out by my colleague and friend, Senator Frist, \nthis is not a new program; it is one that has been out there working \nand has very broad support. We encourage it. We hope other communities \nwill take advantage of it and that the children will be the \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 475 to Amendment No. 358\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment will be set aside. Under \nthe previous order, the Senator from Louisiana is recognized to call up \namendment No. 475 on which there shall be 2 hours of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, is the amendment at the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 475 to amendment No. 358.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To ensure adequate funding for targeted grants to local \n  educational agencies under part A of title I of the Elementary and \n                    Secondary Education Act of 1965)\n\n       At the end of part A of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 120D. ADEQUACY OF FUNDING OF TARGETED GRANTS TO LOCAL \n                   EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER \n                   FISCAL YEAR 2001.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The current Basic Grant Formula for the distribution of \n     funds under part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.), often does \n     not provide funds for the economically disadvantaged students \n     for which such funds are targeted.\n       (2) Any school district in which at least two percent of \n     the students live below the poverty level qualifies for \n     funding under the Basic Grant Formula. As a result, 9 out of \n     every 10 school districts in the country receive some form of \n     aid under the Formula.\n       (3) Fifty-eight percent of all schools receive at least \n     some funding under title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965, including many suburban schools with \n     predominantly well-off students.\n       (4) One out of every 5 schools with concentrations of poor \n     students between 50 and 75 percent receive no funding at all \n     under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     of 1965.\n       (5) In passing the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994, \n     Congress declared that grants under title I of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 would more sharply target \n     high poverty schools by using the Targeted Grant Formula, but \n     annual appropriation Acts have prevented the use of that \n     Formula.\n       (6) The advantage of the Targeted Grant Formula over other \n     funding formulas under title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 is that the Targeted Grant \n     Formula provides increased grants per poor child as the \n     percentage of economically disadvantaged children in a school \n     district increases.\n       (7) Studies have found that the poverty of a child's family \n     is much more likely to be associated with educational \n     disadvantage if the family lives in an area with large \n     concentrations of poor families.\n       (8) States with large populations of high poverty students \n     would receive significantly more funding if more funds under \n     title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     were allocated through the Targeted Grant Formula.\n       (9) Congress has an obligation to allocate funds under \n     title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     so that such funds will positively affect the largest number \n     of economically disadvantaged students.\n       (b) Limitation on Allocation of Title I Funds Contingent on \n     Adequate Funding of Targeted Grants.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, the total amount allocated in any \n     fiscal year after fiscal year 2001 for programs and \n     activities under part A of title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.) may \n     not exceed the amount allocated in fiscal year 2001 for such \n     programs and activities unless the amount available for \n     targeted grants to local educational agencies under section \n     1125 of that Act (20 U.S.C. 6335) in the applicable fiscal \n     year is sufficient to meet the purposes of grants under that \n     section.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to acknowledge before I begin the \nfine work my colleague from Massachusetts has done on this bill and on \neducation in general. His leadership in this area has been \nextraordinary and breathtaking in terms of the energy and enthusiasm he \nputs forward year after year on this issue.\n  I join with him in thanking our colleague, Senator Bond, for offering \nhis amendment that will help to provide some of the resources for early \nchildhood education. I also join with Senator Kennedy in suggesting it \nwould be a very wise expenditure of our dollars to move them at the \nvery early end when children are so impressionable, young children, \nparticularly between the ages of 0-3, helping them to come into this \nworld healthy, helping their parents or their one parent to be as \nresponsible, caring, loving, and nurturing as possible so that family \nunit gets off to a very good start.\n  As a parent--and you know this as a parent, Mr. President--I believe \nall parents want to be good parents. I really believe that. I believe \nall of us have an innate sense of wanting to do the best for our \nchildren. But some adults who have not had a good example in their own \nparents or some adults who have suffered abuse and gross neglect \nthemselves, some adults who have been oppressed and have very low self-\nesteem have a very difficult time trying to be that responsible parent.\n  With these early childhood initiatives so we can perhaps reach out \nthrough our elementary and secondary bill, as well as other efforts in \nthis Congress, I believe we can identify some wonderful community-\nbased, statewide national organizations that are sprouting up \neverywhere recognizing this and for the Federal Government to be a real \npartner.\n  In my State, we have created Steps to Success which is the first \nstatewide effort but community based, community built but networked, \nworking with hospitals and other agencies in the private sector in \nLouisiana and, as Senator Kennedy has mentioned, in \nMassachusetts. While this is not the topic of my short remarks on the \nfloor today, I lend my support to this area of early childhood \neducation and thank the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist, for his \nremarks.\n\n  I come to the floor today to offer an amendment related to title I, \nthat has to do not with spending more money, necessarily, but spending \nthe money we are already spending better--spending whatever new money \nwe can negotiate in this new approach, this new accountability system, \nthis new system of real consequences for students and their families, \nteachers, and the schools that fail to meet the new accountability \nstandards for whatever that new money is, to target it so we hit our \ntarget, so we hit a bull's eye.\n  We have been spending money for education at the Federal level for \nover 30 years. We have been spending, in some people's minds, a lot of \nmoney. We have been creating program after program after program for 35 \nyears. In my opinion, and in the opinion of many who offer this \namendment today, including Senator Lieberman, Senator DeWine, Senator \nBayh, Senator Carper, and many others, we have not targeted this money \nwell enough to meet the challenges of yesterday, today, and most \ncertainly not of tomorrow.\n  What do I mean by that? It is as if we shot our quiver of arrows, we \ncontinue to shoot arrows, but we are not hitting the bull's eye; we are \nnot hitting the target. That target, as far as the Federal Government \nis concerned, based on the initial concepts of Federal aid to \neducation, is to use our resources--which represent only about 7 \npercent of the total dollars spent for elementary and secondary \neducation--to reach the students who need the most help. Who are those \nstudents? Those students are from poor areas or students in poverty \nthemselves, students who find themselves in schools with high \nconcentrations of poor students.\n  This is where the Federal resources should be directed. I am sad to \nreport to all of my colleagues, this is not where our resources are \ngoing. In fact, there was a startling and wonderfully written article \ncalled ``How the U.S. Tax Code Worsens the Education Gap.'' I ask \nunanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6028]]\n\n                       [From the New York Times]\n\n            How the U.S. Tax Code Worsens the Education Gap\n\n                         (By Richard Rothstein)\n\n       Congress will soon debate the government's biggest \n     education program, Title I, which has origins in President \n     Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty and sends nearly $9 \n     billion a year to schools with low-income children.\n       While some dismiss Title I as a failure, no one disputes \n     its intent to aid needy children. Yet few recognize that over \n     all, the federal government exacerbates inequality in \n     education, giving more money to districts with affluent \n     children than to those with poor ones.\n       It does so with a tax system that subsidizes school \n     spending in home-owning communities, many of them upper \n     middle class or even wealthy. Homeowners who itemize \n     deductions reduce their federal income taxes by a portion of \n     their property tax payments. A family in the 28 percent \n     bracket that pays $1,000 in local property taxes for public \n     schools can deduct that payment on its income tax returns. Of \n     the $1,000 going to schools, the family pays only $720 out of \n     its earnings. The federal government contribute the $280 \n     balance.\n       Economists term these subsidies ``tax expenditures,'' \n     because they have the same effect as direct government \n     spending. Yet the federal education budget highlights only \n     direct outlays, perhaps because tax expenditures would be \n     politically indefensible if widely publicized.\n       The property tax subsidy aids affluent families more than \n     lower-income ones. It helps only those who itemize \n     deductions, and itemizers have higher incomes on average than \n     taxpayers who take the standard deduction. Nearly all \n     families with annual incomes of $100,000 itemize, as against \n     fewer than a third of families with incomes of $35,000.\n       And because the subsidy is tied to a family's tax bracket, \n     even among itemizers the subsidy grows as income rises. \n     Families in the 28 percent bracket get a $280 subsidy for \n     each $1,000 in property taxes, but those in the 15 percent \n     bracket get only $150.\n       Dr. Susanna Loeb, a Stanford University economist, notes \n     that this system spurs school spending in wealthy \n     communities, both in total dollars and relative to spending \n     in less wealthy districts. When larger shares of property \n     taxes are under-written by the federal government, families \n     become more willing to raise levies for better schools. \n     Districts in wealthier communities can raise property taxes \n     more easily, knowing that Washington picks up more of the \n     tab.\n       There are some offsetting factors. One is the alternative \n     minimum tax, paid by those who claim so many tax breaks that \n     they would otherwise pay little or nothing in income taxes; \n     this effectively reduces the property tax subsidy. On the \n     other hand, many other, less affluent taxpayers do not \n     itemize deductions at all, mostly out of ignorance. A \n     community's schools get no benefit if its residents are \n     lower-middle-income homeowners who take the standard \n     deduction instead of itemizing.\n       Another countervailing factor is state income taxes, also \n     deductible on federal forms. If a state uses its income tax \n     revenue to equalize school spending, the federal system helps \n     it do so. But this effect is limited. A homogeneous \n     affluent community can more easily respond to federal tax \n     incentives by voting to increase its property levy than a \n     state as a whole can respond by increasing its income tax \n     rates.\n       On balance, direct federal education outlays are mostly for \n     poor children, while indirect spending mostly benefits the \n     affluent. And federal tax expenditures for schools exceed \n     direct spending.\n       Dr. Loeb has calculated federal per-student education \n     spending for 1989. (Calculations for recent years must await \n     data from the 2000 census.) She found that federally \n     stimulated inequality occurs both among and within states.\n       In New Jersey, federal tax expenditures were $1,257 per \n     student, but direct spending was only $237. In Alabama, tax \n     expenditures were $165, while direct spending was $371.\n       Among districts within states, the differences were just as \n     stark. Because tax expenditures are so high in wealthier \n     districts, Princeton, N.J., got $2,399 in total per-student \n     federal aid. But Camden, despite high Title I grants, got \n     only $1,140.\n       Other tax expenditures increase inequality further. For \n     example, the mortgage interest deduction also subsidizes \n     homeowners' costs, lifting property values. This, in turn, \n     disproportionately adds to the income of wealthy school \n     districts, because tax rates are a percentage of assessments.\n       Politically, it is hard to imagine that either Democrats or \n     Republicans will meddle with these upper-middle-class tax \n     benefits, or appropriate enough Title I aid to outweigh them. \n     But there is something perverse about both parties' \n     proclaiming that they wish to leave no child behind, when the \n     federal government plays so big a role in pushing affluent \n     children farther ahead.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The author is supporting my point but with a different \napproach. He is saying not only, basically, are Senator Landrieu and \nothers right to say that title I is underfunded--and I am \nparaphrasing--but we are also not giving as much direct aid to poor \nstudents as to more affluent students. To make the matter even worse, \nthe Tax Code itself, which is indirect aid, helps to underwrite \neducation in more affluent, middle-income districts throughout \nLouisiana, Texas, California, and throughout our Nation. The \ncombination of not getting the title I money to the poorest districts, \ntogether with the Tax Code that subsidizes home ownership to a degree \nproportionately greater in more affluent neighborhoods, is a \ncombination of giving Federal resources to middle-income, affluent \nstudents, which is fine, but we are not reaching the poor students, and \nwe should reach them first. With what is left over, in addition, we can \nreach more middle-income and affluent students.\n  I think the Federal Government should try to help all students. We \nwant every school to be excellent. We want every child to have an \nopportunity to enjoy a technology lab, a science lab, a math lab. We \nwant to be in partnership with the affluent districts, with middle-\nincome districts, but we must be in partnership with poor districts. \nThey are short on partners. Those children are short in their future. \nTheir dreams are cut short. We have to meet them more than halfway and \nthen do our very best to be partners with our other districts. We can \ndo that. We can adopt this amendment which will help target the funding \nto these poor students.\n  Let me show ``A Tale of Two Schools.'' I will give some specific \ninformation for the Record. We picked a couple of States for this \ndiscussion. People might be interested to hear about Mississippi, or \nPennsylvania, California as one of our largest States, and then, of \ncourse, Louisiana. I begin with Mississippi.\n  Before I get into the specifics, 35 years ago, in 1965, President \nJohnson created title I for this express purpose. He said when he \ncreated this program: ``By helping some, we will increase the \nprosperity of all.'' President Johnson put forward that providing a \nquality education for every child, regardless of whether they were a \nchild in poverty, a child in a difficult situation, was not only the \nright thing to do, not only the fair thing to do, but it was the smart \nthing to do for our Nation.\n  If we are a nation blessed with natural resources, clearly the \ngreatest resource is our own people. That is even more true today than \nit was in the agricultural age or the industrial age. Today, as we \nbuild a society based on intelligence and skill and comprehension, \nbuilding those skills inside of each human and developing them is more \nimportant to help strengthen our economy. Any businessperson in this \nNation--whether with the Chamber of Commerce or the Business Council, \nwhich have been supportive in many of these areas--will say that. \nPresident Johnson had this idea 35 years ago.\n  He went on to say that ``in the future, as in the past, this \ninvestment will return its costs manyfold to our entire economy.'' He \nwas right.\n  What we have done from that initial ``birthing'' of this idea is we \nhave allowed this child, this teenager of ours, ``title I,'' to go off \nin a different direction than we first intended. We need to pull this \nback and get back to its basics, as it was created 35 years ago. Let me \nexplain why.\n  Taking ``A Tale of Two Schools,'' in Mississippi, Taconi Elementary \nSchool in Ocean Springs, the poverty rate in Ocean Springs is 27 \npercent. They are receiving $546 per title I child. However, across the \nState of Mississippi, in Jackson, there is a school, Brown Elementary, \nwith a poverty rate of 99.5 percent for children. In this school, there \nare only a handful of households with parents working. These are \nparents who were working because we have welfare reform. People work at \nminimum wage jobs, but 100 percent of these children have households \nwith a parent or parents bringing in less than $13,000 a year. Because \nwe are not funding our targeted grantees, each child doesn't receive \n$546; they receive $268. The children who need the most help are \ngetting less money in Jackson.\n  The principal to whom we spoke yesterday, Hazel Shield, when we told \nher of this situation, said: That is ridiculous. We are talking about \nmy kids who need the most attention.\n  She says her top priority for the funds is reading and math supplies, \nbut she said: We run out of paper, pencils, and their parents don't \nhave them, crayons, just the basic tools.\n\n[[Page S6029]]\n\n  I suggest if we expect all our students at Brown Elementary School to \nmaster this new test that this underlying bill is requiring, to be able \nto compete in math and English and language, to be able to be computer \nliterate, they are going to need more than crayons. They are going to \nneed more than pieces of paper and pencils and crayons. Mr. President, \n$268 is not going to do it.\n  Let's go to Pennsylvania. This is two schools in Pennsylvania. I know \nour Senators from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum and Mr. Specter, will be \nvery familiar with these schools. No doubt both of those Senators who \nworked so hard in education have visited these or other schools similar \nto them. Rolling Hills Elementary only has 3 percent poverty. It is in \nHolland County. It is a very wealthy district. You can see, $2,361 is \nreceived for each child under the poverty level in Holland. But in \nAliquippa Middle School in Aliquippa County, where the poverty rate is \n85 percent, these children who need the most help are only receiving \nfrom the Federal Government $878 per child.\n  These children in Aliquippa need help; they need a partner; and the \nFederal Government must be their partner. They do not have a tax base \nas Holland does. They don't have Fortune 500 companies in Aliquippa, as \nperhaps Holland does, there or close by. If they do not have the \nFederal Government as their partner, they do not have a partner, and \nthese children will fail, not because they are not talented, not \nbecause they are not smart, not because their parents don't love them, \nnot because they do not try but because they simply do not have the \nresources to compete. It is a shame and we need to fix it.\n  Let's now go to California, which is one of our largest States. I \nthought it would be interesting, since most everybody knows where \nBeverly Hills is, to show the Beverly Hills situation which, of course, \nincludes Beverly Vista, a wonderful school where the poverty rate is \nonly 10 percent. This is a fairly well off community. Many people have \nseen Beverly Hills on television or visited there. We send to each of \nthese children in Beverly Hills $1,100.\n  But on a little different side of Los Angeles, which is a big city, \nthere is a little school called Sixth Avenue Elementary where the \npoverty rate is 100 percent. There is not one child in this school \nwhose family earns a little more than $20,000--I am just assuming it is \na little higher than it would be in Mississippi. But if anybody has \ntried to live in Los Angeles on $18,000 a year for a household income, \nthat is very hard. It is hard to live on that anywhere but particularly \nin a big city. We help these children with $270. We help them but we do \nnot help them enough.\n  We spoke to the principal and a teacher there at Sixth Avenue \nElementary. The principal says her greatest need is teacher \ndevelopment. At this school, Sixth Avenue Elementary, 66 percent of the \nstaff is not certified. In our bill, if I am not mistaken, there is \neither an amendment on the bill or there is going to be an amendment \nadopted which is going to say schools with 50 percent of teachers who \nare not certified have 3 years to get them certified.\n  At $270 a child, I, for the life of me, do not know, even with the \ngreatest principal in the world and the most active parent association \npossible, how they, in Sixth Avenue Elementary, are going to reach that \ngoal when we are only helping them at $270 per child.\n  The average fourth grade student at Sixth Avenue Elementary is \nreading at the third or below third grade level, and the pupil-teacher \nratio in fourth and fifth grades is 35 to 1.\n  Let me repeat, the fourth and fifth grade students are now reading \nbelow the third grade level, and the pupil-teacher ratio is 35 to 1. We \nare contributing $270 per student to help them pass these new tests \nthat they are now going to have to take every year, which I support--\nnew accountability standards which I have supported. The cosponsors of \nthis amendment have been some of the strongest on the floor for \naccountability. But if we do not step up to the plate on this, if we do \nnot target our resources, we are setting our children up for failure.\n  As a mother of two children, I hate to see my own children fail. But \nI realize some failure is part of life and you cannot be successful \nwithout some failure. But my children wake up every day knowing they \nwill succeed because I tell them so. I don't set them up for failure. I \ndon't put them in places where they will be consistently failing. I \ngive my children opportunities to succeed even in the small things \nbecause I want to build them into a sense of accomplishment, a sense of \nwell-being, a sense that they can do it.\n  What in heavens name are we doing if we set up our children in this \nNation so they can fail and fail and fail and then say it is their \nfault. They are not living up to their responsibilities when we are not \nliving up to our responsibilities--at $270.\n  Two people who go out to eat in LA--I know because I have been \nthere--at one restaurant one night could spend $270 on a meal. But that \nis all we do at Sixth Avenue Elementary in Los Angeles to help these \nchildren for a year of learning. It is, in my estimation, a crime and a \ntravesty.\n  Let me talk a minute about Louisiana. I see my colleague, Senator \nDeWine. I am going to try to wrap up in about 10 minutes because I know \nhe is here to speak. But let me go through three examples at Capdau \nMiddle School in New Orleans, right in my hometown. I want to show you \nsome pictures. We did not go out of our way to find the worst pictures. \nThey couldn't get much worse than this. But we thought this was an \ninteresting picture because on the front--I don't know if the camera \ncan pick it up--it says: ``You are about to enter a learning zone.''\n  The artist had to airbrush off the graffiti that was here because it \nwas not appropriate to show on the camera. So after we polish up this \npicture, it still doesn't look very good. This is the learning zone--a \nvery attractive entrance, as you can see. I am being sarcastic here. It \nis not a very attractive entrance for children to walk into in the \nmorning.\n  If a child got thirsty somewhere out in the playground, I don't think \nthey would be very interested in drinking the water that would come out \nof this faucet, if water could come out of it. We have seen many \ncomparable slides on the need for school construction. It is not only \nspending more money but also managing our schools well so the \nmaintenance keeps up. I venture to say you cannot just pour in money \nand solve these problems. It has to be a maintenance effort and good \nmanagement of the schools.\n  I want to show you what the school looks like so you can get the \nsense that this school has an 83-percent poverty rate. But the \nunbelievable thing I want to share with you is that this school in New \nOrleans doesn't get any title I money. At least the Sixth Avenue \nElementary School in Los Angeles got $278. Why? Because we don't fund \nthe targeted grants at all and never have. They are in the law but they \nare not funded.\n  The amount of money in title I is not enough to reach all poor \nchildren. Even in New Orleans, the school with 83 percent of the \nchildren in poverty is not receiving one dollar of title I money. And \nthe principal says they need basic supplies and textbooks. There is \nsimply not enough to go around. Half the staff is not certified. This \nis one of the low-performing schools in our parish.\n  We are in an accountability system right now. Louisiana has adopted \none of the leading accountability systems in the Nation. Despite the \nfact these children have no water to drink on the playground, despite \nthe fact they don't have enough textbooks, despite the fact they have \nto walk every day into this place that is called a learning zone--it \nsurely doesn't look like one--these kids are doing better on their \ntests. Why? Because they want to succeed. Why? Because their parents \nwant a better life for them. They are doing their best. They are not \nwhere they need to be. If I were in a school such as this, I might not \nbe where I needed to be either. But we can do better.\n  Let me show you Johnson Elementary School. Johnson Elementary School \nin Lake Charles was forced to cut its summer program to just 3 weeks. \nThree percent of the students are at the poverty rate. Last summer I \nthink they were able to provide 6 weeks of summer school to the \nchildren who were behind so they could catch up and so they would have \na safe place to play in those hot summer months.\n\n[[Page S6030]]\n\n  Lake Charles, unfortunately, with this hurricane, is having a lot of \nproblems, as in southwest Louisiana. This school, in addition to these \npressing and chronic problems, may be in a flood zone at this moment. \nThere may not be any summer school, but if there is, they will just \nhave enough money for 3 weeks.\n  At Greenlawn Terrace Elementary in Jefferson Parish, there are 33 \nstudents for each teacher in the fourth and fifth grades. The ratio is \n1 to 33. The principal says, obviously, these students need more \nindividual attention. It is hard to teach a fourth grader and fifth \ngrader. It is not the easiest grade to teach. The students are at a \nvery interesting age, shall we say, at a time I think in their life \nwhere they need extra special attention. These are 10-, 11-, and 12-\nyear-olds at this particular age in the fourth and fifth grade. That \nschool does not receive any title I.\n  Finally, at Scotlandville Middle School in Baton Rouge, our capital \ncity, 68 percent of eighth graders fail to pass the math portions of \ntheir statewide exams. People would say: Why? How could 68 percent of \nthe students fail their exams? One of the reasons is the school has a \nmath lab and it is fully equipped, but they don't have enough money to \nhire a teacher to teach the math class. They have the laboratory; they \nhave the best software; they have the computers; but because they do \nnot have the extra title I money, they do not have the instructor. So \nit sits empty, and 68 percent of eighth graders have failed their math \nportion.\n  Let me share with you some successes. Despite the fact we have not \ntargeted our money, despite the fact we have never allocated enough \nmoney, there are some successes with title I. That is the point of my \nmessage. This is an amendment with hope. This is a story that could \nhave a happy ending. This is an exercise where if we did what we could \nwe could most certainly hit that target. When we hit it, it would make \na big difference for these children.\n\n  In Baton Rouge, they were able to use the title I dollars they \nreceived last year to hire one additional teacher. They took their \nthird grade class size down from a ratio of 32 to 1 to 21 to 1. Now you \nare talking; now kids are learning; now there is teaching going on, and \nstudents will be able to meet these high standards we have set for \nthem.\n  When a school that we contacted in Lake Charles used their title I \nfunds, they extended their schoolday. They went to a year-round \nlearning program. The students in that school, within just a short \nperiod of time--I think less than 1 year--showed clear and drastic \nimprovement on their State tests.\n  The great thing about funding title I is that it is in some way the \nperfect block grant. The locals have total flexibility as to how they \nwould like to spend it. It is tied to student achievement. Senator \nFeinstein has an amendment on this subject to tie title I to student \nachievement so the locals can decide if they want to have afterschool \ncare, learning, and extended days. How about Saturday school for some \nkids who would need the extra help? Alternative schools, extra reading, \nextra math, tutoring, computers, textbooks, software, special teachers, \nguidance counselors, and even nurses I think should be encouraged to be \nfunded under title I, because students who are not healthy have a hard \ntime learning.\n  Students who have a learning disability are perhaps victims of child \nabuse at home. Perhaps they have been exposed to a tremendous amount of \nviolence and they are just unable to learn. They are sad children. They \nare despondent. They don't see joy in their house. They see violence in \ntheir house. Guidance counselors cannot substitute for that, but they \nmost certainly can help to get a child mentally to a place where they \ncan learn. Yes, nurses and guidance counselors, there are successes. \nThat is one of the reasons I believe so strongly in title I because we \nare not mandating to the local governments. We are giving them complete \nflexibility. They can use it to meet these new accountability \nstandards. I most certainly know they would take full advantage of this \nin making improvements.\n  Let me end with the example of the research that has been done. There \nis a study which talks about funding for poor students.\n  When we have been able to fund and target our dollars, the scores of \npoor students in high concentrations of poverty increase. The research \nshows this. We don't have to be the least bit worried about this money \nbeing put to good use. As we march forward on our accountability \nstandards and new tests --and there are real consequences for failure--\nthe local governments now have a tremendous incentive. If they didn't \nhave it before, they now have a tremendous incentive to put their money \nto good use and to get their test scores up and to create the kind of \natmosphere in their schools of which we would all be proud.\n  The Prospects study was done on the performance of seventh graders in \nhigh and low poverty districts. This shows the discrepancy between the \nway students perform in schools that have low-poverty rates and the way \nstudents can't perform in schools that have high-poverty rates.\n  Again, let me stress that children who are born into poverty have as \nmuch talent and as many God-given gifts as children who are not. God \nreally is very fair in his allocation of gifts. He doesn't reserve them \nto one group. He generously bestows gifts on children from many \ndifferent walks of life. It is not a talent deficit that exists here. \nIt is not an ability deficit that exists here. It is a political will \ndeficit that exists. We need to correct it with this and other similar \namendments.\n  These are math grades for the seventh grade. You can see the low-\npoverty schools. These are more affluent schools and not very high-\npoverty rates. These are A students--who are getting A's in their \ntests. The pass rate for their math tests was 87 percent. A students, \nwith the same ability--they are straight A students--but they are \nstudents in high-poverty schools, their average pass rate was 36 \npercent, a 50-percentage-point difference.\n\n  For B students, it is the same: 56 percent pass, but in the poverty \nschools only 34 percent pass. For C students, 41 percent pass but in \nthe poverty schools only half of that--22 percent--pass.\n  Let's go to reading where it is even more dramatic. For A students in \nlow-poverty schools, 81 percent of the students pass their reading \nproficiency test. But A students--bright students, good students--who \nare poor but are trying hard, they only pass at 36 percent based on \nthis study.\n  As you can see from the chart, for the B students, the ratio of low-\npoverty students to high-poverty students who pass is 49 percent to 19 \npercent; for C students, it is 23 percent to 13 percent; and for D \nstudents, it is 23 percent to 14 percent of the students. The pattern \nis set and the pattern is troublesome.\n  The pattern shows that when students are in low-poverty schools, they \ntend to do better on their testing and excel at their studies. The \nstudies show that even smart kids--good kids, kids who are trying hard, \nwho are getting good grades--when they find themselves in high \nconcentrations of poverty, which, unfortunately, exists in our country \nbecause of prejudice, because of unequal opportunity, because of past \ndiscriminations, even though they are trying, continue to fall short of \nthe mark.\n  In closing, let me just say one thing about reading. If we in this \ncountry do not help every child read--I know we cannot do everything; I \nknow money does not grow on trees; I know taxpayers work hard for it; I \nknow people do not like to pay a lot of taxes to any government--local, \nState or Federal, but paying taxes is an important thing to do when it \ncomes to education.\n  Supporting the education of our children is so crucial. It is \nimportant for every businessperson. It is important for everybody \nbuilding a future in our Nation. It is important to our country. If we \ncould just do one thing, it would be to get children reading well at \nthat magic age of 8 or 9 because when a child masters that skill, a \nchild begins to think positive about themselves. Even if their parents \nare not literate, even if their parents are having difficulty, that \nchild can then take the role of educating the whole family. That child \nwill think well of himself or herself and then can master math and \nscience and social studies.\n  When we have large numbers of children concentrated in high-poverty \nschools, and when we have our money\n\n[[Page S6031]]\n\nso dispersed throughout the country, we are missing the target. And \nthat target is poor children who need to learn to read early so that \nthey can succeed in their studies and be part of their community and \npart of our Nation.\n  Under this amendment, the funding would hold every school district \nharmless so no school district would lose money. But all the new money \nthat was added, whether it was for Ohio or for Louisiana, would go to \nhelping children who need the most help.\n  Let's hit the bull's-eye. Let's be that partner that these children \nso desperately need. And I can promise you, they will do more than \ntheir share. I know the children. I know their energy. We have all seen \nthem: our own and our neighbors' and our friends'. If we just help \nthem, they will meet us more than halfway and succeed, not fail. They \nwill be proud; their parents will be proud of them; their communities \nwill be proud of them, and the Nation will prosper from their education \nand their efforts.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Ohio, how many minutes would the Senator like?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I think my colleague from Tennessee will proceed for a \ncouple minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield back the remainder of my time, but I think we \nhave 2 hours reserved for this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. I think we will be talking for another hour and 15 \nminutes. We can take the time for the Senator from Ohio off our time. \nWe will be going back and forth.\n  Mr. President, I very briefly want to say that much of the debate \nover the last several weeks has been on how we can best improve the \nsystem, modernize the system, reform the system, and consolidate, \nstreamline local control, and have more accountability. That is one \nelement.\n  The other element that we keep referring to is the whole element of \nmoney, of how many Federal dollars should be injected.\n  This particular amendment really asks a much different question than \nthose two. Basically it says, given the dollars that are out there--\nwhatever they might be--how can we best invest those and reform the \nsystem to accomplish what we all want to do. And that is to leave no \nchild behind.\n  I say that only because so many of the amendments have to do with new \ndollars or new programs. This really puts that aside and says, given \nwhatever dollars we are going to allocate, how can we best invest those \nspecifically as they apply to title I or low-income students?\n  I believe the principle in this amendment is that the money we, as a \nCongress, intend to invest in title I, or intend to invest in low-\nincome students, needs to get there--or needs to get close--and that in \nspite of good intentions since the 1995 reform--and going back to \n1965--the money has not arrived.\n  Again, it is not new money. It is not a new program. It is really \ndealing with a more prudent use of it to make sure that, once \nimplementation takes place, those dollars go to the low-income \nstudents, which is where the money was intended by the will of Congress \nto go.\n\n  I congratulate my colleague from Louisiana, and also her cosponsor, \nthe Senator from Ohio, in bringing forward the underlying principle in \nthe amendment itself.\n  I yield time, as necessary, to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from Tennessee \nfor his very excellent comments. I also thank my colleague from \nLouisiana for her great leadership in this area. It has been a pleasure \nto work with her on this amendment, as it is a pleasure to work with \nher on so many other issues relating to our children. She is a real \nchampion for our Nation's children. And I think this amendment is a \ngood reflection of that compassion and how much she cares about our \nchildren.\n  This amendment is aimed specifically at helping children in those \ndistricts most in need of Federal assistance. Our amendment would \nsimply ensure that any increases in title I funding above fiscal year \n2001 levels would be directed to grants for school districts with the \nhighest concentrations of poverty. In other words, our amendment \ndirects the limited and finite Federal education resources to the \nschools where they can do the most good, to the schools that are in \nmost need, the kids who are in most need.\n  A little history: Title I dates back to 1965 when the Congress and \nPresident Johnson created this act. The Federal Government, through \ntitle I, stepped in and created a program in an effort to help address \nthe needs of children in low-income areas, where the districts simply \ncould not meet the basic needs of the children. That was the rationale \nfor title I.\n  Understandably, over the course of the last 3\\1/2\\ decades, the \nFederal role in education has broadened. Often that broadening role of \nthe Federal Government in those programs has been driven more by \npolitics than by the needs of low-income students. So in an attempt to \nget back to the original intent of title I, the original Federal \nmission in education--to direct dollars to those districts and those \nkids most in need--the 1994 reauthorization legislation created a \nseparate title I grant program. This new program that was created 7 \nyears ago was supposed to address the unique needs and challenges of \nstudents in communities with extremely high concentrations of \nimpoverished children. That is what we intended to do and said we were \ndoing 7 years ago.\n  However, though authorized in 1994, to this day not a single Federal \ndollar has been appropriated to fund this grant program. This simply \nmust change. As a result of this failure to appropriate any money, \nthousands of children in the very highest poverty communities are not \ngetting the attention they deserve from this Government. The money that \nwas supposed to reach the most impoverished districts is simply not \ngetting there.\n\n  Actually funding these grants is a necessary part of any plan to help \nimprove our Nation's neediest schools. While our amendment is very \nsimple, I believe it will have a big impact. Quite frankly, it is an \namendment whose time has come. Once and for all, it is time to get \nserious about the children in those districts most in need. It is time \nto stop paying lipservice to these kids and to focus some money on \nthem.\n  We have an obligation in this Congress and in this country to ensure \nthat every single child in America receives a good, solid, quality \neducation. Ultimately, a quality education for a child today is the key \nto that child's quality of life in the future; tragically, though, not \nall children are getting the quality education they deserve.\n  Our society today is divided, divided along economic and educational \nlines. This division is nothing new. Scholars and sociologists have \nbeen warning us for years that this was where our Nation was heading, \nparticularly if we did not properly educate our children. \nUnfortunately, we did not heed the warnings. As a result, our Nation \ntoday is a Nation split into two Americas--one where children get \neducated and one where they do not. The gap in educational knowledge \nand economic standing is entrenching thousands upon thousands upon \nthousands of children into an underclass, a permanent underclass, and \ninto futures filled with poverty and little hope, little opportunity, \nand little room for advancement.\n  That is exactly what is happening in my home State of Ohio. \nTragically, that is what is happening all across our great country. \nOhio is generally a microcosm of the rest of our country. When we look \nat this growing gap, the development of the two Americas, what we see \nin Ohio is also what we see in our Nation. There now exist two Ohios; \nthere now exist two Americas.\n  In Ohio, growing income and educational disparities are creating our \nvery own permanent underclass. Most of Ohio is doing very well \neconomically and doing well from an education point of view. The \nchildren in most of Ohio are doing very well and have a great future. \nHowever, when we look across our entire State, we see two areas where \nthat is not the case, areas where our children are not being educated \nas well as we would like. One place is in rural Appalachia, the 20 to \n25 counties that comprise our Appalachian counties. The other area is \nin our core cities, our inner cities. It is in these areas where\n\n[[Page S6032]]\n\nwe as a State--and also as a country--face our greatest challenges.\n  This is a problem that is not unique to Ohio. Rather, it is a huge \nsocietal problem which is pushing society further and further apart to \ncreate the two Americas of which I spoke.\n  Tragically, it is the children who are suffering the most. According \nto the National Center for Children in Poverty, between 1979 and 1998 \nthe national child poverty rate increased by 15 percent, rising from 3 \nmillion children in poverty to over 13 million, or 19 percent. In Ohio, \nduring that same period, the rate increased by over 50 percent. We in \nOhio went from over 164,000 children in poverty to over a half a \nmillion today, or 18 percent.\n  These children are at risk, every single one of them. The structural \nconditions of poverty make it very difficult for these children to \nsucceed in life and move up and out of their impoverished \ncircumstances. The fact is that with poverty often come drugs, crime, \nbroken homes, unemployment, violence, and lower educational levels. In \nfact, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics, in \n1999 young adults living in families with incomes in the lowest 20 \npercent of all family incomes were five times as likely to drop out of \nhigh school as their peers from families in the top 20 percent of the \nincome distribution--five times more likely to drop out.\n\n  Moreover, most of the research concerning high school dropouts \ngenerally concludes that socioeconomic status is the most important \nsingle factor in student dropout rates. Just look at the class of 2000 \ngraduation rates for cities in Ohio, for those school districts.\n  In Akron, 72 percent of the city's high school students graduated \nthat year. That is actually a high rate for an urban area. In Toledo, \nonly 67 percent graduated. In Columbus, it was only 62 percent. And in \nYoungstown, it was 59 percent. Dayton, OH, graduated that year 57 \npercent of its students; Canton, 53 percent; Cincinnati, only 51 \npercent. In Cleveland, OH, in the year 2000, only 34 percent of the \nstudents who started high school actually finished. That is right, 34 \npercent. Two-thirds of those kids did not graduate.\n  It is not surprising that 32 percent of Cleveland City schoolteachers \nhave fewer than 5 years' experience, giving the district one of the \nlargest percentages of inexperienced teachers in the State.\n  Those figures in Cleveland are not unusual. You will find such \nstatistics in major cities across our country. The simple fact is that \nthe more experienced teachers with better training, more practice, are \nbeing lured away from our city schools to the suburbs by more money \nand, many times, simply better working conditions.\n  Before anyone becomes too complacent or thinks maybe they don't have \nthis problem in their State, let me remind my colleagues in the Senate \nthat what is happening in Cleveland and other Ohio cities is not \nunusual, nor is it only happening in our State. What is happening in \nOhio is typical of many urban areas.\n  My guess is that if we look at the other major cities in this \ncountry, we will find similar disturbing statistics, similar rates of \npoverty, and similar rates of high school dropout. I believe the best \nway we can get to these children before we lose them is through a \nquality education.\n  Horace Mann, former president of Antioch College in Yellow Springs, \nOH, the community where my wife Fran and I grew up, and who is known as \nthe father of public education, once said the following:\n\n       Education, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the \n     great equalizer, the great equalizer of the conditions of \n     man--the balance-wheel of the social machinery.\n\n  This is exactly what education can and should do. It should provide \nall children, regardless of their economic circumstances or family \nbackgrounds, with the tools they need to make it as adults in our \nsociety, with the tools necessary to rise above individual situations \nof poverty and instability, individual situations of hopelessness and \ndespair.\n  As my colleagues in the Senate know, today's educational system is \nnot always meeting this goal. Don't get me wrong. I am not blaming the \nschools, and I am not blaming the teachers for all of society's and \neducation's ills. Rather, I am suggesting that we, as a society, are \nfailing to use the awesome power and potential of our schools to the \nmaximum extent to help give these poor children the future they deserve \nand the future they need.\n  No matter where a child lives, whether in Portsmouth, OH, or New York \nCity, every one of the 1.8 million children in the Ohio public school \nsystem and every one of nearly 47 million children in public schools \nnationwide deserve the opportunity to learn and to become educated.\n  Let's face it: Our schools have our children in their care 7, 8 hours \na day, 5 days a week. That is not a lot of time, but it is time our \nschools and our country simply cannot afford to waste.\n  I am reminded of a line from a 1970s song that said: ``Your dreams \nwere your ticket out.''\n  For all too many children--children living in poverty--dreams alone \nare not enough. For those children, a dream and a solid education is \ntheir ticket out.\n  This is not a new concept. Historically, our schools have been the \nbest opportunity for children to move out, to move up, to advance, to \nchange their lives. Education has built our Nation. We are truly a \nnation of immigrants who, because of public schools, because of \neducation, escape ignorance, illiteracy, and lives of poverty. A strong \neducation tradition in this country kept entire generations from being \nmarginalized and left behind. For them, education was their ticket out \nof despair and toward opportunity.\n  For the children in this country today who are growing up under very \ndifficult circumstances, education should be their ticket out as well. \nI believe that we in this body and in this Federal Government, in \ndeciding how to spend the finite money we are going to put into \neducation, have an obligation to target those children who are most in \nneed, to target those children for whom an education will make the most \ndifference. That is what the amendment that has been offered by my \ncolleague, Mary Landrieu from Louisiana, Senator Lieberman, myself, and \nothers, will do.\n  When education is not working to give our kids the tools they need to \nmove ahead in life, those children suffer. We can't always fix broken \nhomes; we can't always fix every societal problem; but we can use the \nfinite Federal dollars that we have and that we are going to spend on \neducation to at least help close the education gap in America. That is \nexactly what this amendment will attempt to do. It targets money to \nthose kids who are most in need.\n  Let me conclude my remarks by referencing an editorial that ran in \nthe Cleveland Plain Dealer on February 28 of this year. The editorial \ntalked about the importance of restoring the original mission of the \ntitle I program. The editorial said the following:\n\n       The most important and valuable suggestion [in education \n     reform] regards the targeting of Federal dollars to poor \n     students. Over the years, the program designed to meet this \n     need, title I, has become so diluted that more than 90 \n     percent of all districts now receive support from it. It \n     would be far more effective if Federal officials insisted \n     that title I money go to students who truly need it.\n\n  That is exactly what this amendment does. It directs our limited \nFederal resources to the children most in need. It seeks to close the \neducational gap in our Nation and, in the process, help narrow the \neconomic gap. This amendment will use education dollars and will use \neducation to equalize the environment for our children. That is the \nright thing for us to do.\n  Ultimately, the Federal role in education accounts for only about 8 \npercent of the money that a typical school district gets. And even \nthough the bill before us will significantly increase the Federal \ndollars that are going into education, we know it is still going to be \na very small percentage of the money a typical school district gets. \nKnowing that, doesn't it make sense to prioritize some of this \nadditional money--all the additional money, actually--that we are going \nto put into title I, to our children most at risk and most in need?\n  I believe we must be prudent and wise in allocating those limited \nFederal resources. That means we should direct those dollars, first and \nforemost, to America's neediest school districts, to its neediest \nchildren. It makes sense to do that. It is the right thing to do.\n\n  Mr. President, I see several colleagues on the floor. I want to, \nagain,\n\n[[Page S6033]]\n\ncompliment my colleague from Louisiana for this very strong and \npowerful amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \npending amendment which is based on my bill S. 231, the Seniors as \nVolunteers in Our Schools which I introduced on January 31, 2001. I am \npleased that Senators Grassley, Akaka, Inouye, Craig, Baucus and Inhofe \nare cosponsors of that bill.\n  Under this amendment, school administrators and teachers are \nencouraged to use qualified seniors as volunteers in federally funded \nprograms and activities authorized by the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, ESEA.\n  Studies show that guidance by a caring adult can help reduce \nsubstance abuse and youth violence. Because every child deserves a safe \nlearning environment, this amendment is an important step in ensuring \nthat our schools provide a safe and caring place for our children to \nlearn and grow. It will help build lasting partnerships between our \nlocal school systems, our children and our senior citizens.\n  Seniors have practical knowledge and wisdom gained from experience. \nThey are as important a part of our national future as are our young \nones in school. Improving the opportunities for learning for all \nAmericans has been the focus of recent debate. We have faced weighty \nand costly decisions about education and the role the federal \ngovernment ought to play in the education of our children.\n  But, there are also many practical opportunities we can offer in this \nendeavor that don't come at a high cost. My amendment offers such an \nopportunity. By making better use of all the gifts senior Americans \nhave to offer, we can provide a framework to connect schools with \nappropriate seniors. My amendment does just that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support prompt passage of this amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for just a few \nminutes about my safe schools amendment to S. 1, the Better Education \nfor Students and Teachers Act of 2001. My amendment, the Safe School \nSecurity Act of 2001, addresses an element that has not been given \nenough attention in the debate over ESEA, school security.\n  In recent years, we have witnessed too many tragic shootings that \nhave resulted in the deaths of students and teachers. While these \nschool shootings are shocking and disturbing, and have received much \nattention, it is the everyday school violence and crime that plagues \nmost students and teachers and interferes with their ability to learn \nand teach.\n  Today I offer an amendment that is designed to assist schools in \nreducing school violence and campus crimes. This legislation would \nestablish the School Security Technology and Resource Center, SSTAR, in \nNew Mexico to work in partnership with the Rural Law Enforcement Center \nin Arkansas and the National law Enforcement and Corrections Technology \nCenter in South Carolina.\n  In the 106th Congress, I introduced similar legislation to establish \nthe School Security Technology and Resource Center, SSTAR, at Sandia \nNational Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM. While the bill was accepted \nby the Senate, and became part of the Juvenile Crime Bill in May 1999, \nthe conference committee failed to produce a conference report and the \nbill never came before the full Congress for a vote.\n  Nonetheless, over the past 3 years, SSTAR has pursued its mission and \nhas provided assistance to hundreds of schools across the country. In \n1999, Sandia worked with the National Institute of Justice to publish \nwhat became\n\n[[Page S6037]]\n\nthe most widely requested document from NIJ last year: The Appropriate \nand Effective Use of Security Technologies in U.S. Schools. Last year, \nSSTAR put on a National School Safety Conference in Dallas, TX, for \nhundreds of school administrators and safety personnel from across the \ncountry. In the last 2 years, with limited resources, SSTAR provided \ntailored school security assessments for schools in Texas, \nMassachusetts, and the Navajo Nation.\n  The Texas project came about when SSTAR was contacted by the \nadministration at Permian High School in Odessa, TX. Although Permian \nhad not experienced any major acts of violence, the Columbine shootings \nmade the administrators rethink the risks facing their large population \nof 2,200 students. Like most schools, Permian was also interested in \nreducing the everyday problems such as fights, theft, vandalism, \ngraffiti and intruders on campus. In the end, the security upgrades and \npolicy changes were well received by the school administration, parents \nand students.\n  The idea for SSTAR started in 1997 with a local initiative in New \nMexico involving Sandia National Laboratories and a local high school \nthat was experiencing a high number of student car break-ins, vandalism \nand theft of school property. Sandia Labs partnered with the community \nand local businesses to implement a wide variety of security upgrades \nat Belen High School, just south of Albuquerque. In the year after they \nimplemented the Sandia-designed plan, Belen experienced a 75 percent \nreduction in school violence, a 30 percent reduction in truancy, an 80 \npercent reduction in theft from vehicles, and a 75 percent reduction in \nvandalism. Interestingly, the drop in automobile break-ins seemed to \nreduce the level of conflict among students and provided many students \nwith ease of mind. The drop in truancy, vandalism and violent crime \nconvinced me that this was a program that should be available to all \nschools.\n\n  Because of Sandia's expertise in evaluating and designing security \nfor our Nation's nuclear sites, Sandia is well suited to evaluate the \nsecurity of our Nation's schools and advise school administrators on \nhow to create safer learning facilities. This transfer of experience to \na school setting has proved beneficial in many pilot projects around \nthe country. SSTAR, when fully operational, intends to offer workshops \nto train school personnel in school security, provide security \nassessments for public schools, and test existing security technologies \nso schools do not spend precious resources on equipment that doesn't \nwork or doesn't suit their needs.\n  The amendment I am introducing today also establishes a $10 million \ngrant program under the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program to assist \nschools in implementing security strategies. These grants will enable \nschool to purchase high tech security equipment or implement low tech \nsecurity upgrades. While our children's safety is of paramount concern, \nwe should also aim to protect the significant investment by America's \ntaxpayers in expensive computer equipment and other high-tech teaching \ntools prevalent in many schools today.\n  If students do not feel safe in their own schools, they cannot focus \nand perform to the best of their ability. If teachers do not feel safe \nin their classrooms, they cannot fully concentrate on teaching. I \nbelieve we have a responsibility to do what is in our power to make our \nchildren and teachers safe at school so they can focus on learning and \neducating. While we have invested in our national laboratories so they \ncan protect our nuclear arsenal, and we have invested in our Federal \nbuildings to protect our Federal employees and the general public, we \nhave failed to adequately invest in our Nation's schools so they can \nprotect our Nation's most valuable assets--our youth. SSTAR can fulfill \nthis responsibility if given the proper resources.\n  Therefore, I urge my Senate colleagues to support this legislation. I \nthank Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas for partnering with me on this \nbill two years ago and for sticking by this worthwhile legislation. I \nalso want to thank Senators Hollings and Corzine for their willingness \nto cosponsor this bill. The services provided by SSTAR and the Rural \nlaw Enforcement Center have benefitted many students, teachers, parents \nand law enforcement and I believe these services should now be shared \nwith the entire country.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 519\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Those amendments are: Senator Wellstone's on family \ninformation centers, Senators Bingaman and Hutchison's on school \nsecurity, Senator Stevens' on cultural exchange, Senator Landrieu's on \nClose-up, Senator Campbell's on senior opportunities.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment of Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Lieberman, and Senator DeWine. We have title I grant \ndiscrepancies for two reasons. The first is legitimate. The second is a \nreflection of insufficient funds. Each State receives a different title \nI grant because it has different numbers of poor children and different \nper pupil expenditures. Since 1965, we have keyed the title I formula \nto the number of poor children in a State multiplied by State per pupil \nexpenditure. The use of the per pupil expenditure is intended to \nreflect the different costs of education in different States and is \nintended to encourage States to increase their own education spending.\n  Those are worthy policies that we have had for many years. The reason \nwe see discrepancies within the States is that districts have a great \ndeal of flexibility in determining per child grants. Districts have to \nserve schools in rank order of poverty. So it goes through the States \nand then to the districts, and then they have to distribute funds on \nthe rank order of poverty. But they can limit the size of the grants to \nserve many schools that are eligible.\n  Low poverty districts often have only one or two eligible schools. \nThose schools see all of a district's title I money, and have large per \nchild grants accordingly. High-poverty large districts often have many \nschools eligible for title I funds, and these high-poverty districts \noften spread out their title I money among many eligible schools. Those \nschools, accordingly, see small per child grants.\n  I support the pending amendment to target limited funds. But the best \nthing we can do is to grow the total title I pot of funding so that \ndistricts do not have to spread limited funding among many poor \nschools. That is the bottom line.\n  There are four different formulas for title I. There are the basic \ngrants, concentration grants, targeted grants, and education finance \ngrants. They all have different bases for support--they benefit \ndifferent numbers of poor children in different States and in different \ncommunities. There is great flexibility within the local school \ndistricts and the amounts they are going to give per school. Therefore, \nyou have the kinds of disparities we have heard talked about this \nafternoon.\n  The way to address that is to do what the Senate has done, and that \nis to support full funding for the title I program. When you have full \nfunding of the title I program, these kinds of aberrations, as the two \nSenators pointed out, don't exist.\n  That is the best way to do it; otherwise, poor children will be \nfighting over scraps. We have the resources to address this issue. The \nSenate is on record supporting full funding of title I. I am strongly \nin support of that program.\n  As I have pointed out, we have a good bill. It is not the bill I \nwould have written. It is not the bill I am sure my colleagues, Senator \nFrist, Senator Gregg, and others would have written, or the President \nwould have written, but it is a good bill. It can make an important \ndifference for the children who are going to benefit from it. The fact \nis though that only a third of the children are going to benefit from \nthis legislation because of the current level of insufficient funding.\n  I have behind me a chart which indicates increases in the ESEA budget \nsince 1994. The ESEA is inclusive of the title I program. This chart \nreflects from 1994 to the year 2001. During the previous \nadministration, we had a 8.6-percent increase in the ESEA budget, but \nunder President Bush it is 3.6 percent.\n  If we look at it more closely, under the Administration's budget, in \nthe outyears--2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010--there \nis virtually no increase. It is flat funded. There will not be an \nincrease of funding for these\n\n[[Page S6038]]\n\nneeds. We are still going to have these extraordinary disparities. We \ncan remedy that with the funding which this Senate has gone on record \nin a bipartisan way to support.\n  The next chart shows under the Title I program, which is part of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, there are 3.7 million children \nwho are going to be reached, out of 10.3 million eligible poor \nchildren.\n  In fiscal year 2008, under the President's budget, it is 3.7 million. \nI do not know what happened to the pledge of leaving no child behind.\n  The Senator from Louisiana, in her excellent presentation, pointed \nout the number of children who are being left behind in those schools, \nas did the Senator from Ohio as well.\n  Under the bipartisan amendment offered by Senator Dodd and Senator \nCollins, which was accepted in fiscal year 2002, we move up the number \nof children served to 5.7 million. We have important reforms, and we \nhave important accountability--accountability for the schools, \nteachers, students, parents, accountability within the community, and \nwe provide that for 5.7 million children.\n  We do state that at the time of the expiration of this legislation in \nthe fiscal year 2008, no child will be left behind. Every one of those \nchildren who are missing out will be covered under the amendment of the \nSenator from Louisiana and the Senator from Ohio. They will be able to \nget supplementary services and inclusion in summer school programs. \nThey will have the opportunity of attending perhaps another public \nschool if that is necessary. They will be able to go to afterschool \nprograms and get supplementary services. That is under the proposal we \nhave.\n  This is a question of resources. I believe we have a strong bill that \ncan benefit the children for the reasons I have tried to outline. For \nmany schools across this country that need it, there will be assistance \nwith improvements. We are going to have reconstitution of schools where \nnecessary. We have had a good debate and have taken strong action to \nmake sure the evaluations of our children are going to be effective.\n  I have one more chart, and this illustrates what is happening in \ntitle I schools. The best estimate from the Education Commission of the \nStates is that 10,000 schools at the present time are failing schools. \nUnder the Bush budget, 2,440 of those schools will have some relief.\n\n  The average cost of turning schools around has been estimated at \nabout $180,000. Some do it for less. I have some examples. I will come \nback to those later in the debate. Some have required more. This is the \nbest judgment about what will be necessary.\n  We are saying we ought to use $1.8 billion of the $6.4 billion \nincrease for which this Senate has voted and turn the 10,000 schools \naround. We can do it. We know how to do it. The difference today is we \nknow what works. We know how to educate children. We know what to do, \nand we know how to give them the support they need.\n  This legislation is crafted to create a sense of expectation for \nthose children, to give them the support so they can reach that \nexpectation, to give them the best trained teachers and modern \ncurriculum, support for supplementary services, afterschool programs, \nnew technology--all of those together is what we are committing.\n  We have a good bill which also includes funding for meeting our \nresponsibilities for special needs children under IDEA.\n  We have an opportunity to address the very tragic circumstances the \nSenator from Louisiana has outlined in her excellent presentation, and \nthe unfair circumstances and the disparities about which the Senator \nfrom Ohio talked. We have a way of doing it with the targeted resources \nfor the new money. We can do it in that way, and I certainly support \nusing additional resources and targeting the way her amendment has been \ndevised. But still even with that, we ought to be prepared to make the \ncommitment to the children of this country that no child is going to be \nleft behind.\n  That is what I thought the President wanted in his statement on \neducation and what we can do.\n  With the passage of this legislation fully funded, we address the \nchallenge the Senators from Louisiana and Ohio have put before us. We \ninclude funding for IDEA which will make the difference in local \ncommunities that are hard pressed to provide for the special needs \nchildren.\n  Over the next 5 to 7 years, the progress we have seen in local \ncommunities that utilize what we have included in this legislation will \nresult in an important upgrading of the educational capabilities for \nthe neediest children in this country.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana for bringing this to our \nattention. No one can look at the illustrations the Senator presented \nand not believe this is grossly unfair. Also, no one can listen to the \nSenator from Louisiana talk about the progress that is being made in \nthese classrooms when children are given the support they need, which \nthey ought to receive, which we can do, but which they are being denied \nbecause we are not giving the funding.\n  We will miss an extraordinary opportunity if we fail to respond in a \npositive way to the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana and to the \nbroader issue raised by her amendment, and that is the funding for \ntitle I and the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I inquire as to how much time is \nremaining under the unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 22 minutes 23 seconds. The \nopposition has 25 minutes 32 seconds.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield myself 10 of those minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I see some of my colleagues coming to \nthe Chamber to speak on this amendment. Let me follow up, if I can, \nsome of the points Senator Kennedy made. He is absolutely right.\n  We have made in the last several weeks in this debate a tremendous \namount of progress, taking some of the best ideas offered by our \ncolleagues on the Republican side, some of the best ideas offered on \nthe Democratic side. The President himself has come forward with a \nnumber of good ideas that have now been weaved into this underlying \nbill. We are in the process of perfecting it. Some amendments offered \non this floor have strengthened the underlying bill, including \naccountability, moving our money in a more targeted fashion.\n  Hopefully, with this amendment, we will take a giant step toward that \nparticular goal, encouraging our system to start rewarding success, to \nstop funding failure, expecting good things from our teachers and our \nschools, then providing resources. All of these elements are important \nto the underlying bill.\n  Let me stress one thing I have said on the floor on many occasions: \nInvestment without accountability is a waste of resources. \nAccountability without resources is a waste of time. We don't have a \nlot of time to waste. A childhood goes by so quickly. Those critical \nearly years move quickly. These children cannot wait 3, 4, or 5 years \nto receive the training in reading and basic skills allowing for the \nfoundation for an education that brings prosperity to themselves, \nwealth to their families, and hope to their children and to their \ngrandchildren. We don't have a lot of time to waste.\n  Adopting this amendment is one step. Whatever money is allocated can \nbe targeted better, and these presentations have shown where the gaps \nare. Senator Kennedy is absolutely correct when he says this is just \none step; without the funding to back up this targeting amendment, \nwithout the funding necessary so the Federal Government can live up to \nthe responsibilities of funding special education, we will literally be \npassing a bill that might have a lot of fancy words, might even have a \nfew wonderful quotes and thrilling lines; however, it will not have the \npower attached to change the lives of children if we do not match the \nresource to the rhetoric.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This will be a lost opportunity for millions of children \nif we fail to provide the investments in the future of our country. \nIsn't that what this is about, trying to make sure children will have \nthe ability to read, to do basic math?\n  Does the Senator agree, we have a good blueprint, but we are reaching\n\n[[Page S6039]]\n\nonly so many children, and without further investment, we are failing \nto meet the opportunity out there; if we fund those programs and \ninvest, it is a landmark achievement?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Absolutely. To further illustrate this point, the \ncritics of Federal aid to education say money doesn't matter; the \nchildren can't learn, or it will not help.\n  Studies have proven them wrong. I have tried to show in my \npresentation when investments are made, coupled with accountability, \nfantastic results are achieved.\n  Another argument is we have spent so much money in 30 years and \nnothing is improving. Let me give the real facts for the record: Title \nI has barely kept pace with inflation. When it was created, 26 percent \nof our children were in poverty. Senator Johnson said: This is a \nshame. The Federal Government has a special role to play. These \nchildren don't live in communities with Fortune 500 companies. They \ndon't live in wonderful homes with paved streets and running water and \nparks in which to play. There are districts, schools, places in \nAmerica, rural and urban, where schools are having a hard time fixing \nthe roof and turning the water on, let alone getting computers and \nlearning. President Johnson said: let's step up to the plate. We put up \nsome money. It was not enough then, and it is not enough now.\n\n  To fault the children for not learning or the teachers--because they \ncannot teach 35 children in their class, or they cannot teach if there \nis a rainstorm because they have to move to another class, and we \nwonder why they lose a few hours of instruction--is beyond \ncomprehension. It has barely kept pace with inflation. It has been a \n2.9-percent increase.\n  When I care about something in my house in my budget, I spend more \nthan 2 percent on it. I might invest 10 percent, 20 percent, or make \ninvestments. Barely 2 percent a year overall was spent on education. \nSome of the money we have added has been for education generally in \nmany new programs but not targeted to those students in rural and urban \nareas who needed the most help.\n  Let me close with one or two points. First, I commend President Bush \nfor stating now on many occasions, in private meetings as well as \npublicly, that he supports targeting. He knows that in order to make \nhis pledge real to not leave any child behind, the Federal Government \nmust be a partner to those schools and to those children who \ndesperately need someone to believe in them, to invest in them, and \ngive hope.\n  The second point: Not only does the President support targeting, and \nhe should be commended for his leadership, but 5 years ago our own \ncongressional commission said there was overwhelming evidence that \nwhile title I had proven to be effective, the title I resources were \nnot being targeted to the children who needed it the most. There were \ntoo many gaps to be filled. The Federal Government was not filling \nthose gaps because the original formula was not correct. So we crafted \na new formula, but we never funded it.\n  This amendment will, for the first time, help fund the formula we \ncrafted, fund a formula the President supports. The only issue \nremaining, which I hope Senator Lieberman will address in his remarks, \nis the fact that the best formulas in the world, the best ideas in the \nworld, aren't worth a hoot if you can't fund them and don't fund them \nto reach these children who want to learn, who can learn, and to help \ntheir parents and teachers help them meet their dreams.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, who is controlling the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is controlling the \ntime.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. How many minutes remain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes, and the opposition has 25 \nminutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Lieberman.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield additional time from the opposition, although I \nknow the Senator is in favor of the proposal. How much time does the \nSenator desire?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. If the Senator has up to 10 minutes, I will be \ngrateful for that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. And 10 minutes to the Senator from Delaware following \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am pleased to rise today to support the amendment \noffered by Senators Landrieu and DeWine, a bipartisan amendment. I \nparticularly express my appreciation to the junior Senator from \nLouisiana for her persistent and principled pursuit of this ideal, \nwhich we believe is essential to the success of the sweeping reforms we \nhave included in this measure and to our paramount goal of helping all \nof America's children, regardless of income, learn at the highest \npossible level.\n  We have said this bill could be described in a phrase that might go \nlike this: ``Invest in reform and insist on results.'' I think we have \nthe insistence on results in the bill now. The question is whether we \nare going to invest in reform. And the question is whether we are going \nto not just put more money into the bill, but as Senator Landrieu has \nsaid, make sure it gets to the kids in America who need it most. That \nis what this amendment aims to do.\n  The underlying bill has the potential to be truly transformational, \nto change not just the way we administer Federal programs but, more \nimportantly, the way we educate our children to help close the \npersistent and pernicious achievement gap separating the haves and \nhave-nots in our country and thereby help better realize the promise of \nequal opportunity, which is the ideal, the driving ideal of American \nlife.\n  All that potential in this bill will be squandered if we do not also \nchange the way we distribute Federal education funding, to target our \nresources on the schools and particularly on the students with the \ngreatest needs.\n  As my colleagues know and Senator Landrieu just indicated, that was \nthe original intent of the ESEA at its programmatic heart, to \ncompensate for local funding inequities within States and help level \nthe educational playing field for disadvantaged children. But the \nreality is that after all these years, 36 years since title I was \nadopted, it is not working in practice as it was designed in principle.\n  The reality is that title I is not nearly as focused on serving high-\npoverty communities and children as it is supposed to be and that many \npoor children, therefore, are not getting the aid and attention they \ndeserve and need.\n  Our amendment aims to fix that imbalance, to renew the true mission \nof title I, and do so in a way that will enable the bill before us to \nmake good on its promise. Across party lines, as we have worked on this \nbill, we fought for the tough new accountability system included in the \nproposal to hold our educators responsible for meeting high standards \nand to impose real consequences for chronic failure--in fact, not to \naccept failure in the education of our children. But this engine of \nreform--accountability--could turn into a form of punishment for our \nchildren if we do not back up these demands with new dollars and \nchannel those dollars to the most disadvantaged cities and towns, to \nthe places that have the most ground to make up. That is exactly what \nthis amendment would do.\n  I suspect many people are under the impression this is already the \ncase and wonder why this amendment is necessary. The fact is, we \ncontinue to spread title I dollars too thin and too wide. According to \na report by the CRS, 58 percent of all schools in our country receive \nat least some title I funding, including many suburban schools with \npredominantly well-off students. Of the schools that receive no title I \nsupport at all, on the other hand, a disturbing number have a high \nconcentration of poor students. In fact, one out of every five schools \nwith poverty rates between 50 percent and 75 percent do not get a dime \nof title I funding--not any title I funding at all. That happens, of \ncourse, because of the formulas. We do not provide enough funding to \nserve every eligible student creating a zero-sum game played through \nformulas, and the formulas we use are poorly targeted to need.\n\n  Most title I funds are distributed through the basic grants formula. \nIn\n\n[[Page S6040]]\n\nthe current year, 85 percent of the $8.6 billion appropriated went \nthrough that channel. But under that channel, any district with at \nleast 2 percent of its students living below the poverty level \nqualifies for funding. That threshold is so low that more than 9 out of \nevery 10 school districts in America receive some title I dollars. As a \nresult, not nearly enough funding is left over to meet the burdens of \nthe highest poverty districts.\n  Congress recognized the problem and sought to begin to fix it in the \nreauthorization of this legislation in 1994 with broad bipartisan \nsupport. We adopted a new formula, the targeted grants formula, which \nis the only one of the four title I funding formulas that is \nspecifically designed to address the unique needs of school districts \nwith high concentrations of poverty. As an indication of the high \npriority we have placed on that formula, the 1994 reauthorization \ndirected that all new funding above the fiscal year 1994 level be \nallocated under that formula. Unfortunately, we have not abided by that \nrequirement and not one dime of funding has yet to pass through that \ntargeted formula.\n  In the first instance, the appropriators made that choice, but I \nwould say to my colleagues, we are all complicit in it. We have all \nvoted to approve those bills. We have all overlooked the inequities in \nthe system. We are all responsible for the consequences of a funding \nsystem that promises one thing and delivers quite another.\n  There is more than a matter of basic equity here because studies show \nus that poor children, living in areas with high concentrations of \npoverty, are at far more risk of educational failure than poor children \nliving in more affluent areas. Therefore, those areas of concentration \nneed more help.\n  Thanks to my friend and colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, I \nthink we have met half the challenge facing us. This bill, through the \nDodd amendment, calls for funding of title I, full funding of title I. \nThat is a very significant statement, which I hope the President will \nembrace as we continue to negotiate on appropriations levels. This \namendment would meet the second half of the challenge and make the \nfirst half work as the bill originally was intended to do. It would put \nthe Senate on record again in support of funding the targeted formula, \nbut would do so with some teeth by saying that no new title I dollars \ncould be allocated under this bill until we sufficiently fund the \ntargeted formula.\n  This is a matter not of parochial interest but of national interest \nbecause of the critical national interest we have in developing all of \nAmerica's human capital to realize the promise of opportunity but also \nto benefit our society and our economy. That is why several prominent \nand diverse groups are joining in backing this amendment that we are \noffering, including: the United States Chamber of Commerce, the \nCongressional Black Caucus, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the \nEducation Trust, the American Federation of Teachers, the National \nEducation Association, the National League of Cities, the National \nUrban League, and the National Alliance of Black School Educators. They \nhave said publicly that they believe better targeting is critical to \nclosing the achievement gap.\n  We know some of our colleagues who may agree with us in principle may \nbe reluctant to support this amendment, perhaps because they do not \nwant to get the bill caught up in a formula fight. But without the \nformula debate, without guaranteeing that the funds flow to the most \nneedy children, this bill will ultimately not mean very much.\n  I would also say the fight occurred 7 years ago and Congress stated \nunequivocally that all new title I funding should be channeled through \nthe title I formula. All we are doing with this amendment is trying to \nget us to abide by the agreement that was made and adopted 7 years ago.\n  There is an important principle at issue here that I hope we do not \nforget. This bill is ultimately not about number runs or aggregate \nState dollars received. It is not about who wins or who loses in States \nand districts. This is about the lives of children across America who \ndepend on us to do what is best for them. Ultimately, we do not fund \nStates or districts, or even schools. We fund children and their \neducation.\n  At the Federal level it has been our special mission to help the \nNation's poorest children, to see that they get a fair shot at the \nAmerican dream.\n  I appeal to my colleagues in this Chamber and in the other body not \nto judge this bill by how much it does for our particular States or how \nmuch it does for a particular House district but by how much it does \nfor our neediest children. This amendment will take us a long way in \nthat principal direction.\n  I thank my fellow cosponsors. I thank President Bush who on numerous \noccasions--most recently in a bipartisan meeting at the White House \nlast week on this underlying bill before us--said he understands that \nto realize the goal he has set, which is to leave no child behind in \nour education system, we can't just put the money out there, we have to \ntarget the money to the kids who need it most.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am happy to support Senator Lieberman, \nBayh, DeWine, and Landrieu's targeting amendment today. This initiative \nsymbolizes what the New Democrats stand for.\n  Targeting ESEA money to the children most in need has long been one \nof our top priorities. It is commonly assumed that title I is already \ntargeted to poor children.\n  In reality, 85 percent of all title I funds are allocated according \nto the basic grant formula that does not take concentration of poverty \ninto account.\n  The remaining 15 percent, which last year was $1.2 billion, was \ndistributed amongst two-thirds of our Nation's schoolchildren.\n  Under this plan, districts with 15 percent poverty received the same \nproportional benefit as districts with 90 percent poverty. That's why, \nthe last time we reauthorized ESEA, we created the targeted grants \nformula. It was an effort to direct the scarce resources to the areas \nof highest poverty. We had good intentions, but bad follow-through. The \ntargeted grants formula has never been funded.\n  I know that changing a funding formula is a detailed and complicated \nendeavor--whether it is transportation dollars, the Older Americans \nAct, or title I. But we must make the difficult decisions--and in \nessence, get more for our dollars. The more we are able to concentrate \nour resources in areas most in need, the more we can close the \nachievement gap in our Nation.\n  This amendment should be even less complicated than I have described \nabove, because we do not seek to change the formula, we only ask that \nwe follow the formula that we established in law.\n  Some of the debate during this reauthorization has been about the \nrole of the Federal Government in K-12 education.\n  What should the Federal Government be doing in this area that is so \npredominately in the jurisdiction of State and local governments. My \nview is that the federal role is to level the playing field in our \nnation of such diversity.\n  Every child should have an equal chance to have a solid public school \nfoundation on which to build their life. The Federal Government--\nalthough only supplying about 7 percent of the funding for K-12 \neducation, should direct that money to those students most in need. \nTitle I was created for the purpose of doing just that.\n  This amendment, and the leadership of Senators Landrieu and \nLieberman, get us closer to that level playing field. I am proud to \njoin Senator DeWine and others, in supporting one of the Senate New \nDemocrats' top priorities.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Landrieu \nand DeWine in offering an amendment that we believe is essential to the \nsuccess of the sweeping reforms included in this reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA and to our paramount goal \nof helping all children learn at a high level.\n  This bill has the potential to be truly transformational, to change \nnot only the way we administer Federal programs but the way we educate \nour children across this country, to help close the persistent and \npernicious achievement gap separating the haves from the have nots in \nthis country, and in time to help realize the promise of equal \nopportunity for every American\n\n[[Page S6041]]\n\nchild. But we are afraid that potential could be squandered if we do \nnot also change the way we distribute Federal education funding to \ntarget our attention and resources on the schools and students with the \ngreatest needs.\n  As my colleagues know, that was the original intent of ESEA and its \nprogrammatic heart, Title I--to compensate for local funding inequities \nwithin states and help level the educational playing field for \ndisadvantaged children. But the reality is, as we intend to show today, \nTitle I is not working in practice as it was designed in principle. The \nreality is that Title I is not nearly as focused on serving high-\npoverty communities as it is perceived to be, and that many poor \nchildren are not getting the aid and attention they deserve and need as \na result.\n  Our amendment aims to fix that imbalance, to renew the true mission \nof Title I, and to do so in a way that will make the bill before us \nmake good on its promise. We as New Democrats fought for the tough new \naccountability system included in this proposal. We fought to hold our \neducators responsible for meeting high standards, and to impose real \nconsequences for chronic failure. But this engine of reform for schools \ncould turn into a form of punishment for children if we do not back up \nthese demands with new dollars, and channel those funds to the most \ndisadvantaged cities and towns, to the places that have the most ground \nto make up. And that is exactly what our amendment would do--target \nmost of the new Title I dollars to the districts with the highest \nconcentration of poor children.\n  I suspect that many of our colleagues are under the impression that \nthis is already the case and that our amendment is therefore \nunnecessary. But the fact of the matter is that we have and continue to \nspread Title I dollars thin and wide. According to a CRS report, 58 \npercent of all schools receive at least some Title I funding, including \nmany suburban schools with predominantly well-off students, from \nBeverly Hills in California to Greenwich in my home State of \nConnecticut. Of the schools that receive no Title I support at all, on \nthe other hand, a disturbing number have high concentrations of poor \nstudents. In fact, one out every five schools with poverty rates \nbetween 50 percent and 75 percent do not receive any Title I funding at \nall.\n  How does this happen? The answer lies in the fact that we do not \nprovide enough funding to serve every eligible student, creating a \nzero-sum game played through formulas, and that the formulas we use are \npoorly targeted to need. Most Title I funds are distributed through the \nBasic Grants formula--in the current fiscal year, 85 percent of the \n$8.6 billion appropriated went through this channel. Under this \nformula, any district in which at least 2 percent of its students live \nbelow the poverty level qualifies for funding. This threshold is so low \nthat more than 9 out of every 10 districts in America receive some \nTitle I dollars. And, as a result, not nearly enough funding is \nleftover to meet the burdens of the highest-poverty districts.\n  To dramatize the inequities of this distribution system, the \nProgressive Policy Institute prepared what it calls a tale of two \ncities, a comparison of the Title I profiles of Beverly Hills and \nCompton in South Central Los Angeles. On the one hand, Compton has 97 \npercent of its children eligible for free and reduced lunch, compared \nto 8 percent in Beverly Hills; and Compton has 43 percent of its \nstudents from families on welfare, compared to 4 percent in Beverly \nHills. On the other hand, Beverly Hills has a tax revenue base that is \n400 percent higher than Compton; Beverly Hills has 90 percent of its \nteaching force certified, while Compton has 37 percent; Beverly Hills \nstudents rank consistently in the 80th percentile on national math and \nreading tests in 4th and 8th grade, while Compton students hover around \nthe 25th percentile. Yet when it comes to Title I funding, Beverly \nHills receives $597 per eligible student, while Compton receives $720. \nThose figures just don't add up, logically or morally. How can we \nexpect Compton to compensate for all its disadvantages with just $123 \nmore per student?\n  Congress recognized this problem and sought to begin fixing it in the \nreauthorization of the ESEA in 1994. With broad bipartisan support, we \nadopted a new formula, the Targeted Grants formula, which is the only \none of four Title I funding formulas that is specifically designed to \naddress the unique needs and challenges of school districts with high \nconcentrations of poverty. And as an indication of the high priority we \nplaced on this new formula, the 1994 reauthorization further directed \nthat all new funding above the FY 1994 level be allocated under this \nformula.\n  Unfortunately, Congress has yet to abide by this requirement, and not \none dime of funding has yet to pass through the Targeted formula. This \nis a choice that the appropriators have consistently made, but I would \nsay to my colleagues that we are all complicit in it. We have all voted \nto approve these appropriations bills for the past seven years. We have \nall overlooked the inequities of this system. And we are all \nresponsible for the consequences of this funding system that promises \none thing and delivers another.\n  We are speaking out today because those consequences are too serious \nand the stakes for this bill too high to tolerate the status quo any \nlonger. We must realize that by spreading Title I funds so thin and \nwide, we are seriously diluting their impact, undermining the \neffectiveness of this critical program, and undercutting the promise of \nequal opportunity for all children. This dilution is evident in my own \nState, where in the 1999-2000 school year, 74 percent of Connecticut's \nschool districts had student poverty percentages of less than 15 \npercent, and received a combined total of about $8 million in Title I \nfunds. In addition, 30 percent of the school districts had student \npoverty percentages of less than 5 percent and received a combined \ntotal of about $2.5 million in Title I funds.\n  Our point is not that poor children living in those more middle class \nand affluent areas do not need help. They certainly do. We are simply \nsaying that given our limited Federal resources, we have an obligation \nto focus first on those communities that have the greatest needs and \nthe least capability to meet them on their own. The fact of the matter \nis that 40 percent of all students eligible for Title I live in the \nNation's 200 poorest communities. It is those communities where the \nachievement gap is most pronounced. And it is those communities that \nmust be our priority if we are going to ensure that no child is left \nbehind.\n  This is more than a matter of basic equity. Studies show us that poor \nchildren living in areas with high concentrations of poverty are at far \nmore risk of educational failure than poor children living in more \naffluent areas. A comparison of Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, \nTAAS, results, for example, found that after controlling for income, \nlow-income students in Alamo Heights Schools District, with only 17 \npercent poverty, had much higher rates of passage than those in San \nAntonio, with 88 percent poverty. Sixty-one percent of Alamo Heights' \nlow-income students passed the TAAS, versus only 39 percent in San \nAntonio. And looking more broadly, a study from the U.S. Department of \nEducation concluded that ``the relationship between family poverty \nstatus and student achievement is not as strong as the relationship \nbetween school poverty concentrations and school achievement \naverages.''\n  It is particularly in places like San Antonio and Compton that we are \nhoping to drive real change with the reform plan before us. Many of \nthese disadvantaged districts are already making significant progress \nin turning around underperforming schools and turning up their academic \nachievement. I am particularly proud of what Hartford has accomplished \nsince the State declared it an educational disaster area and took over \nthe school system. We want to encourage other districts to pursue the \nsame kind of bold reforms. We want to provide them with the resources \nand the freedom to make those reforms work. And at the end of the day, \nwe are for the first time going to hold them accountable for producing \nresults.\n  But we have good reason to be skeptical about this bill's \neffectiveness if we do not target funding to those communities that \nneed it most. Indeed, we may be setting up many poor students and \ndisadvantaged schools to fail. This is basic math. We cannot \nrealistically expect high-poverty schools, who have\n\n[[Page S6042]]\n\nthe farthest to climb, to fill acute shortages of qualified math and \nscience teachers, to invest in innovative curricula and teaching \nmethods, and to do whatever else it takes to meet the ambitious goals \nset out in this new system without substantial additional support. That \nmeans not only more Title I funding, but far better targeting.\n  Thanks to my friend and colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, we \nhave met half the challenge. This bill, through the Dodd amendment, \ncalls for full funding of Title I, and that is a significant statement, \nwhich I hope the President will heed as we continue to negotiate on \nappropriation levels. Our amendment would meet the second half of the \nchallenge. It would put the Senate on record again in support of \nfunding the Targeted formula, by saying that no new Title I dollars can \nbe allocated until we sufficiently fund the Targeted formula. We know \nthis formula, like any formula, is far from perfect, and it is going to \nhave its own quirks in equity. But it's the best we have got, and until \nwe find a better way, which I hope we will, we need to fund it.\n\n  Several prominent groups and advocates for disadvantaged children are \njoining us in this effort--Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional \nHispanic Caucus, the American Federation of Teachers, Education Trust, \nNational League of Cities, National Urban League, National Alliance of \nBlack School Educators, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. They have \nsaid publicly that they believe better targeting is critical to closing \nthe achievement gap.\n  We know some of our colleagues who may agree with our principle will \nbe reluctant to support this amendment because they do not want to get \ncaught up in a formula fight. To them I would simply say we already had \nthis fight. It was settled seven years ago when Congress stated \nunequivocally that all new Title I funding should be channeled through \nthe Targeted formula. All we are doing with this amendment is trying to \nget us to abide by that peace treaty. This is just restating what is \nalready the law.\n  But there is an important principle at issue here that we cannot \nforget. This is not about number runs or State aggregates, or who wins \nor who loses. This is about the lives of children who depend on us to \ndo what is best for them, not our political fortunes. Ultimately, we do \nnot fund States or districts or even schools. We fund children. And at \nthe Federal level, it has been our special mission to help the nation's \npoorest children to see that they get a fair shot at the American \ndream.\n  As of today that's not happening. Not when 63 percent of African-\nAmerican and 58 percent of Latino fourth-graders are reading below \nbasic levels, according to the most recent NAEP results, compared to 27 \npercent of whites. Not when 60 percent of disadvantaged fourth-graders \nare reading below basic, compared to 26 percent of advantaged. And not \nwhen African-American and Hispanic 12th-graders on average read and do \nmath at the same level as 8th-grade white students.\n  What we do today is not going to singlehandedly erase this \nachievement gap, which is a national disgrace. That is going to take a \nlot of hard work by dedicated educators, most of which will occur \nschool by school, classroom by classroom. But it will make a real \ndifference, and for that reason I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment and the larger cause of targeting.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been informed by Senator Kennedy that \nwe have two final speakers before the vote. Senator Carper is going to \nspeak for 10 minutes, and the Senator from Wyoming is going to speak \nfor 15 minutes on an unrelated subject. I alert everyone that we will \nprobably vote at about 5:20. I don't know who is first with these two \nSenators. After that, I believe that basically all time will be used. \nThe opposition has been kind enough to yield time. But the time for \nSenator Carper is still controlled by the Senator from Louisiana. She \nhas already yielded to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank both Senator Landrieu and Senator \nLieberman for the leadership they have shown in getting us on the right \ntrack--I think the track we intended to be on.\n  A friend of mine who used to be my education adviser when I was \nGovernor of Delaware for a number of years used to say that all of us \ncan learn but some of us learn differently. Some of us learn faster \nthan others, but all of us can learn.\n  We are talking about title I, which is a program the Federal \nGovernment introduced some 35 years ago to really make sure that young \npeople in our schools--very young people and not so young people--who \nneed extra help in learning to read are going to get it. If they need \nextra help in math, they are going to get it. Our job is to make sure \nthey get that extra help which they need to enable them to be \nsuccessful.\n  We are seeking through the debate in the last couple of weeks, and \ncertainly the debate through this week, to redefine the Federal role in \neducation. Nobody here believes the role of the Federal Government in \neducation is to run our schools in Delaware, Nebraska, or in any other \nState. The role of the Federal Government, as Senator Lieberman said, \nis to try to help level that playing field so that all kids have a real \nshot at meeting the academic standards that have been established in \ntheir States.\n  In the course of the debate on this bill, we are agreeing on a number \nof important principles. One is that we ought to be investing more \nmoney and to transition Federal resources to raise student achievement. \nWe ought to give that money to schools so that school districts have \nmore flexibly with fewer strings, that we can provide more money and \nfewer strings, that we ought to require results and demand results. \nThat means accountability and consequences for schools and students who \ndo well, as well as for those who do not do well.\n\n  Another thing on which we agree is the need for parents to have \ngreater choices in where they send their kids to school--to have a \npublic school choice and charter schools as well.\n  During the course of this debate, one of the things I have learned--\nand Senator Lieberman just said it again--is that for a lot of our \nschools around the country that have a fair amount of poverty, we don't \nfund title I. It is a strange thing. In a school where the level of \npoverty is over 50 percent, over half the kids are getting free or \nreduced-price lunches. That is a school where we can provide title I \nmoney and extra learning time for kids who need it. But in about 20 \npercent of our schools, we don't do that at all.\n  Nobody here is interested in throwing money at the problem. We are \ninteresting in investing money in programs that work, especially where \nthe need is the greatest.\n  I have stood here on the floor in the last couple of weeks and talked \nabout three programs that we know work where we don't invest the money \nwe ought to be investing. The first is Head Start. We provide Head \nStart funding for fewer than half of the eligible 3- and 4-year-olds in \nthis country. States such as Delaware and Ohio have provided extra \nmoney on their own to help make it possible for all 4-year-olds in \nDelaware, for example, to be in the Head Start Program. But nationally, \nthe Federal Government provides Head Start money for fewer than half of \nthe eligible 3- and 4-year-olds. We know it works. We just do not \nprovide the money.\n  Another program is the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act \nand Federal money for special education programs. We are supposed to, \nby agreement, provide up to 40 percent of the funds in States across \nAmerica for students in special education programs. Do we do that? No. \nWe don't provide 40 percent, or 30 percent, or 20, or even 10 percent \nof the funding. We know it works. But we don't invest the money.\n  The third program we are talking about today with title I is the \nExtra Learning Time Program, which the Federal Government funds. We \ndon't fund money for every child who is eligible for the program. We \ndon't provide extra money and time for even half of the kids who are \neligible. It is one out of three; that is all.\n  In a situation where we know the program works and we know that if we \ninvest the money we will raise student achievement, in the situation \nwhere we have a little more money in terms of\n\n[[Page S6043]]\n\nour budget surplus than we have had in recent years, having taken some \nof that money off the table through a tax cut--we don't have unlimited \nmoney--I think it is incumbent on us, as we increase the spending, to \nspend a little extra money in this title I for Extra Learning Time. \nLet's spend it where the kids are most needy. Let's target that money \nwhere it will make the most difference. It is really common sense.\n  Let me close by saying this. I talk a lot about Delaware. That is the \nState I know most about, just as other Members know about Louisiana, \nNebraska, or their respective States. I visited a little school in \nsouthwestern Delaware a week or so ago, West Seaford Elementary. I met \nwith the principal, a number of the teachers, and an administrator or \ntwo. We talked about a variety of ways in which we are trying to raise \nstudent achievement. I will mention a couple of them.\n  There is a State program in the department that provides services for \nchildren. Their emphasis is to put in that school a social worker--a \nfamily crisis therapist who is a go-between for that school and the \nfamilies who are in a crisis to work; a go-between to help make sure \nwhatever is going wrong at home gets fixed--the child has a better \nlearning environment at home, and the parents will be able to work with \nthe kids at school.\n\n  I met with a woman who coordinates the mentoring program. She comes \nin every week and works with kids to help them in this school. There \nwas also a teacher in the room funded by smaller classroom size \nappropriations. In other words, we provide money for smaller \nclassrooms. They use that money to hire extra teachers. There was a \nlady there who was funded out of that. Finally, there was a title I \nteacher there who worked with kids, especially with their reading.\n  These were part of the team that works very successfully at West \nSeaford to make it possible for just about every kid to reach the \nstandards we set in our State in reading and writing and math.\n  One of the best things we have done in this legislation is provide \nsome extra money and provide more flexibly so that schools such as West \nSeaford can use those disparate sources of State and Federal and local \nmoneys in ways that they know will work to help their kids do better.\n  While I applaud the fact that we are providing extra money through \nthis authorization bill--and we are going to provide that money with \nmore flexibility--we demand accountability.\n  Hopefully, tomorrow with the Carper-Gregg amendment, we will work a \nlittle more on poverty parents through public schools and charter \nschools. I think it is important, as we spend those extra dollars, to \nmake sure they go to the schools where the need is the greatest.\n  In this day and age where one out of every five schools and where \nwell over half of the kids living in poverty don't have access to the \nhelp they get in title I, that is wrong. We can fix it here. My hope is \nthat by agreeing to this amendment, we will do just that.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we are debating education, and we are \ndebating a new direction in education. That is what the overall \ndifference is that I address in the amendment. The new direction we are \ntalking about is increased flexibility so that the schools can use the \nmoney to the best advantage possible.\n  I am really pleased to see a lot of funds come to Wyoming. But there \nwas a small amount that we could not use. By the time we wanted to hire \nthe required administrator, there was no money left in the program. Now \nwe will be able to combine those programs and have fewer administrators \nand, hopefully, less paperwork.\n\n  To listen to the debate, it grows more and more to sound as if the \nFederal Government should fund all of education. The States fund 93 to \n94 percent of education. What we are trying to do is to allow them to \nuse the money--that little bit of money they get from the Federal \nGovernment--as effectively as possible.\n  I had an intern who worked for me. He had been a principal at a \nschool and he got a leave of absence. He came to Washington and did a \nlittle checking to see what happened to the paperwork he had to fill \nout for years and years. He was delighted to find that every piece of \npaper he sent back to Washington was well read. It was examined to make \nsure every t was crossed and every i was dotted. It was examined to \nmake sure every blank was filled in, and that it was filled in \nproperly.\n  What he was disappointed to find out was that that was the end of the \nroad for that piece of paper. We provide 6 to 7 percent of the money, \ndepending on whose figures you use, and we force over 50 percent of the \npaperwork. How do we do that? We build a huge bureaucracy in \nWashington. Every time we do a new program or add more funding to a \nprogram, we hire more bureaucrats in Washington; the money does not get \nto the classroom.\n  Throughout the debate, you will hear that we do not provide the money \nfor--fill in the blank--or we do not provide enough money for--fill in \nthe blank. Remember, what the Federal Government is doing is providing \nabout 6 to 7 percent of the local funds. It is a State responsibility \nto provide education. They have been doing it. They have had the main \nrole in doing it.\n  In Wyoming, we have a provision in our State constitution that says \nall children will have an equal opportunity for education. We have had \ncourt cases over the years that have determined the money has to go to \nthe State and the State has to distribute it on an equal basis, so that \nall kids get an equal education.\n  That is a difficult thing to do. We have a lot of rural communities. \nWhen you have rural communities, they have different needs and \ndifferent capabilities than a city. A big high school in a city might \nbe able to provide a wide range of courses. A small rural area might \nonly be able to offer the basic courses. Is that an equal education? It \nis very difficult to determine.\n  But it sounds to me, from a lot of the discussion, that it is time we \npress the States to make sure they are providing an equal education. It \nhas not been our fault that some schools get a lot more funding and \nsome schools get a lot less funding. There are some exceptions, and we \ntry to take care of those exceptions. But I do not think we are placing \nnearly enough pressure on the States to do the job of having equality \nthat would solve a lot of the problems we are talking about in this \nChamber.\n  But today I mainly want to talk about the issue of technology. \nSenator Dorgan brought that up early this morning. He and I have an \namendment on which we have been working. Senator Cantwell and I have \nbeen working on another amendment.\n  Mr. President, as a former computer programmer and someone who is \nvery interested in technology and all its applications, I am glad to \nknow that increasing access to technology has been receiving national \nattention. While technology can never replace a caring, qualified \nteacher or involved parents, it can open a child's eyes to worlds they \nmight otherwise never have a chance to experience. I firmly believe \nthat the educational opportunities afforded by technology can and \nshould be harnessed in a child's pursuit of academic success. There is \nalso evidence that the need for skilled workers is rising and \ntechnology is becoming an increasingly valuable asset as students move \nfrom the classroom into the job market. I have been disappointed to see \nthat over the past few years the Federal Government has tried to \nsupport educational technology through a fragmented set of programs \nwith money flowing through multiple bureaucratic agencies. This kind of \ndisorganized Federal funding has generated tremendous amount of \nbureaucratic redtape that has not helped States and local school \ndistricts ensure that all children have access to technology.\n  The legislation that we are debating today, the overall bill, S. 1, \nthe Better Education for Students and Teachers Act, changes all this. \nIt consolidates current technology programs authorized through the \nElementary and secondary Education Act to create a targeted State \nformula program geared towards improving the use of technology in the \nclassroom. This change in the structure of Federal technology programs \nis a great thing for small or predominantly rural States such as \nWyoming, which may not receive enough money from a particular \ncategorical program, as I mentioned earlier, to effectively achieve the \ngoal of\n\n[[Page S6044]]\n\nincreasing technology. When this legislation passes, Wyoming will have \nthe ability to use Federal funds to implement the technology programs \nthey believe will be most useful to students. This legislation also \nmakes it easier for States that may not have the resources to hire a \nprofessional grant writer and are therefore at a disadvantage when it \ncomes to applying for the competitive grants that have traditionally \nbeen used to allocate technology funding.\n  Under this new formula, States will have the flexibility to implement \ntechnology to support and expand school reform efforts with a focus on \nimproving student achievement and academic performance, provide ongoing \nprofessional development to help integrate technology into school \ncurriculum, acquire hardware and software, and repair and maintain \nschool technology equipment.\n  The Better Education for Students and Teachers Act supports a \ncomprehensive system to effectively use technology in elementary and \nsecondary schools to improve academic achievement and student \nperformance. Specifically, the goal of title II, part C of this \nlegislation is to assist every student in crossing the digital divide \nby ensuring that every child is technologically literate by the time \nthey finish the eighth grade.\n  I am pleased to report that Senator Dorgan and I have completed work \non an amendment that will help to give rural schools comprehensive \nassistance to make sure that our children have the technological \nbackground they will need to be successful in the 21st century. Senator \nCantwell and I have also drafted an amendment that will help ensure \nthat the findings of the Web-based Education Commission, of which I was \na member, are used to allow States and local school districts to \neffectively implement technology in a variety of areas.\n  With the increasing national focus on technology, I am pleased to \nreport the State of Wyoming has determined that technology is so \ncritical to their educational success that they have put considerable \ntime and effort into the development, ongoing implementation, and \nrevision of a comprehensive education technology plan. This plan does a \ngreat job of identifying Wyoming's needs, defining our infrastructure \nrequirements, articulating goals for educational technology, and \nproposing strategies for achieving these goals. It was complied by \nteachers, school boards, communities, libraries, State agencies, \nbusinesses, and other interested citizens from around the State.\n  Wyoming outlined some ambitious objectives in their technology plan, \nsuch as establishing educational partnerships among public and private \nentities, implementing improved professional development geared towards \ntechnology, integrating technology into instructional delivery systems, \nproviding equal access to interactive information resources for all \nstudents, and creating an evaluation process to determine if their plan \nis working. As Federal legislators we must clear away any obstacles and \nunnecessary redtape that would slow or stop the implementation of the \ngoals that so many people in Wyoming have worked so hard to develop.\n  I would also like to stress that the appropriate use of technology in \neducation can and should go beyond the classroom. For example, Wyoming \nhas also done a great job of utilizing Federal technology funds in an \ninnovative way by establishing a website--that is, \nwww.wyoming.edgate.org--that provides services for students, teachers \nand parents. If you want to know how your child's school is doing, you \ncan go to the web site and find out. This website also allows teachers \nto access innovative curriculum ideas, gain information about \nprofessional development options, or access the latest information on \nteaching techniques. Students can get help on their homework. They can \nview notes from their teachers, or even research a science project. \nParents have the ability to check on their child's homework \nassignments, gain information on options for paying for college, get \nideas about how to talk to their kids about drugs, or even check their \nschool's test scores to ensure instant accountability. While Wyoming \nwas able to use Federal funds for this program, current law required \nthe State to expend valuable time and resources to get a waiver from \nthe Federal Government.\n  I am also very pleased with Wyoming's efforts to develop a distance \neducation system that will allow kids in any high school across the \nState to participate in courses such as advanced placement English and \ncalculus, Japanese, Russian, art history, sociology, anthropology, and \non and on. It has made selection of classes in the very rural schools \nmuch greater than it was before.\n\n  Considering the rural and sometimes geographically isolated nature of \nsome of Wyoming's communities, it is a tremendous asset. This type of \ndistance learning will allow an unprecedented level of educational \nequity in my State, where students in small schools that serve 20 \nstudents or less will be able to receive the same diversity in course \nofferings as students in the much larger schools. It will also allow \nareas that have difficulty recruiting and retaining teachers to share \nin the teaching expertise of other areas of the State without traveling \nthe miles and miles and miles.\n  The same distance learning system also provides Wyoming with great \nopportunities for providing continuity in our professional development \nprograms. Teachers from around the State will now have the chance to \nparticipate in proven and effective professional development that will \nimprove the educational opportunities for all of our students.\n  Speaking of professional development efforts that incorporate \ntechnology, I have been very impressed by the work of project WYO.BEST. \nThis pilot program in Platte County School District No. 1 in Wheatland, \nWY, has been working to help teachers improve their ability to teach in \na standards-based, technology-enriched environment geared towards \nimproving student learning and achievement, and they have been doing \nthis since 1997. Over 100 teachers in southeast Wyoming have received \nsustained training and mentoring in student-centered instructional \napproaches, in standards-based instruction, and in technology \nintegration. All of this has been done under the guidance of their \ndirector of instruction, Roger Clark. I take this opportunity to \ncommend him for his efforts.\n  The progress that has been made by the State of Wyoming is \nimpressive, but we are certainly not alone. States across the country \nhave been making tremendous progress not only in incorporating \neffective uses of technology in the classroom but in preparing students \nto pursue technical careers after graduation.\n  A good example of this is the PPEP TECH High School in Tucson, AZ, \nwhich I recently had a chance to visit. This school is part of a \npublicly financed statewide system that provides an alternative \neducational program for students age 15 through 21 in grades 9-12. The \nschool's primary focus is on providing high academic standards and \ntechnological training for the children of migrant and seasonal farm \nworkers in rural Arizona and for at-risk students, high school \ndropouts, or students who work. Each student is actively engaged in an \nindividualized educational program that helps them obtain a high school \ndiploma, improve their job skills, and continue on the postsecondary \neducation.\n  Laptop computers and 1-800 numbers allow the children of migrant \nworkers to move frequently and still work with the same teachers. They \nsubmit their homework; they get their grades by using the Internet. \nHere is an effort to make sure that no child is left behind.\n  I have also been very impressed with the efforts of an organization \ncalled the JASON Project. This organization offers students and \nteachers in grades 4-9 a comprehensive multimedia approach to enhanced \nteaching and learning in science, technology, math, geography, and \nassociated disciplines. Included in the project's components are State-\naligned curricula, video programming, satellite transmissions, on-line \nactivities, and professional development training. Hands-on learning is \nprovided for the visual learners, while sounds help oral learners to \nachieve. I am pleased to report that 35 teachers in Freemont County, \nWY, are currently preparing to receive training that will enable them \nto participate in this program.\n\n  The JASON Project provides a new program topic each year. For \nexample,\n\n[[Page S6045]]\n\nthe 2001-2002 school topic of ``Frozen Worlds'' will take students and \nteachers on a virtual adventure of some of the colder regions of our \nplanet and solar system, such as Alaska and the polar regions. Students \nwill then examine research questions such as what are the dynamic \nsystems of earth and space; how do these systems affect life on earth; \nwhat technologies do we use to study these systems; and why.\n  As you can see, there are many options that allow teachers and \nstudents to integrate technology into the classroom. Our first \nresponsibility as Federal legislators is making sure States and local \nschool districts have the ability to implement the programs they feel \nare most effective.\n  Once again, I commend my colleagues on the Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions Committee on their hard work on this legislation. I intend \nto support S. 1 and any other legislation that helps States such as \nWyoming by giving them the flexibility they need to determine the best \nway they can help their own students gain access to technology.\n  I encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for 3 additional minutes: 1 minute \nfor the Senator from Louisiana, I would like 1 minute, and 1 minute for \nthe Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator from Massachusetts will \nyield, would the Senator also ask en bloc for the yeas and nays on both \namendments?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays on both amendments, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to ordering the yeas and \nnays with a show of hands? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to say that I am looking forward \nto supporting the Landrieu amendment. It is an excellent amendment. It \nwill, as she pointed out, give greater targeting of resources to the \nchildren who most need it.\n  I am strongly in support of the Bond amendment.\n  We are asking all of those colleagues who have amendments to bring \nthese amendments up. We have been on this bill one way or the other for \n7 weeks. Now the leader has indicated to me that we are going to stay \nuntil we finish this bill this week. Members must bring up their \namendments. Otherwise, we will establish a time for the completion of \nthe bill, and Members will have to come over and object and we will \nconsider their amendments then. The leader has said we will stay this \nweek until we finish.\n  It is Monday now. I hope we can. It is a good bill. We want to \nconsider other amendments that are necessary, but we insist now that \nMembers come over and offer their amendments so we can complete \nconsideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to reiterate the importance of \nhaving the amendments before us. We have been able to go through a \nlarge number of amendments. We agreed upon several about an hour and a \nhalf ago. It is very important that people understand that in order to \nfulfill the will of the American people to really make sure we leave no \nchild behind, we have to finish consideration of the bill. We would \nlike to finish as soon as we can.\n  I, too, support the Bond amendment and the Landrieu amendment, both \nof which involve no new programs, no new money, both of which I believe \nimprove the underlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, in closing, I again thank Senators \nKennedy, Frist, DeWine, Lieberman, Carper, and others, for the \nbipartisan support of this important amendment to a very important \nbill.\n  We have spent 2 hours speaking about the history of title I, the good \nintentions in the way it was originally crafted, but how over time, for \nunderstandable reasons, it has been diluted and is no longer effective, \nparticularly to try to meet the challenges this new piece of \nlegislation, this reform piece of legislation, will present.\n  We have talked about the success stories of title I--that when it is \nproperly directed, it can work because it can reduce class size, extend \nschool time, support students in their learning, providing the help in \nthe classroom where these children need it the most.\n  Let me use 30 seconds in my closing to dispel something that some \nMembers have a question about. The question is, Will my State lose \nmoney?\n  The answer is no. In this amendment, there is a hold harmless \nprovision. No State will lose money. For the record, let me say Iowa \nmoves from $53 million to $69 million, based on a $3.7 billion \ninvestment; Connecticut will move from $82 million to $108 million; \nDelaware will go from $22 million to $31 million; Massachusetts will go \nfrom $177 million to $215 million; Ohio goes from $298 million to $412 \nmillion; Louisiana, my home State, goes from $187 million to $279 \nmillion. But no State loses money.\n  Let me say that title I should be about funding children. It should \nbe about giving children a chance, being a partner with children. \nWhether they live in rural or urban areas, they are poor; they don't \nlive in districts with large companies and a big tax base. If we don't \nhelp, no one will. This amendment is the right thing to do. I ask for a \ngood vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that prior to the \nLandrieu vote, the second in order, there be 1 minute on each side \nbefore the vote occurs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I regret that I was delayed in \nreaching the Senate floor and missed the vote on Senator Bond's \namendment to the Better\n\n[[Page S6046]]\n\nEducation for Students and Teachers Act that would serve to strengthen \nparental involvement in the education of their child.\n  I feel very strongly that parents should play an active and informed \nrole in the education of their child, and I am pleased that my \ncolleague, Senator Bond, offered an amendment to further encourage \nactive and informed parental involvement.\n  Recent studies have helped us better understand the role that our \nbiological development plays in our ability to learn and understand. \nThese studies reinforce the need for early and consistent parental \ninvolvement in their child's social and cognitive development.\n  While I regret being absent during this vote, I am pleased that the \nSenate overwhelmingly agreed to this amendment. Helping parents better \nunderstand their child's developmental stages, and offering more ways \nfor them to be involved in their child's education, will certainly lead \nto better education programs and more opportunities for our \nchildren.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 475\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I speak in the absence of the Senator from Louisiana \nwho is privileged to be off the floor with her mother and father. On \nbehalf of this amendment, which Senator Landrieu, Senator DeWine, and I \nhave cosponsored, we have come together on a bipartisan basis on the \npolicy in this bill to demand educational results for the children of \nour country.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. I hope the Chair \nwill use that gavel vigorously. It will not crack. It only cracked once \nin the history of the Senate.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. In an effort to maintain order, we now have the \nsponsor, and I yield to Senator Landrieu.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask for a vote on our amendment. We had a good 2-hour \ndiscussion about targeting the funds. As I said in my presentation, no \nState will lose money. There is a hold harmless provision in this \namendment. Every State will gain money. Most importantly, this \namendment is there for every child who needs a helping hand, every \nchild who needs the Federal Government to be a partner, so we can make \nsure these children meet their requirements. That is what this \namendment does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute in opposition to the Landrieu amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as a member of the authorizing committee, \nand as now chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on education, we \nput two programs in here in 1994. One was the targeted program. That is \nfine. But then we also put in there what we call the education finance \nincentive grant, which is otherwise known as effort in equity. In other \nwords, a lot of States that need targeted grants, their State \ngovernments are not doing enough to target their money towards the \npoorer school districts. So we added--not just targeted--but we added--\neffort and equity. We wanted to see what was the State doing to \nequalize the funding between the richest districts and poorest \ndistricts. So we added that in as a formula also. This amendment only \nspeaks to the targeted program and does nothing about effort and \nequity.\n\n  A 1998 GAO report found that Federal education programs provide an \nadditional $4.73 for each poor student for every dollar provided for \nall children. In contrast, States provided 62 cents for each poor child \nfor every dollar provided for all children.\n  Senator Landrieu's amendment seeks to improve this record for the \nFederal dollars. We can always do better, but Federal dollars alone \ncannot correct the serious deficiency experienced by many low-income \nschool districts. We must also encourage states to help these \ndistricts.\n  The Targeted Grant and the Education Finance Incentive Grant, in \ntandem, would be a more effective way of helping get additional \nresources to local school districts.\n  By funding the two grants, we accomplish two goals. First we do a \nbetter job of targeting Federal funds. Second, we also provide States \nwith a modest incentive to also help poor schools. The Federal \nGovernment cannot do this job alone.\n  As we proceed to the appropriations bill in the next few months I \nwould like to work with the Senator from Louisiana to accomplish our \nmutual goal of getting more resources to the poorest school districts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS (when his name was called). Mr. President, Mr. Inouye is \nnecessarily absent. If he were to vote, he would vote ``aye.'' If I \nwere permitted to vote, I would vote ``no.'' I withhold my vote and \nannounce a pair with the Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden) is absent \ndelivering a commencement address.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nDelaware (Mr. Biden) and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) would \neach vote ``aye.''\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Madam President, let me begin by especially thanking two \nof our colleagues as we begin this debate about a part of this \ncountry's educational system that, unfortunately, has gotten short \nshrift. For the next few minutes we are going to talk about summer \nschool, which I think is a critical time between the spring achievement \ntests that our youngsters take and that time in the fall when it is so \ncritical to evaluate their performance for the upcoming school year.\n  Suffice it to say, what the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin, and I would like to do is have an opportunity to \nsupercharge those few months in an effort to beef up the test scores, \nparticularly the test scores of math and science, for youngsters across \nthis country.\n  What Senator Sessions and Senator Durbin and I envision is \nestablishing a new demonstration program that would empower States and \nlocal educational agencies to develop models for exceptionally high-\nquality summer academic enrichment programs that would be designed to \nhelp public school students meet those achievement requirements being \nrequired by the States in the performance standards that are being \nestablished.\n  For me, it all came down to what Nehemiah Vaughn told me in Portland \nnot long ago when he was going into the sixth grade. Nehemiah Vaughn \ntold me: Summer school, Mr. Senator, is helping me to raise my grades.\n  I think, as we look at educational reform in this country, we ought \nto think about what students and families are telling us. For example, \nin Baltimore--and we know our colleague, Senator Mikulski, has been \nvery interested in these education issues--the Baltimore Sun had an \nexceptionally important article a few days ago indicating that more \nthan 30,000 children--nearly one-third of Baltimore's public school \npopulation--had failed to meet the tough new promotion standards and \nwere being directed to summer school.\n  So this legislation, which Senator Sessions and I have worked on for \nmany months, on a bipartisan basis, with Senator Durbin especially--and \nwe are pleased to have Senator Landrieu, Senator Breaux, and Senator \nMikulski as bipartisan cosponsors--is an effort to develop these model \nprojects around the country that can be duplicated in the years ahead.\n  We are not saying that we can spend an unlimited sum of money at this \npoint, but we are saying that $25 million is a modest amount of money \nto spend each year over the next few years to set in place these \ndemonstration projects which we believe would then be projects that \ncould be duplicated in school districts across this country.\n  For example, Senator Durbin has done very important work with the \nChicago program which is called the Public School Summer Bridge \nProgram. I happen to share his view that it is going to take a \nsubstantial investment in the years ahead to strengthen these summer \nschool programs.\n  Frankly, I would like to be able to invest a bit more in those \nprograms now. I think it is critically important that one of those \nmajor urban school districts be part of the set of programs that are \nselected when these programs are evaluated by the experts in the field. \nSo I want it understood that his contribution, in my view, is extremely \nimportant.\n  I also note the chairman of the committee, Senator Kennedy, is with \nus. He has again and again and again raised these issues in this Senate \nChamber. I think this country is very fortunate that someone is in this \nChamber who consistently makes it impossible for the Senate to forget \nthese priorities. I express my appreciation to the chairman of the \ncommittee as well for all of his help, and that of the staff.\n\n  Finally, I will yield to my colleague from Alabama. He and I have \nbeen talking about this effort for more than a year. I have always \nthought that the really important work for this country can only be \naccomplished on a bipartisan basis. I think it is clear that when we \nlook at the future of education, it does not get much more important \nthan summer school.\n  It is our hope, the hope of Senator Sessions and I, and Senator \nDurbin, that after we get the results of these demonstration projects--\nand we see\n\n[[Page S6049]]\n\nwhat works and what is most cost effective--we can be in this Chamber \nagain, on a bipartisan basis, making the case to our colleagues that \nthese are the kinds of programs that are going to allow us to use those \nmonths, those precious months between the spring achievement tests and \nthe fall, to make sure that when young people leave in the spring they \nsay more than: See you in September; that they say: See you in summer \nschool, and that they and their families know the programs that truly \nmake a difference.\n  I yield the floor and especially thank my colleague, Senator \nSessions, from Alabama who has worked with me on this for more than a \nyear. And I also recognize the critically important work of Senator \nDurbin.\n  I think when we get the results of these demonstration projects, you \nare going to see the bipartisan team that has advanced this \ndemonstration project effort back in this Chamber again saying that now \nthis country has to make a truly significant investment in summer \nschool because these are programs that make a difference.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I join with Senator Wyden in our \nconcern that summer not be a vacuum for children. I have had, for quite \na number of years, a deep concern that children are losing too much \nover the summer.\n  Every child perhaps does not need to go to summer school. I am not \nperfectly sure how it ought to work. But ultimately I think we have the \nquestion of whether or not we could do a better job in the summer.\n  We do know this. We do know that in an age where we are doing a \nbetter job of testing, we are finding that children are falling behind. \nWe have seen some studies that indicate the normal summer school \nprograms of today have not been very effective in helping those \nchildren who fall behind. So it strikes me as perfectly good sense and \ngood public policy for the U.S. Government to be involved in helping to \nidentify how education is occurring, where the problems are, and to do \ngood scientific research to help our States and local school systems to \nbest understand what is occurring and how they might, with frugal and \nwise use of their money, get the most learning possible by each and \nevery child in a school system.\n  A few years ago, Senator Feinstein and I offered a very serious \namendment to end social promotion. Social promotion is a system where a \nchild is clearly falling behind the minimum standards of education, yet \nthey are passed on because people think that helps them socially.\n  Dr. Paige, the Secretary of Education, from the Houston school system \nbecame the superintendent of that school system when only 37 percent of \nthe students were passing the Houston basic education test. He decided \nto make some serious changes. One of the changes he made was to end \nsocial promotion and to provide more incentives to help children who \nwere falling behind. In 5 years, those passing that test went from 37 \npercent to 73 percent. This was in a huge 210,000-student system in \nHouston, TX, one of the largest school systems in America, facing all \nthe problems that a big inner-city school system would face.\n  He took those tough positions because he loved those children. He did \nnot want to see them just be passed along and not learn, to be not up \nto the level they needed to be, finally reaching a level in school \nwhere they were so far behind, they just dropped out. That is the \npattern he said he saw and was determined to end, and he did a \nremarkable job when he was in Houston of ending that cycle.\n\n  The goal is for us to be a lot more serious about education. The goal \nhas to be to have some change in education. Senator Wyden is correct: \nWe need to ask some of these questions. We need to know what is \noccurring in our school systems.\n  One of the things that is plain and simple is, perhaps if we can \nidentify children who are falling behind in early grades and provide \nthem with a high-quality, well-managed summer school program, we just \nmay be able to achieve special results for those children. And then \nwhen they come back in September, instead of falling even further \nbehind during the summer, they are up and ready to compete with the \nother children in that class.\n  One of the things I strongly believe is appropriate for the Federal \nGovernment to do is to do this kind of research. So we are going to \nhave the Department of Education review these programs, these programs \nin each one of these pilot five States that will be selected. They will \nbe required to submit intense data on what they have done and how they \ndid it. We will have the General Accounting Office as an additional \nindependent evaluator of these school systems.\n  Maybe when we look at them around the country, we can say: This \nclearly works, this is real progress; or, this did not show much good \nprogress. We can use that information to challenge every school system \nin America to use the best available scientific evidence to plan a \nsummer school program that works for every child and focuses not just \non going through the motions of a summer school but actually bringing a \nchild up who has fallen behind, getting them ready to start in the \nfall, motivating them with more confidence than they would have \notherwise had.\n  I am honored to join Senator Wyden on this legislation. We are \nstarting the right way. It has the potential to provide us information \nthat could be extraordinarily valuable. I thank him for his commitment \nand leadership. I thank Senator Durbin, who also is strongly committed \nto summer school programs, for working with us on this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank Senators Wyden and Sessions and \nothers for bringing this amendment to the attention of the Senate. In a \nfew moments, I will urge that the Senate accept the amendment.\n  I want to mention to the two sponsors a very interesting program we \nhad in Boston last summer that was a result of the leadership provided \nby the Federal Reserve in Boston and the PIC and Tom Payzant, who is \nthe superintendent of schools. What they did is provide, with the \nsummer employment program of the mayors, 2 hours of reading for a 6-\nweek period to students who the principles of various schools thought \nwould have difficulty with what they call the MCAS, which is our sort \nof NAEP test, the principal test that is given statewide and the child \ncannot graduate unless that child is going to pass the test.\n  They had some 260 students who were involved in that program. The \naverage progress that was made was 1.7 years. No student advanced less \nthan a year, and many of them were at least 2 years or above. It was \nthe combination of the school system working, in this case, with the \nPIC, which is a combination of the industries, in this case in Boston, \nreally one of the best of the PICs that exist not only in our State but \nin the country, really outstanding leaders in the business community, \nthe labor community, the education community, and the school system. \nThey made it an objective to try to take the summer employment program \nand add the educational component to it.\n  This year they are going to have it for 460 students. That might not \nbe the best one even for Springfield, MA, let alone for Seattle or \nPortland but, nonetheless, it is working. It is an innovative and \ncreative way of trying to develop an education program that is also an \nemployment program where in many instances these children need the \nemployment in the summer as well as the educational program.\n  As I understand, you have sufficient flexibility in the development \nof this program to try to sort of challenge local communities to find \nways in which you can enhance academic achievement in the course of the \nsummer program. At least in Boston it works very well.\n  I was in a plane just last week talking to one of the stewardesses \nwhose family was located in North Carolina. The child was in one of the \nearly grades and had not quite done as well as they should, just missed \nnarrowly, and only had 5 days of a summer program. But the parents were \nvery supportive of it. The child was rather excited about it because \nthey were going to get caught up to the rest of the class.\n  The summer programs are here to stay, hopefully in ways that are \ngoing\n\n[[Page S6050]]\n\nto reach out to children at the lower levels as well as children moving \nthrough the middle schools and high schools.\n  One of the things I find most appealing is the good amendment you \npointed out to try to find out what is happening out there across the \ncountry, what is working, what is demonstrating good results. The \nsummer is really going to be a key time in terms of helping children.\n  The last point I will make is that in looking at the country and \ntrying to enhance education accomplishment, most educators would say, \nparticularly for children who are hard-pressed, that the summer \ninterlude is a dangerous time. Children fall behind. A lot of it is \nthat they are sort of moving along, gradually making some progress. \nThen they run into the summertime, and they fall behind again; they \nhave to start over again. So this summer period--trying to find ways in \nwhich they can have effective programs so children who may be behind a \nlittle bit can catch up, get some advantage, retain the knowledge they \nmay have gained, get some advantage in making up for perhaps some other \narea of need--makes them better prepared in the next full period. All \nof this deserves our thought.\n\n  The good amendment is going to help us do some important work in this \narea. I thank the two Senators for their initiative and those the good \nSenators have referenced for their help as well.\n  If there is no further comment, I ask, what is the question before \nthe Senate at the present time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 450, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 450), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/11/senate-section/article/S6050-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I strongly support S. 994, which would \nextend the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act for 5 years.\n  Current U.S. law imposes economic sanctions on foreign companies that \ninvest in Libya's oil sector, but those sanctions expire on August 5th. \nThe need for the sanctions is as strong today as when they were enacted \nin 1996. They deserve to be extended. Easing sanctions on Libya by \nallowing the law to expire would have a far-reaching negative effect on \nthe battle against international terrorism and the twelve-year pursuit \nof justice for the 270 victims of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.\n  Current law requires the President to impose at least 2 out of 6 \nsanctions listed in the statute on foreign companies that invest more \nthan $20 million in 1 year in Iran's energy sector, or $40 million in 1 \nyear in Libya's energy sector. The 6 sanctions are the following:\n  (1) Denial of Export-Import Bank loans, credits, or credit guarantees \nfor U.S. exports to the firm.\n  (2) Denial of licenses for the U.S. export of military or militarily-\nuseful technology to the firm.\n  (3) Denial of U.S. bank loans exceeding $10 million in 1 year to the \nfirm.\n  (4) If the sanctioned firm is a financial institution, a prohibition \non the firm's service as a primary dealer in U.S. government bonds; \nand/or a prohibition on the firm's service as a repository for U.S. \ngovernment funds.\n  (5) Prohibition on U.S. government procurement from the firm.\n  (6) A restriction on imports from the firm.\n  Under Section 9(c) of current law, the President may waive the \nsanctions on the ground that doing so is important to the U.S. national \ninterest. For Libya, the law terminates if the President determines \nthat Libya has fulfilled the requirements of all U.N. resolutions \nrelating to the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Those conditions, \nwhich were imposed by the international community, require the \nGovernment of Libya to accept responsibility for the actions of its \nintelligence officer, disclose information about its involvement in the \nbombing, provide appropriate compensation for the families of the \nvictims of Pan Am Flight 103, and fully renounce international \nterrorism.\n  President Bush has emphasized his support for these conditions. As he \nstated on April 19, ``We have made it clear to the Libyans that \nsanctions will remain until such time as they not only compensate for \nthe bombing of the aircraft, but also admit their guilt and express \nremorse.'' Yet the Government of Libya continues to refuse to meet the \nconditions of the international community. Until it does, both the \nUnited States and the international community should continue to impose \nsanctions on the regime.\n  Despite the conventional wisdom that economic sanctions do not work, \nthey have been effective in the case of Libya. As a result of the \nUnited Nations sanctions, the U.S. sanctions, and diplomatic pressure, \nthe Libyan Government finally agreed in 1999 to a trial by a Scottish \ncourt sitting in the Netherlands of two Libyans indicted for the \nbombing. Last January 31, one of the defendants, a Libyan intelligence \nagent, was convicted of murder for that atrocity.\n\n  The court's decision clearly implicated the Libyan Government. The \nconviction was a significant diplomatic and legal victory for the world \ncommunity, for our nation, which was the real target of the terrorist \nattack, and for the families of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103.\n  The Iran Libya Sanctions Act is also intended to help level the \nplaying field for American companies, which have been prohibited from \ninvesting in Libya by a Presidential Order issued by President Reagan \nin 1986. The statute enacted in 1996 imposed sanctions on foreign \ncompanies that invest more than $40 million in any year in the Libyan \nenergy sector. The objective of the 1996 law is to create a \ndisincentive for foreign companies to invest in Libya and help ensure \nthat American firms are not disadvantaged by the U.S. sanctions. Since \nthe sanctions on U.S. firms will continue, it is essential to extend \nthe sanctions on foreign firms as well.\n  The Administration has indicated that it has no evidence of \nviolations of the law by foreign companies. But some foreign companies \nare clearly poised to invest substantially in the Libyan petroleum \nsector, in violation of the law. A German company, Wintershall, is \nreportedly considering investing hundreds of millions of dollars in the \nLibyan oil industry.\n  Allowing current law to lapse before the conditions specified by the \ninternational community are met would give a green light to foreign \ncompanies to invest in Libya, putting American companies at a clear \ndisadvantage. It would reward the leader of Libya, Colonel Qadhafi, for \nhis continuing refusal to comply with the U.N. resolutions. It would \nset an unwise precedent of disregard for U.N. Security Council \nResolutions. It would undermine our ongoing diplomatic efforts in the \nSecurity Council to prevent the international sanctions from being \npermanently lifted until Libya complies with the U.N. conditions. And \nit would prematurely signal a warming in U.S.-Libyan relations.\n  Our European allies would undoubtedly welcome the expiration of the \nU.S. sanctions. European companies are eager to increase their \ninvestments in Libya, but they do not want to be sanctioned by the \nUnited States. They are ready to close the book on the bombing of Pan \nAm Flight 103, and open a new chapter in relations with Libya.\n  But the pursuit of justice is not only for American citizens. \nCitizens of 22 countries were murdered on Pan Am Flight 103, including \ncitizens of many European countries. The current sanctions were enacted \non behalf of these\n\n[[Page S6051]]\n\ncitizens as well. Our government should be actively working to persuade \nEuropean countries that it is premature to rehabilitate Libya.\n  Some have proposed extending the law for two years, rather than five \nyears as our bill proposes. I strongly support a five-year extension.\n  If we reduce the time period, Colonel Qadhafi will have an incentive \nto continue stonewalling, as he has done since the verdict was \nannounced last January, and wait until the law expires.\n  Extending the law that requires sanctions on foreign companies that \ninvest in Libya for another five years is in both the security interest \nof the United States and the security interest of the international \ncommunity. Profits in Libya should not come at the expense of progress \nagainst international terrorism and justice for the families of the \nvictims of Pan Am Flight 103.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/11/senate-section/article/S6051-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       INTERNATIONAL FOOD FOR EDUCATION AND NUTRITION ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to join my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senators Lugar, Leahy, Harkin, Durbin, and \nothers, as well as Representative Jo Ann Emerson and Representative Jim \nMcGovern in the House, to speak in favor of the International Food For \nEducation and Nutrition Act of 2001.\n  Mr. President, former Senators Bob Dole and Senator George McGovern \ndeveloped the concept of this bipartisan bill last year. This \nlegislation, which links food to education, is really brilliant in its \nsimplicity, by making permanent an existing international school \nnutrition pilot program.\n  These two dedicated public servants, Senator Dole and Senator \nMcGovern, worked tirelessly in the Senate in years past to feed needy \nchildren both in this country and around the world. Because of them and \nbecause of their leadership and their vision, millions and millions of \nchildren have received nutritious meals and an education. Through their \nefforts, they have given millions of children hope and a future.\n  Mr. President, nearly 30 years ago, on this Senate floor, Senator Bob \nDole and Senator George McGovern formed a bipartisan coalition on \nmatters that had to do with agriculture and domestic food assistance. \nThey led the way in putting in place an expanded network of food stamps \nfor the poor, school lunches and breakfast on a much wider scale, a \nsupplementary feeding program for low-income pregnant and nursing \nmothers and their infants, and nutrition guidelines for the American \npeople.\n  Indeed, Senators Dole and McGovern, through their words and their \ndeeds, have demonstrated a deep and enduring commitment to children \naround the globe.\n  But there is still more to do--much more. Today, we still cannot \nunderstate the importance of school feeding programs in impoverished \ncountries throughout this world. Currently, there are hundreds of \nmillions of children worldwide who are not enrolled in school, in part \nbecause of hunger or malnourishment. We know if there is food at \nschool, children will come, children will attend. The fact is that \nschool feeding programs can reach the poorest of the poor, providing \nnecessary nutrition to children who often do not receive any other food \nthroughout the entire day.\n  As a result, these programs have had a substantial and very positive \nimpact on school enrollment levels and attendance. More and more \nchildren are going to school around the world, and more and more \nchildren are able to learn and become educated. With an education, a \nchild has a future.\n  There is a very simplistic and important link between food and \neducation. My wife, Fran, and I have seen it in our travels to Haiti. \nWe have become good friends with Father Hagan--Tom Hagan--an American \npriest who works so very hard with the poorest of the poor in Haiti. \nOne of the things that Father Hagan does, and is doing today, is making \nthat link between food and education.\n  Father Tom waits until after the school year starts and he sees what \nchildren don't have the money, don't have the ability to enroll in \nschool. He waits a couple weeks and then he opens up his school and \ntakes those children in from the city of Port au Prince, the Cite \nSoleil, the poorest part of the city, the slum, and provides them with \neducation. He not only provides them with education, he provides them \nwith what for most of them is the only meal they will receive, the only \nfood they will receive all day. So the food serves as sort of a magnet, \nbut, at the same time, it gives these young children the nourishment \nthey need so they can concentrate and study and they can learn.\n  Fran and I have seen it firsthand in Haiti. We have seen it in \nNicaragua, we have seen it in other countries where people are working \nto make a difference.\n  What this bill does is put the Congress and this country on record as \nsaying we are committed to doing this around the world. We want to work \nwith other countries and the United States to lead by example. We \ncannot do this all ourselves, but we can provide the initial \nleadership.\n  The specific initiative we are introducing today advances and expands \ncurrent feeding programs by establishing the International Food for \nEducation and Nutrition Program. This new program will enable the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to use funds from the Commodity Credit \nCorporation to purchase U.S. agricultural commodities for use in global \nschool feeding programs. These commodities then would be provided to \nprivate organizations for distribution in recipient countries \nthroughout the world.\n  To facilitate enactment of these programs, our bill also would \nprovide adequate funds for transportation and distribution costs \nassociated with these efforts. It does no good to give food if you \ncannot get it distributed.\n  Our legislation stems from the 1-year pilot program I referenced a \nmoment ago which Senators Dole and McGovern developed and the previous \nadministration launched a year ago. Known as the Global Food for \nEducation Initiative, this $300 million pilot program provides \nnutritious meals to children in 38 countries.\n  Under the program, 14 private volunteer organizations, together with \nthe United Nations World Food Program, are working to provide a free \nbreakfast or free lunch to some 7 million schoolchildren in developing \ncountries. Our legislation is a perfect complement to the current \nPublic Law 480 title II emergency feeding program which helps nourish \nmore than 40 million children and adults worldwide.\n  Let me highlight just one of the many success stories we have already \nseen with the current pilot program.\n  In Cameroon, for example, we are providing nutritious meals to more \nthan 50,000 schoolchildren, helping to increase school enrollment by \nover 50 percent and cutting the dropout rate for girls to virtually \nzero. These findings are not unique. We find, for example, similar \nsuccess stories in Vietnam and in Honduras.\n  Our bill will continue to build upon the initial success of the pilot \nproject, and we will make this program permanent. By making it \npermanent, we can reach even more impoverished children and have a \nlasting, long-term effect on global educational development and work to \neradicate childhood hunger.\n  Furthermore, the investment in international school feeding programs \nnot only will help children in developing countries, but it also will, \nof course, benefit our U.S. farmers. The program provides our farmers \nwith a steady opportunity to sell the goods they produce. This is \ndefinitely a win-win situation.\n  I look forward to continuing our work on this important initiative, \nand I urge my colleagues to join in support of our legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/11/senate-section/article/S6051-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6051-S6052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               JAMES BOATWRIGHT, A VALUED SENATE EMPLOYEE\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I take a moment on the Senate floor to \nstate my sadness--and I am sure the sadness of many Senators--on the \ndeath of James Boatwright.\n  For all the years I have served in the Senate, James has worked in \nthe Senate restaurant. He has been a friend of mine and to many of us. \nHe has kept us informed and entertained with his stories about his golf \ngame, his insights about life, and sports in general. He was a very \nreal and valuable part of the Senate and he will be missed by all of us \nwho knew him.\n\n[[Page S6052]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Not only was he a fixture in the restaurant, but he retired once. The \nreason his retirement was curtailed is that he, as the gracious, good \nman he was, cosigned a note for someone, and that person didn't pay \nthat note. Rather than his defaulting on the note, he came back to \nwork, out of his retirement, so he could do the honorable thing and pay \nthat debt of someone else. He was a good man. I am sorry. I did not \nknow of his passing until just now, and I certainly will miss him in \nthe Senate restaurant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/11/senate-section/article/S6052-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, on this day, my thoughts are with the \nvictims of Timothy McVeigh, and with their families. I hope that the \nspectacle of these last few weeks, leading to this execution, has not \ncaused them further pain. McVeigh was cowardly and cruel, and I shall \nnot dwell upon his memory or indulge his desire to be seen as a martyr. \nI rise today to speak on his execution not because I wish to add to the \nburdens of this day, but because I do not want it said that those of us \nwho oppose the death penalty stood silently by.\n  Today, the question we need to ask is not: Was McVeigh a despicable \nkiller, of course he was.\n  Rather, the questions we should ask are these: Does the death penalty \nserve us and our best American ideals, does it always serve justice, is \nit administered fairly, is it sometimes imposed upon people who are \ninnocent.\n  The records will note that the cause of McVeigh's death was homicide, \nthe intentional killing of one human being by another. The execution of \neven this most notorious murderer should prompt us anew to reconsider \nthe idea of our government killing people in our name, and perhaps to \nbegin to acknowledge the growing American belief that the time has come \nto stop and learn the answers to the questions that plague the death \npenalty, before we proceed with any further executions.\n  We have an opportunity to turn another way on the death penalty. The \nnext scheduled federal execution is that of Juan Raul Garza. His \nexecution has been stayed until June 19 in light of the questions \nraised about regional and racial disparities in the federal death \npenalty system.\n  But the Justice Department now has declared that it will not wait \nuntil those questions are answered by an ongoing National Institute of \nJustice study before proceeding with his execution. They have gone so \nfar as to declare that there is no bias in the system, even though the \nstudy has not come close to completion. Until we are certain of the \nfairness of the process and these questions are resolved, Garza should \nnot be executed in our name. That's the real and difficult test that \nPresident Bush and Attorney General Ashcroft must face in the next few \ndays. On this day, I hope that they will turn to it in earnest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/11/senate-section/article/S6052-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6052-S6053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE 65TH INFANTRY DIVISION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \ncommend the dedication and courage of the members of the 65th Infantry \nDivision of the United States Army who fought in World War II.\n  The 65th Infantry Division was activated on August 16, 1943 at Camp \nShelby, Mississippi under Major General Stanley E. Reinhart. Like many \nnewly formed divisions in 1943, the men of the 65th Division traveled \nto different bases training in preparation for their participation in \nthe battles across Europe during World War II.\n  On January 10, 1945, the 65th Infantry Division departed New York, \nand they arrived in Le Havre, France on January 21, 1945. On March 9, \n1945, the division assembled near Ennery to relieve the 26th Infantry \nDivision, defending Saarlautern Bridgehead from Orscholz to Wadgassen.\n  On March 13, 1945, the 261st Infantry Regiment crossed the Saar River \nnear Menningen to clear the German defenders near the town of Merzig. \nOn March 17, 1945, the 261st Infantry Regiment cleared the heights \nsouth of Merzig, and took the town of Killingen the following day. The \nrest of the division fought its way out of the bridgehead as the 259th \nInfantry Regiment captured the town of Fraulautern and the 260th \nInfantry Regiment seized Saarlauten on March 19, 1945. Then, the \ndivision fought its way through the West Wall and captured the town of \nNeunkirchen on March 21, 1945. It then assembled near Ottweiler for \nrest and rehabilitation.\n  After 10 days of rest, the 65th Infantry Division connected with the \n6th Armored Division. Closing into the Schwabenheim area, the division \ncrossed the Rhine River with both the 260th and 261st Infantry \nRegiments during the night of March 29, 1945. It attacked across the \nFulda River on April 2 and reached the Reichensachen-Langenhain line on \nApril 3, 1945. There the two divisions split. The same day the 259th \nInfantry Regiment crossed the Werra River, and continued to the \nGreuzberg area on April 4, 1945. The division assaulted the town of \nLangensalza, which fell on April 6, 1945, but a German counterattack \noverran a battalion of the 261st Infantry Regiment at Struth on April \n7, 1945. The division restored the situation with air support and went \ninto reserve on April 8, 1945, moving to the town of Berka on April 10, \n1945.\n  The division moved to the town of Waltershausen on April 11, 1945 and \nthen onto Arnstadt. On April 17, 1945 it assembled in the town of \nBamberg and attacked toward Altdorf with the 259th and 260th Infantry \nRegiments the next day. The town of Neumarket was taken on April 23, \n1945 and the division drove to the Rhine River against crumbling German \nresistance. The division established a bridgehead across the Danube \nRiver southwest of Regensburg despite strong opposition, especially \nagainst the 261st Infantry Regiment on April 26, 1945. The bridgehead \nwas expanded allowing the 13th Armored Division to pass through. The \n260th Infantry Regiment took Regensburg on April 27, 1945. The division \nfollowed the Armored Division and crossed the Isar River at Platting on \nMay 1, 1945.\n  The 261st Infantry Regiment reached the Inn River at Passau on May 2, \n1945 and assaulted across it at the town of Neuhaus. The town of Passau \nfell the next day and the 261st Infantry Regiment reached the Enns \nRiver and overran the town of Enns. The division crossed the Enns River \non May 6, 1945, and made contact with the advancing Soviet Army in the \nvicinity of Strengberg.\n  The 65th Infantry Division reached Austria on May 4, 1945 and \nremained in Austria, under Brigadier General John E. Copeland until \ndisbanded on August 31, 1945. Two hundred and thirty three men of the \n65th Infantry Division were killed in action. Nine hundred and twenty-\nseven men were wounded in action.\n  In August of this year, the members of the 65th Infantry Division \nwill gather for their 48th annual reunion in Pennsylvania. During their \nreunion, the men will be honored for their service with the dedication \nof a monument stone by the Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge. The \nmembers of the 65th Infantry Division deserve this special recognition \nfor their service, and I am pleased to be able to commend them on the \nfloor of the United States Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the list of the\n\n[[Page S6053]]\n\nnames of the members of the 65th Infantry Division.\n  There being no objection, the names were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Robert D.

Mr. President, I rise today to draw continued attention \nto our important narcotic interdiction efforts throughout the Caribbean \nand Eastern Pacific, commonly referred to as the ``Transit Zone,'' and \nthe aging condition of the aircraft and vessels in both the U.S. \nCustoms Service and U.S. Coast Guard fleet inventories.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics \nControl held a hearing on the Transit Zone. Intelligence sources \nestimate that the annual cocaine flow through the six million square-\nmile Transit Zone is in excess of 500 metric tons. Non-commercial \nmaritime conveyances account for more than 80 percent of this Transit \nZone flow, and unfortunately, the estimated success rate for smugglers \n``go-fast'' deliveries is close to 90 percent.\n  The U.S. Coast Guard operates numerous ships and aircraft that are \naging and now require excessive maintenance to keep them in operation. \nBecause these assets lack current technology, they are extremely \nmanpower intensive, and require constant maintenance, which detracts \nfrom readiness and increases life cycle costs. All of the Coast Guard's \n210-foot and 378-foot ships are at least 30 years old, and the Coast \nGuard even operates 3 ``Mature class'' cutters, WWII-era vessels \ninherited from the U.S. Navy. The Coast Guard's fleet of medium and \nhigh endurance cutters is older than 37 of the world's 39 similar naval \nfleets, and the majority of major Coast Guard ships and aircraft will \nreach the end of their predicted service lives by the year 2008.\n  The Customs Service operates a wide range of aircraft at 11 air \nbranches and 10 air units throughout the country, as well as at 3 \noverseas forward operating locations (FOLs) and 2 sites in Mexico. The \nCustoms Service has 142 aircraft and 196 vessels, and many are in need \nof modernization or replacement. The average age of their C-12 aircraft \nis 22 years old and all 16 of their UH-60 Blackhawks are ``A'' models \n(first production series) on loan from the U.S. Army. As their P-3 \naircraft fleet has aged, numerous corrosion and cracking problems have \nbeen discovered. It is the P-3 aircraft that has become the backbone of \nour detection and monitoring system. But, the U.S. Customs Service Air \nand Maritime Interdiction (AMID) January 2001 Strategic Assessment \nreported, the level of aviation operations is insufficient to meet the \ncurrent agency requirements of Presidential Decision Directive (PDD-\n14), the National Drug Control Strategy, and Plan Colombia.\n  While both services begin to feel the debilitating effects of these \naging assets, demands for both the Customs Service and Coast Guard's \nunique services are simultaneously increasing. A doubling world \npopulation, the continued decline in marine fisheries, the end of the \nCold War, the doubling of commercial passenger enplanements by 2009, \nthe continuing scourge of illegal drugs and human smuggling, and the \ntripling of international commerce are all expected to increase the \nnation's reliance on these agencies. The Customs Service will continue \nto be on the front lines on trade and economic growth, border security, \ncounter terrorism, narcotics interdiction, financial crimes and money \nlaundering, pornography, and Internet cybercrime cases. The Coast Guard \nwill continue as the lead federal agency in the maritime environment \nwith respect to drugs, illegal\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\nimmigration, and fisheries law enforcement. We are increasing our \ndemands, we are expanding our expectations, but we are not investing in \nour capability.

Mr. President, the Hebrew Orphan Society of \nCharleston, SC has a long, rich history that deserves to be celebrated. \nOn June 24, a reception and dinner will be held at Charleston's \nMiddleton Place Gardens in honor of the society's 200 years of good \nworks. Founded in 1801 by a small group of Jewish men at K.K. Beth \nElohim synagogue, the society flourished in culturally and religiously \ntolerant 19th-century Charleston. Its members reached out to widows and \ntheir families and to Jewish youth who could not afford a proper \neducation. Membership was initially limited to 18, or ``chai,'' the \nnumber representing life in the Jewish faith, but has now doubled and \nincludes women as well as men with a distinguished record of service in \nthe Jewish community and the larger Charleston community. Today, the \nsociety assists Social Services clients with transportation and medical \nbills and meets requests from Hospice and Jenkins Orphanage in North \nCharleston. A quiet, yet diligent effort by The Hebrew Orphan Society \nmay often go unnoticed by the public. However, rest assured of the many \ngrateful citizens throughout history who have experienced its \nmunificence. My wife, Peatsy, and I send The Hebrew Orphan Society our \nheartfelt congratulations on this milestone and best wishes in the \nyears ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/11/senate-section/article/S6054-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO GLEN TAIT\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my \nLegislative Director, Glen Tait, who is leaving my employ for other \nopportunities outside the Senate. He has been an integral part of my \nstaff since I was elected to the Senate, and his absence will be \ngreatly noted. Glen's involvement in the Senate dates back more than a \ndecade, much of it spent in service to the State of Idaho. Prior to \ncoming to work for me, he worked for my predecessor, Dirk Kempthorne, \nso he truly has become an adopted Idahoan.\n  Glen has headed up my legislative efforts since I was first elected, \nand has provided invaluable guidance and direction for my legislative \nstaff. He is particularly knowledgeable about military and energy \nissues, both of which hold significant importance to the State of \nIdaho. Mountain Home Air Force Base and the Idaho National Engineering \nand Environmental Laboratory owe a great debt to his expertise and \nability. Glen has strong insight into the legislative processes of the \nSenate and served as a mentor to a number of staffers, who have taken \nthat knowledge and used it to help improve their career options.\n  Glen's wife tells me that he will miss working directly for the \npeople of Idaho, and we will miss him tremendously as well. But he will \nhave a constant reminder of the State in at least one of his two \ndaughters. Glen and his lovely wife, Jeanette, have two young toddlers \nat home, Lindsey Marie and Hailey Madison. Hailey was named for the \ntown of the same name in Idaho, and for the county in Idaho in which \nshe was born. I wish him the very best and want him to know how much I \nappreciate the stability and guidance he provided to a fledgling Senate \nlegislative staff several years ago. My best wishes go out to him as he \nmoves on to other opportunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/11/senate-section/article/S6054-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO LINCOLN HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate another class from Lincoln High School in Portland, OR, \ncompeting in the national finals of the program ``We the People . . . \nThe Citizens and the Constitution''. This April, students from Lincoln \nHigh School placed third among 49 classes in this national competition. \nI had the great pleasure of meeting these impressive young people while \nthey were visiting the Capitol, and I am very proud of their efforts. I \nknow that they worked diligently to reach the national finals, \ndemonstrating a remarkable understanding of the principles and values \nthat support our constitutional government.\n  The ``We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution'' program \nis the most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled after \nhearings in the United States Congress, consisting of oral \npresentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges. \nThe student testimony is followed by a period of questioning during \nwhich the judges probe students for their depth of understanding and \nability to apply their constitutional knowledge.\n  It is extremely important that our young people come to understand \nand appreciate the unique concepts and values which have guided our \nNation since its inception. These are the young leaders who must guide \nour country's future, and their wisdom must be equal to our country's \nneed. Again, I congratulate the student team from Lincoln High School \nand thank each member for their dedication, hard work, and enthusiasm.\n  The student team from Lincoln High School consists of: Brett Bell; \nMichael Blank; Ben Brewer; Chris Chamness; Greg Damis-Wulff; Alex \nDewar; David Dickey-Griffith; Heather Dunlap; Jenni Hamni; Jennifer \nHill; Scott Huan; Nick Johnson; Kathayoon Khalil; Cali Lanza-Weil; \nJenelle Milam; Jonathan Pulvers; Julie Rhew; Katie Rose; Andrew \nRosenthal; Anay Shah; Chris Shay; Rafael Spielman; Jason Trombley; \nJessica Vandermeer; Oliver Vandermeer; Ben Walsh; Colleen Wearn; and \nwith their teacher, Jennifer Vaught.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/11/senate-section/article/S6054-5", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  On Friday, June 8, 2001, the following bills were read the first \ntime:\n\n       H.R. 503.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nVoinovich to offer legislation on a health issue that is very important \nto parents across the Nation.\n  Bacterial meningitis affects 3,000 people across the United States \neach year.

Of \nthose individuals who survive, an additional 10 percent have severe \naftereffects of the disease, including mental retardation, hearing \nloss, and loss of limbs.\n  My bill would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in \nconsultation with the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, to \ndevelop and make available information about bacterial meningitis. In \naddition, it would make available information about the availability \nand the effectiveness of bacterial meningitis vaccinations for children \nand adults.\n  To help prevent these needless deaths, the bill requires the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to provide this information to a \nlist of institutions, including child care centers, schools, \nuniversities, boarding schools, summer camps, detention facilities, \nand, as determined appropriate by the Secretary any other entity that \nprovides housing in a dorm-like setting. This information in turn would \nbe provided to both children and adults.\n  This will allow parents and others to be more informed about this \ndangerous disease and encourage them to obtain appropriate vaccines.\n  I commend the Senator from Ohio for his support on this issue and \nurge other Senators to join us in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HELMS (for himself and Mr. Thurmond):\n  S. 1010.

A bill to provide the financial mechanisms, resource \nprotections, and professional skills necessary for high quality \nstewardship of the National Park System and to recognize the importance \nof high quality outdoor recreational opportunities on federally managed \nland; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, John Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club \nonce said, ``Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people \nare beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home; \nthat wilderness is a necessity; and that mountain parks and \nreservations are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating \nrivers, but as fountains of life.''\n  As our society becomes increasingly removed from the natural world, \nthis prescient statement rings ever more true.\n  Americans are becoming increasingly aware of the opportunities that \nour national parks provide for us to reconnect with the magnificent \nnatural heritage of our country. The number of visits to national parks \nis soaring, as is use of their diverse resources. While this is good \nnews in many ways, it has created a peculiar problem.\n  We are loving our parks to death.\n  Today, I am joined by my colleague Senator Akaka to introduce the \nNational Parks Stewardship Act of 2001. This legislation endeavors to \naddress some of the most serious problems facing the national parks \nsystem today.\n  First, the National Parks Stewardship Act ensures that activities in \nparks and on Federal lands adjacent to parks are compatible with the \nconservation and preservation of natural, cultural, and historical \nresources. This legislation also requires the proper preservation of \nhistoric documents, records, and artifacts, including resources in \nmarine environments which may require specialized skills for their \nmaintenance.\n  The National Parks Stewardship Act also helps the Park Service plan \nfor the future by studying visitation and demographic patterns and \npreparing for an increasingly diverse and growing population.\n  Second, this legislation provides innovative financing tools to help \nfund operations and maintenance and to address the current maintenance \nbacklog. Specifically, the National Parks Stewardship Act proposes a \nnon-appropriated funds instrumentalities program and challenge cost \nshare projects.\n  In addition, the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program would be \npermanently established with the requirement that certain percentages \nof the revenues generated remain available to the park at which they \nwere collected. A system of signs would also be established to let park \nvisitors know how recreation fees are spent and which projects have \nbeen completed as a result of this program.\n  Finally, the National Parks Stewardship Act establishes a pilot \nprogram called Professionals for Parks. This program would enable the \nPark Service to recruit prospective employees who have completed \ngraduate-level administration and business management programs. \nFurthermore, this legislation creates a student loan payment program to \nentice quality employees to bring their expertise to the Park Service.\n  I believe that the Park Service and our national parks are beginning \na new era. Visits to and enjoyment of our parks will continue to \nincrease, and we must enable the Park Service to keep pace with this \ntrend. We must encourage sound management of our parks and the vast \nnatural and cultural resources they safeguard. We must also encourage \nopportunities for new ways to fund increasing operations and \nmaintenance costs. Finally, we must encourage our national parks to \nrepresent a growing and increasingly diverse population. The National \nStewardship Act starts us along that path.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n\n[[Page S6057]]\n\n  S. 1012. A bill to ensure that children at highest risk for asthma, \nvision, hearing, and other health problems are identified and treated; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n Mr. DURDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nHealthy Children Learn Act with my colleague from Maine, Senator \nCollins. This legislation is focused on eliminating some bureaucratic \nbarriers that make it more difficult for schools to provide their \nstudents with health care services, if they so choose.\n  Many schools have found that the health of a child can significantly \naffect his or her ability to learn. To enhance children's learning \nability and to increase the well-being of their students, these schools \nsometimes choose to provide health care service including health care \nscreenings.\n  One example of a disease that significantly affects children's \neducation is asthma. Asthma is the single greatest reason for school \nabsenteeism today. Over five million children in America suffer from \nasthma. 49 percent of children with asthma missed school in the last \nyear and 48 percent of children with asthma are limited in sports and \nrecreation. Lack of physical activity in turn can lead to childhood \nobesity with its concomitant health care problems.\n  ``America is in the middle of an asthma epidemic--an epidemic that is \ngetting worse, not better.'' So says the PEW Environmental Health \nCommission in its most recent report on asthma. The prevalence of \nasthma continues to rise at astounding rates, in every region of the \ncountry and across all demographic groups, whether measured by age, \nrace or sex.\n  My home State of Illinois has some of the highest rates of childhood \nasthma in the country. Unfortunately, Chicago has the highest childhood \nasthma-related death rate in the Nation. Over 60 percent of childhood \nadmissions to the emergency room in Chicago are for asthma. This \ndisease exacts a very significant toll on children in my State.\n  For the next 15 minutes, imagine breathing through a tiny straw the \nsize of a coffee stirrer, never getting enough air. Now imagine \nsuffering through the process three to six times a day. This is asthma. \nCan a child really concentrate on learning, when he or she is gasping \nfor air?\n  Due to the very high rates of asthma in Chicago and the effects it \nhas on absenteeism and children's ability to learn when at school, the \nChicago Public Schools, (CPS), have instituted a new asthma screening \nprogram. At the beginning of this program, they estimated that at least \n40,000 undiagnosed or under-diagnosed cases of asthma existed among \ntheir students. The school system developed an asthma manual to provide \na standard plan of care for all students with asthma. They provided \ncitywide nurse training so as to develop a uniform, high standard for \napproaching students with asthma and their parents and high-quality \neducation about the environmental triggers for asthma and how to lessen \nthem, together with education on how to use asthma inhalers. In 1999, \nthey identified 12,374 cases of asthma. CPS continues to monitor and \nevaluate this program. They have also partnered with other \norganizations such as the American Red Cross Asthma Program, the \nUniversity of Chicago and the Chicago Department of Public Health \nAsthma Programs. CPS has also developed parent tutoring programs and \nhas linked asthmatic children with primary health care providers for \nappropriate follow-up.\n  All of these efforts are extremely important but they are resource \nintensive. While the majority of the children in the Chicago Public \nSchools system are eligible for Medicaid or the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, the payment rules for Medicaid make it more \ndifficult for CPS to get reimbursed for health screenings. These \nbarriers should be removed. Schools that make the extra effort to \nprovide their students health care services should be adequately \nreimbursed. When they provide Medicaid-eligible children with Medicaid-\ncovered services, they should receive appropriate reimbursement for \nthose services. Likewise for the S-CHIP program reimbursement should be \navailable for covered services for children enrolled or eligible for \nthe program.\n  This legislation goes further and provides for a $10 million grant \nprogram for school districts such as CPS to apply for funds for asthma \nscreening for those children who are not eligible for either S-CHIP or \nMedicaid. The grants would be targeted to those districts that have the \nhighest prevalence or deaths associated with asthma. The legislation \naddresses a barrier to children receiving vital health screenings in \nschools.\n  CPS has also found that children's ability to learn is affected by \nimpaired vision and hearing. Children with vision deficits are far more \nlikely to fail academically. In 1998, CPS found that children who were \nretained failed their school-based vision screening at a rate 50 \npercent higher than children who were not failing. Likewise, children \nwho have difficulty hearing struggle with language development, social \nprocesses and communication. This can seriously impair all aspects of \nthe educational process. For example, children in Grade 1 with a 25 \ndecibel hearing loss have a reading and grade equivalence of 2.0 \ncompared to children without such a loss who on average score 2.3 on \nthe same test. Through these programs, CPS has provided over 5,000 free \neye exams, and 4,000 free pairs of glasses have been dispensed. They \ncurrently are reimbursed less than 40 percent of the cost of the vision \nand hearing screenings.\n  To address some of these funding shortfalls, this legislation creates \na $10 million grant program for vision and hearing screening and \nclarifies Medicaid payment rules so that schools can be reimbursed when \nthey provide a Medicaid covered service to a Medicaid child.\n  No child should have his or her education threatened by the lack of \neffective screening to diagnose these health problems. In each case, \ntreatments or corrective devices are available to help children and we \nshould see to it that the children receive them where necessary. The \nHealthy Children Learn Act will help children get the health care \nservices they need so that they can get the educational opportunities \nthey deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Lott) (by request):\n  S.J. Res. 16. A joint resolution approving the extension of \nnondiscriminatory treatment to the products of the Socialist Republic \nof Vietnam; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that would implement a long-awaited bilateral trade \nagreement with Vietnam. This agreement marks another step in the long \nroad toward normalizing relations between our two nations. When we pass \nthis and other important trade legislation, we send the signal that we, \nas a Nation, are committed to engaging with countries around the globe \nby using our mutual interests as a foundation for working through our \ndifferences. By fully implementing this agreement, Vietnam will also \nsend a clear message that it is interested in continuing, and \ncompleting, a process of reform and modernization of its economy and \ninstitutions.\n  The Clinton administration signed the bilateral agreement with \nVietnam on July 13, 2000, after nearly four years of meticulous \nnegotiations. Under terms of the agreement, Vietnam will reduce tariffs \non approximately 250 products, about four-fifths of which are \nagricultural products. My own State of South Dakota will be among the \nbeneficiaries of Vietnam's market opening commitments. As the second-\nlargest producer of sunflower seeds, our farmers will no doubt benefit \nfrom the slash in duty on this product from the current level of 30 \npercent to 10 percent. Exporters of soybeans, furthermore, will see the \nrates drop by half, to only 5 percent.\n  In addition to the significant reduction in tariffs on agricultural \nand industrial products, the agreement opens Vietnam to American \nfinancial, banking and telecommunications services. While the agreement \ndoes not make Vietnam a member of the World Trade Organization, WTO, a \nnumber of its provisions bring Vietnam one step closer to compliance \nwith WTO accords. Specifically, Vietnam has committed to abide by WTO \nstandards regarding customs procedures, import licensing requirements \nand phytosanitary measures. In addition, Vietnam has also agreed to \nfollow WTO agreements on\n\n[[Page S6058]]\n\nintellectual property rights, which protect American copyrights, \npatents and trademarks. The same can be said for regulations involving \nAmerican investment there. Hopefully, passage of this bilateral \nagreement will add momentum to Vietnam's bid for full membership in the \nglobal trading body.\n  The United States, in return, has promised to grant Vietnam normal \ntrade relations, NTR. The practical effect of this action would be that \nproducts imported from Vietnam would now be subject to the same level \nof tariffs as products from almost every other country in the world. \nVietnamese companies would no longer face significant tariff barriers \nto our market. The agreement does include, however, a safeguard \nprovision to prevent a surge in Vietnamese imports from injuring our \nown domestic industries.\n  The implementing resolution introduced today would fulfill our \nobligation to grant Vietnam normal trade relations. Under this \nlegislation, however, Vietnam's trading status would still be subject \nto annual Congressional review. The legislation is in no way a \npermanent extension of such treatment. This is due to the so-called \nJackson-Vanik provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, which allow for an \nannual review by Congress of an extension of normal trade relations to \nany non-market economy country, such as Vietnam.\n  Specifically, the Jackson-Vanik amendment mandates that a non-market \neconomy country's access to American markets is conditioned on their \ncompletion of a bilateral commercial agreement with the United States \nand their policies on freedom of emigration. According to the statute, \na non-market economy country like Vietnam must sign an agreement with \nthe United States extending nondiscriminatory treatment to our \nproducts. In other words, they must grant normal trade relations to the \nUnited States. Access to our markets is further contingent on their \npolicies on freedom of emigration. If the President determines that \nsuch policies meet certain standards, or that a waiver of the Jackson-\nVanik provisions would, in fact, encourage further liberalization of \ntheir emigration policies, only then can the United States grant these \ncountries normal trade relations.\n  President Clinton first waived Jackson-Vanik provisions with respect \nto Vietnam in 1998 on the basis that such action would promote further \nliberalization of its emigration policies. The waiver has been extended \nevery year since then. But since Vietnam does not currently have a \nbilateral agreement with the United States, and therefore does not \nreceive normal trade relations, the waiver simply allows for the U.S. \nOverseas Private Investment Corporation, OPIC, and the U.S. Export-\nImport Bank to support U.S. businesses exporting to and/or operating \nthere. The legislation I am introducing today would grant normal trade \nrelations to Vietnam, meeting the second requirement of Jackson-Vanik, \nand therefore allow the market opening agreement to take effect.\n  The Presidential waiver of Vietnam's treatment under Jackson-Vanik \nhas never been disapproved by Congress. In fact, support for the waiver \nhas grown substantially in both chambers. Last year, for instance, 330 \nmembers of the House voted in favor of the waiver's extension and a \nbill disapproving the President's waiver was voted down by 94 Senators. \nI am confident that such action indicates strong support by Members of \nCongress for passage of this agreement.\n  I am encouraged that President Bush has sent the agreement to \nCongress for final approval. Indeed, last month, I signed a letter \nurging him to do so as soon as possible. This is an important \nagreement, and today we are taking the first step towards swift Senate \nconsideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/11/senate-section/article/S6058-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 795.
