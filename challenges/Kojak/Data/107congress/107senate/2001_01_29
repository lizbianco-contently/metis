Our desire to pray arises in \nour hearts because You want to love, guide, inspire, and empower us. \nThe greatest gift we can receive in this time of\nprayer is more of You. Whatever else You give or withhold is to draw us \ncloser to You.\n  In our world of politics, so often the question is, ``Who gets the \nglory?'' We confess that often we become obsessed by concern over \nwhether we have been recognized for our abilities or rewarded for our \naccomplishments. Your admonition to us through Jeremiah helps us order \nour priorities. ``Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, let not the \nmighty man glory in his might, nor let the rich man glory in his \nriches, but let him who glories glory in this, that he understands and \nknows Me, that I am the Lord, exercising loving kindness, judgment, and \nrighteousness in the earth. For in these I delight.''--Jeremiah 9:23-\n24.\n  We dedicate this new week to delight in what delights You. You are \nthe only One we want to please. You are our heart's delight!

Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 2 p.m., with the two leaders or their designees \nin control of that time. Following morning business, the Senate will \nbegin consideration of Gale Norton's nomination to be Secretary of the \nInterior. Under the previous order that was entered into last week, \nthere will be up to 4 hours of debate on the Norton nomination during \ntoday's session. Tomorrow the Senate will complete debate on the Norton \nnomination as well as consider the nominations of Governor Whitman to \nbe the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator and Elaine Chao to \nbe Secretary of Labor. Those confirmation votes are scheduled to occur \nat 2:45 p.m. tomorrow. Following those votes, the Senate will begin \nconsideration of the nomination of John Ashcroft to be Attorney \nGeneral. A vote on that nomination is expected prior to the Senate \nadjourning this week.\n  I should say that while the vote in the Judiciary Committee on \nSenator Ashcroft was delayed until this week, I believe there will be a \nvote on it either Tuesday or Wednesday morning. I hope we can begin the \ndebate on his nomination as early as tomorrow afternoon and continue, \nif necessary, into the night and Wednesday and into the night and into \nThursday--all if necessary.\n  I had a brief conversation with Senator Daschle this morning about \nthe schedule for the next month or so, but we did not get into a deep \ndiscussion about exactly how to proceed after the\n\n[[Page S592]]\n\nvotes that are now scheduled at 2:45 tomorrow afternoon. We expect to \nmeet later on today, and as we get an agreement of how we can proceed, \ncertainly we will notify our Members to that effect.\n  I do want to say also, I firmly believe that Senators should have \nevery opportunity to question the nominees to the President's Cabinet, \nand to make statements on the floor if they choose so there can be a \nfull reading of the record and a discussion of their record. But I also \nthink it is important that we do come to a conclusion and reach a vote.\n  There has been good cooperation on both sides of the aisle, and from \ncommittees, over the past month when they were chaired by Democrats and \nlast week as it continued under Republican leadership. We will have \ncompleted all the nominations but one by tomorrow afternoon. I hope we \ncan move to that nomination expeditiously also.\n  Again, I am sure we will have a full debate, but I think after a \nreasonable period of time we should come to a vote so the Justice \nDepartment can have an Attorney General in place and can begin to do \nthe very important job that he will have to carry forward.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention and look forward to the \ndebate this week and working with the leadership on the schedule.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will yield for \na comment?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. On the nomination of Senator Ashcroft to be Attorney \nGeneral, I understand the White House actually sent the nomination up \nthis morning. But even though they had not sent it until today, to try \nto accommodate the new President, we held hearings prior to the \ninauguration of the new President. I think we had an equal number of \nwitnesses on both sides. There may have been one more for Senator \nAshcroft than against, but anyway, it was completed during that time. \nAnswers that were submitted came in this weekend.\n  I know the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Hatch, is \nout of the country, but I am perfectly willing, certainly on this side, \nto go forward with the committee vote on him as soon as he comes in, \nespecially now that the papers have come up from the White House today. \nI notified the President's office this morning--speaking about Senator \nAshcroft--I will not take part in any filibuster, nor do I expect there \nto be any filibuster on this nomination. I assure the distinguished \nmajority leader we moved as rapidly as we could. We now actually have \nthe nomination and the schedule is now in the hands of my friend from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from Vermont for that information. I \nthink it is appropriate we actually receive the nomination before we \nvote--a little small detail but that has been taken care of.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It always helps.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be talking further to your leadership about how we \nschedule it this week, and I look forward to getting it completed as \nsoon as possible.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/29/senate-section/article/S592-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as the majority leader indicated, we have \ndone really a good job of approving the nominations of the new \nPresident. By tomorrow afternoon, 12 of the 13--I think that is the \nright number--will have been approved. Anyway, all but one will have \nbeen approved.\n  While the Senator from Vermont is on the floor, I extend to him the \nappreciation of the entire Democratic caucus for the way the hearings \nhave been conducted.\n  First, as Senator Leahy was chairman of the committee, and then \nfollowing that, working as the ranking member, this is a lot of heavy \nlifting.\n  I talked to someone today, and they asked me: Why is it taking so \nlong? I indicated that it is taking a long time because--let's assume \nVice President Gore had been elected President, and I just pick a name. \nLet's assume Senator Kennedy had been selected to be the Attorney \nGeneral for the United States rather than John Ashcroft, two people who \nhave served this Senate on different sides of the political spectrum. I \nthink the Republicans would have taken a lot of time to go over all the \nthings Senator Kennedy had said in speeches and things he had said on \nthe Senate floor.\n  That is what we are doing. We are looking at the record of the \ndesignate for Attorney General, what he said when he was attorney \ngeneral, what he did when he was attorney general, what he did when he \nwas Governor, and what he did in the Senate.\n  I extend my appreciation to the Senator from Vermont for the job that \nhas been done. Senator Leahy, prior to coming here, was a prosecutor. \nHe had to prepare his cases to make sure all the evidence was brought \nbefore the jury and/or the court. That is in effect what he is doing, \nbut in this instance the jury is the 100 Members of the Senate. Without \na good record, we cannot make a good decision.\n  I have not had the benefit of sitting through all of these hearings \nas has the Senator from Vermont. Therefore, he must provide us, through \nthe committee procedures, all he believes is important to be brought to \nthe floor of the Senate. To this point he has, as usual, done an \noutstanding job. For the third time this morning, I extend the \nappreciation of the entire Democratic Conference for giving us \ninformation upon which we can make a decision regarding the Attorney \nGeneral-designate that has been sent to us by the President.\n  I personally have not made up my mind as to what I am going to do. \nTherefore, I am depending on the Senator from Vermont to give me his \ndirection, his leadership. I think it is so important that we all take \nwhat has gone on in that committee to heart.\n  I have said publicly on other occasions that this is not a decision \nonly Democrats will have to make. I hope the Republicans will also keep \nan open mind before rushing to a decision. I have been very \ndisappointed in some of my friends on the other side of the aisle who, \nprior to a single witness testifying, said they were going to vote for \nSenator Ashcroft. I think they should also keep an open mind and base \ntheir decision on what has transpired before the Judiciary Committee.\n  I also take what the Senator from Vermont has said to heart. People \nhave things to say. I do not know who wants to speak. We will certainly \nknow before this debate takes place, but this is not a time to \nrestrict--and I know the majority leader has not suggested that--\nrestrict how much time people can take. We want to make sure there is \nfull opportunity for people to say what they want to say.\n  I have been contacted by a number of my colleagues who are voting for \nand voting against Senator Ashcroft and who want to spend some time on \nthe Senate floor explaining that position. The floor activities will \nbe, of course, under the direction of the Senator from Vermont who is \nthe ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. I look forward to a good \ndebate. It should be a high point for the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nLeahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend, the senior Senator\n\n[[Page S593]]\n\nfrom Nevada, for his kind words. As always, we rely on his leadership \nhere, too. I appreciate what he said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/29/senate-section/article/S593-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S593-S607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF JOHN ASHCROFT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. The President of the United States sent to the Senate the \nnomination of John Ashcroft to be the Attorney General of the United \nStates. In advance of him sending it, to accommodate the new President \nand expedite the consideration of the nomination, I convened 3 days of \nhearings on this nomination over the 4-day period from January 16 to \nJanuary 19.\n  The Republican leadership had announced weeks ago that all 50 \nRepublican Senators would be voting in favor of this nomination, but I \ndeclined to prejudge the matter.\n  The Committee on the Judiciary has done the best it could to handle \nthis nomination fairly and fully, and we did it through hearings of \nwhich all members of the committee, on both sides of the aisle, and all \nMembers of the Senate I believe can be proud.\n  Having reviewed the hearing record and the nominee's responses to \nwritten follow-up questions from the Judiciary Committee, I come today \nto announce and explain my opposition to the nomination of John \nAshcroft to be the Attorney General of the United States.\n  I take no pleasure in having reached this decision. I have voted or \nwill be voting to confirm nearly all of the President's Cabinet \nnominees. No one in this Chamber more than I would have wanted a \nnomination for Attorney General that the Senate could have approved \nunanimously. As the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \nam going to be working closely with the new Attorney General, often on \na daily basis. I would have wanted to begin that relationship with \nenthusiastic support for whomever the President chose.\n  I also had the privilege of working with John Ashcroft during the 6 \nyears he served as a Senator, and I consider it a privilege. Most of us \nknow him and like him. I admire his personal devotion to his family and \nto his religion. While we are not always in agreement, I respect his \ncommitment to the principles he firmly holds, and I respect his right \nto act on those principles.\n  The fact that many of us served with Senator Ashcroft and know and \nlike him does not mean we should not faithfully carry out our \nconstitutional responsibility in acting on this nomination. No one \nnominated to be Attorney General of the United States should be treated \nin any special way, either favorably or unfavorably, by this body \nbecause he or she once served in the Senate. Our guide must be \nconstitutional duty, not friendship.\n  Most of us believe that a President has a right to nominate to \nexecutive branch positions those men and women whom he believes are \ngoing to carry out his agenda and his policies, but it is only with the \nconsent of the Senate that the President may proceed to appoint.\n  The Constitution, interestingly enough, is silent on the standard \nSenators should use in exercising this responsibility. Every Senator \nhas the task of discerning what that standard should be, and then each \nSenator has to decide how it applies in the case of any nomination, \nespecially a controversial nomination such as that of Senator Ashcroft.\n  The Senate's constitutional duty is to advise and consent; it is not \nto advise and rubber stamp. Fundamentally, the question before us is \nwhether Senator Ashcroft is the right person at this moment for the \ncritical position of Attorney General of the United States.\n  This is an especially sensitive time in our Nation's history. Many \nseeds of disunity have been carried aloft by winds that often come in \ngusts, most recently out of Florida. The Presidential election, the \nmargin of victory, the way in which the vote counting was halted by the \nU.S. Supreme Court remain sources of public concern and even of \nalienation. Deep divisions within our country have infected the body \npolitic. We experienced the closest Presidential election in the last \n130 years, possibly in our history.\n\n  For the first time, a candidate who received half a million more \nvotes lost. The person who received half a million fewer popular votes \nwas declared the victor of the Presidential election by 1 electoral \nvote.\n  The Senate, for the first time in our history, is made up of 50 \nDemocrats and 50 Republicans. Although this session of Congress is less \nthan 1 month old, each political party has already had its leader serve \nas majority leader. Both Senator Daschle and Senator Lott have served \nas majority leader.\n  Senate committees have already operated under both Democratic and \nRepublican chairs. I suspect Ph.D. dissertations will be written about \nthis for years to come.\n  Much has been made of what has come to be known as the Ashcroft \nevolution, where activist positions he has held and valiantly advanced \nappear now to be suddenly dormant in deference, as he said, to settled \nlaw, at least during the confirmation hearings.\n  But leaving Senator Ashcroft aside for a moment, it must not be left \nunremarked that he is not the only politician who has sent conflicting \nsignals about his view of Government. We have already seen two distinct \nsides of the new President since he was declared the victor after the \nNovember election. One side is the optimistic face of bipartisanship--a \nsincere and knowledgeable President determined to work with like-minded \nDemocrats and Republicans to overhaul the way we educate our children. \nThis is a side of hope, cooperation, and compromise. In fact, in his \nencouraging inaugural address barely 10 days ago, President Bush \nacknowledged the difficulties of these times and the very special needs \nof a divided nation. He said: ``While many of our citizens prosper, \nothers doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country.'' He \nrecognized that deep differences divide us and pledged ``to work to \nbuild a single nation of justice and opportunity.'' I applaud President \nBush for those words. At the luncheon after the inauguration, I told \nhim how much those words meant to me.\n  These crucial weeks and months after the divisive election are an \nespecially sensitive time, when hope and healing are waiting to emerge. \nBut they are also fragile, like the first buds of the sugar maple in \nthe spring in my own State of Vermont.\n  On the other side of the ledger, though, is the President's decision \nto send to the Senate the nomination of John Ashcroft. Senator Ashcroft \nis a man we know and respect, but a man we also know held some of the \nmost extreme positions on a variety of the most volatile social and \npolitical issues of our time: Civil rights, women's rights, gun \nviolence, discrimination against gay Americans, and the role of the \njudiciary itself.\n  Appointing the top law enforcement officer in the land is the place \nto begin, if the goal is to bring the country together. I wish the \nPresident had sent us a nomination for Attorney General who would unite \nus rather than divide us. But that did not happen. This is a nomination \nthat had controversy written all over it from the moment it was \nannounced. It should surprise no one that today we find ourselves in \nthe middle of this battle. It should surprise no one that the polls in \nthis country show the American people are deeply divided on this \nnomination.\n  It was, I believe, a crucial miscalculation from the President and \nhis advisers to believe this nomination would have brought all of us \ntogether. Or perhaps, as some have suggested, it is an instance where \nconsensus was not the objective.\n\n  Many organizations and their members have weighed in on either side \nof this debate. Some advocates for the nominee have been especially \ncritical of the membership groups that oppose this nomination. It must \nbe said that the only political pressure groups that have had a \ndecisive role in this nomination are the far right wing elements of the \nRepublican Party who insisted on this particular nominee and even \nbragged to the press that they vetoed other, more moderate, \ncandidates--Republican candidates--for this job.\n  What is crystal clear to me is that the nomination of John Ashcroft \ndoes not meet the standard the President himself has set. In those who \ndoubt the promise of American justice--and there are those--it does not \ninspire confidence in the U.S. Department of Justice.\n  The Senate can help mend these divisions, it can give voice to the \ndisaffected, it can help to restore confidence in our Government, but \nonly if\n\n[[Page S594]]\n\nit remains true to its own constitutional responsibilities. At a time \nof intense political frustration and division, it is especially \nimportant for the Senate to fulfill its duty.\n  One of the abiding strengths of our democracy is that the American \npeople have opportunities to participate in the political process, to \nbe heard, and to believe that their views are being taken into account. \nWhen the American people vote, every vote is important, every vote \nshould be counted. Then when we hold hearings, and when we vote, we \nhave to be cognizant that each of us has sworn an oath to uphold the \nConstitution. Each action we take as Senators has to be consistent with \nthat oath.\n  There are 280 million Americans in this wonderful and great country \nof ours. Of those 280 million Americans, there are only 100 people who \nhave the license and the obligation to vote on this nomination: 100 \nMembers of the Senate, a body that should be the conscience of the \nNation, and sometimes is. Two hundred eighty million Americans expect \nus to make up our minds on this.\n  There is a reason many of us believe that the job and role of \nAttorney General is the most important job in the Cabinet. Why? Because \nit is not simply a job where you carry out what the President tells you \nto do; it is far more than that. The extensive authority and discretion \nto act in ways that go beyond Presidential orders are part of the \nimportant role of the Attorney General and require that our Attorney \nGeneral have the trust and confidence of all the people. Democrats, \nRepublicans, moderates, conservatives, liberals, white, black, no \nmatter who, rich, poor, they must all have confidence in this one \nCabinet position above all others, because the Attorney General is a \nlawyer for all the people. He is the chief law enforcement officer of \nthe country.\n  The Attorney General is not the lawyer for the President. The \nPresident has a White House counsel for that. The Attorney General is \nthe lawyer for all of us, no matter where we are from, no matter what \nparty we belong to. We all look to the Attorney General to ensure \nevenhanded law enforcement. And we look to the Attorney General for the \nprotection of our constitutional rights--including freedom of speech, \nthe right to privacy, a woman's right to choose, freedom from \nGovernment oppression, and equal protection of the laws. The Attorney \nGeneral plays a critical role in bringing the country together, \nbridging racial divisions, and inspiring people's confidence in their \nown Government.\n  Senator Ashcroft has often taken aggressively activist positions on a \nnumber of issues that deeply divide the American people. He had a right \nto take these activist positions. But we have a duty to evaluate how \nthese positions would affect his conduct as Attorney General.\n  John Ashcroft's unyielding and intemperate positions on many issues \nraise grave doubts, both about how he will interpret the oath he would \ntake as Attorney General to enforce the laws and uphold the \nConstitution and also about how he will exercise the enormous power of \nthat office.\n  Let me be very clear on this. I am not objecting to this nominee \nsimply because I disagree with him on ideological grounds. I have voted \nfor many nominees with whom I have disagreed on ideological grounds. I \nam not applying the ``Ashcroft standard'' as he applied it to Bill Lann \nLee and other Presidential nominees over the last 6 years. My \nconclusion is based upon a review of John Ashcroft's record as the \nattorney general and then Governor of Missouri, as a Senator, and also \non his testimony before the Judiciary Committee. It is based on how he \nhas conducted himself and what positions he has taken while serving in \nhigh public office while sworn to uphold the Constitution, basically \nthe same oath one would take as Attorney General.\n  President Kennedy observed that to govern is to choose. What choices \nthe next Attorney General makes about resources and priorities will \nhave a dramatic impact on almost every aspect of the society in which \nwe live. The American people are entitled to be sure not just that this \nnominee says he will enforce the laws on the books but also to be sure \nwhat those priorities are going to be, what choices he is likely to \nmake, what changes he will seek in the law. Most importantly, we are \nentitled to know what changes he will seek in the constitutional rights \nthat all Americans currently enjoy--that includes, of course, what \npositions he will urge upon the Supreme Court--in particular, whether \nhe is going to ask the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade or to \nimpose more burdensome restrictions on a woman's ability to secure \nlegal and safe contraceptives.\n  On several of these issues, such as his lifelong opposition to a \nwoman's right to choose, his support for measures to criminalize \nabortion even in cases of rape and incest, and his efforts to limit \naccess to widely used contraceptives, Senator Ashcroft has moved far \noutside the mainstream. The controversial positions taken by this \nnominee and his record require us to reject this nomination as the \nwrong one for the critical position of Attorney General of the United \nStates at this time in our history.\n  It is in part because I know John Ashcroft to be a person of strong \nconvictions and consistency that I am concerned that he could not \ndisregard those long-held convictions if he is confirmed by this body. \nIt troubles me that he took essentially the same oath of office as \nattorney general of Missouri that he would take as Attorney General of \nthe United States, but he acted differently than what he tells us he \nwould do now. Senator Ashcroft assumed a dramatically different tone \nand posture on several matters during the course of his hearing.\n\n  The new John Ashcroft did not oppose the nomination of James Hormel \nbecause of his sexual orientation. The new John Ashcroft is now a \nsupporter of the assault weapons ban. The new John Ashcroft is an \nardent believer in civil rights, women's rights, and gay rights. The \nnew John Ashcroft now believes Roe v. Wade is settled law. In fact, the \nmore I heard him refer to matters he has consistently opposed, laws he \nconsistently tried to rewrite, the more he referred to them as settled \nlaw, the more unsettling that became.\n  Occasionally, we would get a peek behind the confirmation curtain. \nWhat we saw was deeply disturbing. Senator Ashcroft was unrepentant in \nthe way he torpedoed the nomination of Judge Ronnie White to the \nFederal district court, despite calls from some Republican Senators who \npersonally apologized to Judge White for the shabby treatment he \nreceived. Senator Ashcroft, on the one hand, denied that sexual \norientation had anything to do with his opposition to the Hormel \nnomination, then left the distinct, gratuitous impression that there \nwas something unspoken, unreported, yet unacceptable about Mr. Hormel \nthat somehow disqualified him from serving the United States as \nAmbassador to Luxembourg, even though Luxembourg said they would \nwelcome his appointment as Ambassador.\n  Senator Ashcroft repeatedly declined to show the slightest remorse \nfor his appearance at Bob Jones University, for the enthusiastically \nsupportive interview he gave with a pro-confederate magazine, Southern \nPartisan, and for some of the most inflammatory language I have heard \nabout the Federal judiciary since the bitter and violent days of the \ncivil rights movement.\n  Most of us in this body have known the old John Ashcroft, but during \nthe hearings we met a new John Ashcroft. Our challenge has been to \nreconcile the new John Ashcroft with the old John Ashcroft, to find the \nreal John Ashcroft who would sit in the Attorney General's office. Were \nthe demurrals of his testimony real, or were they delicate bubbles that \nwould burst and evaporate a year or a month or a day from now under the \nreassertion of his long-held beliefs.\n  So we come back again to why all this matters. Why would we treat \nthis position differently than, say, Secretary of Commerce or \nTransportation? Obviously, if he had been nominated to either of those, \nwe would not have the controversy we now have. We treat it differently \nbecause of this: The position of Attorney General is of extraordinary \nimportance. The judgments and priorities of the person who serves as \nAttorney General affect the lives of all Americans.\n  We Americans live under the rule of law. The law touches us all every \nday in ways that affect our safety and our health and our very rights \nas citizens. Our Attorney General is our touchstone in the fair and \nfull application of\n\n[[Page S595]]\n\nour laws. The Attorney General not only needs the full confidence of \nthe President, he or she also needs the full confidence of the American \npeople.\n  The Attorney General controls a budget of more than $20 billion, \ndirects the activities of more than 123,000 attorneys, investigators, \nBorder Patrol agents, deputy marshals, correctional officers, other \nemployees, in more than 2,700 Justice Department facilities around the \ncountry, actually more than 124 in foreign cities. The Attorney General \nsupervises the selection and the actions of 93 U.S. attorneys and their \nassistants and the U.S. Marshals Service and its offices in each State. \nThe Attorney General supervises the FBI and its activities around the \nworld and in this country, as well as the INS, the DEA, the Bureau of \nPrisons, and a whole lot of other Federal law enforcement departments.\n\n  The Attorney General evaluates judicial candidates, recommends \njudicial nominees to the President, advises on the constitutionality of \nbills and laws. The Attorney General determines when the Federal \nGovernment is going to sue an individual or a business or even a local \ngovernment. The Attorney General decides what statutes to defend in \ncourt, what arguments to make to the Supreme Court or other Federal \ncourts, even State courts, on behalf of the U.S. Government.\n  As I said at the confirmation hearings for Edwin Meese to be Attorney \nGeneral, while the Supreme Court has the last word in what our laws \nmeans, the Attorney General, more importantly, has the first word.\n  The Attorney General exercises broad discretion--in fact, most of \nthat discretion is not even reviewed by the courts; one might say it is \nvery rarely and then only sparingly reviewed by the Congress--over how \nto allocate that $20 billion budget, then how to distribute billions of \ndollars a year in law enforcement assistance to State and local \ngovernments, and coordinate task forces on important law enforcement \npriorities. These are the priorities the Attorney General sets.\n  The Attorney General makes the decision when not to bring prosecution \nas well as when to bring prosecution, when to settle a case and when to \ngo forward with a case. Having been a prosecutor, I know these are the \ndecisions that can set policy more than anything that a Governor or a \nPresident or Member of Congress might do. A willingness to settle \nappropriate cases once the public interest has been served rather than \nto pursue endless and divisive and expensive appeals, as John Ashcroft \ndid in the Missouri desegregation cases, is a critical qualification \nfor the job.\n  There is no appointed position within the Federal Government that can \naffect more lives in more ways than the Attorney General. No position \nin the Cabinet is more vulnerable to politicization by one who puts \nideology and politics above the law. We should expect --all of us, not \njust 100 Senators but 280 million Americans--to have an Attorney \nGeneral who will ensure evenhanded law enforcement and equal justice \nfor all, protection of our basic constitutional rights to privacy, \nincluding a woman's right to choose and our rights to free speech and \nto freedom from government oppression. We look to the Attorney General \nto safeguard our marketplace from predatory and monopolistic activities \nand to protect our air and our water and our environment.\n  The Attorney General, among all the members of the President's \nCabinet, is the officer who must be most removed from politics, if he \nis going to be effective and if he is going to fulfill the duties of \nthat office.\n  Now, I have a deep and abiding respect for the Senate and its vital \nrole in our democratic government. Twenty-six years in the Senate have \ngiven me the privilege to know and work with hundreds of others in this \nbody. I cherish those friendships, and not only the friendships of the \nother 99 Senators here today, but the others I have served with over \ntwo-and-a-half decades. But far beyond friendship, my first duty as a \nU.S. Senator from Vermont is to the Constitution. I have sworn to \nuphold the Constitution.\n  In the aftermath of the national election in November, I have gone \nback to that Constitution many times. This weekend, I re-read the \nappointments clause.\n  I cannot give consent to the nomination of John Ashcroft to be \nAttorney General and thus be true to my oath of office. I do not have \nthe necessary confidence that John Ashcroft can carry on the great \ntradition and fulfill the important role of Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  The American people certainly are not united in any such confidence. \nThis nomination does not help President Bush to fulfill his pledge to \nunite the Nation.\n  I will vote no when the Senate is asked to give its advice and \nconsent to the nomination of John Ashcroft to be Attorney General of \nthe United States.\n  To further elaborate, Mr. President, the week before the Inauguration \nof the new President, the Senate Judiciary Committee conducted three \ndays of hearings over four days on the nomination of former Senator \nJohn Ashcroft to be the next Attorney General of the United States. We \nheard not only from the nominee but also from thirteen witnesses called \non his behalf and thirteen witnesses who opposed his nomination. While \na number of my colleagues, most notably the entire Republican caucus, \nexpressed support for this nomination before the hearing, I declined to \npre-judge the nominee until I had heard his testimony and that of other \nwitnesses, and reviewed their responses to follow-up written questions. \nI rise today to express my opposition to this nomination.\n  The Appointments Clause of the Constitution gives the Senate the duty \nand responsibility of providing its advice and consent. The \nConstitution is silent on the standard that Senators should use in \nexercising this responsibility. This leaves to each Senator the task of \nfiguring out what standard to apply and, most significantly, leaves to \nthe American people the ultimate decision whether they approve of how a \nSenator has fulfilled this constitutional duty.\n  Many of us believe that the President has a right to appoint to \nexecutive branch positions those men and women whom he believes will \nhelp carry out his agenda and policies. Yet, the President is not the \nsole voice in selecting and appointing officers of the United States. \nThe Senate has an important role in this process. It is advise and \nconsent, not advise and rubberstamp. The Senate has a duty to take this \nconstitutional function seriously.\n  There was a time, of course, when ``senatorial courtesy'' meant \ncursory attention to former members of this body. Senators nominated to \nimportant government positions did not even appear before Committees \nfor hearings. Certainly, the Senate was and should continue to be \ncourteous to all nominees, but we should not use a double standard for \nmembers who have not been re-elected to the Senate. No one nominated to \nbe Attorney General should be treated specially either favorably or \nunfavorably just because he once served in the Senate. The fact that \nmany of us served with, know and like John Ashcroft does not excuse the \nSenate from faithfully carrying out its constitutional responsibility \nwith regard to this nomination. Our constitutional duty rather than any \nfriendship for Senator Ashcroft must guide us in the course of these \nproceedings and on the final vote on his nomination.\n  This is especially the case in these times when the new President is \nemerging from a disputed election that was decided after vote counting \nin Florida was ordered to stop through the intervention of the U.S. \nSupreme Court. The resolution of this election remains a source of \npublic concern and sharp division in our country, reflected in a deeply \ndivided electorate and demands from all sides for bipartisan \nleadership.\n  These are not auspicious beginnings for a new Administration and this \nnomination has been a troubling signal. John Ashcroft has taken \naggressively activist positions on a number of issues on which the \nAmerican people feel strongly and on which they are deeply divided. On \nseveral of those issues, such as his lifelong opposition to a woman's \nright to choose and support for measures to criminalize abortion, even \nin cases of rape and incest, and to limit access to widely-used \ncontraceptives, he is far outside the mainstream.\n  The President has said his choice is based on finding someone who \nwill enforce the law, but we need more than airy promises on this score \nto vest the extensive authority and important role\n\n[[Page S596]]\n\nof the Attorney General in John Ashcroft. His assurances that he would \nenforce the law cannot be the end of our inquiry, as some would urge. \nThe heart of the Attorney General's job is to exercise discretion in \ndeciding how and to what extent the law should be enforced, and what \nthe Government will say it means.\n  The essence of prosecutorial discretion is that some laws get \nenforced more aggressively than others, some missions receive priority \nattention and some do not. No prosecutor's office--unless you are an \nindependent counsel--has the resources to investigate every lead and \nprosecute every infraction. A prosecutor may choose to enforce those \nlaws that promote a narrow agenda or ones that protect people's lives \nand neighborhoods. We need an Attorney General who has the full trust \nand confidence of the people that the laws will be enforced fairly and \nacross the board, and that any changes the Attorney General will seek \nlegislatively or in defining critical constitutional rights before the \nU.S. Supreme Court will be for the benefit of all Americans and reflect \nthe mainstream of our values.\n  John Ashcroft's unyielding and intemperate positions on many issues \nraise grave doubts in my mind both about how he will interpret the oath \nhe would take as Attorney General to enforce the laws and uphold the \nConstitution, and about how he will exercise the enormous discretionary \npower of that office. Let me be clear: I am not objecting to this \nnominee simply because I disagree with him on ideological grounds.\n  My conclusion is based upon a review of John Ashcroft's record as the \nAttorney General of Missouri and then Governor, as a United States \nSenator, and his testimony before the Judiciary Committee. That is to \nsay, it is based on how he has conducted himself, and what positions he \nhas taken, while serving in high public office and while sworn to \nuphold the Constitution. Let me give some specific examples.\n  As Governor, John Ashcroft vetoed two bipartisan bills that would \nhave made it easier to register voters in the City of St. Louis, a city \nwith a very substantial African-American population. These bills would \nhave directed election authorities to allow outside groups, such as the \nLeague of Women Voters, to register voters. They were designed to \nrectify an imbalance between St. Louis County, a predominantly white \narea where outside groups were allowed to register voters, and St. \nLouis City, whose election commissioners (appointed by John Ashcroft) \nforbade the practice. Due in large part to that imbalance, only 73 \npercent of St. Louis City residents were registered to vote, while 81 \npercent of County residents were registered. (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, \nFebruary 2, 1989). Faced with an opportunity to correct that imbalance, \nhowever, Governor Ashcroft refused. He vetoed one bill that dealt \nspecifically with the St. Louis City Election Board, claiming it was \nunfair to single out one region for this requirement. The following \nyear, the legislature addressed that criticism and passed a bill that \npertained to the entire state. Nonetheless, Governor Ashcroft vetoed it \nagain. (New York Times, January 14, 2001).\n\n  This opposition to legislation that would have ensured that black and \nwhite voters were treated equally in Missouri is all the more \ndisturbing in light of the serious charges that have arisen in the wake \nof the Florida vote in the presidential election. It is critical that \nour new Attorney General have a sterling record on voting rights \nissues.\n  Neither Senator Ashcroft's handling of this matter as Governor nor \nhis response to the Committee's questions about it inspire confidence. \nIndeed, it was distressing that Senator Ashcroft, when given the chance \nto explain his actions, chose to engage in an apparent ``filibuster'' \nby reading his entire veto messages, which were neither concise nor \nresponsive to the questions he was asked. As a result, the time of his \nquestioner expired and Senator Ashcroft was able to avoid confronting \nthis issue fairly and completely.\n  Set against John Ashcroft's questionable record on voting rights \nissues, his record while he served as Attorney General and Governor of \nMissouri on fighting a voluntary desegregation plan for the St. Louis \nschool system is particularly troublesome. My concern is not merely \nthat he fought a voluntary desegregation plan, since I can well \nappreciate the volatility of using busing to achieve equal educational \nopportunity. My concern is over the manner in which he aggressively \nfought this voluntary plan, the defiance he showed to the courts in \nthose proceedings and his use of that highly-charged issue for \npolitical advantage rather than for constructive action. Most \nsignificantly, on at least four crucial points, the testimony he gave \nto the Committee about this difficult era in Missouri's history was \nincomplete and misleading, which he essentially conceded when I \ncorrected the record on the second day of the hearing.\n  First, Senator Ashcroft repeatedly claimed during the first day of \nhis testimony that the state was not a party to the lawsuit brought to \ndesegregate the schools in St. Louis. He testified, in response to my \nquestions that ``the state had never been a party to the litigation.'' \n(1/16/01 Tr., at p. 101). He repeated this assertion that the state was \nnot a party to the litigation, stating, ``if the state hadn't been made \na party to the litigation and the state is being asked to do things to \nremedy the situation, I think it's important to ask the opportunity for \nthe state to have a, kind of, due process, and the protection of the \nlaw that an individual would expect,'' (Id., at p. 101).\n  Yet, Missouri was, indeed, made a party to the St. Louis lawsuit in \n1977, the year after Ashcroft took over as the state's Attorney \nGeneral. See Adams v. United States, 620 F.2d 1277,1285 (8th Cir.), \ncert. denied, 449 U.S. 826 (1980). I pointed out this fact at the \noutset of the second day of the hearings. (1/17/01 Tr., at p. 2-3), and \nSenator Ashcroft thanked me for the opportunity to clarify the record. \n(Id., at 2-3).\n  Second, Senator Ashcroft also repeatedly claimed in his testimony \nthat the state was not liable. He testified that ``I opposed a mandate \nby the federal government that the state, which had done nothing wrong, \nfound guilty of no wrong, that they should be asked to pay . . .'' (1/\n16/01 Tr., at p. 100). Again, he testified ``the state had not been \nfound really guilty of anything.'' (Id.). He explained that ``I argued \non behalf of the state of Missouri that it could not be found legally \nliable for segregation in St. Louis schools because the state had never \nbeen party to the litigation.'' (Id.). He further explained, ``Frankly, \nI thought the ruling by the court that the state would have to pay when \nthere was not showing of a state violation to be unfair.'' (Id. at p. \n101). He maintained this position in response to questions by Senator \nKennedy and testified that segregation in St. Louis ``was not a \nconsequence of any state activity.'' (Id., at p. 123).\n  In fact, however, the state was found directly liable for illegal \nschool segregation in St. Louis. In March 1980, the Eighth Circuit \nruled that both the state and the city school board were liable for \nsegregation. Adams v. United States, 620 F.2d 1277, 1280, 1291, 1294-95 \n(8th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 826 (1980). The state's improper \nconduct included previously mandating, over a period of years, the \ninter-district transfer of black students into segregated city schools \nto maintain segregation. Id. at 1280. In other words, when Senator \nAshcroft testified that the State ``had not been found really guilty of \nanything,'' the fact was that it had been found guilty of imposing \nforced busing on African-Americans in order to segregate them. And the \n``mandate by the federal government'' that he opposed was a mandate to \nremedy the State's own flagrant violation of Brown v. Board of \nEducation.\n  In June 1980, the district court made clear the state's liability, \nexplaining that ``the State defendants stand before the Court as \nprimary constitutional wrongdoers who have abdicated their remedial \nduty. Their efforts to pass the buck among themselves and other state \ninstrumentalities must be rejected.'' Liddell et al. v. Bd. of Ed. of \nCity of St. Louis, 491 F. Supp. 351, 357, 359 (E.D. Mo. 1980), aff'd \n667 F.2d 643 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1081 (1981). Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft appealed this liability finding, but the Eighth \nCircuit rejected his argument as ``wholly without merit.'' Liddell, \nsupra, 667 F.2d at 655. The U.S. Supreme Court denied the state's \nattempt to appeal the decision. 454 U.S. 1081, 1091 (1981).\n\n[[Page S597]]\n\n  Again, in 1982, the Eighth Circuit reiterated that the state \ndefendants were ``primary constitutional wrongdoers'' that could be \nordered to take remedial action. Liddell, 677 F.2d 626, 628-29, (8th \nCir.), cert. denied 459 U.S. 877 (1982). The U.S. Supreme Court again \ndenied the state's attempted appeal.\n  Yet again, as his attorney general term was ending in 1984, the \nEighth Circuit rejected the state's arguments against voluntary city-\nsuburb desegregation, and the Supreme Court again denied review. \nLiddell, 731 F.2d 1294, 1305-9 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 816 \n(1984).\n  I pointed out the multiple findings of state liability by the federal \ncourts at the outset of the second day of the hearing, and Senator \nAshcroft conceded the accuracy of that correction. (1/17/01 Tr., at p. \n2-3). It is a shame, indeed, that he only acknowledged the settled law \nof the case 20 years after the courts decided it.\n\n  Third, Senator Ashcroft testified that in the St. Louis case, ``[i]n \nall of the cases where the court made an order, I followed the order, \nboth as attorney general and as governor.'' (1/16/01 Tr., at p. 125-\n126). He repeated this claim in response to questions from Senator \nHatch, stating that ``we complied with the orders of the federal \ndistrict court and of the Eighth Circuit court of appeals and of the \nUnited States Supreme Court.'' (1/17/01 Tr., at p. 197).\n  While as attorney general, John Ashcroft may have complied with the \ntechnical terms of the court orders, his vigorous and repeated appeals \nshow that he did so reluctantly and the scathing criticism he received \nfrom the courts shows that they lacked confidence in how he was \nfulfilling his obligations as an officer of the court. This is \ntroubling. In 1981, the federal district court ordered the state and \nthe city board to submit voluntary desegregation plans, but attorney \ngeneral Ashcroft failed to comply. Consequently, the court threatened \nin March 1981 to hold the state in contempt if it did not meet the \nlatest deadline and explicitly criticized the state's ``continual delay \nand failure to comply'' with court orders. (AP 3/5/81). The court also \nstated the following: ``The court can draw only one conclusion--the \nstate has, as a matter of deliberate policy, decided to defy the \nauthority of the court.''(St. Louis Post-Dispatch 3/5/81). The district \ncourt also stated in a 1984 order, ``if it were not for the state of \nMissouri and its feckless appeals, perhaps none of us would be here \ntoday'' (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, December 30, 1984).\n  Fourth, Senator Ashcroft denied that he ``opposed voluntary \ndesegregation of the schools'' and said ``nothing could be farther from \nthe truth.'' (1/16/01 Tr., at p. 99). He asserted that ``I don't oppose \ndesegregation'' and that ``I am in favor of integration,'' and only \nopposed the State being asked to pay this very substantial sum of money \nover a long course of years.'' (Id., at p. 101).\n  I take Senator Ashcroft at his word that he supports integration. \nThis only makes more disturbing his public statements made in the heat \nof political campaigns that exacerbated an already difficult situation \nover desegregation in Missouri schools. In 1981, he opposed a plan by \nthe Reagan Administration for voluntary desegregation, based not just \non cost but also because it would allegedly attract ``the most \nmotivated'' black city students, even though the city school board \nitself disagreed. (Newsweek, May 18, 1981). I cannot understand how \nJohn Ashcroft, leading advocate of vouchers to facilitate ``parental \nchoice'' for those motivated to leave the public school system, could \nat the same time oppose the parental choice involved in voluntary \nschool desegregation for ``motivated'' African-Americans. In 1984, he \nassailed the St. Louis desegregation plan as an ``outrage against human \ndecency.'' (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, June 15, 1984). In his 1984 \ngubernatorial campaign, he proudly stated that he had done ``everything \nin his power legally'' to fight the plan and suggested that listeners \nshould ``[a]sk Judge (William) Hungate who threatened me with \ncontempt.'' (UPI, February 12, 1984).\n  Commentators at the time were critical of John Ashcroft's use for \npolitical gain of the difficult challenges of desegregating the \nschools. For example, the Post-Dispatch commented that Ashcroft and his \nRepublican gubernatorial primary opponent in 1984 were ``trying to \noutdo each other as the most outspoken enemy of school integration in \nSt. Louis,'' and were ``exploiting and encouraging the worst racist \nsentiments that exist in the state.'' (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, March \n11, 1984). An African-American newspaper, the St. Louis American, had \neven harsher words for Ashcroft. ``Here is a man who has no compunction \nwhatsoever to standing on the necks of our young people merely for the \nsake of winning political favor,'' it wrote. ``Ashcroft implies at \nevery news conference, radio and television interview that he couldn't \ncare less what happens to black school children.'' (St. Louis Post-\nDispatch, February 29, 1984).\n  Finally, during the course of the hearing, Senator Ashcroft tried to \ndeflect any criticism of his own actions over desegregation by trying \nto blame others. Specifically, he twice cited in his oral testimony and \nagain in his responses to written questions, an incident ``when the \nstate treasurer balked at writing the checks'' and ``it became \nnecessary to send a special delegation from my office to him to \nindicate to him that we believed compliance with the law was the \ninescapable responsibility . . . fortunately, the state treasurer at \nthe time made the decision to abandon plans for a separate counsel and \nto go ahead and make the payments.'' (1/17/01 Tr., at p. 196; see also \n1/16/01 Tr., at p. 100-103).\n  The treasurer to whom Senator Ashcroft referred was the late Mel \nCarnahan. As I clarified on the record, treasurer Carnahan faced \npersonal liability for making a payment without the warrant of the \ncommissioner of administration of the state of Missouri and properly \nissued the check as soon as he had the appropriate legal authority to \ndo so. (1/18/01 Tr., at p. 130). In other words, Mel Carnahan did not, \nas Senator Ashcroft implied, seek to defy the court's order; he merely \nmade sure that legally mandated procedures for complying with that \norder were followed. The insinuation that Mel Carnahan was the obstacle \nto desegregating Missouri's schools is false and reprehensible. \nGovernor Carnahan is rightly credited with bringing this lengthy \nlitigation to a close and fashioning progressive, bipartisan \nlegislation to appropriate funds sufficient for a remedy and allowing \nthe court to withdraw from active supervision of the case.\n  In my view, Senator Ashcroft's thinly-veiled disparaging testimony \nabout his deceased political opponent were mean and offensive.\n  In his written response to questions from Senator Kennedy, Senator \nAshcroft presents his role in the desegregation case as simply an \nattempt to oppose interdistrict remedies, not intradistrict remedies. \nThis is the same argument he made as Attorney General to justify \nbringing appeals from desegregation orders in 1981, 1982, and 1984. As \nexplained above, the courts repeatedly rejected this argument. It \nshould be noted in this regard that John Ashcroft did not merely appeal \nthose orders that imposed interdistrict remedies--he also appealed \norders mandating that the State aid in making improvements within St. \nLouis itself, and orders that simply told the State to enter into \ndiscussions concerning the possibility of interdistrict cooperation. \nSee, e.g., Liddell v. Board of Education, 667 F.2d 643. It should also \nbe noted that the courts found that Missouri was constitutionally \nresponsible for segregation in St. Louis in part because it mandated \nthe transfer of black suburban students into segregated city schools to \nenforce segregation. Liddell v. Bd. of Educ., 491 F. Supp. 351, 359 \n(E.D. Mo. 1980).\n\n  Ignorance Is His Defense--Southern Partisan and Bob Jones University. \nSenator Ashcroft's record on the racially-charged issues of voting \nrights and desegregation make more worrisome his explanations for and \nassociations with Southern Partisan magazine and Bob Jones University. \nIn short, his explanation is ignorance.\n  In 1998, Senator Ashcroft gave an interview to the Southern Partisan, \na magazine which has gained a reputation for espousing racist views due \nto its praise in past articles of such figures as former KKK leader \nDavid Duke and its defense of slave-holders. At the hearing, Senator \nBiden asked Senator Ashcroft about this interview and his\n\n[[Page S598]]\n\nassociation with this publication. Senator Ashcroft disavowed any \nknowledge about the publication or its reputation. He said, ``On the \nmagazine, frankly, I can't say that I knew very much at all about the \nmagazine. I've given magazine interviews to lots of people. . . . I \ndon't know if I've ever read the magazine or seen it'' (1/17/01 Tr., p. \n146). He told Senator Feingold that he thought the magazine was ``a \nhistory journal.'' (Id., at 219).\n  Yet, it is difficult to square Senator Ashcroft's quoted remarks in \nthe Southern Partisan interview with his purported ignorance about the \npublication. He praised the magazine, saying ``Your magazine also helps \nto set the record straight'' on what he called ``attacks the \n[historical] revisionists have brought against our founders.'' He added \neven more praise, saying, ``You've got a heritage of doing that, of \ndefending Southern patriots like Lee, Jackson and Davis.'' Southern \nPartisan, at 28 (2d Quarter, 1998). It is difficult to reconcile \nSenator Ashcroft's testimony not to have known ``very much at all'' \nabout the magazine with his own statements in the interview praising \nits ``heritage.'' Indeed, he subsequently admitted that ``I know \nthey've been accused of being racist.'' (1/17/01 Tr., p. 152).\n  Putting that aside, however, I find it more troubling that despite \nthe multiple opportunities he was given to distance himself from this \nmagazine and evidence regret for giving the interview, he refused to do \nso. Instead, he responded with a platitude saying, ``I condemn those \nthings which are condemnable.'' (Id., at 147). We need more than \nplatitudes from the next Attorney General. He made clear that what he \nmostly regretted is that this interview became an issue, saying: ``And \nI regret that speaking to them is being used to imply that I agree with \ntheir views.'' (1/17/01 Tr., p. 146). Would it really hurt him to say, \n``I made a mistake. It's an obnoxious publication and its positions are \noffensive\"? It troubles me to see a public official going around \napplauding racially offensive institutions, and it troubles me even \nmore to see him refusing to admit his mistakes and try to heal the \noffense.\n  The same claim of ignorance was Senator Ashcroft's excuse for \naccepting a speaking engagement and an honorary degree from Bob Jones \nUniversity. This school is not accredited. It did not admit African \nAmerican students until 1971. Then, from 1971 to May 1975, the \nUniversity accepted no applications from unmarried African American \nstudents, but did accept applications from African Americans ``married \nwithin their race.'' Bob Jones University v. U.S., 461 U.S. 574 (1983). \nEven after it lost its tax exempt status in the mid-1970's, Bob Jones \nUniversity maintained a ban on interracial dating. This policy changed \non March 3, 2000, when Bob Jones announced on Larry King Live that the \npolicy was dropped after an outcry over the visit to the University by \nthen candidate, now President Bush.\n  The school, however, continues to discourage interracial dating. \nAfter announcing that the school would drop the interracial dating ban, \nBob Jones told the student body at their daily chapel service the \nfollowing day that they must tell their parents if they became involved \nin an interracial relationship and parents must send a letter to the \ndean of men or women approving the relationship before the university \nwould allow it. Two days later, he announced that the school would drop \nthe parental permission requirement but that students who wanted to \nengage in ``serious dating relationships'' against their parents' \napproval would be referred to counseling by the university. That is \nmandatory special ``counseling'' for adults engaged in interracial \ndating in the year 2001. That is a disgrace to our nation and all that \nwe stand for.\n  As recently as March 2000, Bob Jones, the leader of the school, made \nclear on national TV that he views the Pope as the ``anti-Christ'' and \nboth Catholicism and Mormonism as ``cults.'' Senator Ashcroft claimed \nthat he did not know about the school's beliefs at the time he spoke. \n(St. Louis Post-Dispatch, March 3, 2000). Yet, when he spoke to the \nstudents at Bob Jones University, he appeared to condone the policies \nof the school from which they were graduating by thanking each of them \n``for preparing themselves in the way that you have.''\n  His assertion of ignorance was once again met with some skepticism, \nas even the press pointed out that ``he was attorney general [of \nMissouri] when the U.S. Supreme Court denied the university's tax \nexempt status, and was governor when a state Supreme Court candidate \nignited a controversy with pro-Bob Jones statements in 1992.'' (Id.). \nSpecifically, in 1992, then Governor Ashcroft considered appointing \nCarl Esbeck to fill, at the time, the seventh and last open seat on the \nMissouri Supreme Court, but this proposed nomination proved \ncontroversial due to Esbeck's criticism of the U.S. Supreme Court's \nruling that Bob Jones University was not entitled to tax-exempt status \ndue to its discriminatory practices. (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, August \n6, 1992). Having seen the offense caused by his own efforts to appoint \na judge who had been supportive of Bob Jones University in 1992, one \nmight have expected Senator Ashcroft to be more sensitive, and more \ncautious about accepting an honorary degree from the same institution \nseven years later.\n  Again, as with the Southern Partisan interview, Senator Ashcroft has \nnever apologized for accepting an honorary degree from this school or \nfor associating with it. Instead, during his unsuccessful Senatorial \ncampaign, in response to his opponent's challenge to take this action, \nSenator Ashcroft ``fired a puzzling return volley, saying he will give \nback all his degrees if Mr. Carnahan will return campaign contributions \nfrom pro-choice groups.'' (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, March 3, 2000). If \nSenator Ashcroft believes that support for Roe v. Wade is on a moral, \nlegal, or political par with racial bigotry and the demonization of the \nCatholic and Mormon Churches, he is further out of the mainstream than \nI thought. If not, he missed a major opportunity to heal an offense for \na great many Americans with an evasive and irrelevant response.\n\n  By contrast, after then candidate, now President Bush spoke at Bob \nJones University in February 2000, he expressed regret for the \nappearance, in recognition of the ``anti-Catholic and racially divisive \nviews'' associated with that school. Another Republican colleague, who \nalso received an honorary degree from Bob Jones University, \nRepresentative Asa Hutchinson, later took a public step to disassociate \nhimself from the school, calling the school's policies \n``indefensible.'' (New York Times, March 1, 2000).\n  Senator Ashcroft apparently has no regrets about accepting an \nhonorary degree from Bob Jones University. On the contrary, Senator \nAshcroft made clear in response to questions from both Senator Durbin \nand Senator Feinstein that he would consider a repeat visit to Bob \nJones University as U.S. Attorney General. (1/17/01 Tr., pp. 237, 243). \nSenator Durbin asked, ``you would not rule out, as attorney general of \nthe United States, appearing at that same school?'' Senator Ashcroft \nresponded, ``Well, let me just say this, I'll speak at places where I \nbelieve I can unite people and move them in the right direction.'' (Id. \nat p. 237). Senator Feinstein asked ``In six months, you receive an \ninvitation from Bob Jones University. You now know about Bob Jones \nUniversity. Do you accept that invitation?'' Senator Ashcroft indicated \nthat, ``it depends on what the position of the university is; what the \nreason for the invitation is,'' but the short answer is ``I don't want \nto rule out that I would ever accept any invitation there.'' (Id., at \np. 243).\n  This response was dismaying for a man who seeks the post of lawyer \nand advocate for all the people of this country. During the hearing, I \nsuggested that he ``put that honorary degree in an envelope and send it \nback and say this is your strongest statement about what you feel about \nthe policies.'' (Id., at p. 262). Maybe at a minimum he could send it \nback with a statement that he will consider associating with Bob Jones \nUniversity again if and when the school publicly disavows all of its \nracially and religiously offensive positions. That, at least, would be \nbetter than hanging a degree from an infamous bastion of discrimination \non the walls of the Attorney General's office. Ignorance is a weak \ndefense for associating with institutions that notoriously espouse \nracially insensitive and discriminatory philosophies and policies. An \ninability to recognize one's\n\n[[Page S599]]\n\nmistakes, and to acknowledge the sensitivities of others, is a serious \nflaw in a man who would be the Attorney General of all the people.\n  Finally, despite the deep concern about his judgment in appearing at \nBob Jones University, Senator Ashcroft has been less than forthright \nwith the Committee. During my short tenure as Chairman of the \nCommittee, I asked him personally for a copy of his commencement \naddress, in whatever form it was in, at a meeting on January 4, 2001. I \nthen wrote to Vice President Cheney, as head of the transition office, \ntwice requesting copies of any tape recordings or transcriptions of \nthat speech. In my January 11 letter, I reported that Bob Jones \nUniversity advised my staff a tape was available but would not be \nreleased without Senator Ashcroft's permission and specifically \nrequested ``a tape of the commencement ceremony in May, 1999, in which \nSenator Ashcroft participated.'' The next day, Senator Ashcroft \nfurnished the Committee with a transcription of the speech, on the same \nday the videotape of Senator Ashcroft's speech was broadcast on Larry \nKing Live. This videotape has never been provided to the Committee. \nMoreover, the Committee's request for the videotape of the entire \ncommencement proceeding remains unanswered.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft proudly told Southern Partisan magazine that ``I \nhave been as critical of the courts as any other individual, probably \nmore than any other individual in the Senate. I have stopped judges . . \n. and I will continue to do so.'' In fact, he led the Senate in the \npolitics of personal destruction by distorting the records of \npresidential nominees whose political ideologies or ``lifestyles'' he \ndisliked.\n  Let me start with a review of how Senator Ashcroft worked to block \nthe nomination of James C. Hormel to be the Ambassador to Luxembourg, \nand then how he explained his actions before the Committee on January \n17, 2001.\n  Ambassador Hormel had a distinguished career as a lawyer, a \nbusinessman, educator, and philanthropist. He had diplomatic experience \nas well. He was eminently qualified for the job of U.S. Ambassador to \nLuxembourg, Luxembourg's ambassador to the U.S. said the people of his \ncountry would welcome him, and a clear majority of Senators supported \nhis confirmation.\n  Yet he was denied a Senate debate and vote. Senator Ashcroft and \nSenator Helms were the only two members of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee who voted against favorably reporting the nomination of James \nHormel to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg.\n  In June 1998, at a luncheon with reporters, Senator Ashcroft is \nreported to have said:\n\n       People who are nominated to represent this country have to \n     be evaluated for whether they represent the country well and \n     fairly. His conduct and the way in which he would represent \n     the United States is probably not up to the standard that I \n     would expect. He has been a leader in promoting a lifestyle. \n     And the kind of leadership he's exhibited there is likely to \n     be offensive to . . . individuals in the setting to which he \n     will be assigned. Boston Globe (June 24, 1998).\n\n  Senator Ashcroft also said that a person's sexual conduct ``is within \nwhat could be considered and what is eligible for consideration'' for \nambassadorial nominees. (San Diego Union-Tribune June 19, 1998). The \nimplication of these remarks seems clear to me. But do not rely on my \njudgment. Listen instead to one of Senator Ashcroft's Republican \ncolleagues of the time, Senator Alphonse D'Amato. Senator D'Amato \nwrote, in a letter to Majority Leader Trent Lott, that he was \n``embarrassed\" that Hormel's nomination had been held up by other \nRepublican Senators. He wrote, ``I fear that Mr. Hormel's nomination is \nbeing obstructed for one reason, and one reason only: the fact that he \nis gay.'' (Id.)\n  When I questioned him at the hearing about his remarks at the 1998 \nluncheon, Senator Ashcroft did not deny making them. Instead, he asked \nus to ignore their clear import. I asked him directly: ``Did you block \nhis nomination from coming to a vote because he is gay?'' Senator \nAshcroft answered, ``I did not.'' I then asked ``Why did you vote \nagainst him? And why were you involved in an effort to block his \nnomination from ever coming to a vote?'' Senator Ashcroft implicitly \nacknowledged that he did engage in blocking the nomination from coming \nto a vote, saying,\n\n       Well, frankly, I had known Mr. Hormel for a long time. He \n     had recruited me, when I was student in college, to go to the \n     University of Chicago Law School. . . . But I did know him. I \n     made a judgment that it would be ill-advised to make him \n     ambassador based on the totality of the record. I did not \n     believe that he would effectively represent the United States \n     in that particular post. (1/17/01 Tr., p.191).\n\n  Senator Ashcroft then proceeded to claim, without directly addressing \nthe Hormel nomination, that ``[s]exual orientation has never been \nsomething that I've used in hiring in any of the jobs, in any of the \noffices I've held. It will not be a consideration in hiring at the \nDepartment of Justice. It hasn't been for me.'' (Id, at 192).\n  I brought Senator Ashcroft back to the question of why he had opposed \nJames Hormel's nomination. I said: ``I'm not talking about hiring at \nthe department, I'm talking about this one case, James Hormel. If he \nhad not been gay, would you have at least talked to him before you \nvoted against him? Would you have at least gone to the hearing? Would \nyou have at least submitted a question?'' (Id.) When evasion did not \nwork, Senator Ashcroft simply flatly refused to answer, stating, ``I'm \nnot prepared to redebate that nomination here today,'' and repeated his \nclaim that his opposition to the Hormel nomination was based on ``the \ntotality of his record.'' (Id, at 192-193). Three Senators asked the \nnominee in written questions to specify the factors that led to his \nopposition to James Hormel, but he continued to refuse to do so, citing \nagain ``the totality of Mr. Hormel's record'' as the basis for his \nopposition.\n  The story does not end there. The implication of Senator Ashcroft's \nremarks what some have called ``creepy'' about being ``recruited'' by \nand ``knowing'' Mr. Hormel was that some personal experience with that \nnominee played a role in his decision to block it. (New York Times, \nJanuary 20, 2001). Yet, by letter dated January 18, 2001, Mr. Hormel \nexpressed ``very deep concern'' about this implication since he could \nnot recall ``ever having a personal conversation with Mr. Ashcroft,'' \n``no contact with him of any type since . . . nearly thirty-four years \nago, in 1967.'' Mr. Hormel also clarified that he did not personally \n``recruit'' John Ashcroft to law school; he had simply admitted him, \nalong with hundreds of other students, in his capacity as Dean of \nStudents. Mr. Hormel concluded, ``For Mr. Ashcroft to state that he was \nable to assess my qualifications to serve as Ambassador based upon his \npersonal long-time relationship with me is misleading, erroneous, and \ndisingenuous.''\n  I am forced to agree with Mr. Hormel's assessment. There certainly \nstill has not been any forthright explanation from Senator Ashcroft for \nhis insistence that, contrary to the views of the President, the \nAmbassador from Luxembourg, and the vast majority of his Senate \ncolleagues, Mr. Hormel would not ``effectively represent the U.S.'' in \nLuxembourg. Indeed, given another chance to explain his position \nthrough responses to written questions, Senator Ashcroft has simply \nrepeated his boilerplate language about the ``totality'' of Mr. \nHormel's record, adding no specificity beyond the fact that Luxembourg \nis ``the most Roman Catholic country in all of Europe.'' He does not \nexplain the significance of this fact.\n\n  At the hearing, Senator Feingold asked Senator Ashcroft whether, as \nAttorney General, he would permit employment discrimination against gay \nmen and lesbians, pointing in particular to Senator Ashcroft's public \nstatement that ``I believe the Bible calls [homosexuality] a sin, and \nthat's what defines sin for me.'' Senator Feingold stated that \n``Attorney General Reno clarified that sexual orientation should not be \na factor for FBI clearances.'' Then he asked Ashcroft, ``As attorney \ngeneral would you continue and enforce this policy?'' Again, Senator \nAshcroft did not answer the question directly with a clear statement \nagainst discrimination based on sexual orientation at the FBI, saying, \n``I have not had a chance to review the basis for the FBI standard and \nI am not familiar with it. I would evaluate it based upon conferring \nwith the officials in the bureau.'' In my view, the American people are \nentitled to expect from\n\n[[Page S600]]\n\ntheir Attorney General more forthright and decisive leadership on the \nsimple question of whether the FBI will be permitted to discriminate on \nthe basis of sexual orientation. The correct answer to that question is \nnot ``maybe,'' it is ``no.''\n  This is troubling. Senator Ashcroft's answers raise serious question \nabout whether he would adopt a policy as Attorney General that a \nperson's sexual orientation could be a basis for denying a security \nclearance. If sexual orientation can be used to deny a security \nclearance for a government job, gay men and lesbians would be barred \nfrom numerous government positions, including in the Justice \nDepartment, as surely as if John Ashcroft, as Attorney General, were to \nexclude them personally.\n  In October 1999, Senator Ashcroft spearheaded a campaign to defeat \nthe nomination of Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White to serve as \na federal district court judge. Like many Senators, I was deeply \ntroubled by Senator Ashcroft's sneak attack on Judge White, who was the \nfirst nominee to a federal district court to be rejected on the floor \nof the Senate in over 50 years. Senator Ashcroft's testimony to the \nCommittee did nothing to allay my concerns.\n  There can be no serious question that Senator Ashcroft distorted \nJudge White's record. To give just one example, in one of the three \nopinions that Senator Ashcroft cited as supposed evidence of a \n``procriminal jurisprudence,'' Judge White took a narrower view of the \nFourth Amendment--and a broader view of the powers of the police--than \nthe U.S. Supreme Court took a few years later. That is to say, Senator \nAshcroft characterized Judge White as ``procriminal'' for taking a \nposition that was more pro-law enforcement than the position of a \nmajority of the conservative Rehnquist Court.\n  Senator Ashcroft has told us that he based his opposition to James \nHormel and other nominees on ``the totality of the record.'' In the \ncase of Judge White, the totality of the record was very different than \nwhat Senator Ashcroft led his colleagues to believe. While I state \nagain and unequivocally that I do not charge Senator Ashcroft with \nracism, I cannot help but think that he was willing to play politics \nwith Judge White's reputation in a manner that casts serious doubt on \nhis ability to serve all Americans as our next Attorney General. In my \nmind, and in the minds of many Americans, he engineered a party-line \nvote to reject Judge White not because Judge White was unqualified, but \nbecause he wanted to persuade the voters of Missouri that John Ashcroft \nwas tougher on crime and more pro-death penalty than his Democratic \nopponent. The voters saw through this ploy, and Senators should \nconsider it carefully in deciding whether to give their consent to this \nnomination. In doing so, Senators may ask themselves whether a man who \nused his public office to besmirch a respected judge for crass \npolitical ends is the sort of man the American people deserve as their \nAttorney General.\n  I want to discuss a few of the circumstances surrounding the White \nnomination that cause me particular concern.\n  As an initial matter, I am disturbed by Senator Ashcroft's repeated \nclaims that he torpedoed Judge White at the urging of law enforcement \ngroups that had come forward to oppose the nomination. On the Senate \nfloor, Senator Ashcroft told his colleagues that law enforcement \nofficials in Missouri had ``decided to call our attention to Judge \nWhite's record in the criminal law.'' (Congressional Record, October 4, \n1999, at S11872). But after the Senate voted to reject the nomination, \nthe press reported that Senator Ashcroft had actually solicited \nopposition to Judge White from at least some law enforcement officials. \n(St. Louis Post-Dispatch, October 8, 1999). This detail--who contacted \nwhom came up at the hearing, and was at the center of more attempts by \nSenator Ashcroft to shade the facts.\n  At the hearing, Senator Durbin noted while questioning Senator \nAshcroft that the Missouri Chiefs of Police had refused to accept his \ninvitation to oppose Judge White. Senator Ashcroft responded, ``I need \nto clarify some of the things that you have said. I wasn't inviting \npeople to be part of a campaign.'' Senator Durbin followed up by \nasking, ``Your campaign did not contact these organizations?'' The \nnominee tried to side-step the issue by making a general statement \nrather than responding directly to the question he was asked. He said, \n``My office frequently contacts interest groups related to matters in \nthe Senate. We don't find it unusual. It's not without precedent that \nwe would make such a request to see if someone wants to make a comment \nabout such an issue.''\n  According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Senator Ashcroft's office \ncontacted at least two police groups with respect to Judge White 's \nnomination, and the contacts went well beyond a mere ``request to see \nif someone wants to make a comment.'' The president of the Missouri \nPolice Chiefs Association--one of Missouri's largest police groups--\nsaid that he was contacted by Senator Ashcroft's office and asked \nwhether the Association would work against the nomination. The \nAssociation declined. Its president said that he knew Judge White \npersonally and had always known him to be ``an upright, fine \nindividual.'' (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, October 8, 1999.)\n\n  According to the same article, Senator Ashcroft's office also \nsolicited opposition to Judge White from the Missouri Federation of \nPolice Chiefs. Vice President Bryan Kunze said the group got involved \nafter Senator Ashcroft's office sent them information about the \nnomination. Kunze is quoted as saying ``I never heard of Judge White \nuntil that day.'' (Id.)\n  What does this mean? It means that there was a simpler, and more \ndirect answer to Senator Durbin's question: ``yes.'' Senator Ashcroft's \noffice did contact law enforcement organizations. And it did so not \njust to ``see if'' they wanted ``to make a comment,'' but to solicit \ntheir opposition to Judge White. At a minimum, Senator Ashcroft shaded \nthe truth when he suggested that his opposition to Judge White was \nprompted by the concerns of Missouri's law enforcement community. While \nsome law enforcement officials eventually came to oppose Judge White's \nnomination, some of that opposition was instigated and orchestrated by \nSenator Ashcroft himself.\n  Moreover, although Senator Ashcroft did not acknowledge the fact, \nmany law enforcement officials strongly supported Judge White. At the \nhearing, I put into the record a strong letter of support and \nendorsement from the chief of police of the St. Louis Metropolitan \nPolice Department for Judge White, which Senator Ashcroft received \nbefore the vote on Judge White's nomination. I also put into the record \nanother letter from the Missouri State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of \nPolice from shortly after the vote, stating on behalf of 4,500 law \nenforcement officers in Missouri that they viewed Judge White's record \nas, ``one of the judges whose record on the death penalty has been far \nmore supportive of the rights of victims than the rights of \ncriminals.'' Yet when Senator Ashcroft went to the floor of the Senate \nin October 1999 to disparage Judge White's record as ``procriminal,'' \nhe gave a one-sided account, ignoring the law enforcement officials who \nhad come out in support of Judge White's nomination or declined Senator \nAshcroft's invitations to work against him.\n  It is worth reviewing the history that led up to Senator Ashcroft's \ndenouncement of Judge White on the floor, because that history sheds \nsome light on the genesis of the supposed ``procriminal'' concerns. \nPresident Clinton first nominated Judge White in June 1997. Like many \nother judicial nominations during the Clinton Administration, the \nnomination was held in limbo for more than two years before the Senate \nfinally voted on it in October 1999. During most of that time, there \nwas no mention of Judge White's judicial record. Senator Ashcroft has \nsaid that he began to review Judge White's opinions ``upon his \nnomination'' (Congressional Record, October 4, 1999, at S11871), yet he \ndid not elaborate on his reasons for opposing Judge White until August \n1999, when he told reporters that Judge White had ``a very serious bias \nagainst the death penalty.'' At the time, the death penalty was a hot \nissue in Senator Ashcroft's re-election campaign against the late \nGovernor Carnahan, who had recently commuted the sentence of a death \nrow\n\n[[Page S601]]\n\ninmate at the request of Pope John Paul II. It was Governor Carnahan \nwho, in 1995, appointed Judge White to the Missouri Supreme Court.\n  When Judge White came before the Judiciary Committee in May 1998, he \nwas introduced by two members of Missouri's congressional delegation, \nSenator Bond and Congressman Clay. Both urged Judge White's \nconfirmation. Congressman Clay also stated that he had discussed the \nnomination with Senator Ashcroft, and that Senator Ashcroft had polled \nJudge White's colleagues on the Missouri Supreme Court--all Ashcroft \nappointees--and they all spoke highly of Judge White and said he would \nmake an outstanding federal judge. That was yet another set of \nendorsements for Ronnie White that Senator Ashcroft did not himself \nacknowledge when he spoke out on the nomination.\n  After the hearing, Senator Ashcroft submitted 21 written questions to \nJudge White, 15 more than were submitted to the other nominees at the \nsame hearing. Among those questions were two concerning an action--\nneither an unlawful nor an unethical one--that Judge White had taken as \na State legislator in 1992 that contributed to the defeat of an anti-\nabortion bill supported by then-Governor Ashcroft. There was also one \nquestion about a death penalty case in which Judge White had written a \nlone dissent.\n  When Senator Ashcroft joined a handful of Senators and voted against \nJudge White in Committee, he inserted a short statement in the \nCommittee records on May 21, 1998, to explain his vote. Making \nreference to the anti-abortion bill that was the subject of those \nwritten questions, he said: ``I have been contacted by constituents who \nare injured by the nominee's manipulation of legislative procedures \nwhile a member of the Missouri General Assembly. This contributes to my \ndecision to vote against the nomination.'' He made no mention of \nconcern about any other issue, including the death penalty case about \nwhich he had also asked Judge White a written question. Apparently \nthen, as of May 1998, Senator Ashcroft's investigations into Judge \nWhite's judicial record had not unearthed any ``procriminal'' concerns.\n  Senator Ashcroft's testimony and answer to written questions that \nreproductive rights played no part in his opposition to Judge White is \nflatly contradicted by both the questions he asked about the judge as a \nstate legislator calling ``an unscheduled vote that resulted in the \ndefeat of a measure designed to limit abortions,'' and the statement \nSenator Ashcroft put in the Judiciary Committee mark up record in May \n1998, in which he referred to Judge White's ``manipulation of \nlegislative procedures while he was a member of the Missouri General \nAssembly'' and expressly stating that ``contribute[d] to my decision.''\n  This dissembling is disingenuous, but explains the troubling fact \nthat Senator Ashcroft did not fully question Judge White about his \ndeath penalty decisions or law enforcement concerns at his hearings \nbefore the Judiciary Committee. That is the purpose of nomination \nhearings, as Senator Ashcroft well knows. At his own hearings, Senator \nAshcroft was afforded a full and fair opportunity to answer questions \nand address concerns. Judge White did not have that opportunity. He was \nambushed on the floor of the Senate, with no opportunity to explain his \ndecisions or defend his reputation.\n  Judge White finally got that opportunity during the hearings on this \nnominee, and I urge all Senators to read his testimony. He was \ngracious, he was dignified, and he set the record straight. This is \nwhat that record shows.\n\n  Ronnie White grew up in a poor, segregated neighborhood in St. Louis. \nHe worked his way through high school, college, and law school. He had \na distinguished legal career in private practice and as city counselor \nfor the City of St. Louis and lawyer for the St. Louis Police \nDepartment. In 1989 he was elected to the Missouri legislature, where \nhe was twice selected to serve as chairman of the judiciary committee. \nIn 1995, he became the first African-American to serve on the Missouri \nSupreme Court.\n  The Facts on Judge White's Capital Cases. At the hearing last week, \nSenator Ashcroft admitted that he had characterized Judge White's \nrecord as being ``pro-criminal,'' but claimed that he ``did not \nderogate his background.'' I believe that Senator Ashcroft's attacks on \nJudge White on the Senate floor went well beyond simply characterizing \nhis record. Senator Ashcroft suggested that Judge White had ``a \ntremendous bent toward criminal activity'' (Congressional. Record, \nOctober 5, 1999, at S11933) and ``a serious bias against a willingness \nto impose the death penalty'' (Congressional Record, October 4, 1999, \nat S11872), and argued that, if confirmed, ``he will use his lifetime \nappointment to push law in a procriminal direction, consistent with his \nown personal political agenda'' (Id.). In my 26 years in the Senate, I \nhave never heard an attack like that on the Senate floor against a \nsitting judge. I can scarcely imagine anything more derogatory that \ncould be said about a judge than that he uses his office to pursue a \npersonal procriminal agenda. Such accusations should not be lightly \nmade. The facts show that they were baseless.\n  Fact one: Judge White voted to uphold the death penalty 40 times in \n58 death penalty cases. In other words, he voted to uphold the death \npenalty in about 70 percent of the capital cases that came before him. \nOne of Senator Ashcroft's own appointees to the Missouri Supreme Court, \nthe late Ellwood Thomas, had a much higher percentage of votes for \nreversal of death sentences.\n  Fact two: In 55 out of 58 capital cases that came before Judge \nWhite--that is 95 percent of the time--he ruled the same way as at \nleast one of his Ashcroft-appointed colleagues. Judge White dissented \nin only seven out of 58 death penalty cases, and he was the sole \ndissenter in only three of those cases. The other four times, one or \nmore of the Ashcroft judges agreed with Judge White that the defendant \nwas entitled to a new trial or a new sentencing hearing.\n  Fact three: In leading the campaign to defeat Judge White, Senator \nAshcroft specifically criticized just three cases in which Judge White \nfiled a lone dissent. In each case, Judge White's dissents were well-\nreasoned and entirely defensible. The first was a 1996 case called \nState v. Damask (936 S.W.2d 565), which raised the issue of the \nconstitutionality of drug interdiction checkpoints in two Missouri \ncounties. Police officers dressed in camouflage were stopping motorists \nin the dark of night at the end of a lonely highway exit ramp and \nlooking for evidence to allow them to search their vehicles for drugs. \nThese stops were challenged by some motorists as a violation of the \nFourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure, \nbut the Missouri Supreme Court decided that these were constitutional \nlaw enforcement procedures.\n  Judge White filed a reasoned and respectful dissent. He agreed with \nhis colleagues that ``trafficking in illegal drugs is a national \nproblem of the most severe kind.'' He also agreed that traffic stops \nsuch as these could be lawful, if conducted in a reasonable way. \nHowever, he found, based on the specific facts of the case, that the \ncheckpoint operations at issue were unduly intrusive and therefore \nunconstitutional.\n  Just a few months ago, a case with facts similar to the Missouri case \nmade its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. In City of Indianapolis v. \nEdmond, 121 S. Ct. 447 (2000), a six-justice majority of the Court \nfound that drug interdiction checkpoints like the ones that were upheld \nby the Missouri Supreme Court are unconstitutional per se. Indeed, the \nCourt went much farther in protecting the rights of motorists than \nJudge White went in his dissent.\n  Judge White testified last week that the U.S. Supreme Court had \nvindicated his decision to dissent in the Damask case. That is clear to \nany competent lawyer reading the two cases. Yet before the Supreme \nCourt's ruling, Senator Ashcroft said that Judge White's dissent in \nDamask revealed a ``tendency . . . to rule in favor of criminal \ndefendants and the accused in a . . . procriminal manner.'' \n(Congressional Record, October 4, 1999, at S11872). A fairer \ncharacterization would be that Judge White faithfully followed the law \nin striking a reasonable balance between the freedoms that we all enjoy \nas motorists and the interests of law enforcement.\n  Senator Ashcroft has stubbornly refused to retract his criticism of \nJudge White's dissent in Damask, notwithstanding the subsequent \ndecision by\n\n[[Page S602]]\n\nthe U.S. Supreme Court vindicating Judge White's position. Instead, \nSenator Ashcroft in his responses to written questions mischaracterized \nthe facts of Damask, claiming that ``the police had created a \ncheckpoint designed to stop only those who behaved in a way to justify \nindividualized suspicion.'' As is clear from the majority decision, \nhowever, the police in Damask stopped all motorists who approached the \ncheckpoint, without any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing, \nvirtually identical to the fact in the Missouri case in which Judge \nWhite dissented.\n  One would think that any Senator who characterized as ``procriminal'' \na position taken by Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, among others, would \nbe embarrassed and quick to apologize. Yet we have yet to hear an \napology or even a retraction by Senator Ashcroft on this point.\n  The other two dissents that Senator Ashcroft cited as evidence of \nJudge White's ``procriminal'' tendencies were filed in death penalty \ncases: State v. Johnson, 968 S.W.2d 123 (Mo. 1998), and State v. \nKinder, 942 S.W.2d 313 (Mo. 1996). Both cases involved brutal and \nshocking murders, and we heard a lot about those murders at the \nhearings. While my heart goes out to the victims, I am troubled by the \nimplication of many of my Republican colleagues that those accused of \nparticularly egregious crimes are somehow undeserving of the fair trial \nand due process rights guaranteed to all Americans. As Senator \nAshcroft's own models of conservative jurisprudence have written, ``the \nmore reprehensible the charge, the more the defendant is in need of all \nconstitutionally guaranteed protection for his defense.'' (Danner v. \nKentucky, 525 U.S. 1010 (1998) (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., \ndissenting from the denial of certiorari)). Focusing on the egregious \nfacts of (rather than the legal analysis underlying) a death penalty \ncase is a disingenuous and inappropriate way of evaluating the \nqualifications of sitting judges.\n\n  Judge White's dissents in Johnson and Kinder properly turned on the \nlegal issues in those cases. In Johnson, the key legal issue was \nwhether or not the defendant received constitutionally sufficient \nassistance from his lawyer. In Kinder, the issue was whether the \ndefendant was entitled to a new trial with an unbiased judge. These \nwere difficult issues, and as many of my Republican colleagues have \nacknowledged, reasonable minds could differ on how they should have \nbeen resolved. Some respected legal commentators have reviewed the \nfacts in these cases and the relevant legal precedents and concluded \nthat Judge White was right to dissent. I especially urge all Senators \nto read Stuart Taylor's thoughtful and thorough analyses of these cases \nin the National Journal on October 16, 1999, and January 13, 2001.\n  It is of course the right and duty of all Senators to familiarize \nthemselves with a nominee's record before voting on his nomination. I \nrespect Senator Ashcroft's diligence in undertaking a review of Judge \nWhite's decisions. What I do not understand are the apparent \ndistortions of Judge White's record, the intemperate attacks, and the \nimplication that judges should apply a lower standard of review in \ncapital cases. When Senator Ashcroft began his campaign against Judge \nWhite, retired Missouri Supreme Court Judge Charles Blackmar--a \nRepublican appointee--said that Judge White's votes in capital cases \nwere ``not a significant diversion from the mainstream,'' and added \nthis strong criticism of Senator Ashcroft: ``The senator seems to take \nthe attitude that any deviation is suspect, liberal, activist and I \ncall this tampering with the judiciary because of the effect it might \nhave in other states that have the death penalty where judges, who \nmight hope to be federal judges, feel a pressure to conform and to vote \nto sustain the death penalty.'' (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, August 21, \n1999). As a strong believer in judicial independence, I share Judge \nBlackmar's concern.\n  To conclude on this point, Senator Ashcroft's words and actions with \nrespect to the Ronnie White nomination raise serious concerns about his \nsense of fair play, his willingness to demonize those with whom he \ndisagrees, and his respect for judicial independence. In my view, what \nAmerica needs is an Attorney General who examines the facts and the law \ncarefully and impartially and then articulates his positions \nrespectfully, not one who distorts the facts and plays politics with \nthe law.\n  In his first day of testimony, Senator Ashcroft stated, in response \nto my questions, that he had opposed Bill Lann Lee, President Clinton's \nnominee for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, because he had \n``serious concerns about his willingness to enforce the Adarand \ndecision, which was a recent decision of the United States Supreme \nCourt. . . . Mr. Lee did not indicate a clear willingness to enforce \nthe law based on that decision.'' (1/16/01 Tr., at p. 96). When I tried \nto explore what Senator Ashcroft perceived to be Mr. Lee's failure in \nthis regard, Senator Ashcroft explained that when Mr. Lee was asked at \nhis confirmation hearing what the Adarand standard was, ``he did not \nrepeat the strict scrutiny standard of `narrowly tailored and directly \nrelated. . . . He stated another standard.'' (Id, at 97). This is \nsimply not true.\n  When Bill Lann Lee testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on \nOctober 22, 1997, he had the following colloquy with Chairman Hatch:\n\n       Chairman Hatch: These cases [Croson and Adarand] would also \n     stand for the proposition, wouldn't they, that strict \n     scrutiny would be required in all governmental racial \n     classification matters?\n       Mr. Lee: Yes, that is correct, that strict scrutiny is \n     required and that properly designed and properly implemented \n     affirmative action programs are consistent with the strict \n     scrutiny test under the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendment.\n       Chairman Hatch: Would you agree that Adarand stands for the \n     proposition--the Supreme Court case of Adarand--stands for \n     the proposition that State-imposed racial distinctions are \n     presumptively unconstitutional, that that presumption can be \n     overcome only by a strong basis in evidence of a compelling \n     interest and should be narrowly tailored? Have I stated that \n     pretty correctly?\n       Mr. Lee: Yes, and I agree with that.\n       Chairman Hatch: All right . . . .\n\n  (Bill Lann Lee Confirmation Hearing, Senate Judiciary Committee, \nOctober 22, 1997, Transcript of Proceedings, pages 41-42).\n  Moreover, when I asked Senator Ashcroft about Bill Lann Lee, he \nreferred to the District Court's decision on remand in the Adarand \ncase, which found unconstitutional the contracting affirmative action \nprogram that is the subject of that litigation. He failed to note, \nhowever, that the Tenth Circuit has since reversed that decision, \nfinding that the contracting program did in fact meet strict scrutiny. \nAdarand Constructors v. Slater, 228 F.3d 1147 (10th Cir. 2000).\n  To this day, I do not understand Senator Ashcroft's opposition to the \nnomination of Bill Lann Lee, but I do know that the purported reason he \ngave at his own nomination hearing is simply not supported by the \nrecord.\n  At the hearing, Senator Ashcroft and the witnesses called on his \nbehalf made claims about the diversity of his appointments to the state \ncourts and his cabinet while he was Governor. These claims were clearly \ndesigned to rebut any inference that his actions and record with regard \nto presidential nominees such as Judge Ronnie White, Bill Lann Lee, and \nothers, or his associations with Southern Partisan magazine or Bob \nJones University, reflected any fundamental insensitivities on his \npart. Unfortunately, the claims made at the hearing about the diversity \nof Governor Ashcroft's appointments do not withstand scrutiny when \ncompared to either his Republican predecessor in the Governor's office, \nSenator Kit Bond, or his successor, Governor Mel Carnahan.\n\n  At the first day of the hearing, Senator Ashcroft stated: ``I took \nspecial care to expand racial and gender diversity in Missouri's \ncourts. I appointed more African-American judges to the bench than any \ngovernor in Missouri history, including appointing the first African-\nAmerican on the Western District Court of Appeals and the first \nAfrican-American woman to the St. Louis County Circuit Court.'' (1/16/\n01 Tr., at p. 89). He repeated these claims the next day. (1/17/01 Tr., \nat p. 57).\n  The claim of appointing more African American judges than any \ngovernor in Missouri history is deliberately deceptive. While Governor \nfrom 1985 through 1992, John Ashcroft set a record at the time with \neight African American appointments to the bench,\n\n[[Page S603]]\n\nbut this is only when compared to his predecessors, who had appointed \nfar fewer. His successor, the late Governor Mel Carnahan, appointed \ntwenty. (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 1/11/01).\n  Also, while technically correct that Governor Ashcroft appointed the \nfirst African-American on the Western District Court of Appeals, this \nwas not the first African American appointed to the appellate court in \nMissouri, as might be implied. Judge Ted McMillian was appointed by \nWarren Hearnes more than ten years earlier to the Eastern District \nCourt of Appeals. (See The Honorable Donald P. Lay, ``The Significant \nCases of the Honorable Theodore McMillian During His Tenure on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,'' 43 St. Louis U. L.J. 1269, \n1270 (1999)). I point this out not to minimize Senator Ashcroft's \nappointment of minority candidates, but simply to ensure that the \nrecord is not exaggerated.\n  Jerry Hunter, former Missouri Labor Secretary, and Missouri Circuit \nJudge David Mason, both of whom had been appointed by Governor \nAshcroft, testified in support of the nominee and applauded his record \nof appointments of African-Americans while he was Governor. Mr. Hunter \nwas the only African-American or minority to serve in John Ashcroft's \ncabinet, which is made up of fifteen department directors, during his \nfirst four years. (1/18/01 Tr., at pp.179-180). In addition, although \nthe Mound City Bar Association, which Mr. Hunter described as ``one of \nthe oldest black bar associations in this country,'' commended Governor \nAshcroft in 1991 upon his appointment to the bench of an African-\nAmerican female judge, this same organization, by letter dated January \n12, 2001, has made clear that ``this is not a nomination that we can \nsupport.'' (Id., at p. 180).\n  Senator Ashcroft as Governor of Missouri claims to have taken \n``special care'' of gender diversity as well, yet his record of \nappointments of women to the judiciary is ``abysmal.'' (1/18/01 Tr., at \np. 60). He carefully testified that he named two women to the appellate \ncourt, the first in 1988; the other to fill the same position when the \nfirst woman moved up to the Supreme Court. He does not mention that \nthis did not happen until nearly three years after he took office and \nonly after front-page stories in local newspapers made clear that \n``Missouri lags behind most other states in the selection of women for \njudgeships,'' (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, October 22, 1986), and a \nnational survey by the National Women's Political Caucus ranked \nGovernor Ashcroft ``near the bottom among state executives in \nappointment of women to Cabinet-level posts. . .'' (St. Louis Post-\nDispatch, October 24, 1986). By contrast, the same survey put Governors \nMadeleine Kunin of Vermont and Bill Clinton of Arkansas among the top \nten states for the percentages of women in their cabinets. (Id.).\n\n  A study on the number of women appointed to the judiciary published \nin 1986 found that Missouri was one of only five states with \nintermediate appellate courts that had never had a female jurist above \nthe trial court level. (Karen Tokarz, ``Women Judges and Merit \nSelection under the Missouri Plan,'' 4 Washington Univ. Law Quarterly, \n903, 916 (1986)). This study suggests that ``the attitude of the chief \nexecutive may affect women's access to the judiciary,'' and cites as \nexamples that the ``explicit affirmative efforts by Governor \nChristopher Bond and President Jimmy Carter to recruit women applicants \ncorrelate with increased numbers of women judicial appointees during \ntheir tenures.'' (Id., at 942). By comparison, the study notes that at \nthe time the article was written, then Governor Ashcroft had selected \nno women for the 19 judicial appointments he had made ``nor has \nAshcroft appointed any women for the nine interim appointments.'' \n(Id.).\n  John Ashcroft's low numbers of women appointments to the judiciary \nwere not due simply to a failure to have women's names recommended by \nnominating commissions. Press accounts report that women candidates \nappeared on panels presented to then-Governor Ashcroft, but in the \nincidents reported, he appointed men. (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, March \n20, 1988). Moreover, as Governor, John Ashcroft did even more poorly \nwith so-called ``interim appointments'' of judges outside the merit \nselection plan, where governors have free rein and are not limited by \nthe recommendations of a selection panel. In two terms, Governor Bond \nhad named eight women out of 77 interim appointments. Governor Ashcroft \nnamed only two women out of 51 interim appointments. (``Report on the \nMissouri Task Force on Gender and Justice,'' 58 Missouri Law Rev. 485, \n688 n. 746 (1993)).\n  In short, Senator Ashcroft deserves credit for appointing women to \njudicial posts, but the amount of credit he should be given depends on \nthe context. John Ashcroft named only eleven women out of 121 judicial \nappointments during his eight years as governor. Id. at 702, Table 1. \nNot only did his successor appoint nearly three times that number in \nthe equivalent time period but this number was even surpassed by his \npredecessor, Governor Bond, who appointed twelve women during two \nterms. (58 Mo. Law Rev. at 702, Table 1).\n  Governor Ashcroft's testimony on the diversity of his appointments is \ntechnically accurate, but in my view was misleadingly framed to portray \nhim as a leader on diversity. In truth, the record shows little \nevidence of urgency or strong advocacy for diversity. Both his actual \nrecord and the manner in which he portrayed it to the Committee are \ntroubling.\n  John Ashcroft has engaged in a pattern of using inflammatory and \nintemperate language to question the authority and legitimacy of the \nUnited States Supreme Court and lower federal courts in a way that \nraises serious concern in my mind about his suitability for the job of \nAttorney General and whether he is the appropriate role model for the \njob of the Nation's chief law enforcer. Worse, while sworn to uphold \nthe Constitution, he has backed up his words and disrespect for Supreme \nCourt precedent by sponsoring legislation both in Missouri and in the \nU.S. Senate that is patently unconstitutional.\n  John Ashcroft has taken many opportunities to bash the federal \njudiciary. In several public speaking engagements he has chosen to \nattack the decisions of federal courts. (Speech to the Claremont \nInstitute, Los Angeles, California, October 13, 1997, available through \nwww.claremont.org; Appearance on ``Jay Sekulow Live'' Radio Show, July \n24, 1998, available through www.jaylive.com.) The most extreme example \nof Senator Ashcroft's rhetorical attacks on the Supreme Court is the \nspeech he gave in March 1997 to both the annual meeting of the \nConservative Political Action Conference and to the Heritage \nFoundation. In ``Courting Disaster: On Judicial Despotism In the Age of \nRussell Clark,'' he characterized the Supreme Court's landmark abortion \ndecisions in Roe v. Wade and Casey as ``illegitimate.'' He called the \nJustices who struck down an Arkansas congressional term limit law \n``five ruffians in robes,'' and said that they ``stole the right of \nself-determination from the people.'' He asked, ``have people's lives \nand fortunes been relinquished to renegade judges, a robed, \ncontemptuous intellectual elite fulfilling Patrick Henry's prophecy, \nthat of turning the courts into, quote, `nurser[ies] of vice and the \nbane of liberty?' '' He also said ``We should enlist the American \npeople in an effort to rein in an out-of-control Court.''\n  The ``five ruffians in robes'' to whom Senator Ashcroft referred are \nmembers of the Rehnquist Supreme Court,\nwhich is a most conservative court--sometimes activist but decidedly \nconservative. I have heard Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Ruth \nBader Ginsburg called many things but never ``ruffians.''\n  I find this sort of rhetoric deeply troubling. I certainly understand \ndisagreeing with a Supreme Court decision. Lately, I have found myself \nstrongly disagreeing with a number of decisions by the Court. I took \nstrong exception to the Court's intervention in Bush v. Gore, but \nhaving noted my disagreement in respectful terms, I said that I \naccepted the Court's decision, and believed that all Americans should \ndo the same.\n  When I asked Senator Ashcroft about these comments, he did not \ndisavow them but simply noted that ``I don't think it'll appear in any \nbriefs.'' (1/17/01 Tr., at p. 263). I should hope not. But I would also \nhope that a public official sworn to uphold the Constitution would not \ngo running around denying\n\n[[Page S604]]\n\nthe legitimacy of Supreme Court decisions that, in our constitutional \nsystem, are the ultimate authority on what the Constitution means.\n  These comments raise serious issues about a fundamental qualification \nfor the job of Attorney General: Senator Ashcroft's ability and \nreadiness to discharge the obligatory oath to uphold the Constitution.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft's legislative career is not reassuring in this \nregard. While it is true, as Senator Ashcroft stressed, that a \nSenator's legislative role is different from an Attorney General's law \nenforcement role, both take the same oath to uphold the Constitution, \nso the one is not irrelevant to the other.\n  As a Senator, John Ashcroft displayed little reverence for the \nConstitution as written and as interpreted by the Supreme Court. It is, \nof course, the privilege of Senators to propose constitutional \namendments, but in his one six-year term here, Senator Ashcroft stood \nout among his colleagues in his eagerness to amend the Constitution \nwhenever its terms dictated a result he did not like. He did not like \nRoe v. Wade, so he sponsored a Human Life Amendment, which would have \nbanned all abortions except where necessary to protect the life of the \nmother. He did not like the way the ``five ruffians in robes'' \ninterpreted the Constitution in the Term Limits case, so he sponsored \nTerm Limits Amendments. In total, Senator Ashcroft sponsored or \nsupported constitutional amendments on no less than eight different \ntopics in his six years in the Senate.\n  That is a distinctly un-Madisonian record. James Madison told \nposterity that constitutional amendments should be limited to ``certain \ngreat and extraordinary occasions.'' Madison's wise counsel, like the \nConstitution itself, has stood the test of time: the Constitution has \nonly been amended 17 times in the past 200 years. But John Ashcroft \ndisagrees with James Madison on the spirit of Article V, the Article \ngoverning the amendment process. Indeed, he even introduced a proposed \namendment, supported by no other Senator, to change Article V itself. \nIn a Dallas Morning News article dated January 17, 1995, he was quoted \nas saying that he wanted to ``swing wide open the door'' to let the \nStates decide on new amendments. His proposed amendment would have done \nso. Even more than the other amendments he supported, Senator \nAshcroft's amendment to Article V would have severely cut back on the \nconstitutional role of Congress, by allowing bare majorities in three-\nquarters of the States to amend the Constitution even if a majority of \nCongress disagreed. This radical proposal sits in stark contrast to the \nclaim Senator Ashcroft makes today--in his response to my written \nquestion he says that his efforts to amend the Constitution as a \nSenator ``reflect a fundamental respect for the Constitution and for \nthe mechanism that that documents for altering the text.''\n  More troublesome is Senator Ashcroft's record of introducing \nunconstitutional legislation, particularly in the area of reproductive \nrights. In both Missouri and in the U.S. Senate, Senator Ashcroft has \nbeen an unabashed advocate of banning abortion in all circumstances, \nexcept to save the life of the mother, even though this position runs \ndirectly counter to the fundamental rights set forth in Roe v. Wade. He \nhas also been an unabashed critic of this seminal decision, stating as \nrecently as 1998 that, ``[c]learly, the Supreme Court, unguided by any \nconstitutional text, has written themselves into a position that is \nlegally, medically and morally incoherent.'' (Congressional Record, \nJune 5, 1998, at S5697).\n  In 1981, when he served as Attorney General of Missouri, he testified \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Separation of Powers on a \nbill sponsored by Senator Helms and Representative Hyde. The bill \nstated ``the life of each human being begins at conception,'' and would \nhave allowed each state to outlaw and criminalize abortion, without any \nexception for victims of rape or incest or even to save the life of the \nmother. (Hearings on S. 158 Before the Subcomm. on Separation of \nPowers, Senate Comm. on the Judiciary, 97th Cong. 1105-1109 (1981)). \nJohn Ashcroft made clear his view of both Roe v. Wade and the workings \nof the Supreme Court in his introductory remarks, stating:\n\n       I have devoted considerable time and significant resources \n     to defending the right of the State to limit the dangerous \n     impacts of Roe v. Wade, a case in which a handful of men on \n     the Supreme Court arbitrarily amended the Constitution and \n     overturned the laws of 50 States relating to abortions. \n     (Id.).\n\n  In a chilling reminder of stringent State anti-abortion laws in \neffect before Roe v. Wade, Missouri Attorney General Ashcroft \nreminisced that:\n\n       We had a law which specified that aborting a child \n     subjected a person to a manslaughter charge, but there was a \n     clearly maintained exception for cases in which the mother's \n     life was in danger.\n\n  True to his 1981 testimony, he was actively involved in anti-abortion \nefforts as Missouri's Attorney General. He defended a state statute \nthat, among other restrictions, would have required all abortions after \n12 weeks to be performed in a hospital. The Supreme Court recognized \nthat such a requirement would effectively increase the cost of such \nabortions dramatically and make them all but impossible to obtain for \nanyone but the wealthy, and therefore ruled that this requirement was \nunconstitutional. Planned Parenthood v. Ashcroft, 462 U.S. 476, 482 \n(1983). In a brief he submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court in defense of \nthat law, John Ashcroft argued that, in establishing the in-hospital \nrequirement, ``Missouri has acted precisely within the parameters of \nRoe v. Wade.'' (Brief for the Cross-Petitioners).\n  While defending the constitutionality of a state law is the \nappropriate role of the attorney general, he has also aggressively \ntested the limits of Roe v. Wade as a legislator. In 1986, as Governor \nof Missouri, John Ashcroft signed a sweeping anti-abortion bill that \nstated, among other things, that ``life begins at conception.'' The \nSupreme Court declined to assess the constitutionality of that \nprovision, while upholding other parts of the law. Webster v. \nReproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490 (1989).\n  His legal success in Webster prompted Governor Ashcroft to appoint a \nstate task force to consider additional measures the state could enact \nto restrict reproductive rights. Despite the complexity and volatility \nof this issue, he made no effort to develop a consensus but instead \nindicated that the group should not have ``drawn-out hearings'' and he \nonly appointed members who shared his ardent anti-abortion views. This \nwas a polarizing action. Indeed, legislative leaders reportedly \n``declined to nominate members to the task force, saying it was going \nto end up stacked anyway in favor of one side of the issue.'' (St. \nLouis Post-Dispatch, August 9, 1989). Harriett Woods confirmed at the \nnomination hearing that ``the leaders of the legislature were so \noutraged that they said they wouldn't participate.'' (1/18/01 Tr., at \np. 63). Not surprisingly, the preordained conclusions of the Task Force \non Unborn Life report, issued in January 1990, were that ``the ultimate \ngoal of legislation and policy-making in the State of Missouri should \nbe . . . the imposing of legal restrictions to reduce the number of \nabortions.''\n\n  Shortly after release of that report, Governor Ashcroft announced his \nsupport for legislation, to become known as Missouri Senate bill 339, \nthat would have criminalized abortions performed for eighteen different \nreasons, including ``to prevent multiple births from the same \npregnancy,'' ``the failure of a method of birth control,'' and ``to \nprevent having a child not deemed to be wanted by the mother or \nfather.'' No exception for rape or incest was allowed. To add to the \nburdens on a woman seeking an abortion, this legislation would have \nrequired a pregnant woman to file an affidavit stating the reasons for \nthe abortion, apparently subjecting her to criminal liability for \nperjury if she did not fully disclose in a document to be filed with \nthe abortion facility her most personal, confidential reasons for \nexercising her right to choose. Furthermore, the bill would also have \nallowed the spouse or father of the ``unborn child'' and the state \nAttorney General to intervene in court to stop the abortion. This \nextreme legislation failed in the state legislature because it lacked \nan exception for cases of rape and incest. (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, \nMarch 28, 1991).\n  When I consider the moral, ethical and religious dilemma that parents \nface when they learn that a pregnancy is multiple and that the best \nchance for normal, healthy births may be to have\n\n[[Page S605]]\n\nselective fetal reduction, I shudder at proposed legislation that would \nmake such a difficult decision a criminal one.\n  More disturbing is Senator Ashcroft's effort, as part of his \nconfirmation evolution, to distance himself from this legislation. He \nacknowledges in response to my written questions that Missouri Senate \nBill 339 might not be constitutional, but asserts that (1) he had ``no \nspecific recollection'' of the bill; (2) ``it appears from press \nreports that representatives from my office may have expressed interest \nin seeing the bill passed out of committee''; (3) ``[w]hile I was \ngovernor, it was my policy to refrain from opining on whether I would \nsign a bill until after a bill actually passed the legislature'' and \n(4) ``this bill did not prevent abortions attributable to rape, incest \nor a ``bona fide, diagnosed health problem''. (Emphasis in original). \nEach of these assertions are belied by the public record.\n  First, Senator Ashcroft's failure of recollection about this \nlegislation is difficult to credit. In his State of the State Address \non January 9, 1990, he said: ``within the next week, I will announce my \nsupport for concepts that would enhance our capacity to protect unborn \nchildren.'' Shortly thereafter, on January 19, 1990, he issued a \nstatement saying, ``Today I am proposing that Missouri ban abortions \nfor birth control, sex selection, and racial discrimination. \nMissourians reject multiple, birth control abortions. . . I am grateful \nfor these proposals and I would welcome an opportunity to sign their \nprotections for unborn children and mothers into law as an alternative \nto the continuation of abortions.'' These specific reasons for banning \nabortion were part of Missouri Senate bill 339. Senator Ashcroft failed \nto provide the Committee with these speeches, but they are documented \nin contemporaneous press reports. (See St. Louis Post-Dispatch, January \n10, 1990 and January 20, 1990).\n  Second, Senator Ashcroft is wrong when he says only his \n``representatives . . . expressed interest.'' In addition to the \nspeeches cited above, in which he expressly supported the terms of this \nlegislation, when the bill was being debated in the Missouri Senate, \nthen-Governor Ashcroft reportedly got personally involved in pressuring \na swing vote. ``Gov. John Ashcroft had telephoned Singleton to urge his \nsupport for a bill barring virtually all abortions'' [referring to \nSenate Bill 339]. St. Louis Post-Dispatch, March 28, 1991.\n  Third, Senator Ashcroft is wrong when he says he refrained from \nopining about signing the bill. Contemporaneous press reports note that \n``[t]he governor's proposal would join two bills that would outlaw most \nabortions in Missouri. Ashcroft said he would sign those measures into \nlaw `as an alternative to the continuation of abortions.' '' (St. Louis \nPost-Dispatch, January 20, 1990).\n  Finally, Senator Ashcroft is wrong when he says the bill did ``not \nprevent abortion attributable to rape, incest''. The bill itself \nprovides no such exceptions and, in fact, the bill failed because in \nthe view of the ``swing vote'' ``the proposal went too far. . . it \nfailed to assure the continued legality of abortions in cases involving \nrape or incest.'' (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, March 28, 1991).\n  We are all aware that during his time in the Senate, John Ashcroft \nwas among the most avid of anti-abortion legislators. He has \ncosponsored the so-called ``Human Life Act,'' which states that ``the \nlife of each human being begins at fertilization.'' This legislation \nwould not only ban all abortions, but also have the effect of outlawing \nthe most common forms of contraception, including the birth control \npill and the IUD.\n  At the nomination hearing, I asked a panel of witnesses that included \nboth supporters and opponents of this nomination, and was composed \nlargely of experts on reproductive rights issues, whether anyone \ndisagreed that the Human Life Act was patently unconstitutional on its \nface. No one expressed disagreement, or disputed me when I said: ``I'll \ntake it by your answers, everybody feels it's unconstitutional.'' (1/\n18/01 Tr., at p. 80).\n  In response to my written questions, Senator Ashcroft has now \nconceded, as part of his confirmation evolution, that, as introduced, \nthe Human Life Act of 1998 was ``not constitutional under Roe and \nCasey,'' thus acknowledging that while sworn to uphold the \nConstitution, he knowingly proposed unconstitutional legislation. His \nexplanation--``I thought that [the legislation] had the potential to \npromote a discussion that could have led to the passage of legislation \nthat would have been constitutional under Roe and Casey''--is \ninconsistent with his statement on introduction of the bill: ``I \nbelieve that our proposed Human Life Act is a legitimate exercise of \nCongressional power under Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment'' \n(Congressional Record. 6/5/98, S5697).\n  There is no doubt that John Ashcroft's support for unconstitutional \nlegislation limiting reproductive rights stems from his genuine and \nheart-felt antipathy for the woman's right to choose--her right to \nchoose not only whether to be pregnant but also the form of \ncontraceptive which works best for her. Limiting access to \ncontraceptives is, for me, a significantly troubling aspect of John \nAshcroft's record.\n  For example, when he testified before the Senate in 1981, opponents \nof the Helms-Hyde bill at issue made clear that an important \nconsequence of a law mandating that life begins at conception would be \nto permit states to ban multiple forms of popular contraceptives. One \nexpert physician explained, ``[t]his bill, if enacted into law, will \nprohibit the use of such commonly employed contraceptives as certain \nbirth control pills and intrauterine devices because these forms of \nbirth control prevent implantation into the uterus of the fertilized \novum that has, by legal decree, been made a person.'' (Hearings on S. \n158 Before the Subcomm. on Separation of Powers, Senate Comm. on the \nJudiciary, 97th Cong., supra, at p. 51, testimony of Dr. Leon \nRosenberg).\n  Short of federal legislation, John Ashcroft took other steps to limit \naccess to contraceptives at the local level. In 1980, as Missouri's \nAttorney General, he issued a legal opinion designed to undermine the \nstate's nursing practices law. He opined that the giving of information \nabout and dispensing of condoms, IUDs and oral contraceptives, and \nother basic gynecological services by nurses constituted the criminal \nact of the unauthorized practice of medicine, even though these \nservices were at the time routine health practices provided by Missouri \nnurses, including within the State's own county health departments. As \na result, the State Board of Registration for the Healing Arts \nthreatened certain physicians and nurses with a show cause order as to \nwhy criminal charges should not be brought against them. The attorney \nwho represented these nurses and physicians, Frank Susman, testified at \nthe nomination hearing that:\n\n       Implementation of the nominee's Opinion would have \n     eliminated the cost-effective and readily available delivery \n     of these essential services to indigent women, who often \n     utilize county health departments as their primary health \n     care provider, and would have shut and bolted the door to \n     poor women who relied upon these services as their only means \n     to control their fertility. (1/18/01 Tr., at p. 75).\n\n  In a lawsuit designed to resolve this matter, Attorney General \nAshcroft intervened to block the nurses from providing these family \nplanning services, but a unanimous Missouri Supreme Court struck down \nthe nominee's interpretation of the Nursing Practice Act. Sermchief v. \nGonzales, 660 S.W.2d 683 (1983).\n  Mr. Susman testified that the nominee has ``at every opportunity . . \n. sought to limit access to and to require parental consent for not \nonly abortion, but for contraception as well.'' (1/18/01 Tr., at p. \n76). Indeed, in the Senate, Senator Ashcroft was the sole sponsor of \nlegislation that would require parental consent before ``an \nabortifacient'' or ``contraceptive drugs or devices'' are dispensed to \na minor through federally-subsidized programs. (S. 2380, in 105th \nCongress; S. 3102 in 106th Congress).\n  Set against this record, John Ashcroft's testimony that he accept[s] \nRoe and Casey as the settled law of the land and that he will follow \nthe law in this area'' seems, at a minimum, implausible. (1/16/01 Tr., \nat p. 91).\n  Religious organizations perform wonderful acts of compassion and \ncharity and play a critical role in helping those most needy in our \ncountry and in filling gaps left by government programs. Yet, our \nConstitution obligates us to ensure that church and state remain\n\n[[Page S606]]\n\nseparate, to protect the religious beliefs of all of our citizens from \ngovernment interference, and to protect the rights of those who do not \nbelieve. This obligation means that any use of religious organizations \nto provide social services must be structured with extraordinary care, \nand that there be separation between proselytizing and charity. John \nAshcroft has been a leading proponent of the most extreme ``charitable \nchoice'' policies, under which religious organizations would not even \nhave to avoid religious proselytizing while distributing federal \nbenefits.\n  His deference to religious groups is such that, as Governor, he even \nopposed laws aimed at ensuring that church-run day care centers met the \nsame basic health and safety requirements (e.g., smoke detectors and \nfire exits) that applied to all other day care centers because, as he \nput it in his response to my written questions, of ``the need to \nprotect religious institutions from excessive entanglements with \ngovernment.'' Missouri was one of a small group of States that did not \napply ordinary health and safety requirements to day care centers run \nby religious organizations. (St. Louis Post-Dispatch, June 13, 1985). \nNevertheless, John Ashcroft threatened to veto bills aiming to apply \nthese requirements. (UPI, December 3, 1984). The extremeness of this \nposition was demonstrated by the testimony of James Dunn, who recounted \nhow a move to apply safety regulations to religiously-run child care \ncenters in Texas were opposed by only three out of 600 such centers (1/\n19/01 Tr., at p. 73).\n  Senator Ashcroft has also not been forthcoming in response to \nstraightforward questioning concerning his views of the Supreme Court's \nFirst Amendment jurisprudence. He told the Christian Coalition in 1998 \nthat ``a robed elite have taken the wall of separation built to protect \nthe church and made it a wall of religious oppression.'' But when I \nasked him in writing to specify which court decisions he was referring \nto, he offered no response. Similarly, I asked him about his attitude \ntoward the Supreme Court's 1987 decision in Edwards v. Aguillard, which \nheld that States may not forbid the teaching of evolution when \n``creation science'' is not also taught. He would not say whether he \nagreed with the decision or not, and he would not provide any examples \nto support his 1997 claim that ``over the last half century, the \nfederal courts have usurped from school boards the power to determine \nwhat a child can learn.''\n  John Ashcroft presents himself as a man of great certitude--we did \nnot hear any regret from him during his testimony about his appearance \nat Bob Jones University, his interview with Southern Partisan magazine, \nor his reference to former Reagan Administration press secretary Jim \nBrady as the ``leading enemy'' of responsible gun owners. In his \nwritten responses to questions from members of the Committee, he \nbypassed further opportunities to reflect on his controversial \nstatements and actions. He can be fairly characterized as seeing issues \nas sharp contests between right and wrong, and I am sure that he \nbelieves he chooses the right. But I am concerned that his certitude \nmay make him insensitive to the actual impact of his actions on \nindividual American families and citizens. I think in particular of the \nstory of Pete Busalacchi, who submitted written testimony to the \nJudiciary Committee.\n\n  Pete Busalacchi is a Missouri man and was one of John Ashcroft's \nconstituents. Almost 15 years ago, his teenage daughter, Chris \nBusalacchi, was grievously wounded in a car crash. According to Mr. \nBusalacchi, his daughter's doctors told him that she would remain in a \npersistent vegetative state for the remainder of her life. (Busalacchi \ntestimony, p. 1). After more than three years had passed since the \naccident, during which time Chris Busalacchi never recovered from her \ninjuries, Mr. Busalacchi sought to move his daughter to Minnesota. He \nplanned to seek further medical opinions and consider removing her \nfeeding tube if the medical consensus continued to be that she had no \nhope of recovery. (Id. at p. 2). Instead, the Ashcroft Administration \nobtained a restraining order preventing Mr. Busalacchi from removing \nher from the state, launching a two-year battle seeking to prevent Mr. \nBusalacchi from making determinations about his daughter's medical \ntreatment. (Id.) Pete Busalacchi testified that John Ashcroft, through \nhis administration, injected his ``political and religious views into \n[the Busalacchi] family's tragedy.'' (Id. at p. 1). When informed of \nthe way Mr. Busalacchi felt and asked in writing whether his \nadministration had shown the proper respect for the Busalacchi family \nin such a difficult time, John Ashcroft simply said, ``Yes.'' He made \nno acknowledgment that this tragedy even presented a difficult case, \nnor did he express compassion for the family.\n  President Bush announced that John Ashcroft would be his nominee for \nAttorney General on December 22, 2000. The choice of a controversial \nnominee was his alone. Despite the controversy surrounding this \nnomination, we proceeded expeditiously to schedule nomination hearings, \nas requested by then President-Elect Bush, even before we had received \nthe formal nomination, a complete FBI background report or Senator \nAshcroft's complete response to the standard Committee questionnaire.\n  As the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for the three-week period \nfrom the beginning of the new 107th Congress until the Inauguration, I \npledged to conduct the nomination hearing for John Ashcroft in a full, \nfair, and thorough manner. I believe this pledge was amply fulfilled. I \nconferred regularly with Senator Hatch to ensure that every single \nwitness from whom the nominee and his supporters wished to hear were \ncalled as witnesses. I also provided a fair amount of time and \nopportunity for the American people, through their elected \nrepresentatives, to ask the nominee about fundamental issues and the \ndirection of federal law enforcement and constitutional policy that \naffect all of our lives.\n  At a time of political frustration and division, it is important for \nthe Senate to listen. One of the abiding strengths of our democracy is \nthat the American people have opportunities to participate in the \npolitical process, to be heard and to feel that their views are being \ntaken into account. Just as when the American people vote, every vote \nis important and should be counted so, too, when we hold hearings we \nought to do our best to take competing views into account. Being \nthorough, and giving a fair hearing to supporters and opponents of the \nnomination, is also what fairness to the nominee requires. I and others \nput tough questions to John Ashcroft so that he would have a fair \nopportunity to respond to our concerns, instead of being ambushed on \nthe Senate floor without an opportunity to respond, as had happened to \nRonnie White.\n  Over the last 200 years the confirmation process has evolved. The \nfirst Congress established the office of the Attorney General in 1789 \nbut confirmations were handled by the full Senate or special \ncommittees. It was not until 1816 that the Senate established the \nJudiciary Committee as one of the earliest standing Committees, chaired \ninitially by Senator Dudley Chase of Vermont. It was not until 1868 \nthat the Senate began regularly referring nominations for Attorney \nGeneral to this Committee. In the 26 years that I have been privileged \nto serve in the United States Senate, these confirmation hearings have \nbecome an increasingly important part of the work of the Committee.\n  Of the 15 cabinet nominees not to be confirmed over time, nine were \nrejected by the Senate after a floor vote. Of those, one was a former \nSenator, John Tower, in 1989. Two were nominees to serve as Attorney \nGeneral. One of those rejected Attorney General nominees was Charles \nWarren, an ultraconservative Detroit lawyer and politician nominated by \nPresident Coolidge who was voted down by a Senate controlled by the \nPresident's own party due to concern that Warren's prior associations \nraised questions about his suitability to be Attorney General.\n\n       Progressive Republicans, recalling that Warren had aided \n     the sugar trust in extending its monopolistic control over \n     that industry believed this appointment was a further example \n     of the President's policy of turning over government \n     regulatory agencies to individuals sympathetic to the \n     interest they were charged with regulating. . . . [T]he \n     progressive Republicans combined with the\n\n[[Page S607]]\n\n     Democrats in March 1925 to defeat the nomination narrowly. \n     Richard Allen Baker, ``Legislative Power Over Appointments \n     and Confirmations,'' Encyclopedia of the American Legislative \n     System, at p. 1616.\n\n  After the Senate rejected the nomination of Charles Warren, President \nCoolidge nominated John Sargent, a distinguished lawyer from Ludlow, \nVermont, who was immediately confirmed and was the only Vermonter ever \nto serve as the Attorney General of the United States.\n  It has been more than 25 years since a Senator was nominated to be \nAttorney General. Senator William Saxbe of Ohio resigned his Senate \nseat in 1974 to pick up the reins of the Justice Department in the \naftermath of Watergate, at a time that saw two prior Attorneys General \nindicted toward the end of the Nixon Administration. It has been more \nthan 130 years since a President has chosen to nominate a former \nSenator after he lost his bid for reelection to the United States \nSenate to be Attorney General. It is not since President Grant \nnominated George Williams to be Attorney General in 1871 that we have \nhad a former Senator nominated to this important post after being \nrejected by the people of his home State.\n\n  The position of Attorney General is of extraordinary importance, and \nthe judgment and priorities of the person who serves as Attorney \nGeneral affect the lives of all Americans. The Attorney General is the \nlawyer for all the people and the chief law enforcement officer in the \ncountry. Thus, the Attorney General not only needs the full confidence \nof the President, he or she needs the confidence and trust of the \nAmerican people. All Americans need to feel that the Attorney General \nis looking out for them and protecting their rights.\n  The Attorney General is not just a ceremonial position, and his or \nher duties are not just administrative or mechanical. Rather he or she \ncontrols a budget of over $20 billion and directs the activities of \nmore than 123,000 attorneys, investigators, Border Patrol agents, \ndeputy marshals, correctional officers and other employees in over \n2,700 Justice Department facilities around the country and in over 120 \nforeign cities. Specifically, the Attorney General supervises the \nselection and actions of the 93 United States Attorneys and their \nassistants and the U.S. Marshals Service and its offices in each State. \nThe Attorney General supervises the FBI and its activities in this \ncountry and around the world, the INS, the DEA, the Bureau of Prisons \nand many other federal law enforcement components.\n  The Attorney General evaluates judicial candidates and recommends \njudicial nominees to the President, advises on the constitutionality of \nbills and laws, determines when the Federal Government will sue an \nindividual, business or local government, decides what statutes to \ndefend in court and what arguments to make to the Supreme Court, other \nfederal courts and State courts on behalf of the United States \nGovernment. The Attorney General exercises broad discretion, largely \nunreviewed by the courts and only sparingly reviewed by Congress, over \nhow to allocate that $20 billion budget and how to distribute billions \nof dollars a year in law enforcement assistance to State and local \ngovernment, and coordinates task forces on important law enforcement \npriorities. The Attorney General must also set those priorities, and \nmake tough decisions about which cases to compromise or settle. A \nwillingness to settle appropriate cases once the public interest has \nbeen served rather than pursue endless, divisive, and expensive \nappeals, as John Ashcroft did in the Missouri desegregation cases, is a \ncritical qualification for the job.\n  There is no appointed position within the Federal Government that can \naffect more lives in more ways than the Attorney General, and no \nposition in the cabinet more vulnerable to politicization by one who \nputs ideology and politics above the law. We all have a stake in who \nserves in this uniquely powerful position and how that power is \nexercised.\n  We all look to the Attorney General to ensure even-handed law \nenforcement; equal justice for all; protection of our basic \nconstitutional rights to privacy, including a woman's right to choose, \nto free speech, to freedom from government oppression; and to safeguard \nour marketplace from predatory and monopolistic activities, and \nsafeguard our air, water and environment.\n  As I said at the confirmation hearings for Edwin Meese to be Attorney \nGeneral, ``[w]hile the Supreme Court has the last word on what our laws \nmean, the Attorney General has often more importantly the first word.''\n  In addition, the Attorney General has come to personify fairness and \njustice to people all across the United States. Over the past 50 years, \nAttorneys General like William Rogers and Robert Kennedy helped lead \nthe effort against racial discrimination and the fight for equal \nopportunity. The Attorney General has historically been called upon to \nlead the Nation in critical civil rights issues, to unite the Nation in \nthe pursuit of justice, and to heal divisions in our society. America \nneeds an Attorney General who will fight for equal justice for all and \nwin the confidence of all the people, not one with a record of missed \nopportunities to bring people together.\n  I do not have the necessary confidence that John Ashcroft can carry \non this great tradition and fulfill this important role. Therefore, I \ncannot support his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman).

Mr. President, several weeks ago, Senator Specter and \nI had the unique privilege to represent our nation and this body during \na visit to Germany, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Bosnia, Egypt \nand Israel.\n  While in these nations, we were able to meet with a number of \ngovernment and non-governmental leaders who familiarized us with the \ncurrent situation in southeastern Europe and the Middle East.\n  I found our discussions with these leaders to be extraordinarily \neducational and highly productive, and their insight helped us assess \nthe broad spectrum of issues that shapes both of these volatile regions \nof our globe.\n  Our first stop was in Munich, Germany where Senator Specter and I \nspoke with members of the U.S. Embassy about trade, security and \nforeign policy issues facing the United States and Germany.\n  We also met with a number of leaders of the Munich business community \nto talk about trade issues affecting the United States and the European \nUnion, (EU). Specifically, we discussed steel, bananas, and \ngenetically-modified beef--all issues currently dominating our trade \nrelations.\n  We further spoke about the deployment of the National Missile Defense \nsystem, our commitment to the ABM Treaty and the concern in the U.S. \nthat the Europeans are moving away from their commitments to NATO.\n  Our second stop was in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. It was my first trip to \nYugoslavia in many years; since before Milosevic came to power. I had \nbeen asked to go many times--even by the Patriarch himself--but I said \nthat I would not go until Milosevic was no longer in power. I had taken \nthe same view with regards to Croatia; I would not go there until \nTudjman was gone.\n  The fact that in the last year I've visited both Croatia and \nYugoslavia says that a lot about the change that has happened.\n  And I am proud of the fact that I was the first member of the House \nor Senate to visit Croatia's new president, Stipe Mesic, and that \nSenator Specter and I were the first U.S. elected officials to fly into \nYugoslavia and congratulate President Kostunica.\n  I think it's important for the American people to know that our \nefforts in southeastern Europe are paying dividends for the cause of \ndemocracy, the\n\n[[Page S608]]\n\nrule of law, human rights and a market economy.\n  However, a part of me often wonders if we had taken as much of an \ninterest in southeastern Europe in the early 1990's as we do today, \nperhaps we wouldn't have to have U.S. troops in Bosnia and Kosovo.\n  Still, we are making progress in restoring order and building peace, \nand though some may not agree, it is in our national interest to be \ninvolved in the Balkans.\n  I was impressed with the leadership of Yugoslavia's President \nKostunica. He has surrounded himself with bright, capable individuals \nwho share their President's eagerness to bring their nation back into \nthe fold of the international community.\n  Our discussion focused on a number of issues, including reintegrating \nYugoslavia into the international community after Milosevic's downfall, \nthe country's continuing economic challenges, the humanitarian issues \nfacing the people--including a lack of power, medicine and medical \nequipment--and the situation in Kosovo, the Presevo Valley and \nrelations with Montenegro.\n  I was also impressed with Zoran Djindjic, the Serbian government's \nprime minister. Our meeting largely focused on the same subject matters \ndiscussed with President Kostunica.\n  We also discussed in detail the war crimes issue and America's strong \ninterest in seeing progress in this area. I reminded him that Congress \nhad laid out conditions in the FY 2001 Foreign Operations \nAppropriations bill in order for U.S support to continue.\n  From Serbia, we traveled to Bosnia to visit our American troops. We \nwere met by Major General Smart who gave us an overview of the \nsituation in Bosnia. He informed us that the men and women under his \ncommand understand the importance of their mission, have high morale \nand are performing beyond expectations.\n  After lunching with some of our men and women in uniform from Ohio \nand Pennsylvania, Senator Specter and I rode along with some of our \ntroops on a Humvee patrol through the area.\n  I asked a couple of the young soldiers with whom we were patrolling \nwhat they thought would happen if the United States were to pull out of \nthe region. They answered without hesitation that the ethnic \nhostilities between the Serbs, the Croat's and the Muslim's would \nalmost immediately resume.\n  Their assessment--these two young men who are right in the thick of \nit--made it clear how important it is to maintain an ongoing \ninternational military presence in Southeastern Europe for at least the \nimmediate future. In my view, Bosnia's government structure which was \ncreated in Dayton is fundamentally unworkable, and it must be \nreassessed if there is ever to be a lasting peace in Bosnia.\n  After a return to Belgrade for more meetings, we flew to Egypt, where \nwe met with President Mubarak.\n  We had a detailed discussion about the latest peace plan put forward \nby President Clinton, Egypt's role in the peace process, and the \ncomparative positions of the Israelis and Palestinians.\n  During the meeting, we encouraged President Mubarak to support \nPresident Clinton's peace initiative, and requested he urge other Arab \nleaders to support the peace initiative in Israel.\n  From Cairo, we went to Israel to meet with Shimon Peres, Ehud Barak \nand Ariel Sharon and other leaders to discuss the fragile peace \nprocess.\n  Mr. Peres felt that economic cooperation is a key to conflict \nresolution, believing that if people have something to lose in war or \nviolence, they will be less likely to fight. We also discussed the \nissues of the day in the negotiations--the Temple Mount and refugee \nreturns.\n  Mr. Barak expressed his disappointment at the failure of various \npeace initiatives, and concern that the Palestinians may be learning \nthe wrong lesson: that continued violence strengthens their negotiating \nposition.\n  He stressed the opposite: that violence is slowing the peace process \nand strengthening the negotiating position of the Israelis. Mr. Barak \nwas hopeful that negotiations would continue throughout the American \npresidential transition and the Israeli elections. Thank God they have.\n  We then met with Ariel Sharon, and immediately discussed his \ncontroversial visit to the Temple Mount last September and the impact \nit had on the peace process. I indicated that many Americans felt it \nwas inflammatory.\n  Mr. Sharon explained that his visit was a normal event and that every \nIsraeli citizen has the right to visit the Temple Mount because of its \nreligious significance. Evoking images of Richard Nixon, he further \nstated that he was the only candidate for Prime Minister who could \nreach a true peace agreement with the Palestinians.\n  After my meeting with Mr. Sharon, I joined U.S. Consul General Ron \nSchlicher for a dinner discussion with Faisal Husseini. Husseini is a \nleading figure in the Palestinian community. We had a lengthy \ndiscussion regarding the ongoing violence and tensions in Israel, \nprospects for peace, and the Palestinian perspective on the last 50 \nyears.\n  The next day, I also met with Mr. Jawdat Ibrahim, a young Palestinian \nbusinessman who was deeply interested in the peace negotiations. I was \ninterested in his view--and through him, the Palestinian view--on \ncurrent events. Our discussion was interesting and it added an \nimportant perspective to my trip.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that a longer \nstatement outlining many of the observations that I was able to make \nover the course of our trip be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, one of the true benefits of traveling \noverseas is it gives lawmakers an opportunity to see first hand the \npolitical, social and economic conditions of nations that many of us \nonly read about in the papers or see on the nightly news.\n  It also allows us to see how these conditions in one part of the \nworld can have a profound impact on an entirely different part of the \nworld.\n  So it was with my trip to the Middle East, where I was able to see \nhow events there have a direct effect on events in the United States. \nMany people in our nation do not realize this, but there actually is an \n``interconnectedness'' of issues between nations that sometimes we \ndon't think about.\n  One thing that I have thought a lot about since my visit is just how \nmuch the ``on-again/off-again'' peace process in the Middle East \naffects our nation's energy policy, particularly as it relates to our \nnational security.\n  While I was in Israel, I met with Richard Shotenstein, the Managing \nDirector of the Ohio Department of Development's Eastern Mediterranean \nRegional Office, an office I created as Governor of Ohio.\n  He told me that the tensions surrounding the ongoing Middle East \ncrisis have dramatically lessened the interest of Ohio companies in \nbusiness opportunities in the region.\n  He also indicated that there is a growing anti-Americanism, largely \nseen in boycotts, spreading throughout the Arab world, where many view \nthe U.S. and Israel as intimately linked. Thus, anti-Israel trends \nbecome anti-American trends.\n  This should be a concern of every American given the fact that today, \nthe United States is more dependent on foreign oil than at any other \ntime in history.\n  In 1973, at the time of the Arab oil embargo, we imported 35 percent \nof our oil to meet our domestic needs. Today, that number averages 58 \npercent and it is estimated that we could be importing 65 percent of \nour oil by 2020.\n  Unless we address our own domestic energy needs and become less \ndependent on foreign oil, we may be held to the whims of the OPEC \nnations, and indirectly, to the vagaries of the Arab world--\nparticularly in Iraq, arguably our nation's biggest enemy.\n  On January 17, the New York Times reported that the OPEC nations were \ngoing to reduce oil production by 1.5 million barrels per day. Although \nthis will likely drive up prices, the real problem to watch for is what \nIraq will do.\n  According to the article:\n\n       If Iraq indeed keeps exports to a trickle, Saudi Arabia--as \n     the largest producer in OPEC and its de facto leader--may \n     feel compelled, as it has intermittently over the last year, \n     to increase its own output to make up for the Iraqi supplies. \n     But the Saudis might be able to replace only part of the oil \n     that Iraq took off the market.\n\n\n[[Page S609]]\n\n\n  I shudder to think how Iraq would use its influence should they gain \na more dominant role in the production of crude oil in the Middle East.\n  It is one of the major reasons why a lack of a reliable supply of \nenergy should be of great concern to all Americans.\n  Consider the rolling electricity blackouts that California is now \nexperiencing. Consider also natural gas prices which are expected to \nskyrocket 70 percent by the end of winter according to predictions by \nthe Department of Energy.\n  Add in the fact that home heating oil prices have already jumped by \n40 percent and more, not to mention high gasoline prices, and it should \nbecome crystal clear that our country's lack of a comprehensive energy \npolicy must be addressed.\n  Since at least the mid-1970's, Congress and presidential \nadministrations of both parties have been unwilling, unable and \nunmotivated to implement a long-term energy policy.\n  As I have stated, the United States relies on more foreign sources of \noil than at any other time in history. However, even if we wanted to \nincrease the production of crude oil in this country, there has not \nbeen a new refinery constructed in 25 years due, in part, to changes in \nU.S. environmental policies.\n  Additionally, 36 refineries have closed since the beginning of the \nClinton administration, in part, because of strict environmental \nstandards.\n  Last year, the existing refineries were running at 95 percent \ncapacity or higher for much of the year. With our refineries running at \nthese levels, even if a greater oil supply was available, there would \nbe no capability for refineries to turn it into useful products.\n  As a result, we must currently rely on overseas supplies at an \nastronomical cost from a region fraught with instability. Until new \nrefining capacity is available, even minor supply disruptions will \ncontinue to lead to drastic increases in fuel prices. No one has dared \ncontemplate what would happen should major disruptions occur.\n  In addition, natural gas heats 56 million American homes and provides \n15 percent of the nation's electric power, for nearly one-quarter of \nour energy supply.\n  Because natural gas burns so cleanly, it is easier to obtain the \nenvironmental permits necessary to build natural gas-run energy plants. \nThus, it is easy to see why virtually all new electric generation \nplants that are currently being built will use natural gas for fuel.\n  The popularity of natural gas is good for the air we breathe, but the \nhigh demand for it is beginning to pinch the pocketbook, resulting in \nsoaring costs. We should not forget that other energy resources are \navailable which can provide additional sources of clean, low-cost \npower.\n  New technologies are making coal an increasingly cleaner source of \nelectricity. We should not forget this valuable, abundant natural \nresource--with an estimated domestic supply of 250 years--as we move \nforward with an energy policy that not only protects our environment, \nbut also continues to meet consumer's needs for power.\n  I support efforts such as those in the National Electricity and \nEnvironmental Technology Act, introduced last week by Senator Byrd. His \nbill creates research and development programs that provide incentives \nfor developing clean-coal technologies in the U.S.\n  As my colleagues know, if we are to decrease our dependence on \nforeign energy sources, research and development will be important to \nensure that coal can remain a viable energy option in the future.\n  During this energy crisis, it is critical that we restructure our \ncountry's disjointed energy policy into a national plan that is \ncomprehensive, cohesive and cost-efficient.\n  Last year, the Majority Leader and Senator Murkowski introduced \nlegislation to address many of these problems. I was proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of that legislation in the 106th Congress, and I \nwill cosponsor Senator Murkowski's bill when he introduces it this \nyear.\n  In addition, Senator Murkowski and I sat down last week to discuss \nthe role that environmental regulations play in our nation's energy \npolicy. We agreed that it is imperative that we work to harmonize our \nenvironmental and energy policies so that clean, affordable and \nreliable energy can be made available to all consumers.\n  To help accomplish this goal, we both agreed that the key to a \ncomprehensive energy policy will rely on environmental regulations \nthat, while protecting public health and the ecosystem, are based on \ncost-benefit analysis and sound science. As Chairman of the Senate's \nClean Air Subcommittee, it is something that I will work towards in the \n107th Congress.\n  Finally, with the extreme cold weather we have experienced so far \nthis winter compounding our current energy crisis, we need to encourage \nthe President to provide more funding for the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program--LIHEAP--to meet the pressing needs of those who are \nmost vulnerable to skyrocketing energy prices. Certainly if we have a \nsupplemental this is an emergency that needs to be addressed in that.\n  Under LIHEAP, states are required to use the Federal funds they \nreceive to provide the greatest level of benefit to the greatest need.\n  That means in my State of Ohio, some 220,000 households are expected \nto be helped this year--10 percent more than last year--with each \nhousehold receiving payments between $150 and $400 to cover energy \ncosts.\n  Last week, along with a number of my colleagues, I asked the \nPresident to provide $300 million in emergency LIHEAP funds. Should he \nallocate these funds, it will help hundreds of thousands of low income \nfamilies, seniors and the disabled get through our current energy \ncrisis.\n  Our national security depends on our ability to guarantee a reliable \nenergy supply. To do this, we must lessen our dependence on foreign \noil, investigate alternative fuels and energy sources and ensure an \nadequate delivery and supply infrastructure.\n  At the same time we are developing this energy policy, we must insist \nthat it does not result in diminishing our environment or public \nhealth. We cannot allow that to happen. We must continue to improve the \nenvironment and public health. It is a complex task, but one I know \nthat we can accomplish if we work together on a bipartisan basis. We \nneed to get the environmentalists, industry, and consumers--all of us \nin the same room talking to each other, so we can come up with a policy \nthat is fair to everyone.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Observations in Southeastern Europe and the Middle East, January 29, \n                                  2001\n\n                     (By Senator George Voinovich)\n\n       On the morning of December 28, 2000, Senator Specter and I \n     left Andrews Air Force Base for a 7 day assessment of the \n     situation in Southeastern Europe and the Middle East and the \n     prospect for peace in either region. The first leg of our \n     journey consisted of an approximately nine hour flight to \n     Munich, Germany where we were scheduled for an overnight \n     stay. Arriving late that evening, we were met by Consul \n     General Robert W. Boehme and John McCaslin, a U.S. Foreign \n     Commercial Service officer. We had an interesting discussion \n     about a variety of trade, security and foreign policy issues \n     facing the United States and Germany.\n       The next morning, (December 29), Senator Specter and I met \n     with a number of leaders of the local business community. We \n     had an interesting conversation about a variety of trade \n     concerns facing the United States and the European Union, EU. \n     Specifically, we discussed the steel, banana, and \n     genetically-modified beef issues currently dominating our \n     trade relations.\n       When the conversation turned to technology, I was surprised \n     to learn that the Germans are facing the same shortage of \n     highly-trained information technology workers that our nation \n     has been struggling with in recent years. This problem has \n     been exacerbated by the growing number of entrepreneurs \n     funneling venture capital into the high-technology sectors of \n     the economy.\n       We also had an interesting discussion about National \n     Missile Defense, NMD. The business leaders we met with \n     explained their deep concern that the United States' \n     commitment to an NMD system may create another Cold War with \n     Russia and China. They were also concerned with our continued \n     commitment to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, ABM Treaty, \n     and indicated that their views largely reflected those of the \n     German people.\n       Finally, we discussed the European Union's, EU, European \n     Security and Defense Policy, ESDP. Senator Specter and I made \n     it clear that many Members of Congress are concerned that our \n     European allies are moving away from their commitments to the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO. The group responded \n     by explaining that the Europeans will continue to view NATO \n     as\n\n[[Page S610]]\n\n     the foundation of the trans-Atlantic relationship.\n       After the meeting in Munich, Senator Specter and I flew to \n     Belgrade in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FRY. Ours was \n     the first American plane to land in Serbia since the Kosovo \n     bombing campaign in early 1999.\n       While a number of the buildings in the central section of \n     the city were abandoned due to bomb damage, I was generally \n     impressed with the city's landscape. It was clear that \n     Belgrade was once the economic, political and cultural heart \n     of Tito's Yugoslavia.\n       We immediately met with Vojislav Kostunica, the recently \n     elected President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at \n     the Federation Palace, and it was not lost on me that we were \n     the first federally-elected officials from the U.S. to meet \n     the man who toppled Slobodan Milosevic. He reminded us that \n     it took Yugoslavia less time to elect their new president \n     than it did for us to elect the President of the United \n     States.\n       The President sat down with us after completing a meeting \n     with Boris Trikosky, the President of the Former Yugoslav \n     Republic of Macedonia, whom I personally had met last \n     February during a visit I made to Croatia, Macedonia and \n     Kosovo. The discussion President Kostunica had with Senator \n     Specter and me focused on the progress that has been made in \n     reintegrating the FRY into the international community after \n     Milosevic's downfall, the country's continuing economic \n     challenges, the humanitarian issues facing the people \n     (including a lack of power, medicine and medical equipment), \n     and the situation in Kosovo, the Presevo Valley and relations \n     with Montenegro.\n       We spent a great deal of time stressing to President \n     Kostunica the importance of cooperation with the United \n     Nations' International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \n     Yugoslavia, ICTY or the Hague. We made it clear that Congress \n     will demand significant progress in this area in order for \n     economic assistance to continue to be made available to the \n     FRY. We also highlighted the view of many in the U.S. that \n     Milosevic must be brought to justice for the crimes he \n     committed against humanity in Bosnia and Kosovo; \n     specifically, that he be brought to the Hague.\n       In response, the President indicated that he was very aware \n     of American concern over the war crimes issue, and that he \n     shared our concern but for very different reasons. Milosevic \n     is thought to have stolen over $1 billion from the people of \n     Serbia during his rule, ordered the murder of many of his \n     political opponents and manipulated the results of several \n     elections, among other crimes.\n       President Kostunica made it clear that the Serb people want \n     him to be held accountable for his crimes against the Serb \n     people before he faces any international court or charges for \n     war crimes. He also indicated that a domestic trial would \n     begin to show to the people of the FRY what horrors were \n     committed on their behalf over the last ten years.\n       He explained that Milosevic's control of the media \n     prevented the vast majority of people from the truth about \n     Bosnia and Kosovo. A trial would begin to present these ugly \n     realities. He pointed out that the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is expected to open an \n     office in Belgrade as a sign of growing cooperation and \n     understanding between The Hague and the FRY.\n       The next meeting we held was with Miroljub Labus, the \n     Federal Deputy Prime Minister responsible for economic \n     policy, and his senior team. I was very impressed by his \n     understanding of the various problems dragging down the \n     Serbian economy. He made a point to stress the humanitarian \n     crisis the country is facing.\n       He also made it clear that their efforts to reinvigorate \n     the economy, attract foreign investment and begin to address \n     the nation's debilitated infrastructure would not likely have \n     an effect for several months. He explained that Milosevic's \n     rule had left the economy in such a shambles that they were \n     only now beginning to pick up the pieces.\n       I stressed the importance of resisting the traditional \n     Balkans temptation to fill key jobs in the new government \n     with family, friends and political allies. Given the troubles \n     before them, now is not the time to bring in political hacks. \n     Labus must assemble a clean, well-qualified team, and from \n     what I saw, he has done so thus far.\n       I was very impressed by Deputy Prime Minister Labus and his \n     team. The future Serbian Minister for Finance, Bozidar \n     Djelic, and the FRY's Stability Pact Coordinator, Milan \n     Pajevic, attended the meeting as well. It was clear that they \n     understood the importance of addressing their people's needs \n     in the short-term.\n       We then met with Zoran Djindjic at his campaign \n     headquarters. Mr. Djindjic ran Mr. Kostunica's presidential \n     campaign and has been active in the opposition movement in \n     Serbia for years. It was widely reported that he would soon \n     be installed as the Serbian government's prime minister, and \n     in fact, on January 25, he was sworn in as prime minister. As \n     my colleagues may not be aware, under the FRY's constitution, \n     the prime minister of Serbia is given a great deal of power, \n     thus, Mr. Djindjic will be intimately involved in finding \n     solutions to the various problems facing his country.\n       The discussion largely focused on the same subject matters \n     discussed with President Kostunica--reintegrating the FRY \n     into the international community after Milosevic's downfall, \n     the country's continuing economic challenges, the \n     humanitarian issues facing the people (including a lack of \n     power, medicine and medical equipment), and the situation in \n     Kosovo, the Presevo Valley and relations with Montenegro. We \n     also discussed in detail the war crimes issue and America's \n     strong interest in seeing some progress in this area. I found \n     Mr. Djindjic to be well-versed in all of these matters and \n     largely aware of the official American position on them.\n       Of the various matters covered, the issue of Montenegro's \n     relationship with Serbia was discussed in the most detail. \n     Mr. Djindjic's passion for retaining the existing structure/\n     relationship with Montenegro was clear. As some of my \n     colleagues may know, President Djukanovic of Montenegro has \n     indicated that, in response to the popular will of his \n     citizens, he may be forced to hold a referendum on \n     Montenegrin independence in the next few months. Mr. Djindjic \n     indicated that such a move would create a crisis between \n     Serbia and Montenegro which would have the potential to have \n     a broader regional impact.\n       I then traveled to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a \n     meeting with Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic. Again, in an \n     effort to be consistent in my message to the new government, \n     I explained in detail the importance of cooperation with the \n     International Criminal Tribunal, (The Hague). The Foreign \n     Minister's response echoed that of the President and Mr. \n     Djindjic.\n       I was pleased to know that Mr. Svilanovic is pushing EU \n     membership as a long-term goal for the FRY. To that end, he \n     plans on traveling extensively in the near future to explain \n     the various issues facing his country, their plans to address \n     them, and their long-term agenda. I am hopeful that he will \n     be successful in this effort. I believe that a focus on EU \n     membership will encourage changes within the FRY that will \n     further instill a commitment to democracy, the rule of law \n     and human rights.\n       For dinner that evening, I was pleased to join U.S. \n     Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, William \n     Montgomery, Foreign Minister Svilanovic, Professor Vojin \n     Dimitrijevic, who is head of the Belgrade Human Rights \n     Committee, and Milan St. Protic, the Mayor of Belgrade. It \n     was widely expected at that time that Mayor Protic would be \n     named as the FRY's Ambassador to the U.S. and since we've \n     been back in the United States, it has actually occurred. As \n     a matter of fact, just last week, I met with Ambassador \n     Protic to discuss a variety of issues of concern to his \n     nation.\n       The dinner we had in Yugoslavia included a frank, wide-\n     ranging, off-the-record discussion, where we exchanged views \n     on the opposition movement in Serbia during the Milosevic \n     years, the Bosnia tragedy and Kosovo. It was a dinner that I \n     am not likely to forget soon.\n       The morning of December 30, Senator Specter and I met with \n     His Holiness Paul, the Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox \n     Church, at the Patriarchate. The Patriarch discussed the \n     importance of reconciliation between the various peoples of \n     southeast Europe to the future of the region.\n       He pointed out that cooperation and mutual respect between \n     the various ethnic groups in the region, between the Serbs \n     and Albanians in Kosovo, for example, is impossible while \n     violence continues. He expressed his deep concern and remorse \n     that nearly 100 Serbian Orthodox religious sites, included \n     centuries-old churches, had been destroyed in Kosovo since \n     the completion of the 1999 NATO bombing campaign.\n       The Patriarch gave me a copy of a booklet that the Serbian \n     Orthodox Church prepared on the number of churches gutted, \n     damaged and destroyed. I told the Patriarch I had read it and \n     had shared copies that I had been given by Father Irini \n     Dobrevich with some of my colleagues.\n       I reminded the Patriarch that I met with Bishop Artemiie on \n     his visit to the UN and the United States last year and \n     indicated that he is an effective voice for the Serbian \n     Orthodox Church in Kosovo. I stated that because of the \n     efforts of people like Bishop Artemjie, the U.S. State \n     Department is a little more focused in terms of their \n     involvement and concern with Yugoslavia.\n       Further, the Patriarch Senator Specter and I discussed the \n     terrible ethnic cleansing that had happened and was \n     continuing to happen in Kosovo, and I asked him to keep me \n     updated on the ongoing situation in Kosovo.\n       Finally, I thanked him for the leadership role the Orthodox \n     Church played in the removal of Slobodan Milosevic and their \n     push for free and fair elections, and for establishing a \n     Serbian Orthodox Church office in Washington, led by Father \n     Irini Dobrevich. I have gotten to know Father Dobrevich and \n     find him to be a breath of fresh air in Washington. He has \n     worked hard on behalf of Serbs in diaspora and continues to \n     respond to the many ongoing humanitarian needs in the FRY.\n       Senator Specter and I then flew to Tuzla, Bosnia where we \n     were met and briefed by Major General Walter M. Sharp. Major \n     General Sharp commands Multi-National Division, a force of \n     some 7,000 soldiers. He was happy to report that the men and \n     women under his command understand the importance of their \n     mission, have high morale and are performing beyond \n     expectations.\n       After the overview, we traveled to Camp Dobol where we \n     shared lunch with a number of Ohioans and Pennsylvanians \n     serving their nation in Bosnia. And I have to say that we as \n     a nation should be very proud of all of our\n\n[[Page S611]]\n\n     young men and women who serve their country, not just in \n     Southeastern Europe, but all over the world.\n       Senator Specter and I then rode along with some of our \n     troops on a mounted patrol through area. It quickly became \n     clear to me that General Sharp's comments about the morale \n     and performance of his people were accurate.\n       Although some of the scenery looked very peaceful, it \n     belied incredible tension in the area. I asked a couple of \n     the young soldiers with whom we were patrolling what they \n     thought would happen if the United States were to pull out of \n     the region. They answered without hesitation that the ethnic \n     hostilities between the Serbs, the Croats and the Muslims \n     would almost immediately resume.\n       Their assessment made it clear how important it is to \n     maintain an ongoing international military presence in \n     Southeastern Europe for at least the immediate future.\n       After our tour, we returned to Belgrade for more meetings.\n       We met with Momcilo Grubac, the Federal Minister of Justice \n     at the Federation Palace. Mr. Grubac stressed his \n     government's commitment to the rule of law. He explained that \n     his first task will be to modernize the legal framework \n     within the FRY to bring it into compliance with international \n     standards. He was quick to point out that the years under \n     Milosevic had set the country and its people behind in this \n     area.\n       Again, we discussed in great detail the importance of \n     cooperation with the international community on war crimes. \n     As expected, his comments largely reflected those of \n     President Kostunica. However, he did indicate that the FRY \n     will no longer harbor indicted war criminals. He added that \n     an internal criminal proceeding to deal with Milosevic would \n     be important to further establishing democracy in the FRY.\n       We then traveled to the Federal Parliament Building where \n     we met with Dragoljub Micunovic, the President of the Chamber \n     of Citizens, and a number of other leading parliamentarians. \n     On the war crimes issue, Mr. Micunovic agreed that \n     accountability must be established to remove the sense of \n     collective guilt that is beginning to become more and more \n     prevalent in the FRY. On Milosevic specifically, he indicated \n     his strong belief that Milosevic would be tried domestically \n     and by the international community if there were evidence to \n     support charges.\n       Senator Specter and I then joined Mr. Micunovic at a press \n     conference to discuss our meeting and our general impressions \n     from our visit to Belgrade.\n       I explained my position about the bombing campaign, that I \n     really believed that other diplomatic routes should have been \n     pursued in dealing with Milosevic. I also explained that had \n     the U.S. not legitimized Milosevic's leadership at Dayton, \n     and not refused to support the resistant movement in 1997, \n     the situation could have been a lot different in Serbia. \n     There could have been an earlier removal of Milosevic from \n     office and avoidance of the whole war, and the death, \n     destruction and human suffering that accompanied it.\n       One of the questions I was asked was whether the U.S. and/\n     or NATO leaders should appear before a war crimes tribunal \n     for the air war conducted over Kosovo. I made it very clear \n     that the responsibility for the bombing rest solely with \n     Milosevic--not the United States or any of her officials, nor \n     NATO. To those in NATO and the U.S., Milosevic and his thugs \n     were a cancer that had to be removed from Serbia for the \n     crimes he has committed. With Milosevic out of power, it is \n     now possible to stabilize southeastern Europe, integrate \n     Serbia into the EU and improve the standard of living and \n     quality of life of all the Serbian people.\n       That evening, I joined a number of OTPOR activists for \n     dinner. As my colleagues may know, it was the demonstrations \n     by OTPOR members against Slobodan Milosevic's attempt to \n     steal last autumn's election from Mr. Kostunica that hastened \n     the downfall of Milosevic. I was heartened by the youthful \n     spirit of the people I met and I suggested some new roles \n     that they could play now that Milosevic has been removed from \n     leadership.\n       I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of this group \n     of leaders in Yugoslavia, men and women who were able to \n     mobilize a nearly 70 percent youth vote turnout in the \n     election that toppled Milosevic. I am sure that they will \n     continue to be a significant force for democracy in the years \n     ahead.\n       The next day (December 31), we traveled to Cairo, Egypt \n     where we met with U.S. Ambassador Daniel C. Kurtzer. He \n     explained that President Mubarak, with whom we were planning \n     on meeting the next day, was consumed with the Middle East \n     peace process.\n       With that in mind, we discussed the political environment \n     among the Arab and Israeli peoples, Prime Minister Barak's \n     political position in light of the upcoming elections in \n     Israel and Arafat's negotiating positions in the discussions.\n       The morning of New Year's day (January 1, 2001), we met \n     with President Hosni Mubarak at his presidential complex in \n     downtown Cairo. We had a detailed discussion about the latest \n     peace plan put forward by President Clinton, Egypt's role in \n     the peace process, and the comparative positions of the \n     Israelis and Palestinians. During the meeting, we encouraged \n     President Mubarak to support President Clinton's peace \n     initiative, and that he should urge other Arab leaders to \n     support the peace initiative in Israel.\n       After meeting with President Mubarak, Senator Specter and I \n     had a news conference where we indicated that we would send \n     out a telegram encouraging other Arab leaders to come out \n     publicly in favor of the initiative. We also announced that \n     we would be urging President Clinton to meet with Chairman \n     Arafat for the purpose of clarifying the details of the \n     proposal and to keep the parties talking to one another \n     rather than seeing the peace discussions end precipitously. \n     Later that day, we sent a telegram encouraging other Arab \n     leaders to come out publicly in favor of the initiative and \n     continuing the negotiations. We were pleased that ultimately \n     the President did meet with Arafat and that the Arab leaders \n     came out and said that they were supportive of the \n     initiative.\n       I found President Mubarak to be an engaging, affable man, \n     committed to peace yet struggling to maintain a very \n     difficult political position. Given Egypt's crucial role in \n     maintaining relative peace in the region since the Camp David \n     Accords, it was an honor to meet him. I believe his role will \n     be crucial in the coming weeks, months, and years if peace is \n     to truly be reached in the Middle East.\n       After the meeting and press conference, we flew to Tel Aviv \n     and then drove to Jerusalem for a series of meetings. Our \n     time in Israel began with a discussion with U.S. Ambassador \n     Martin Indyk who updated us on the American perspective on \n     the peace negotiations. We examined the right of return and \n     Temple Mount issues in some depth which quickly confirmed my \n     impression that the issues facing the negotiators are \n     incredibly complex.\n       We then traveled to the Knesset building where we had a \n     series of meetings. We first saw Shimon Peres, a friend I \n     have known for years. He indicated that he did not believe \n     that the schedule imposed on the ongoing peace talks, \n     considering the U.S. presidential transition and the upcoming \n     election for prime minister in Israel, was realistic. I \n     agreed.\n       I believe that it was a mistake and is a mistake to set \n     deadlines on the discussions because they create unnecessary \n     pressure. I believe that it is best to continue an active, \n     open dialogue for as long as necessary, even if it appears \n     that little progress is being made.\n       Mr. Peres commented how advances in information technology \n     had fundamentally altered the worlds of diplomacy and \n     warfare. He also explained that one of the keys to peace in \n     the region that has not been properly addressed is economic \n     cooperation.\n       He believes that if people have something to lose in \n     conflict or violence, they will be less likely to fight. This \n     is a message I had received from him several years ago and \n     was crucial in my decision when I was Governor of Ohio to \n     open a Middle East trade office, the Eastern Mediterranean \n     Regional Office, in Israel.\n       We then discussed the issues of the day in the \n     negotiations--the Temple Mount and refugee returns. As \n     always, I found his analysis to be insightful.\n       Senator Specter and I then visited with Prime Minister Ehud \n     Barak. As my colleagues would expect, the peace process was \n     the only matter discussed.\n       Mr. Barak expressed his disappointment at Camp David's \n     failure and the various peace initiatives attempted since \n     then. He also expressed his concern that the Palestinians may \n     be learning the wrong lesson in recent months--that continued \n     violence strengthens their negotiating position. Rather, he \n     made it clear that violence is slowing the peace process and \n     strengthening the negotiating position of the Israelis.\n       Mr. Barak was hopeful that negotiations would continue \n     throughout the American presidential transition and the \n     Israeli elections. It was clear, however, that the continued \n     violence was putting a great deal of pressure on him.\n       We then met with Ariel Sharon who is widely expected to \n     defeat Mr. Barak in the upcoming elections for prime \n     minister. We immediately turned to his controversial visit to \n     the Temple Mount last September and the impact it had on the \n     peace process. I pointed out to him that many of us felt that \n     his visit was inflammatory, that it did nothing to aid the \n     peace process and that if elected Prime Minister of Israel, \n     he would have to make it very clear that he was for peace. \n     Mr. Sharon explained that his visit was a completely normal \n     event and that every Israeli citizen has the right to visit \n     the Temple Mount because of its religious significance. I \n     also expressed my opinion that in visiting Israel for the \n     sixth time in twenty years, the situation there was more \n     critical and explosive than I'd ever seen.\n       We then discussed his plans for the peace process, should \n     he be elected prime minister. He made a number of strong \n     statements regarding his commitment to the process. He argued \n     that since only President Nixon could open the door to China, \n     only he could come to a peace agreement with the Palestinians \n     given his military background.\n       After the Sharon meeting, Senator Specter traveled on to \n     Jordan to continue examining issues in the Middle East. I \n     remained in Jerusalem to continue to examine the situation in \n     Israel.\n       That evening, I joined U.S. Consul General Ron Schlicher \n     for a dinner discussion with Faisal Husseini. Husseini is a \n     leading figure in the Palestinian community. We had a lengthy \n     discussion regarding the ongoing violence and tensions in \n     Israel, prospects for peace, and the Palestinian perspective \n     on the last 50 years.\n\n[[Page S612]]\n\n       I thought it was important that I have a balanced \n     understanding of the current situation in Israel and was \n     pleased to have the opportunity to meet with Mr. Husseini.\n       The next day (January 2), I met with Ehud Olmert, the Mayor \n     of Jerusalem. I met Mr. Olmert on my fourth trip to Israel in \n     1993. He indicated how important it was to retain Jerusalem's \n     integrity during the course of the peace negotiations.\n       He also argued that the various plans being considered, \n     including President Clinton's proposal, were fundamentally \n     flawed on this point. He strongly believes that the people of \n     Jerusalem, his constituents, will never agree to a divided \n     capital city. Richard Shotenstein, the Managing Director of \n     the Ohio Department of Development's Eastern Mediterranean \n     Regional Office, attended the meeting with Mayor Olmert.\n       Afterwards, I spoke with Mr. Shotenstein regarding the \n     Office's recent activities. While there have been some great \n     successes, he explained that the tensions surrounding the \n     ongoing Middle East crisis have dramatically lessened the \n     interest of Ohio companies in business opportunities in the \n     region.\n       He also indicated that there is a growing anti-Americanism, \n     largely seen in boycotts, spreading throughout the Arab \n     world. This trend has especially impacted consumer products. \n     Mr. Shotenstein explained that to many in the Arab world, the \n     U.S. and Israel are intimately linked. Thus, anti-Israel \n     trends become anti-American trends.\n       I then met with Mr. Jawdat Ibrahim, a young Palestinian \n     businessman who was deeply interested in the peace \n     negotiations. I was interested to see his view--and through \n     him, the Palestinian view--on current events. Our discussion \n     was interesting and it added an important perspective to my \n     trip.\n       Later that day, I met with a group of Ohioans now living in \n     Israel. After meetings with various political leaders, I \n     wanted to have an opportunity to discuss the issues of the \n     day with people whose lives are affected by the ongoing \n     violence. The group made it very clear that there was a very \n     real sense of fear living in Israel.\n       Some described risking their life simply driving to and \n     from work. Others feared that their car would explode when \n     they started it every morning. Still others recounted phone \n     calls from relatives living in America expressing concern \n     about the safety of their grandchildren. I cannot imagine \n     living with this kind of fear.\n       The last day of the trip (January 3), I had a telephone \n     conversation with Benjamin Netanyahu. While I was \n     disappointed that scheduling conflicts prevented our meeting \n     in person, I found his analysis of the situation in the \n     region to be very insightful. I hope to have the opportunity \n     to meet him on my next visit to the region, although he \n     indicated that he would make it a point to meet with me the \n     next time he visited the United States.\n       Following my phone conversation, I had another meeting with \n     Ambassador Indyk to discuss the various things I had learned \n     during my visit to the region.\n       I was pleased to travel with my colleague, Senator Specter, \n     to two of the most important regions to our national security \n     at such a crucial time. I gained valuable insight as to the \n     fragility of peace, and came away with a new and deeper \n     appreciation for our American democracy.\n       Mr. President, as we welcome a new administration to the \n     White House, I am hopeful that President Bush and his foreign \n     policy team will be successful in promoting peace, stability \n     and prosperity in these areas. We must never forget that both \n     southeastern Europe and the Middle East are important to our \n     national security and our nation's future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Elaine Lan \nChao, of Kentucky, to be Secretary of Labor, notwithstanding the \nconsent of January 24, 2001, that the time of the nomination be yielded \nback, and the nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate then resume the pending business.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of all \nSenators that this will mean we have approved in such a short period of \ntime 12 of President Bush's 15 nominations and that tomorrow afternoon \nwe will approve two more, leaving only one. I want the record to be \nspread with the fact that that is pretty good work of the U.S. Senate. \nWe look forward to completing all 15 in the near future.\n  I withdraw any objection that I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? If not, the nomination is \nconfirmed.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President. Certainly all of us are pleased \nwith the progress that has been made here and that it allows the \nadministration to get into place and begin to move. I thank the Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could say to my friend from Wyoming----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Also we have had experience working with Mrs. Chao before. \nShe is a good administrator. She has been good to the State of Nevada \nin the past. I look forward to working with her as Secretary of Labor. \nI am sure she will do a good job.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to express my \nsupport for Elaine Chao's nomination to be Secretary of Labor. Ms. Chao \nis a woman of impressive talents who has achieved a great deal in her \ncareer, both in and out of government. She is an accomplished manager \nand a graceful leader, and she has distinguished herself and her family \nby her strong commitment to public service.\n  She knows first hand the experience of minorities growing up in the \nAmerica of the 1950's and 60's. Her career is a vivid example of the \ntriumph of the American dream. She decided to attend both college and \ngraduate school in Massachusetts, and our state is proud of her, too.\n  As we all know, the Secretary of Labor has the profound \nresponsibility for enforcing the basic federal laws and federal \nprograms that protect workers' fundamental rights, especially in areas \nsuch as fair wages, fair benefits, reasonable work hours, safe and \nhealthy workplaces, and non-discrimination and equal opportunity in \nemployment. The Department's statutory mission is specifically, and I \nquote, ``to foster, promote and develop the welfare of the wage earners \nof the United States, to improve their working conditions, and to \nadvance their opportunities for profitable employment.''\n  Ms. Chao is committed to these goals. As she stated forcefully at her \nconfirmation hearing, ``all work is worthy of respect and virtually all \nworkers need appropriate protection.'' She recognizes that ``the labor \nstruggles of the early part of the last century and the laws that grew \nout of them are a critical part of this nation's historic commitment to \njustice for all.'' She has promised to ``fully, fairly and evenly \nenforce the labor laws of this country.'' Many challenges will face Ms. \nChao in her new position, and I look forward to working with her to \nmeet them.\n  This Congress, once again, will have an opportunity to increase the \nminimum wage. Many of us have long fought for raising the minimum wage, \nand we plan to introduce new legislation soon to grant a long overdue \nincrease. Eleven million workers have already waited for over three \nyears for Congress to act.\n  The real value of the minimum wage has fallen dramatically in the \npast generation. To have the purchasing power it had in 1968, the \nminimum wage would have to be at least $8.05 an hour today, not the \ncurrent level of $5.15. Minimum wage families today fail to earn enough \nto rise above the poverty level. No one who works for a living should \nhave to live in poverty. So, I hope that a fair increase in the minimum \nwage will be a top priority for both Congress and the Administration \nearly this year.\n  I also hope that President Bush and Secretary Chao will reconsider \ntheir support of proposals that would enable states or local \ncommunities to ``opt out'' of a minimum wage increase. In some states \ntoday, the state minimum wage is as low as $1.50 an hour. In others, it \nis $2.65 and $3.35. The vast majority of workers are covered by the \nfederal minimum wage, so these state rates apply to relatively few \nworkers. Clearly, allowing states to opt out of the federal minimum \nwage would violate our commitment to the principle, which Congress has \nstood by for over sixty years, that working men and women are entitled \nto a fair minimum wage. Ms. Chao has said that she supports and will \nmaintain the current federal minimum wage of $5.15 an hour nationwide, \nbut that level today is not sufficient to provide the economic security \nthat every working family deserves.\n\n[[Page S613]]\n\n  Another vital labor priority is training the nation's workforce to \nmeet the demands of the new economy. I welcome Ms. Chao's assurance \nthat ``training, developing and modernizing America's work force is one \nof [her] highest priorities,'' and I look forward to working with her \nto strengthen programs to address the needs of those in the workforce \nwho are not adequately prepared. The bipartisan Workforce Investment \nAct, which Congress passed in 1998, reformed federal job training by \ncreating a streamlined, one-stop approach to job training, and it was \nan important first step. But as more and more workers face mid-life \ncareer changes, and as even traditional occupations grow in complexity, \nbetter training for all workers--adults, dislocated workers and youth--\nis a necessity.\n  I was also encouraged by Ms. Chao's desire to see that ``parents have \nan easier time balancing the responsibilities of home and work.'' \nToday's employees are working longer and longer hours to make ends \nmeet. The result is significant new problems for businesses and \nfamilies. I welcome Ms. Chao's recognition that the Family and Medical \nLeave Act ``has brought about a great deal of benefit for working \nfamilies that need flexibility.'' But we can and should do more to deal \nwith these problems, and I am pleased by Ms. Chao's commitment to \n``keep an open mind'' and to be ``a real good listener'' on further \nexpansions in the law.\n  We must also guarantee strong and effective enforcement of the \nfederal laws against job discrimination. Current laws require non-\ndiscrimination and affirmative action. The landmark Executive Order \nissued by President Johnson in 1965 has been in effect for more than 35 \nyears, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, and strong \nenforcement is still needed. In her opening statement at her \nconfirmation hearing, Ms. Chao eloquently testified to \nher understanding that barriers based on gender, race, national origin \nand disability have prevented many of America's workers from achieving \ntheir true potential. She emphasized that she is ``against \ndiscrimination of any sort, and will enforce the law as it is \nenacted.'' I hope this is an area where the Department and Congress can \ncontinue to make progress together.\n\n  Many of us have also long been committed to vigorous enforcement of \nlaws and programs to protect workers' health. A particular contemporary \nconcern is the prevalence of ergonomic injuries in the workplace. These \ninjuries are the most significant workplace safety and health issue we \nface today. About 1.8 million workers report that they suffer ergonomic \ninjuries every year. Another 1.8 million workers suffer such injuries \nthat they do not report. These injuries are painful and often \ndebilitating, and disrupt and sometimes end workers' careers. In the \nvast majority of cases, these injuries are preventable. The OSHA \nergonomics rule went into effect at long last earlier this month. It \noffers vital protections to American workers, and it benefits employers \ntoo. Recent studies should lay to rest the suggestion by special \ninterest groups that we should wait for additional scientific evidence \nto deal with this serious problem.\n  Ms. Chao has called the ergonomics rule ``the most visible issue'' \nfacing the Department of Labor, and she said she would give the issue \nthe ``greatest thought and effort and study.'' I commend her \nrecognition that ``any change in our labor laws or in their \ninterpretation must be carefully and solemnly considered, giving \nrespectful and full attention to the views of every participant in the \nlabor-management equation.'' I know that she will apply this \nunderstanding to the ergonomics rule, as well as to all of the other \nissues before the Department of Labor.\n  Finally, as we know, from equal pay for women and people of color, to \npension plans and health plans, to the Family and Medical Leave Act, \nemployees depend on the Department of Labor to ensure that the nation's \nlabor laws are fully and fairly enforced. We in Congress have our own \nresponsibility in this area--to see that the Department has adequate \nresources to carry out these missions successfully.\n  I congratulate Ms. Chao on her nomination, and I look forward to \nworking with her on issues of vital importance to workers and their \nfamilies. I hope that under her able leadership, the Department of \nLabor will be at the forefront of improving the lives of the nation's \nworkers and their families, by ensuring that they have good jobs, good \nwages and safe and healthy places to work.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am thrilled that we are today confirming \nElaine Chao as Secretary of Labor. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEmployment, Safety and Training and a member of the Small Business \nCommittee, I am very concerned about making sure all businesses in this \ncountry, even the very smallest, are able to understand the thousands \nof regulations they must follow and get the help they need to follow \nthem. I know Secretary Chao shares these concerns and I look forward to \nworking with her on these issue.\n  I am also extremely excited about the managerial and administrative \nexperience Ms. Chao brings to the Department. It is so important that \nwe have good administrative processes in the Department of Labor. The \ndecisions of this Department deeply affect both our nations' workers \nand the businesses that provide jobs and incomes and help our economy \ngrow. It is absolutely critical that both workers and employers feel \nthat these decisions are not arbitrary and are reached in a fair and \nimpartial manner.\n  I firmly believe Secretary Chao has the experience and skills to \ninspire confidence in the fairness of the Department's actions, \nregardless of their popularity. This is a crucial responsibility of the \nSecretary of Labor, and I believe Secretary Chao has been well trained \nto fulfill this responsibility. I look forward to helping Secretary \nwith this task, and I welcome my fellow members from both sides of the \naisle to join us in this effort. I hope that together during this \nCongress we can take a careful and close look at some of the existing \nregulatory and enforcement procedures that Secretary Chao will inherit. \nWe must ensure that good procedures are followed properly, and we must \nchange procedures that are not working.\n  I also look forward to working with Secretary designate Chao to bring \nthe Department of Labor into the 21st Century. We are in a very \nexciting time of more positive relationships between employees and \nemployers. In this period of record unemployment, employers have \nlearned the lesson that it makes good business sense to keep employees \nhealthy and happy. In order to encourage this progress, we must ensure \nthat our Department of Labor does not thwart the development of \nworkplace arrangements and initiatives that benefit both employee and \nemployer. This will take modern, innovative thinking and I am confident \nthat Secretary Chao is such a thinker.\n  I think President made a wonderful choice when he nominated Elaine \nChao to be Labor Secretary, and I am so glad the Senate has \ndemonstrated equal wisdom by confirming her quickly. I look forward to \nworking closely with Secretary Chao and the Department on all the many \nchallenging workplace issues.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for Ms. \nElaine Chao to be Secretary of Labor.\n  This Nation can be no stronger than the men and women who get up \neveryday and accept the challenges to go out into the workplace and \nreturn home to care for their families, themselves, and their \nneighborhoods. The Secretary of Labor's responsibility is to look out \nfor the welfare of these men and women across our country. I am \nconfident that Ms. Chao will be a great champion of these individuals, \nand I commend President Bush on selecting such an excellent nominee.\n  Ms. Chao brings to this important position a record of accomplishment \nboth in the private and public sectors. Among other positions, Ms. Chao \nhas served as president of the United Way, Director of the Peace Corps, \nDeputy Secretary of the Department of Transportation, and Chairman of \nthe Federal Maritime Administration. Her experience as an executive and \nexperience in finding solutions to complex problems with limited \nbudgets, gives her a solid foundation to lead the Labor Department.\n  I have personally known Ms. Chao for a number of years. I was honored \nto be present at her confirmation hearing before the Senate's Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, of\n\n[[Page S614]]\n\nwhich I am now once again a member. Throughout her career, Ms. Chao has \naccepted the challenges that have confronted her and pursued her \nresponsibilities with firmness, fairness, and always with a quiet \ndignity.\n  Ms. Chao will be a great leader at the Department of Labor, and I \nlook forward to voting in support of her nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/29/senate-section/article/S614-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we were talking about confirmation of \nappointments. Among the next ones that will take place tomorrow will be \nthe Secretary of the Interior, Gale Norton. I want to spend a little \ntime talking about the Secretary, but perhaps more as a preliminary \nmatter, I want to talk about the importance of Federal lands and the \nimpact they have on the West in particular. Of course, they are \nnational lands.\n  First of all, I am very hopeful and confident that Gale Norton will \nbe confirmed. I think she has done an excellent job in responding to \nthe legitimate questions she has been asked. That is the role of the \nSenate: to inquire, ask questions of these aspiring nominees. She has \ndone, I believe, an excellent job of responding.\n  She is a superb candidate for this job. She has experience. She has \nexperience as attorney general of the State of Colorado, during which \ntime, of course, she had to deal with a good many land, water, and air \nquality issues and I think dealt with them professionally.\n  She is knowledgeable, certainly, about the West. The West is unique--\nI will talk about that in a moment--where, in many cases, more than \nhalf of a State belongs to the Federal Government. It is very important \nto all of us.\n  Gale Norton has a background in land use and park use, not only from \nher experience in Colorado but also her experience in the Interior \nDepartment as an associate solicitor for the Fish and Wildlife Service, \nas well as the Park Service. I have had some occasions to talk with her \nas chairman of the parks subcommittee.\n  I certainly have an interest in this job in that this Secretary has \njurisdiction over the National Park System. She is certainly a \nconservative conservationist. We have sometimes gotten into the \nposition where those things seem to be an oxymoron; they seem to be \nconflicting. Indeed, it seems to me they are not.\n  She is a conservative and I am a conservative, but we are \nconservationists in that we want to protect the resources so they will \nbe there in the future for our kids and future youngsters. These two \nthings are not incompatible. Under most definitions, they would be \nquite compatible. I would substitute conservationist--at least to some \nwe have to be an environmentalist. That perhaps is another step.\n  In any event, I do believe Gale Norton will be confirmed as \nSecretary, and I certainly support her nomination. I do want to talk \nabout public lands, since we have some time today.\n  In my State of Wyoming, nearly 50 percent of the land belongs to the \nFederal Government in various categories. Some was set aside for \nnational parks. We have two of the most famous national parks, \nYellowstone and Grand Tetons. We also have Devils Tower and other \nfacilities as well. Some of the land was set aside for U.S. forests. \nMuch of the land, on the other hand, is BLM land, which really was \nremaining land after the Homestead Act was finished and lands were \ntaken for private ownership. These were the lands that remained and \nstayed in Federal ownership.\n  This map shows the holdings throughout the country. They represent \nmillions of acres--a great deal of public land. In Alaska, 68 percent \nof the land belongs to the Federal Government. In Nevada--Senator Reid \nwas just here--they believe theirs is closer to 87 percent federally \nowned lands. It goes all the way to New Mexico, the Presiding Officer's \nState, with about 26 percent.\n  They are very important. Not only are they important because they are \npublic lands and they are great treasures that we want to preserve, but \nof course they have a great deal to do with the way we live. They have \na great deal to do with our economy. They have a great deal to do with \nour culture.\n  Those who live there often talk about public lands, and I understand \npeople in Maryland or people in Connecticut often are not quite as \nfamiliar with the fact that we have millions of acres that are either \nmountains or high plains.\n  When we talk about those things, there is not much recognition of \nwhat the problems are. I suppose we are guilty of the same thing with \nregard to coastal lines. We do not have coastal lines in Wyoming. We \nneed to talk about some of these things so we will better understand \nthem.\n  I am very interested, of course, in the parks. I grew up right \noutside Yellowstone Park in Cody, WY. The park is one of the real \ntreasures of this country. It seems to me the purpose of the park is to \nprotect those treasures. The second purpose is to allow the owners, the \nAmerican people, to enjoy them, and, from time to time, how we do that \nbecomes somewhat controversial.\n  These places are unique, and some are managed for a single purpose: \nwilderness areas. I support wilderness areas. They are set aside and \nrestricted as to how they can be used.\n  I hope we do not change the old sign of the Forest Service which said \n``Land of many uses,'' to what some would like to change it to: ``Land \nof no uses.'' I do not believe that is where we ought to be headed, and \nI do not believe that is where our Secretary of the Interior will be \nheading.\n  There are many uses for which the land should be made available, not \nall economic. There is hiking and camping. You would be surprised by \nthe number of letters I receive, when we talk about the roadless areas, \nfrom veterans organizations. Some of our disabled veterans are not \ngoing to have access to these lands if we do not provide it. Not only \nare there resources there such as grazing and timbering, but also \nrecreational access, of course, is most important.\n  We also need to understand that these resources do need to be \nmanaged. We had this year probably the most devastating series of \nforest fires on public lands in the West. Managing those forests more \nin terms of access if there is a fire, in terms of thinning to prevent \nfires, is a very important issue.\n  We have a unique relationship with the Federal Government because of \nthis involvement. Generally, it is a pretty good relationship. \nInterestingly enough, often the relationship with regard to the forest \nand BLM lands is pretty good on the local level with the staffs that \nare doing the actual work, but when you get to the policy level, the \nregional level, the national level, that coordination and cooperation \nseems to become more and more difficult.\n  We need to find some ways to make the Government a better neighbor to \nthe people of the West so that we can work together. There has been a \npromise on the part of this administration, and particularly on the \npart of Gale Norton, to work more closely to involve local people and \nlocal governments in management of these lands.\n  One of the things that has happened, and needs to happen more, and at \nleast be done more effectively and efficiently, is what is called a \ncooperating agency agreement where, when you have an EIS or study on a \nparticular change of a regulation, why, the surrounding States, the \nsurrounding counties, officials can be brought in as cooperating \nmembers and cooperating agencies to help make these decisions. It is \ntrue they are Federal lands and the final decision rests with those \nagencies, but the people who live there ought to have some input, and \nwe hope that can be the case.\n  Throughout this past administration, it was more difficult. I \nunderstand the Secretary of the Interior and the last President were \nseeking to make some history for themselves, some legend in terms of \nsetting aside public lands. Much of that was done without any \ncommitment or involvement of local people at all.\n\n[[Page S615]]\n\n  On the contrary, Escalante Staircase, in Utah, was announced in \nArizona when the Governor and the delegation had not been consulted \nabout setting aside millions of acres in the State of Utah. That is not \nthe kind of thing that makes for a good arrangement for managing these \nresources well or providing an opportunity for local people to \nparticipate that each of us thinks they ought to have.\n  Also, of course, there are a number of agencies that are involved. It \nisn't just the Department of the Interior. Certainly, in terms of \naccess, we have the EPA, which has a great deal to do with some of the \nthings that are involved with the endangered species and that sort of \nbusiness. We have the whole access question, which has to do with \nTransportation, and other agencies. So we hope there will be an effort \nto bring together agencies that have sometimes conflicting \njurisdictions in the Interior Department.\n  Certainly, I hope, for the most part, these lands, other than those \nthat are set aside for special purposes, can be used for multiple use. \nAnd ``multiple use,'' I am afraid, is sometimes interpreted as being \nvery detrimental to the environment. It does not necessarily need to be \nthat way. There can be these uses, if they are managed well--renewable \nresources, such as grazing, for example. Grazing can be, if it is \nmanaged properly. It is certainly not detrimental to these lands. It \nharvests a crop that is there and will be there again next year.\n  So multiple use is very important to our States and to the economy \nthere. This, of course, is not to say in the least that we in the West \nare not as interested in preserving the resources as anyone else in the \ncountry. One of the real problems, however, is the decisions with \nrespect to that have generally been made from the top down, where the \nwhole system really was designed in the NEPA arrangements that are in \nplace, and so on, to start at the bottom and move up. And we have had, \nin our case in Wyoming recently, several instances of changes that were \nto be made, the most recent one being the use of snow machines in \nYellowstone Park, where we had a 2-year winter-use study. They went all \nthrough this thing. They came up toward the end with some preferred \ndecisions, and the Assistant Secretary--the very person we are talking \nabout here--came there and said: Wait a minute. We are going to change \nthat. And that was after all the people had participation in it.\n  In Jack Morrow Hills, which is in the Red Desert in Wyoming, the very \nsame thing happened recently with the Secretary. You go through this \nprocess and you talk about partnerships and participation, and then \nsomebody from the administration, at the top level, comes out and says: \nAll right, we are going to change all that.\n  That is not really what is intended for participatory government. \nHopefully, we can do some things that will help to change that.\n  I emphasize, however, again, that when we talk about preserving \nresources, I think you will find the people who live there are as \nadamant and emotional about preserving the resources--more so--than \nmost people because that is where they live. That is where they are. \nThose are the things that are very important.\n  So we need to have a little better understanding of the plan and \nprocess. Frankly, more recently, it has been my experience, that when \npeople from Washington went out to talk about a proposed roadless plan \nthey were not certain what the plan was when they got to the meeting. \nAnd there would not be a lot of support for it among the people who \nwere actually managing the process.\n  We have a process for a forest plan that comes up for renewal about \nevery 10 years. That is where the decisions ought to be made for the \nMedicine Bow Forest, not here in Washington. So I hope that is what we \ncan do; that there can be public involvement.\n  So, Mr. President, I am very excited about the opportunity to support \nGale Norton. Certainly, the appointments of the other officials in the \nDepartment will be equally as important--when you appoint the Director \nof the Park Service, when you appoint the Director of the Fish and \nWildlife Service, or in the Department of Agriculture, where you have a \nSecretary who is over the Forest Service and the Forest Service \nmanagement, as well as, of course, the Chief of the Forest Service, who \ndoes not happen to be one who is confirmed by the Senate.\n  But those are very important items. I hope we can help build some \nunderstanding that people who are interested in having multiple use of \nthe lands are not interested in destroying those lands. We sometimes \nget that view promoted by some of the environmental groups in New York \nCity and other places, that if you are going to use it, it destroys it. \nThat does not need to be the case. Indeed, it should not be the case.\n  In fact, of course, in the parks we work very hard to provide \nfacilities so that people can come and enjoy them. They have to be \nmanaged. I mentioned the sled issue. The parks said: We are going to do \naway with them because they are too noisy and have too much exhaust. \nThey do. The difference is, there has been no management effort made \nover the last 20 years to separate the snow machines from the cross-\ncountry skiers. There has been no effort made to have standards so that \nthe manufacturers of the sleds would reduce the noise and the exhaust. \nThey were willing and able to do that, if they had some standards that \nwould ensure that the investment they made could then be legitimate.\n  So I think these are the things we are looking for, to have a little \ndifferent way of managing these kinds of resources. I am excited about \nthe prospects that Secretary Norton will bring to this agency.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Thomas, in \nsupporting the nomination of Gale Norton as Secretary of the Interior. \nShe will, indeed, provide the kind of consultation that has been \nlacking in this past administration on important issues such as the \ndesignation of lands for conservation areas, or monuments, and some of \nthe other issues on which there has been little consultation with the \nstakeholders, the people who are really most affected by the decisions \nof the Department of the Interior. Because so much of that Department's \nrole recently has been the recommendation to the President of \nunilateral executive decisions on his part, that kind of consultation \nis going to be critical. Gale Norton is the kind of person who \nthroughout her public career has brought people together and has \nreached solutions to problems that were primarily acceptable to all \nsides.\n  I have known Gale Norton for over 20 years. First of all, she is one \nof the smartest people I know. She actually scored 100 percent on her \nlaw school admissions test, the so-called LSAT. She graduated magna cum \nlaude from the University of Denver. She attended the University of \nDenver Law School, where she was a member of the school's honor \nsociety.\n  She has held a variety of positions in her career, including chairing \nthe Republican National Lawyers Association. She served under the \nprevious President Bush on the Western Water Policy Commission. She \nserved as chair of the Environmental Committee for the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General when she was attorney general of the \nState of Colorado.\n  As a matter of fact, when she was at the Department of the Interior, \nin her earlier career, serving as Associate Solicitor for Conservation \nand Wildlife, she was the primary legal adviser for the National Park \nService and the Fish and Wildlife Service. She also played a key role \nin something--the Presiding Officer has, I think, perhaps been to my \noffice. There is a very large painting in my office of the Vermilion \nCliffs in northern Arizona, which is the area where the California \ncondors were brought--this endangered species--to try to rejuvenate the \nspecies. This is an area where they thought the condor could survive. \nThey are having a fairly tough time of it, but we hope they will \nsurvive. In any event, she was instrumental in protecting the condor.\n  She was instrumental in negotiating an agreement to deal with the \nnoise from overflights over the Grand Canyon. There are a whole variety \nof things that Gale Norton did while at the Department of the Interior, \nand then as the attorney general of Colorado. For example, she was \nsuccessful in persuading the Federal Government to accelerate the \ncleanup of a hazardous waste area near Rocky Flats in\n\n[[Page S616]]\n\nColorado, which is the former nuclear weapons production site there, \nand at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, a chemical weapons manufacturing \nsite. There are a whole variety of things that one could mention in her \nrecord. I think most of them have been pretty well discussed in \nconnection with her confirmation hearings.\n  But the point is to illustrate, first of all, the fact that she is an \nextraordinarily capable person, a lawyer with great experience in this \nDepartment of the Interior, as well as an attorney general, and other \npositions, all of which qualify her now to become the Secretary of the \nInterior.\n  She has experience in a wide variety of areas with which she will \nhave to deal, including environmental protection--as I mentioned, \nhazardous waste cleanup, and other things.\n  As the Presiding Officer is well aware, one of the things the \nDepartment of the Interior, of course, has to deal with is giving great \ncare and commitment to be the primary trustee for our Native Americans.\n  Because the United States has that trust responsibility and it \nreposes primarily in the Secretary of Interior, it is a critical \nposition.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter from Kelsey \nBegaye, President of the Navajo Nation, in support of Gale Norton for \nthe position of Secretary of Interior.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            The Navajo Nation,\n\n                                Window Rock, AZ, January 16, 2001.\n     Hon. John Kyl,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: On behalf of the Navajo Nation, I convey \n     our support for Ms. Gale Norton, nominee for Secretary of the \n     Department of the Interior. The Navajo Nation, in its \n     government-to-government relationships, works with the \n     Department of the Interior on myriad issues affecting the \n     Nation. Although there are times when we disagree with one \n     another we continue to work together for the benefit of the \n     Navajo People. We wish to continue the working relationship \n     with the new administration and we look forward to working \n     with Ms. Norton.\n       The Navajo Nation's past experience with Gale Norton \n     involved issues with the Southern Ute Tribe during her term \n     as Attorney General for the State of Colorado. During that \n     time Ms. Norton approached the tribes and asked how she could \n     help. She provided testimony to the House (Natural Resources) \n     Committee on the Animas-LaPlata project which benefitted the \n     tribes. Her willingness to support the tribes demonstrates \n     her knowledge of Indian nations and their position within the \n     federal system.\n       The Navajo Nation does have its concerns with regard to \n     Indian country policies and initiatives. We advise the new \n     administration to follow the basic goals and principles of \n     affirmation of the commitment to tribal sovereignty and self-\n     determination, protecting and sustaining treaty rights and \n     the federal trust responsibilities, and supporting \n     initiatives which promote sustainable economic development in \n     Indian country.\n       The Navajo Nation supports the nomination of Gale Norton \n     for Secretary of the Interior and we trust she will continue \n     to work with Indian country as she has done in the past. We \n     look forward to working with her in advancing Indian country \n     policies and Indian initiative for the Bush/Cheney \n     Administration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kelsey A. Begaye,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. KYL. In this letter he notes that Gale Norton has in the past \nexhibited an understanding of the needs of Native Americans. She worked \non one of the settlements when she was attorney general of Colorado \nthat involved water and other issues relating to the Colorado Ute \ntribe.\n  On other areas as well, President Begaye notes that she has an \nunderstanding of Indian issues which will make her a fine trustee. In \nall of these regards, it is clear that Gale Norton is well positioned \nto be a fine Secretary of Interior.\n  I conclude with what I began--namely, she is the kind of person who \nis able to bring people together to work on solutions to problems that \nhave been somewhat contentious. Because we are dealing with so many \ndifferent needs and different groups of people with our western lands \nand resources, it is important to bring these groups together. She will \ndo that and will make a strong Secretary of Interior.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/29/senate-section/article/S616-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S616-S617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF JOHN ASHCROFT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise briefly to discuss the nomination of \nanother Cabinet official, the Attorney General, John Ashcroft. \nHopefully, we will be able, on the Judiciary Committee, to have the \nvote on Attorney General designate Ashcroft tomorrow. We hope to have \nthat meeting on Tuesday, at the very latest Wednesday. We are hoping to \nconsider his nomination on the floor of the Senate and get that done by \nThursday afternoon prior to the time that the Senate recesses for the \nweek.\n  It is important that this nomination be confirmed. There are a lot of \nthings pending. The Attorney General is one of the officers of the \nCabinet who is always on watch. There are all of the assistant \nattorneys general, U.S. attorneys around the country who are looking \nfor guidance from Washington on a wide variety of matters. We have more \nterrorist issues that demand the attention of the Attorney General. My \ncolleagues on both the Democratic and Republican side are interested in \ncommencing the process of judicial nominations to fill so many \nvacancies that exist. All of these and many more issues require an \nAttorney General who is active and in place. The sooner we can get the \nPresident's nominee for Attorney General confirmed, the better for the \nNation.\n  I will comment briefly on some comments that have been made. One of \nmy colleagues this morning spoke, as a matter of fact. The charges are \npretty much the same. Let me summarize three or four things that have \nbeen said with regard to John Ashcroft and try to put them in proper \ncontext.\n  One of my colleagues this morning commented on the floor that there \nis a new John Ashcroft. I would have thought that since they didn't \nparticularly like the old John Ashcroft, this would be good news, but \nit turns out not to be. What they are basically saying is, they don't \nknow which one to trust. You have the old John Ashcroft who, as a \nMember of the Senate, was pushing legislation to do this and \nlegislation to do that. Now as Attorney General, he says he will abide \nby the law. Well, which is it? The fact is, John Ashcroft has served in \ndifferent capacities in his life, and they are not always the same.\n\n  As Members of the Senate, we put ideas forth. They are partisan \nideas, they are philosophical ideas, and we debate them. In the \ncrucible of this institution, those ideas are put to tests. They are \nmolded, and they are amended. And consensus develops around solutions \nthat we eventually will pass. None of us get our way on any of this \nlegislation, but we all put it forth. We have our debates and then we \nmove on.\n  That is a very different position than the position of a judge or \nAttorney General. There you have to take the law as it is, and you have \nto apply it. You have to interpret it. You have to argue it to the \ncourt and so on. I, for the life me, cannot understand why some of my \ncolleagues are not able to make this distinction. Perhaps they are able \nto and choose not to because it is an unfair criticism of John Ashcroft \nthat he will not apply the law as he is required to do as Attorney \nGeneral simply because, as a Member of the Senate, he argued for other \npositions.\n  We can all walk and chew gum. We can all do different things at \ndifferent times. There is nothing to suggest that John Ashcroft won't \ndo exactly what he swears he will do when he puts his hand on the Bible \nand swears to uphold the Constitution and the laws. He did that as \nattorney general of the State of Missouri. One should not expect that \nit would change if he is Attorney General of the United States.\n  Secondly, there is this question of whether he would enforce laws \nwith which he disagrees. Two thoughts about that: First, everyone is \nassuming he disagrees with certain laws that he doesn't disagree with. \nThe so-called FACE law, the freedom of access to clinics entrances law, \nhe supports that law. He opposes abortion. Some of his opponents say if \nhe opposes abortion, he therefore must oppose that law, and therefore \nhe probably won't enforce it. Wrong on two counts. You can oppose \nabortion and still support the law, as I do, as Senator Ashcroft does, \nwhich says that people should not be harassed when they want to \nlawfully go into a place which is a lawful place of business. There is \nnothing inconsistent with opposing what goes on inside that office but \nupholding the law that says people have a right to enter. He has said \nhe would do that. That is the second point.\n\n[[Page S617]]\n\n  I don't know why people don't believe that. There is nothing in his \nrecord to suggest he would not uphold that law. He supports the law. He \nsays he will uphold it. I don't understand why people, therefore, in \neffect question his motivation or his commitment to abide by the oath \nhe will take. That bothers me because it suggests they don't trust John \nAshcroft. Yet there isn't a single Senator who has served with John \nAshcroft who hasn't, when asked to remark upon this, confirmed that, \nno, they understand his integrity and it is not that they don't trust \nJohn Ashcroft. There is something else.\n  I think it has to do with the fact that there are so many liberal \nspecial interest groups that have a reason to oppose John Ashcroft \nbecause his views are not the same as theirs that it is forcing our \ncolleagues then to say things that are inappropriate. Because to \nsuggest that John Ashcroft is not a man of integrity and that he won't \nkeep his commitments is quite unfair to this fine and decent man.\n\n  That finally brings me to the third point. My colleague, Senator \nLeahy, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee on which I sit, made a \nvery important point this morning with which I agree. He said the \noffice of Attorney General is a little different than the other Cabinet \npositions in that there is a special kind of responsibility there. With \nmost of the other Cabinet positions, there are policy issues and \nadministration involved, but there is not the necessity of upholding \nthe rule of law. In that, Senator Leahy was absolutely correct. One \ncould argue that there are a couple other Cabinet positions that also \nhave a unique responsibility.\n  The Secretary of Defense, I am sure, would fall into that, protecting \nthe American people, not just being interested in policy. But certainly \nhe is right that the office of Attorney General is something special.\n  We expect the Attorney General to care first and foremost about the \nrule of law and to represent all Americans as well as the President in \nupholding that rule of law. As a matter of fact, Senator Leahy said--\nparaphrasing here--no position in the Cabinet is as important for \nevenhanded justice. I didn't do him justice in paraphrasing, but I \nagree with that sentiment.\n  It seems to me that people who focus on that issue now with respect \nto John Ashcroft would have a lot more credibility in making their case \nagainst John Ashcroft if they had demonstrated an equal concern for the \nrule of law in a whole variety of issues that involved the Clinton \nadministration for the last 8 years. On this, many of his opponents \nhave been relatively silent. Every single one of the Democrats in this \nbody voted against the punishment that the House of Representatives \noffered forth with respect to the impeachment of President Clinton. \nThat was all about the rule of law. As it has transpired, the President \nhas admitted to making knowingly false statements to officers of the \ncourt. This is not something which enhances the rule of law. Yet I \nheard all manner of excuses about the President's conduct at that time.\n  Nor have we heard much about the rule of law as to the current \nAttorney General's refusal time after time after time to appoint \nspecial counsel or otherwise look into what were clear violations of \nthe law and very questionable conduct with respect to campaign \ncontributions, among other things. When her special counsel Charles \nLaBella recommended the appointment of a special prosecutor to look \ninto this, when Louis Freeh, head of the FBI recommended the same, time \nafter time Attorney General Reno said no.\n  When we talk about politicizing the office of Attorney General, I \nthink it is important for our Democratic friends to understand that \nRepublicans have been concerned about the rule of law and the \npoliticization of the Department of Justice for a long time. We are \nanxious for an Attorney General to go into that office and, frankly, \nclean it up so that there isn't the politics that has characterized it \nfor the last 8 years.\n  It is hard for me to give much credence to those on the outside who \nquestion whether John Ashcroft can do this and who question his \ncommitment to the rule of law when, for 8 years, they have been silent \nabout repeated matters involving very strong charges that the rule of \nlaw is violated by various people and an unwillingness on the part of \nthe Attorney General to do very much, if anything, about it.\n  Even the last act of President Clinton in pardoning a whole group of \npeople has drawn very little criticism from our friends who are \ncritical of John Ashcroft and are now very concerned about the rule of \nlaw. One of these was the pardoning of Marc Rich. A few of my \nDemocratic Senate colleagues have been coached to come out with mild \nstatements, or expressions of concern, about that pardon. I think that \nis appropriate. There ought to be expressions of concern about it.\n  My point is that if we are going to talk about concern over the rule \nof law and how John Ashcroft as Attorney General will protect and \npreserve the rule of law in this country, then I think it behooves us \nto be consistent in our concern for the rule of law and apply it \nequally in the situation of the immediate past Attorney General.\n  This is an example where I suspect many Americans look at this and \nsay, well, I guess where you stand depends on where you sit. It is easy \nto criticize somebody on the other side. You don't want to criticize \nsomebody on your own side. That is a natural characteristic of \npolitics. But when we are talking about actually voting against John \nAshcroft to be Attorney General of the United States, it seems to me \nthat at last my colleagues who will have an opportunity to vote on \nthat--and I now separate them from the special interest groups about \nwhich I have been speaking--need to look at this carefully, look at \nwhat they have said about the rule of law over the last 8 years, before \nthey raise concerns about John Ashcroft and the rule of law.\n  There has never been a more qualified nominee for Attorney General \nthan John Ashcroft and I doubt many with greater integrity. I know many \nAttorneys General have served with great integrity. Neither his \nintegrity nor qualifications has been questioned. All it boils down to \nis that some people object to his conservative ideology.\n  The President of the United States is elected, and I believe he has \nan opportunity to serve the American people and ability to do so in \nfollowing through on his campaign commitments, following through on his \nideas of how we ought to proceed with public policymaking. The Attorney \nGeneral will have something to say about that. But mostly, as Senator \nLeahy said today, the Attorney General's job is to administer the law. \nAbout that, there is no question where the President stands and where \nJohn Ashcroft stands.\n  I urge my colleagues to think very carefully how a ``no'' vote on \nJohn Ashcroft would look perhaps 2 years from now, 5 years from now, 10 \nyears from now. Will it look like a good call or will it look petty? \nWill it look like an act of statesmanship or will it look like an act \nof partisanship? I urge my colleagues to think very carefully about \nthis vote before they cast it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/29/senate-section/article/S617-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S617-S631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     NOMINATION OF GALE ANN NORTON TO BE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Byrd).

Mr. President, I understand there is to be 3 hours of \ndebate on this nomination to be equally divided, and my request is that \nI be allowed such time as I may consume and to make it clear to my \ncolleagues that I have no intention of coming close to the hour and a \nhalf that is allocated for our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair should state that under the previous \norder there will be 3 hours of debate equally divided between the \nchairman and the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 60 minutes to be equally \ndivided\n\n[[Page S618]]\n\nbetween the two leaders, or their designees. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah is recognized during the period which is equally divided \nbetween the two leaders.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair for the clarification.\n  Mr. President, when I decided that I would run for the Senate, I had \nbeen out of any active kind of political involvement for close to 18 \nyears.\n  I left Washington in 1974, the same year Richard Nixon, the President \nin whose administration I served, left Washington. I remember being in \na taxicab in Burbank, CA, on my way to an airport to come back to \nWashington to pick up my family when on the radio playing in the \ntaxicab Mr. Nixon announced his resignation from the Presidency. At \nthat time, I thought I would never return to anything connected with \npublic life or politics and settled into a career as a businessman.\n\n  But life has a way of changing things that we think are set in our \nlives. I found myself in 1991 contemplating a return to the political \narena for the first time as a candidate for a serious office. I \ndiscovered in the 18-year hiatus since I had been gone that there were \na number of issues I had not paid any attention to which were burning \nissues in the political arena of that time. One of them was clearly the \nquestion of the environment and the use of public lands.\n  In Utah, we have a tremendous number of public lands. Indeed, two-\nthirds of our State is owned by the Federal Government, and a large \npercentage of that which is owned by the State government is given over \nto State parks and other State land uses. One of the most inspiring of \nthose State parks is known as Dead Horse Point. It is a place where you \ncan go out and look over a huge vista way down below and, for reasons \nwhich I don't understand, is named after a dead horse.\n  As you stand on that point--Dead Horse Point--you get a picture of \nthe grandeur that is available in southeastern Utah. As I went down in \nthat area to look for votes, I discovered that one of the biggest \ncontroversies there was the question of an oil well built in an area \nthat could be seen from Dead Horse Point. I went down there absolutely \ndetermined that I would do whatever I could to see to it that there \nwould be no oil exploration anywhere in an area that might despoil or \ndamage the glorious views of Dead Horse Point.\n  When I got there, I found that the local Republican leaders were \ninvolved in the oil well. Indeed, the woman, whom I had not met before, \nwho took me around and introduced me into that area, said her husband \nworked on the oil well and outlined for me what it meant to their \nfamily economically if something were to happen to close oil wells. I \nthought, Well, here I am caught between the economic impact that is \nbenefiting their family and other families and the aesthetic impact of \nseeing to it that things must be done properly as well as to protect \nthe environment. What am I going to do about it? Then she said \nsomething that was very appropriate and, frankly, rare among \npoliticians. She said: Why don't we go look at it? Why don't you see \nfirsthand what this is all about? I said: Fine. That was a good way to \ndelay the issue and not have to announce my position while I would let \nher take me out and show me where the oil well was.\n  The gentleman who had driven me down into that part of the State and \nI got into her pickup truck and we went out looking for the oil well. I \nsay ``looking'' because you couldn't find it. If you didn't have a \nguide who knew her way very well, you couldn't find the oil well. You \ncouldn't see it.\n  To further complicate things, on that particular day it was a little \nbit overcast and there was not necessarily fog but some confusion in \nthe atmosphere making it difficult for us to get our bearings from \nsurrounding mountains. She was a native of the area, knew it very well, \nbut got lost nonetheless. We made a wrong turn. We wandered around. She \ntried to get her bearings and finally, retracing our steps, she took us \nto the place where there was the oil well. We got out of the truck and \nwalked out into an area maybe twice the size of the Senate Chamber.\n  It had been bermed up around the area, possibly by a bulldozer, but \nthe result was that the oil well was in the bottom of what you might \nconsider a very shallow basin. That is why you couldn't see it. It was \nnot the great derrick we think of when we think of the movie ``Giant'' \nand Some of the other visual depictions of drilling for oil. It was \nwhat is called a Christmas tree, a series of valves that come together. \nI had my picture taken standing on it, and the Christmas tree was no \nhigher than I could reach. I could put my hand out on the top of this \nand stand there. This was the total visual impact of this oil well. It \nwas painted in such a way as to blend into the surrounding flora, and \nit was at the bottom of a shallow basin. If you were more than 100 feet \naway from it, you couldn't see it. I realized that the idea it could be \nseen from Dead Horse Point maybe was true if you had a very high-\npowered set of binoculars and knew exactly where to look and maybe had \nsome sort of laser device to help you aim, but that no one in the \nnormal course of enjoying the outdoor experience of Dead Horse Point \nwould ever see this oil well.\n  I went away from the experience determined that I would support the \noil well and the pumping of oil in that area to see to it that the \npeople of that area would get some economic stability to their lives, \nknowing it could be done in an environmentally sensitive way that would \nsee to it that visitors to Dead Horse Point would have no diminution of \ntheir outdoor experience in southeast Utah.\n  I described this experience in this kind of detail for this reason: \nWe are going to discuss the nomination of Gale Norton to be Secretary \nof the Interior. The opposition to Gale Norton as Secretary of the \nInterior comes from those who insist that her attitude toward the wise \nuse of our natural resources in this country is so inimical to the idea \nof wilderness, environmental enjoyment, and environmental protection \nthat she must be defeated.\n  I suggest we need to, as a nation, go through the same kind of \nexperience that I as an individual went through when I was trying to \nmake up my mind on which side of this divide I would come down. I \ndiscovered that you can, in fact, if you are willing to look at the \nfacts, come down on both sides simultaneously; they are not mutually \nexclusive.\n  The wise exploitation of our natural resources in an environmentally \nsensitive way can and should go forward, and it need not--indeed, \nshould not--impinge upon our national commitment to preserve that which \nis wonderful about the American environment, and particularly the \nAmerican West where I come from. Those two can and should work closely \ntogether.\n  I learned another thing out of that experience and out of my time in \nthe Senate: The greatest environmental degradation comes in the areas \nthat are the poorest. I was talking to a friend of mine who travels \nwidely around the world for his jobs. He said: The worst pollution I \nhave ever seen in my entire life in all the places I have visited is in \nKatmandu. It is one of the poorest places on the planet. The reason \nthey have such tremendous pollution is that they don't have the money \nnecessary to clean it up.\n  We in America have the money, and we have spent the money, and we are \ncontinuing to spend the money to see to it that we can have this \ncombination of what I have spoken: Sound economic activity, along with \nproper reverence for and preservation of our environment. The aspect of \nthat balancing act is this: If we do things in the name of preserving \nthe environment that has the effect of destroying our \neconomic strength, paradoxically, that will come back to hurt the \nenvironment. Environmental protection of the kind we have embarked on \nas a nation costs money. Environmental preservation of the kind to \nwhich we have dedicated ourselves as a people is expensive. And the \nmost pollution-free and the most scenically preserved areas in the \nworld are those in the areas where people are the most economically \nstrong.\n\n  I say to those who view the nomination of Gale Norton with hostility, \nrecognize that if you are so pure in your determination that nothing \nwhatever can be done of an economic nature on public lands, you run the \nrisk of damaging those public lands. If you do things that damage the \nAmerican economy, you undercut the American ability to pay for \nenvironmental protection, just as the people in southeastern\n\n[[Page S619]]\n\nUtah, if they say absolutely no to any kind of oil exploration or \npumping, run the risk of degrading the economy in that part of the \nState to the point where there can be no money for environmental \nprotection. The two must go hand in hand. Not only can they go hand in \nhand, they must go hand in hand for the benefit of the environment.\n  The Senator from Alaska has invited me and every other Member of this \nbody to go with him to the Alaskan wildlife preserve, not to be sold a \nbill of goods, not to go up there with any predetermination. He is \nwilling for us to come up under whatever sponsorship and attitude we \nmight have and see for ourselves what drilling at ANWR really would \nmean. In other words, he has asked Members to do what I did in southern \nUtah: Look at it on the ground. See for yourself what it would mean. I \nintend to take him up on that, by the way, Mr. President. I believe \nwhen we do that, we can make a wise decision without going up \ndetermined, either for drilling or against drilling, prior to our \nvisit.\n  One other personal comment about all of these debates. I served in \nthe Nixon administration when the question arose as to whether or not \nto build the Alaskan pipeline. We had all of the same debates then that \nwe are having now. One that I heard over and over again was the \nstatement that the building of the Alaskan pipeline would not only \ndisturb but would ultimately destroy the caribou herd in Alaska because \nthe pipeline went right through the caribou's traditional mating \ngrounds: We must not allow this; the caribou are too important; the \ncaribou are too vital to our heritage to allow anything to go forward.\n  That argument did not prevail back in the 1970s. The pipeline was \nbuilt, and now we can look back at it with nearly 30 years of \nexperience and discover that the amorous urges of the caribou were not \naffected by the presence of a pipeline. Indeed, the caribou herd is now \nlarger than it was when the pipeline was built, and caribou that have \nbeen born since the pipeline was built see it as part of their natural \nenvironment, having not been told in advance they were going to be \nagainst it, and enjoy the pipeline as their mating grounds. They rub up \nagainst the pipeline because it is warm and it is a opportunity for \nthem to get warm in a hostile environment. And the caribou, as I say \nnot being educated to the contrary, think this is a good thing.\n\n  I think we can learn a lesson from that experience, the same lesson, \nagain, that we can have proper preservation of the environment and \neconomic development side by side. We need not have this wide schism.\n  Finally, one last story that frames my approach to this nomination, \nthis seems to be my day to go down memory lane. I go way back this \ntime, to the time when my father served in the Senate and the issue \nbefore the Senate was the building of the Glen Canyon Dam, the creation \nof Lake Powell. There were those who opposed the building of the Glen \nCanyon Dam, just as there are those now who want it dynamited and taken \ndown. One of the arguments for the Glen Canyon Dam was the need for \nelectric power. There were those who said: This is ridiculous. We will \nnever as a nation need that much electric power. We have plenty of \npower. The building of the Glen Canyon Dam with its hydroelectric \nfacility will only depress prices because it will produce so much extra \npower that we will never, ever need.\n  We can look back on that, with 40 years of experience, and realize \nthat their projections of this Nation's power needs were wrong and that \nwe clearly do need the power. But the interesting footnote of that \ndebate was this: During that debate, people said: If we should be wrong \nand somehow, some way, the country should need that much extra power, \nwe do not need Glen Canyon Dam and hydroelectric power. There is all \nthat coal in the Kaparowitz Plateau, right next door, that could be \nburned to provide the power that we need. So let us not build the dam. \nIf we should, by some strange circumstance, need that power, we can \nalways burn the coal.\n  That was the argument made while my father was a Senator, trying to \nget the Glen Canyon Dam built. By coincidence, when I became a Senator, \nPresident Clinton used the Antiquities Act to create a national \nmonument on the Kaparowitz Plateau for the sole purpose of preventing \nus from burning that coal.\n  In today's circumstance it is interesting to note that the coal in \nKaparowitz represents enough power to heat and light the city of San \nFrancisco for the next 100 years. Given where we are right now in the \nCalifornia energy crisis, that is an interesting circumstance.\n  So I have given this history of my own involvement to make it clear \nwhy I am an enthusiastic supporter of Gale Norton. She understands that \nwe can do both, we must do both, and we should do both--protect the \nenvironment and support the economy. I say to those who say no, no, no, \nshe is too extreme, on one side or the other: Do what I did. Go to the \nground. Look at it yourself and try to take a long view of the next 20 \nor 30 years and see what would be the result of Gale Norton's \nstewardship, for both the economy and the environment in that \ncircumstance.\n  Mr. President, I endorse her nomination. I will vote enthusiastically \nfor it. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me recognize the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, former President pro tempore of this body. It is \ncertainly a privilege to have him in the Chair. I wish him a very good \nafternoon.\n  I make an inquiry relative to the time agreement pending. Am I \ncorrect in assuming we have 3 hours equally divided between my \ncolleague, Senator Bingaman, who cochairs the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, and myself?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Is there additional time, if necessary, to be divided \nbetween the leaders?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There is an additional \nhour to be divided between the two leaders.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. For further clarification, it is my understanding that \nTuesday at 10:30 there will be a number of Senators recognized to speak \nfor roughly 2 hours?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is the intention of the leadership to vote at 2:45 \ntomorrow, on the nominees, Whitman, Chao, and Norton?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chao nomination has already been disposed \nof. The other two nominees will be voted on at 2:45 p.m. tomorrow.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is my intention to defer my extended opening \nstatement and yield to Senator Domenici and then it will be Senator \nBingaman's turn in sequence to speak at length.\n  Before I yield to Senator Domenici, let me point something out \nconcerning the nomination of Gale Norton for Secretary of the Interior. \nThe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources voted her out with a \nmandate, 18-2. I might add, for the benefit of Members, that she \nanswered some 224 written questions. She answered all of them in \ndetail.\n  It is my own view that the environmentalist's attacks on her have \ngone too far. I think they overstep the bounds of reasonableness. I \nthink to some extent the environmental groups lost credibility with \ntheir overzealous attacks on her.\n  If I were a member of some of those environmental groups, I would \nwant to know whose decision it was to spend the millions of dollars \nthat have been spent in advertisements in newspapers that made false \nstatements about her record. It seems to be the case, when the facts \nare not on your side the attack seems to be on the person. It is my \nview that that is what has happened here.\n  Finally, they have attempted to try to rub out the messenger, but \nthey cannot rub out her message. Her message was that she will enforce \nthe law if confirmed by this body.\n  I yield to the senior Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. How much time is yielded to the Senator?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield whatever time is necessary. Again, I recognize \nthe junior Senator from New Mexico, and as we have agreed, we encourage \nother Senators who intend to speak to come to the floor and be heard \nthis afternoon during the available time.\n\n[[Page S620]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, is \nrecognized for whatever time is necessary.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for the Senators present and for my \nfriend from New Mexico who might want to speak next, I do not think I \nwill use more than 10 minutes.\n  First, let me say it is a pleasure seeing you in the Chair. For a \nnumber of years, obviously, when it was not 50/50 and we were in \ncontrol, we did not see you there very often. Now we will and it is \nreally a pleasure. I am hopeful that sometime when we have some \ndifficult matters you might be there because your sense of \nparliamentary procedure is very good from what I can tell and it helps \nthe whole Senate.\n  Mr. President, today on the floor is the Senator from West Virginia, \nthe Senator from Alaska, and two Senators from New Mexico. It is rather \ninteresting because I choose today to spend my time talking about a \nvery serious crisis that Gale Norton can help us with.\n  The American people are just finding out that we have an energy \ncrisis of serious proportions. We are on the Budget Committee and we \nwill be talking about grave matters, such as Dr. Greenspan's statement \nabout the surplus being so big and how we ought to start giving back to \nthe people.\n  You, Mr. President, sat in attendance and listened for 4 hours when \nhe testified, without a recess.\n  The most important thing in our society is the energy that moves \nevery American's daily life. From the automobiles they drive, the \nhouses they own, the ironing boards they use, the electric washing \nmachines, and, yes, even the industry down the road, be it little or \nbig, all use energy.\n  I was on this floor way back when we had a big natural gas crisis. \nThe Senator might remember it. It was one of the few times the \nDemocrats told a Senator who was postcloture filibustering a natural \ngas bill to sit down. Even back then there was great fear that \nindustries in America might not have enough natural gas for the 24-hour \nshift that they were on.\n  It was amazing. One of the Senators who objected most to deregulating \nnatural gas--and for those hearing the word ``deregulation,'' this is \nnot deregulation like California deregulating the energy industry. This \nwas deregulation in the sense of the marketplace determining whether \nthey drilled for natural gas and what price was received.\n  It was important back then. Today America has more coal than Saudi \nArabia has oil. What is happening? We have not built a coal-burning \npowerplant in America for I do not know how long, yet the last five we \nbuilt were all natural gas.\n  There are 20-some plants in California and almost all of them are \nnatural gas. They do not make us work at trying to fix the Clean Air \nAct and expand technology in order to make exchanges that will permit \nus to use what energy we own.\n  We have become so frightened about nuclear power. Nuclear power does \nnot have to be a nemesis to coal. America needs a diversity of energy.\n  In the area of clean coal, we tried to put money into it, we even \nadvanced appropriated money for clean coal technology because it was so \nimportant. I was here when it was done. I shared with the Senator in \nthe Chair when he said: Why don't we do that?\n  I said: Let's do that.\n  I was not the only one, but we all did that. Even with that, we are \nso timid matching up the environment with the energy needs of America, \nand we never come down on the side of energy. It is amazing: New rules, \nnew regulations, new ideas about conservation, but never has one of \nthose issues come down in the last decade on the basis of how much \nenergy are we losing.\n  This energy crisis is so severe and this President will set about to \nsolve it in a very extraordinary way. The Secretary of the Interior, \nwhom we are about to confirm, will be part of solving that problem; not \nall of it, but part of it. Why? Because on the public domain lands \nowned by Americans is more of the resources for energy than on any \nother properties in America. The Senate ought to know that on the basic \nproperties that we own in the West in the public domain, there is more \nnatural gas than we ever thought existed. There are some who say we \nhave 20, 30, 40 times more than we need. We know for sure that in the \npast 8 years, the Secretary of the Interior, a wonderful, nice man who \ngot along well with all of us, succeeded in taking lands out of \npossible production. The potential of drilling a natural gas well, \naccording to the experts, are enough to produce 20 times what we are \nusing per year now. That is a lot.\n  What if it was 10 times as much? That would be great. It means that \nmuch is there and we ought to get it.\n  What is this Secretary going to be doing? She is going to be part of \nwhat I am sure this President is going to do, and that is to task more \nthan one Department to be concerned about energy. He has to task the \nInterior Department to begin to make decisions based on our energy \nfuture. He is also going to task the energy Secretary to get on board \nas well. In my opinion, he will even task the Director of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to do the same. Nobody thinks of that \nas part of our energy solution, but it is a huge potential. They have \nnot been making decisions because nobody has yet asked them to.\n\n  When you are making something and you are balancing pluses and \nminuses, you have to consider energy at each of these Departments in \ntheir major decisions. We need an energy policy quickly that will let \nus have the kind of energy supply that America needs to stay on the \npath of prosperity. This kind of prosperity will cease if our companies \ndo not get the electricity they need, if those who travel the roads and \nsell their products do not get electricity, if those who are building \nnew small businesses in the high-tech area which use a lot of \nelectricity do not get what they need, from where is this prosperity \ngoing to come?\n  I am here today because I think it is the right time in history to \nchange Secretaries of the Interior. The public had an election. They \nelected a Republican, and that means we are going to change the \nSecretary of the Interior from Mr. Babbitt, a nice man--I like him--to \nGale Norton.\n  I hope she is confirmed. She is entitled to the job. We have probably \nnever had a candidate for that job who is better educated or qualified \nin the areas of her jurisdiction than this lady. She is not going to be \na fool. She is not going to do things in any extraordinary way to cause \nthe people to say: She is forgetting about the environment. You count \non it. She is just going to say some of the things we have been doing \nin the name of conservation are not needed for the environment. We can \nchange them and produce more natural gas for America.\n  I am not talking only about ANWR because I do not think ANWR is a \npolicy, it is part of a policy. It is part of looking at the public \ndomain of America and asking, considering the nature of America's \nenergy crisis now and for the next 25 or 30 years, can we preserve the \nenvironment? Can we produce energy and supply basic energy to help \nAmerica continue to be the strongest nation on Earth militarily and \neconomically?\n  It is interesting because I could say almost the same thing about \nChristine Todd Whitman, the Environmental Protection Agency \nAdministrator nominee. I know that she is not going to be able to \nexclusively consider environmental matters with total disregard for any \ncost benefit as it pertains to reasonable costs of energy. That cannot \ncontinue. The heyday of that is gone as America tries to find a way to \nhave energy so we can be powerful and prosper and have good jobs and \ngood paychecks.\n  That is why I think Gale Norton should be confirmed \noverwhelmingly. There are some in this country who want to ``put \nanother Secretary Babbitt in office,'' and they are angry because this \nis not another ``Secretary of the Interior Babbitt.'' As I said in \nconfirmation hearings to Gale Norton: If you told the committee you \nwould do everything like Secretary Babbitt, this Senator would not be \nvoting for you because this is the time for a change.\n\n  Actually, we do not need more of the last 8 years. We need somebody \nwho will bring balance so we will not have the kind of crisis that is \noccurring in California and all over America.\n  I want to close by saying I am very confident that our new President, \ntogether with these new Cabinet members will not hide from the facts. I\n\n[[Page S621]]\n\nknow they will continue telling America that we must do some things \ndifferently if we want to have a vibrant country. We have a lot of \nenergy sources in this country there at our disposal and we can \npreserve this country's magnificence--the beauty of our parks and the \nlike--while still producing energy for the American people.\n  I was very proud, as I listened to Gale Norton answering some of the \naccusations made against her. I also read about other accusations, such \nas the Summitville mining disaster in Colorado. Actually, she had more \nto do with trying to solve the Summitville crisis. Yet, that was put up \nas some reason for us voting against her.\n  Some talked about the Rocky Mountain Arsenal and Rocky Flats cleanup \nin Colorado. Actually, when it is all boiled down and you look at her \nrecord, she did a lot to help move that along. Incidentally, it is the \nbest project we have of the seven on-going in the United States in \nterms of nuclear cleanup. We still have two or three big ones in \nCalifornia and the Carolinas, and we are not sure when we will ever \nclean them up.\n  So I close today. I put all the details about her background in the \nRecord. Today, I have just chosen to say a few words about why she is \ngoing to be the right person on a team that will help move us in the \nright direction on energy. I do not think within the next 6 months to a \nyear we are going to be short of good, positive ideas from this \nadministration. I think they will come. I do not think we will be \nfrightened by any of these ideas.\n  To reiterate, I support the nomination of Gale Norton as the new \nSecretary of Interior. She has extensive legal, regulatory, state and \nfederal government experience which duly qualifies her to serve as \nSecretary of a department as diverse as Interior.\n  The Interior Department has a broad mission which includes \nresponsibility for the internal development of the nation and the \nwelfare of its people. It's broad coverage includes managing parks, \nwater issues, basic responsibilities for American Indians, public lands \nmanagement, and the rational exploration of our wilderness areas in \nbalance with preserving our nation's resources.\n  Gale Norton has worked for over 20 years on environmental and federal \nland issues. She has demonstrated her commitment to a safe and clean \nenvironment by bringing all parties together in an effort to find \nsolutions to these complex issues. She has proven herself as a \nnegotiator, a skilled legal mind and a defender of the law. She \nexemplifies the qualities of a consensus builder, not a divider.\n  The issues arising in these areas are some of the most complex and \ncontentious and require a leader who can balance the various competing \ninterests. Gale Norton has repeatedly demonstrated that she is this \ntype of leader.\n  One example of Gale Norton's consensus building leadership is \nexemplified in her handling of western water issues. She has led \nefforts to bring together state water users, federal agencies, and \nIndian tribes to settle water use disputes. In particular, during the \nRomer-Schoettler process that led to the development of the Colorado \nUte Settlement Act Amendments of 2000, which recently passed Congress, \nGale Norton worked to ensure that the water rights settlement with the \ntwo Colorado Ute Indian Tribes would be fulfilled in a way that would \nrespect existing water uses and the social fabric of the area. This \nincluded balancing a variety of interests including that of current \nusers and the Ute tribes while looking out for potential development \nand considering the needs of endangered species. Ms. Norton honored \nColorado's commitments to both the Tribes and the non-Indians living \nand working in Southwest Colorado and Northwest New Mexico. She worked \nthrough a very contentious issue looking for consensus and reasonable \nsolutions.\n  Ms. Norton has mentioned the priority the new administration intends \nto place on American Indian issues. I commend her on her past efforts \nrelated to these issues, such as her role in the Animas La-Plata \nproject, and I look forward to working with the new administration on \nAmerican Indian issues.\n  Ms. Norton has had other extensive experience with western water \nissues. She has actively participated in the negotiation, litigation, \nand settlement of multi-state compact claims and has dealt with other \ncomplex water issues including federal reservation rights, interstate \nwater use, and the balance between water rights protection for states \nand preservation of endangered species.\n  Gale Norton has successfully balanced environmental concerns while \nbeing sensitive to businesses and other citizens whose interests are at \nstake. Ms. Norton created an environmental crimes task force to \nprosecute the most flagrant polluters. She played a leading role in the \ncleanup of numerous sites in Colorado to protect the environment and \nensure its preservation for future generations.\n  Ms. Norton has always worked to find innovative ways to protect the \nenvironment. While at Stanford she researched ``emissions trading'' \napproaches, like those adopted in the Clean Air Act, that created \nmarket based incentives for businesses to reduce emissions. The \nColorado ``audit law'' that Gale Norton supported achieved better \nenvironmental protection by encouraging early and full identification \nof environmental problems and, most importantly, long term solutions.\n  Ms. Norton is committed to enforcing the law and has a record of \nbipartisan cooperation and negotiation. Additionally, Ms. Norton \nunderstands the importance of the relationship between States and the \nfederal government and has proven her ability to negotiate with both. \nShe has worked towards finding innovative solutions to environmental \nproblems, while at the same time working towards the goals advocated by \ninterested parties. She understands that these issues are important to \na variety of people and will work to ensure that all competing \ninterests are balanced within existing laws.\n  I am convinced that Interior needs this type of balanced leadership, \nand needs that leadership today. I look forward to working with Gale \nNorton as the new Secretary of Interior and it is my strong \nrecommendation that the Senate move quickly to approve her nomination.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will give a short statement that \nrelates to the nomination of Gale Norton myself, and then I know there \nare three other Democratic Senators here who have indicated a desire to \nspeak briefly. I know Senator Murkowski wishes to speak, and there are \nothers on his side as well.\n  As the principal steward of our public lands, the Secretary of the \nInterior is responsible for overseeing and protecting the natural and \ncultural treasures of our Nation, including all units of our National \nPark System, national wildlife refuges, most national monuments, \nnational conservation areas, and many of our wilderness areas.\n  When the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which Senator \nMurkowski chairs, and which I serve on as the ranking Democrat, began \nits hearings on the nomination of Gale Norton to be Secretary of the \nInterior, I indicated that I had serious doubts about whether Ms. \nNorton's past views on the role of the Federal Government in enforcing \nenvironmental protection laws were consistent with the responsibilities \nof the Secretary of the Interior. In her many published articles, Ms. \nNorton had amassed a record that championed the rights of individuals \nover the public interest in many natural resource issues; she had \nargued that key environmental protection laws--including critical \nprovisions of the Endangered Species Act and the Surface Mining Act--\nwere unconstitutional; and she had often supported the interests of \neconomic development over environmental protection.\n  During two days of hearings, however, Gale Norton presented a much \ndifferent picture of her future actions as Secretary of the Interior, a \ndifferent picture than her previous writings would have suggested. She \ntestified that she was, as she put it, a ``passionate conservationist'' \nand that her ``top priority'' will be the ``conservation of America's \nnatural resources.'' She recognized that--this is a quote from her \ntestimony--``the great wild places and unspoiled landscapes of this\n\n[[Page S622]]\n\ncountry are the common heritage of all Americans'' and she pledged to \nwork to conserve them for present and future generations.\n  She testified in support of laws she had previously opposed. She \nproposed the committee--this is a quote from her testimony--she ``will \nbe fully committed to ensuring that our nation's environmental laws and \nlaws for the protection of natural resources will be fully enforced.''\n  With respect to the Endangered Species Act, she testified that she \nsupports not only the goals of the act, but also that she ``will apply \nthe Act as it is written, and as the courts have interpreted it.'' When \nspecifically asked whether she will support the protection of critical \nhabitat for threatened and endangered speices--a provision she had \npreviously opposed while attorney general of Colorado--Ms. Norton \nreplied that ``the courts have decided that, in addition to things that \naffect the species directly, the Fish and Wildlife Service has the \nability to regulate on private land, and I will enforce that \nprovision.''\n  When questioned about another key environmental law she had earlier \nopposed, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, Ms. Norton \ntestified that ``I will certainly enforce the law in the way it has \nbeen interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court.''\n  Contrary to some of her critics' past accusations, Ms. Norton \ntestified that it will be her responsibility to enforce Federal \nenvironmental laws, and that she will ensure that all parties comply \nwith those laws. She expressly refuted a previous statement written \nlong ago suggesting that corporations had a ``right to pollute.''\n\n  She made it very clear that both President Bush and she support \ncontinuing the moratoriums on offshore oil and gas leasing off the \ncoasts of California and Florida, and that she would work with other \nStates opposing drilling activities off their coastlines.\n  Finally, she recognized the Secretary's special responsibility to \nNative Americans, and promised to improve Indian education programs.\n  In addition to answering two days of questions before our committee, \nshe responded in writing to another 227 questions that were submitted \nto her by committee members and other Senators.\n  It is clear that the Gale Norton who testified before our committee \npresented different views about the Federal Government and its role in \nprotecting the environment than the Gale Norton who authored \ncontroversial articles challenging that same Federal authority \npreviously. Frankly, reconciling some of her past views with her \ncurrent testimony is not that easy.\n  However, I take Gale Norton at her word when she testified under oath \nin front of our committee that she will uphold our Nation's \nenvironmental laws, and that she will be a strong defender of our \nnatural and cultural heritage. I listened to all of her testimony and \nhave reviewed all of her written responses to our questions. Based on \nher testimony and those written responses, to our questions, and \nbecause of the promises she made at the hearing, I am supporting her \nnomination.\n  While I will vote to confirm her nomination tomorrow, I still do have \nreservations about some issues that Ms. Norton declined to provide \nspecific answers for. For example, she did not take a position on \nwhether she would work to ensure the protection of those areas \ndesignated as national monuments by President Clinton, or whether she \nwould support efforts to modify or repeal the Antiquities Act. She did \nnot give us specifics as to how she will balance the Secretary of the \nInterior's resource protection responsibilities against the need to \nensure continued energy resources from public lands. She avoided \nanswering questions on whether she will support and enforce Federal \nreserved water rights for wilderness areas or endangered species.\n  In the final analysis, Gale Norton's actions on these and other \nissues as Secretary of the Interior will ultimately speak louder than \nany statements made during her confirmation hearing. While I am willing \nto give her the benefit of the doubt, I know that other Senators--and \nsome who will speak here--still have reservations about whether she \nwill be able to set aside her past policy positions and be a strong \nadvocate for protecting the critical Federal resources under her \ndomain.\n  But, based on the assurances she gave our committee, I will support \nher confirmation. I expect her to honor the commitments she has made to \nme and to other Senators to justify the trust that the Senate is going \nto place in her when she is confirmed tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in order to accommodate Members who \nhave been waiting, I wonder if Senator Bingaman and I could agree to \nallowing time off each side by various Senators. I will ask Senators in \nthe order in which they appear. We would like to go back and forth.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I believe the order Senators appeared \nwas Senator Wyden, then Senator Feinstein from California, then Senator \nBreaux from Louisiana, and I believe Senator Stevens from Alaska. That \nis the order they appeared.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have no objection. I ask each Member how much time \nthey might request. We want to run time equally. It is immaterial to \nme. We can run it equally.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. How much time does the Senator from Oregon require?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I believe about 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will be glad to yield 15 minutes off of my time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Then is it the understanding that we would go in that \norder; is that agreeable? It would be understood that after Senator \nWyden, Senator Feinstein, Senator Breaux, and then Senator Stevens, and \nthen we will perhaps start again and go back and forth after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator please state the names in \nsequence so the Chair will have a clear understanding?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. It is my understanding that Senator \nWyden would be recognized next, and the time would be 15 minutes, and \nit would be off the time of the minority, if that is agreeable; Senator \nFeinstein, the time would be 10 minutes, and that would be off Senator \nBingaman's time; Senator Breaux, 5 minutes from Senator Bingaman's \ntime; and then Senator Stevens for 7 or 8 minutes from our time. That \nwould be the proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Again, I recommend any Senators who intend to \nparticipate please come to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, every day the Secretary of the Interior \nmakes decisions that directly affect the quality of life in the West. \nThis Department manages almost 500 million acres of public lands, and \nthe debates that westerners have about the management of these lands \nare not for the fainthearted. To the people I represent, controversies \nabout spotted owls, raging forest fires and mining waste are not \nintellectual abstractions. Almost invariably, discussions about these \nissues divide into two camps, with the environmental community on one \nside, and the affected industries on the other. Finding common ground \nbetween these two camps is extraordinarily difficult, but it is the \npremier challenge in the natural resources field.\n  Today--and I say this with reluctance--I rise to state that I will be \nvoting no on this nomination. I still have reservations about the \nnominee's commitment to make, as the central focus of her office, the \nbringing together of these two camps, the environmental community and \nthe affected industries, to find common ground. America wants and \ndeserves this because it is the common ground where we can protect our \ntreasures and be sensitive to local economic needs.\n  First, I do not necessarily share the views of those who believe that \nGale Norton will throw open the doors at Interior, invite in powerful \ninterest groups and say: Feel free to plunder our natural treasures and \nresources. In her testimony before the committee, Ms. Norton committed \nto not just enforce the Federal environmental laws as written but also \nas interpreted by the courts. In my opinion, she significantly changed \nher previous position on the Endangered Species Act, the so-called \nright to pollute, and global warming science.\n\n[[Page S623]]\n\n  The Gale Norton who testified this month before the Senate is \ncertainly no James Watt, but at this unique time in our history, that \ndistinction alone is not enough to warrant confirmation.\n  My reservations about this nominee fall into two major areas. First, \nMs. Norton's desire to provide flexibility to private parties and the \nStates to comply with our environmental laws has not been accompanied \nby a demonstrated commitment to watchdog those companies and the States \nto ensure that our national treasures are not exploited.\n  Ms. Norton is right--what works for the Bronx does not necessarily \nwork for Prineville, Oregon. One size does not fit all. But her \ndemonstrated record suggests that she did not come down with hobnail \nboots on private parties who abuse our national treasures in the name \nof exercising flexibility.\n  Look at what happened at Summitville in Colorado where a vast amount \nof cyanide spilled into the Alamosa River. Colorado was supposed to \nsupervise that mine. It was the State's job and the State didn't do it.\n  When I asked Ms. Norton at the confirmation hearings how she would \nprevent future ``Summitvilles,'' she was unwilling to say that the key \nto preventing these environmental tragedies is leadership that steps in \nwhen private parties go over the line. After Summitville, Ms. Norton \ncould have immediately pushed to extend the statute of limitations on \nenvironmental crimes, which would have allowed criminal prosecution in \nthat case. But she didn't, and respected Colorado commentators took her \nto task for not doing so.\n  In another case involving heavy metal pollution at the Asarco plant \nin the Globeville neighborhood of Denver, Ms. Norton said she couldn't \nmove quickly and aggressively because she could act only on referrals \nfrom the State health department. Every U.S. State senator knows that a \nState attorney general has more power than that. The State attorney \ngeneral has the power to call in the officials from State agencies that \nare not doing their job and tell them to get on the stick and protect \nthe public and the environment. Ms. Norton could have even taken her \nconcerns about the State health department dragging its feet to the \npublic, but she didn't. That absence of leadership led to a settlement \nfrom her agency that was so inadequate that a private citizens lawsuit \nrecovered significantly more damages than Ms. Norton did.\n  The Secretary of the Interior has wide latitude under the law as to \nwho gets the land for leases or how the land will be handled under \nthose leases. The Secretary of the Interior has the right to say we \nwill lease this land for oil and gas, but we will not lease this land \nfor coal exploration or we will not lease it at all or we will lease it \nwith the following requirements to protect the environment. For \nexample, many new oil and gas leases require the lessee to take the \nspecial precautions to protect wildlife on public lands. By Secretarial \norder, Ms. Norton could direct the Bureau of Land Management to weaken \nprotective requirements enclosed in oil and gas leases, and at the same \ntime significantly harm the environment. The fact is, the power of this \noffice could allow virtually any private interest to build in one of \nour national treasures. In addition, through this office, the Secretary \nof the Interior can do much to deep six the prosecution of egregious \nenvironmental disasters. The reality here is: whether lawyers for the \nInterior Department are handling a case or the Justice Department is \nhandling it, the Secretary of the Interior will be consulted just as \nany client is consulted by a lawyer about important appeals. Should \nthere be an appeal at all? What kind of settlement would be \nappropriate? Is this offer satisfactory? Given Ms. Norton's record, the \nevidence does not demonstrate that she will be tough with polluters. \nThe fact is, as you try to find the common ground between the \nenvironmental community and the affected industries, when one of those \nparties goes over the line, you do have to have a Secretary of the \nInterior who is willing to be tough about using the enforcement \ncapabilities of the office.\n  Finally, I am concerned about Ms. Norton's interest and willingness \nto do the heavy lifting, to bring parties together, to find creative \nsolutions to vexing environmental problems.\n  I am proud to have been able to work with the Senator from Idaho, Mr. \nCraig, in an effort that was successful in the last session to resolve \nthe question of how you pay for schools and roads in rural communities \nthat have historically been tied to the harvest of timber. When Senator \nCraig and I started that effort, the two sides were 180 degrees apart, \nand virtually no one thought we could bring them together. But with \ngood will and rolling up our sleeves, we were able to do it.\n  When Ms. Norton was kind enough to come visit me at my office, I \nasked her to bring to the committee specific examples of how she would \ntry similar efforts on other longstanding conflicts, such as the \nEndangered Species Act. I thought for a long time that it was extremely \nimportant to relieve some of the redtape and bureaucratic requirements \non small private landowners, for example, under the Endangered Species \nAct, and I believe that can be done without destroying the mission of \nthat critical statute. That would be the kind of thing that I would \nlike to see the Secretary of the Interior take on and bring together \nthese rival camps in an effort to find common ground.\n  But she didn't give us those examples at the hearing that was \nscheduled. I asked--not just when she came to the office, but at the \nhearing--for specifics where she might work to try these common ground \nefforts that are so important, but none were furnished.\n  So I will be a reluctant vote on Ms. Norton. I strongly hope that her \nrecord proves me wrong. As I stated in the committee, it would not be \nthe first time, nor the last time, that that was the case. I hope Ms. \nNorton goes on to lead the Interior Department and that she will, in \nfact, look for specific ways to do what the President of the United \nStates is asking us in natural resources and other areas, and that is \nto unite, not divide. On that important objective articulately stated \nby the President of the United States, Ms. Norton will always have my \nassistance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, \nhas 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I associate myself \nwith the comments made by the ranking member, the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman. My assessment of this nominee is \napproximately the same. I will vote for her, and I want to take a few \nmoments to explain to this honorable body why I will vote for her.\n  I am a new member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. As such, I had an opportunity to hear her answers to \nquestions presented firsthand, and I also had an opportunity to talk \nwith her in my office. I talked with her about specific California \nissues. The first was something called CALFED; second, the Colorado \nRiver decision; third, oil drilling off the coast of California; \nfourth, the land and water conservation fund.\n  I think virtually all Members of this body know about the energy or \nelectricity crisis in California, but I think what perhaps many Members \nof this body might not understand is that water is close behind.\n  Beginning in 1993, I asked Interior Secretary Babbitt if he would sit \ndown and meet with the so-called water constituencies in California--\nthe agricultural farmers, the environmentalists, the urban water users, \na group called stakeholders in California's water future. As often \nsaid, whiskey is for drinking but water is for fighting. Lawsuit after \nlawsuit had characterized the situation with respect to water.\n  The basic fact is that California has a water infrastructure for 16 \nmillion people. That is when it was built, when Pat Brown was Governor \nof the State. Today the State has 34 million people, and it will be 50 \nmillion people within 20 years--with the same water infrastructure. \nThat is not good for the ecosystem, not good for the largest \nagricultural State in the Nation, and it is certainly not good for \nclean drinking water for the people of California.\n  To make a long story short, this CALFED venture culminated last year \nin an agreement between the Governor of the State and the Secretary of \nthe Interior called ``A Plan For Action.'' That plan for action \ninvolved the State water project, which is the California water \nproject, and the federally run,\n\n[[Page S624]]\n\nbuilt, and operated project, the Central Valley Project. It is to be a \n$7 billion shared program over the next 7 years with some 700 \nindividual projects. That program needs both an authorization this year \nand an appropriation this year as well. There was an attempt last year \nand it failed. So to have a Secretary of the Interior who would be \nwilling, one, to put an appropriation, which is a substantial one, in \nher budget to send up to the Office of Management and Budget this year \nis important to me. Secondly, to have a Secretary of the Interior who \nis willing to designate a high-level member of her Department, just as \nSecretary Babbitt designated the Under Secretary to oversee the \ndevelopment of this State-Federal program, is important to me as well.\n  Ms. Norton has agreed to do both. She has agreed to take a good \nlook--I know she has called the Office of Management and Budget and \nadvocated for the CALFED program because we were called by OMB and they \nsaid that she had done so. Secondly, she has assured us that she will \nappoint a high-level official to oversee the various meetings with the \nstakeholders.\n  So for me, my No. 1 environmental priority this year is the \nauthorization and the appropriation of the first year of a new CALFED \nprogram. I believe she has an open mind. I think she understands the \nimportance of water. I think she understands the outdated nature of the \nwater infrastructure, the struggle to keep the salmon running, to keep \nhigh-quality water for people to drink, and enough water to be able to \nproduce what is in excess of a $25 billion agricultural industry.\n\n  I also discussed with her the recent 15-year Colorado River \nagreement, which has been now agreed to by seven States, which will \nensure that California will receive no more than its annual allowance \nof 4.4 million acre feet of water from the Colorado River.\n  The fact is, because of this water shortage, California has been \noverdrawing the Colorado River allotment by some 800,000 acre feet a \nyear. Southern California, which uses water from the Colorado, has \nemployed all sorts of additional water conservation methodology, water \nrecycling and water transfer measures, to ensure that there will be \nenough water for the other States.\n  I am a strong supporter of this agreement. I would like to see it go \nforward. I believe this Secretary will do her due diligence on the \nagreement and also agree that it is a major and positive step forward \nfor the seven affected States.\n  She has also categorically assured me that there will be no offshore \noil drilling off the coast of California. That is something the people \nof California have very strong opposition to, and I believe she will \nkeep her word.\n  We also spoke about the importance of the land and water conservation \nfund. I happen to believe it can be the most important environmental \nprogram. I think there is an accumulation of $13 billion in offshore \noil revenues that can go for appropriation into the land and water \nconservation fund.\n  I supported a bill Senator Murkowski and Senator Landrieu had put \ntogether, plus my own bill, which would assure the appropriation of \nsome of this money on a regular basis--approximately $900 million of \nthat money.\n  I see the chairman of the Appropriations Committee on which I am a \nlowly member, and I know appropriators don't necessarily like being \ntold how to appropriate. However, I can say this: I think the Land & \nWater Conservation Fund offers this Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives an opportunity for major improvements in our \nenvironmental legacy. I am hopeful that issue might be settled. I know \nthere has been some significant opposition to Gale Norton. As a former \nColorado attorney general, she has taken some positions with which I \ndisagree. However, she had every right to do so.\n  I, for example, was troubled by her 1997 op-ed when she said there \nwas no consensus on global warming. And quite categorically, to our \ncommittee, she stated that times have changed--and indeed they have--\nand that she has had an opportunity to reconsider her point of view and \ndoes in fact believe that global warming is real. I think what came \nthrough to me the most clearly when I had an opportunity to talk with \nher was that this is a very talented woman. She has strong skills. She \nis flexible. She is trying very hard to maintain an open mind, and I \nthink it is very possible that she is going to do an excellent job as \nSecretary of the Interior.\n  At the very least, she has convinced me that she is willing to work \non issues in a bipartisan fashion. She is willing to address the \ndifficult issues which will confront her, as I believe she is open \nminded and I feel as though I can pick up the phone and call her and \nthat she will, A, either return that call, or, B, listen to my concerns \nand try to work them out. As a Senator from the largest State in the \nNation, that means a great deal to me.\n  I want to say one thing. I returned last night from Switzerland where \nI attended the World Economic Forum. I cannot tell you how deeply \ntroubled other nations are by the fact that, as they see it, the United \nStates is unwilling to put forward a major environmental presence. They \nexpress concern that the United States, with 4 percent of the world's \npopulation, uses 25 percent of the energy. They are concerned about \nglobal warming--particularly nations that are low lying that see the \nsea rising and have the possibility, within decades, of some of their \ncoastal cities being wiped out. They are concerned about deforestation \nof the rain forest and the loss of wetlands, and they are concerned \nabout clean air and clean water. I share their concerns. I believe this \nnew Secretary of the Interior will also share these concerns as the \nchief steward of land managed by the National Park Service, the Bureau \nof Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. \nGeological Service.\n  In California alone, this includes the Mojave National Preserve, \nYosemite, Joshua Tree, and Death Valley National Parks.\n  She has a tremendous responsibility.\n  I end my remarks by saying, once again, that she is a talented woman. \nShe is flexible. She is committed, I believe, and she has the \nopportunity to be a very positive Secretary of the Interior. I will be \nvery happy to cast my vote for Gale Norton.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana was ahead of \nme. I will be pleased to wait for him, if Senator Bingaman would like \nme to do so.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I don't know where he is. I suggest the \nSenator from Alaska go right ahead.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am very pleased to come to the floor to \nsupport the nominations of Gale Norton to be Secretary of the \nDepartment of the Interior. She has a proven record as a public servant \nand the credentials, experience, and character to be a great Secretary \nof the Interior. I know a little bit about this Department. I was at \nthe Interior Department during the days of President Eisenhower first \nas a legislative counsel, then as Assistant to the Secretary of the \nInterior, Fred Seaton, and then as the Solicitor of the Interior \nDepartment. I recall that in those days we had informal meetings with \nMembers of Congress to discuss the real issues facing Federal land \nmanagers and the people living and working near those lands. Those were \nnonpartisan talks that assured the success of later more formal \nadministrative and legislative initiatives during the Eisenhower \nadministration.\n  In Alaska, one-third of the lands are managed by the Bureau of Land \nManagement, two-thirds of the lands managed by the National park \nService, and almost 90 percent of the lands managed by the Fish and \nWildlife Service. All agencies of the Department of the Interior, and \none-quarter of all the lands under the management of the Interior \nDepartment have been declared to be wilderness by the U.S. Congress and \nnot available for our use.\n  Many of Alaska's Native people, as well as other Alaskans, live \nwithin the boundaries of these Federal conservation areas that have \nbeen withdrawn. They make their livelihood off of the land, and many \ntimes there are conflicts between our people and the Department of the \nInterior.\n  As an Alaskan, I am very pleased to support Gale Norton because of \nher background, and as a Senator, I say to\n\n[[Page S625]]\n\nmy colleagues that we are most fortunate to have this brilliant young \nwoman as a guardian of our Nation's lands and native people. As a \nlawyer, she will look beyond rhetoric. As a former Interior Department \nofficial, she will understand the duty and stewardship and traditions \nof that Department. As a former attorney general of a Western State, \nshe will remember the communities and the people who neighbor Federal \nlands under her jurisdiction. I shall vote for her nomination and \nwelcome the opportunity to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Idaho seeking \ntime. May I ask how much he might require at this time? I yield 12 \nminutes, and I think Senator Bingaman and I agree that when Senator \nBreaux returns, he will be recognized. I also am under the impression \nthat Senator Warner will be coming to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee for yielding me time to speak on \nbehalf of the nomination of Gale Norton as Secretary of the Interior. \nAs someone who knows Ms. Norton, I commend her to my colleagues as an \nInterior Secretary who will cooperate with Congress and collaborate \nwith States and local governments and communities of interest affected \nby her Department's decisions.\n  I also commend her to my colleagues as a person who demonstrated in \nher two days of testimony before the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources that she possesses the balanced views and judgment and \npersonality required to be a Secretary of the Interior. That was \nperhaps somewhat of a surprise, I think, to some of our committee \nmembers who had heard about Ms. Norton only through the advertisements \nof a $2 million media campaign waged against her nomination by national \nenvironmental groups. I don't believe it has been since Jackie \nGleason--and we remember Jackie Gleason, fist doubled up, face \nflushed--railing against his Honeymooner's neighbor by the name of \nNorton. We kept hearing ``Norton, Norton.'' I don't think we have heard \nthat name Norton, spoken with so much venom since the days of Jackie \nGleason. Unfortunately, national environmental groups literally have \nbecome the Ralph Cramden of the advocacy community--overbearing, \noverwrought, and overstuffed--in their case, with foundation money that \ncould have been so much better spent on on-the-ground conservation \npriorities.\n\n  The Senate confirmation process is also a bit of an acronym in this \nera of 24/7 news coverage--that is, round the clock news coverage and \ncontinuous campaigning. Every elected official knows, as we all must \nunderstand, the peril of letting an attack against a candidate or a \nlegislative proposal go unanswered within a 24-hour news cycle. And \nyet, to protect our prerogatives as Senators in this process that we \nare talking about today, we insist that nominees for public office \nremain silent until they appear before us for their confirmation \nhearings.\n  At those hearings on January 18 and 19, Ms. Norton finally was able \nto speak about what she believes and who she is. The contrast with what \nwas falsely portrayed in 3 weeks of intensified interest group \nadvertising was stark and it was vivid. It contributed, I think, to the \noverwhelming vote by the committee in favor of her confirmation.\n  Two themes, in particular, that emerged from her testimony, deserve \nthe close attention of all of our colleagues. First, this is an \nInterior Secretary who is committed to working with Congress. That is a \nrefreshing and important concept. Both in her opening statement, as \nwell as in several thoughtful responses to questions, Ms. Norton \nexpressed her commitment to working with Members of Congress from both \nsides of the aisle to develop bipartisan solutions to difficult natural \nresource problems. This is a sharp contrast to her predecessor who made \nno secret of his disdain for the congressional authorizing committees \nas little more than ``highly partisan debating societies'' that were \nstaffed by ``munchkins'' and that do nothing more than ``wrangle a \nlot'' about the issues of the day. I also doubt that we will see Ms. \nNorton walk off camera during a ``20/20'' interview, swearing under her \nbreath.\n  Second, this is an Interior Secretary who is committed to listening \nand working with the people affected by her decisions. She said:\n\n       I am firmly committed to a process of consultation and \n     collaboration. We should listen to all voices and involve all \n     citizens. That is fair. It is also wise. People are \n     magnificent resources for ideas, for knowledge, for insight. \n     I have lived and worked here in Washington. I have also lived \n     and worked in the great American West. Those of us in \n     Washington need to be good partners with Americans living in \n     other parts of the country and in our territories. America is \n     a strong nation because of the diversity of its people. These \n     people hold many different views in different perspectives. \n     We need to work with them, to involve them, to benefit from \n     their creativity and their capacity to innovate.\n\n  What a refreshing statement compared with the Secretary of the \nInterior who has now just left this city.\n  I submit to my colleagues that, whatever our differences with one \nanother over the contentious issues and whatever differences some or \nall of us may ultimately have with the new administration, starting off \nwith the Secretary of the Interior who is committed to being a listener \nis a very good place to begin. As she so eloquently said at her \nconfirmation hearing, ``Using consultation and collaboration, forging \npartnerships with interested citizens, together we can all succeed in \nour effort to conserve America's most precious resources.''\n  I urge my colleagues to vote favorably for the nomination of Gale \nNorton to be Secretary of the Interior of the United States. Our \nenvironment, our public land resources, and the Nation as a whole \ndepend upon it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. To clarify, prior to my colleague from Colorado coming \nto the floor, we had an agreement that Senator Breaux would be the next \nrecognized speaker, and Senator Breaux did show up, so I guess we will \nhave to live with that.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That will be fine. I am happy to wait until the Senator \nfinishes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think Senator Breaux wanted about 8 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. More or less.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator from Colorado will be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. It is Breaux by a nose.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for making time available on \nthis very important nomination as to who is going to be the new \nSecretary of the Interior, a very important position for all Americans. \nWe as a nation have a major interest in knowing that the person who is \nto be in charge of the managing of all of our public lands and much of \nour public resources is going to be a person who brings a balanced \nphilosophy to that task. It is an immense task for which I imagine no \none who would be nominated would ever be considered the perfect \nnominee.\n  What I mean by that is it seems to me there will be some, and I think \na minority of people in both camps, who would say they would perhaps \nlike to have a Secretary of the Interior who would bring almost no \nmanagement responsibilities to that task, who would basically say we \nshould let the private sector develop the resources of this country in \nwhatever way they saw fit. There is probably another group of people in \nthe country--again a very small number--who would say no, when it is \npublic lands, they cannot be utilized for private purposes ever; that \nit should be micromanaged by the Federal Government out of Washington; \nyou can limit activity to only what is absolutely needed.\n  I think the better philosophy for this very important job is to bring \na balance. In my conversations with Gale Norton, I have come to the \nconclusion that she is a person who can bring a\n\n[[Page S626]]\n\nmanagement-type philosophy to this job.\n  Neither of the two extremes that I describe will probably be very \nhappy with the approach she uses. Some will say in many cases she is \nbeing far too restrictive and limits to too much detail what can be \ndone on our public lands. Others will say she is not being aggressive \nenough in allowing for development on these resources.\n  The answers to these questions, simply stated, are that we want a \nbalanced person for the job. We want someone who brings commonsense \npolicies to this important task, and commonsense policies is a phrase I \nhave heard used in describing Gale Norton.\n  In addition, I think she will be a person who will consider multiple \nuse of these valuable properties. What do I mean by that? What I mean \nis that Federal lands owned by our Government can be used for more than \njust one purpose; yes, there are lands that are particularly set aside \nas wildlife refuges and conservation areas and wilderness areas. My \nargument is that these areas can be subject to multiple use in a \nfashion that preserves the intent of why this area was set aside in the \nfirst place and at the same time allows for balanced development which \nis compatible with that purpose.\n  There has been a great deal made about the new administration's \nconsideration of opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in the \nState of Alaska. I happen to think that is something that can be done. \nIt is not without risk. Nothing we do as a society is without some \nrisk, some adverse consequences, but history tells us that we can have \na wildlife refuge in an area of the country where ANWR is located and \nfind there are uses that are compatible to that refuge that make sense \nfrom a public policy standpoint.\n  That is where the question of whether it is going to be balanced \ncomes into play. I note that when I met with Ms. Norton in my office, \nwe talked about that, and I suggested she look at the record in \nLouisiana where we have had exploration and development on wildlife \nrefuges for over 60 years. We have almost 1,700 wells that have been \ndrilled on wildlife refuges, both Federal and State refuges, including \nproperty owned by environmental groups, that has been done \nsuccessfully. Because we have been doing it since the 1940s, we have \nmade mistakes that would not be made in the year 2001 and beyond \nbecause we, in fact, have learned from those mistakes.\n  I argue that an area such as ANWR, which is covered over in the \nwinter months with solid sheets of ice, an area where there would be no \nnecessity for dredging canals to get to the property, where there is \nalready a major pipeline running from Prudhoe Bay down to Valdez, is an \necosystem that can allow for exploration and production in a manner \nthat would be compatible with the purpose of the refuge.\n  I argue the refuges in Louisiana where we have that type of \nproduction are much more complicated. We have much greater abundance of \nwildlife than they do in ANWR. We have everything from alligators to \nfur-bearing animals, to waterfowl, ducks, geese, shrimp, oysters, and \nfin fish, all within the same ecosystem in a very fragile wetland area. \nIf we are able to do it under those circumstances, I argue that \ncertainly ANWR can also allow for the compatible exploration and \nproduction in their area if it is done carefully in a managed fashion.\n  As far as what is potentially available in that area, they tell me \nthe latest estimates are that it could produce up to 1.5 million \nbarrels a day of oil for at least 25 years, a sum that is equal to \nnearly 25 percent of our daily oil consumption.\n  Some people say: That is not that much. Yes, it is. It is a \nconsiderable amount, and if you look at California, which is \nexperiencing blackouts and operations which are being curtailed because \nof either unavailability of energy or because of the high cost of \nenergy, how can we say that we are going to just build a fence around \nan area which will potentially be the second largest energy-producing \nregion of all of North America?\n  We have to take a balanced approach, look at it carefully, look at \nwhat we have done in other areas, and then make a decision not based on \nemotion but based on the facts of the situation. When I spoke with Ms. \nNorton and listened to what she was thinking of doing, that was a \nbalanced position she would bring to this job. I am pleased to stand \nand urge my colleagues to support her. This Congress will watch \ncarefully how she conducts the affairs of the Department of the \nInterior because this is something that affects all Americans, whether \nyou are a Westerner, a Southerner, or someone in an urbanized area in \nNew England. I think she can do a good job, will do a good job, and I \nlook forward to working with her.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Montana seeking \nrecognition, to be followed by Senator Allard from Colorado. Senator \nWarner indicated an interest in speaking.\n  How much time does the Senator from Montana require?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I will try my best to keep it under 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I appreciate that and leave it up to the clerk to \nmonitor the clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am very glad to stand today and voice my \nsupport for Gale Norton as this country's next Secretary of the \nInterior. After meeting with Ms. Norton and sitting in on her \nconfirmation hearings, I am convinced she is the right person for the \njob. Not only am I impressed with her good ideas and her willingness to \nlisten, but I am impressed with the balance of thought she will be \nbringing to the Department. She knows that the challenges in that \nDepartment are probably larger than any other department in Washington, \nDC. She also has an idea about how she wants to deal with them.\n  As a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and also a \nmember of the Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations, I look forward \nto working with Ms. Norton. If confirmed as the next Secretary of the \nInterior, she will be called upon to appear in front of these \ncommittees, and she will ultimately be held responsible for the \nworkings of the agencies under her supervision.\n  When we have questions or concerns about the National Park Service or \nthe Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, just to name a few, we will come to \nher. I am grateful for that because I think what we are looking for, \nmore than anything else, is balance instead of activism.\n  Like most Western States, Montana has a lot of public land, and we \nare affected every day by some of the decisions that are made regarding \nFederal land because they determine whether we will make a living or \nnot in our State. Sometimes Government is a very good neighbor; \nsometimes it is not. I think Ms. Norton understands that, coming from a \npublic lands State.\n  One thing in particular: Last year, the year 2000, we know how the \nfires swept across the West. No State was more affected than New Mexico \nor the State of Montana. In fact, Congress appropriated $1.6 billion to \nhelp fix the damage from the summer of 2000 and also to make sure we \nwill be prepared should another catastrophe such as that happen again. \nWe would rather that not be repeated.\n  In the year 2000, almost 1 million acres burned in Montana, some of \nit public. Plenty of the land was private, however, because private \nlands lay next to those forest lands--forest land, grassland, pasture \nland, homes, businesses, and everything in between. It was a dark, dark \nsummer for us in Montana.\n  We are approaching spring again, and the work is just beginning. We \nneed to reseed the burned areas to keep the soil from eroding. We need \nto make sure the watersheds stay clean. One of the most important \nthings we can do is to make sure the noxious weeds do not take our \nnewly burned land. I know a lot of folks say everything has grown back. \nNine times out of 10, it is a noxious weed. When they take hold, the \nnative plants are crowded out, wildlife habitat is compromised, \nlivestock-carrying capacity is reduced, and the condition of the land \nis jeopardized for years to come.\n\n  So we need to get after it and get this land cleaned up, making sure \nthose lands that are remaining now are\n\n[[Page S627]]\n\nprotected because we are again looking at a very difficult time. Our \nsnow pack is low again this year. We have not had moisture since before \nChristmas. Again, we are looking at another year that could be another \ndrought year in Montana. We will need people who are not afraid to make \ndecisions, make them quickly, and make the right decision that protects \nthe land.\n  You have to appreciate Ms. Norton for another area, too. Under the \nprevious administration, we withdrew a lot of land from minerals \nmanagement, resource management, and resource development. We have an \nenergy crisis in this country. Maybe you are not affected by it now, \nbut our friends from California are. The last time I looked around, \nCalifornia was still a part of this great country, which makes us \nconcerned about what happens to our good friends in California.\n  It is just not a California problem. If you come from the Northwest, \nwhere we produce an abundance of electrical power, you see that power \nsucked away from our area, going to California. I do not begrudge \nCalifornians the power. But I also have to be a little bit nervous \nabout having power for the people in the Northwest.\n  When they are in trouble, we are in trouble. We have built no new \ngenerating facilities. We just came from an administration that wanted \nto breach the dams that produce electricity for the West and the \nnational grid. That is irresponsible. Conservation, yes. It is of vital \nimportance to all our energy needs. But conservation will not do it \nalone.\n  We were very successful the last time we faced an energy crisis, \nwhen, way back in 1976, we did a lot of good through conservation. And \nwe are still doing a lot of good through conservation. But we failed to \nbuild any more facilities to produce power, electricity.\n  I will tell you, electricity does not come Republican or Democrat. I \nwill tell you where it comes from. The first time that finger hits that \nswitch, and these lights do not go on, it becomes a national crisis.\n  I think Ms. Norton will be able to play a vital role in resource \nmanagement when it comes to solving some of the power problems and \nenergy crises that we are facing today.\n  When we look at public lands, energy development and access to public \nlands are vital issues. These things will be coming up again and again \nover the next few years because I truly believe the chairman of the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources probably has his hands as \nfull as he wants in trying to deal with the energy crisis for all \nAmericans. Because there is no doubt in my mind, if you want to pick \none thing that is slowing down our economy, it is the tremendous \nincrease in the cost of our energy. Access to those lands is very \nimportant.\n  But also another point that I think was brought up during the \nhearings is that, for the first time, we heard the Secretary of Energy \nsay that he is not afraid to talk to the Secretary of Agriculture, and \nneither one of them are afraid to talk to the Secretary of the Interior \nto solve common problems. That is very important in this town because \nin this town we spend more time solving turf wars that we do anything \nelse. But this time it is going to take an administration of Department \nheads and Secretaries working together, knowing what one is doing and \nthe policy they are putting forward, and knowing how we can complete a \nnational policy to deal with an energy crisis; the ability to work \ntogether.\n\n  So I am here today to offer Ms. Norton my wholehearted support in her \nnomination as Secretary of the Interior. She is the right person for \nthis job. I cannot imagine how we would find anybody more qualified. \nShe has a great mind and is very intelligent, understanding her job, \nwhich touches so many of our lives every day.\n  I heard some of the folks on the other side of the aisle saying she \nis too far to the right to go into the Department of the Interior. But \nI will tell you, when you look at those statements, they are just \npartisan arguments, and that is all because there is no other substance \nthere.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the full committee and yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, under the previous agreement, the \nsenior Senator from Virginia was to be recognized upon his return. I \nsee the Senator from Virginia has returned to the floor.\n  Might I ask, how much time might the Senator desire?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would think 10 minutes would be \nadequate.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Virginia and yield him 10 \nminutes. And then after he speaks, I will yield to the Senator from \nColorado who has been waiting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today with other colleagues to \nexpress my strong support for President Bush's nominee to be Secretary \nof the Interior, Gale Norton.\n  I have had a brief opportunity to visit with this distinguished \nAmerican, and I heartily endorse the President's nomination. She has \nthe qualifications, in my judgment, to serve in this important post.\n  As many of my colleagues have detailed, she is an effective \nlitigator, with over 20 years of experience in environmental and \nnatural resources law. Prior thereto, she was a law clerk to a judge. \nAnd I had the privilege in my lifetime to have that experience.\n  Her professional experiences and successes as Colorado attorney \ngeneral, I believe, have given her a solid foundation and, indeed, the \ntemperament--and it requires temperament because there will be a lot of \nheated issues in the course of her duties that she will have to \nresolve--necessary to be an outstanding Secretary.\n  She has served on, as we say, ``both sides of the fence''--in the \nFederal Government and State government. She is skilled in the law and \nknows that States can be effective partners in preserving our public \nlands and managing its valuable resources.\n  From her testimony before the committee, I was compelled by her \nrecognition that the primary responsibility of Secretary of the \nInterior is one of protecting and fostering our public lands, our \nnatural resources, and the treasures that make up our national park and \nwildlife refuge system.\n  Mr. President, I want to finish up my statement on a personal note. I \nhave three wonderful children. All of them are very active in \nphilanthropic activities to protect the very things that I have \nenumerated here: our natural resources, national parks, wildlife, and \nthe like. Their philosophy extends a little further than their old \nman's philosophy on this. I tend to be a centrist, trying to strike a \nclean balance between the necessity for carefully expanding the \nprotected areas of America, and husbanding of our resources, while at \nthe same time giving the private sector and, indeed, the States the \nrights to which they are entitled.\n  My children have all communicated with me within the past few days \nabout this nomination. I have told them very clearly, I am going to \nsupport this nominee. Their request to me was this: Father, that's \nfine, but keep a watchful eye.\n  So I made a commitment to my family that I shall keep a watchful eye. \nBut I assured them that, in my judgment, this eminently qualified \nindividual would pursue a balanced course of action between the many \ncompeting interests for the precious resources we have. And in the \nwords of my children, once these resources are withdrawn, once they are \ndeveloped, they are gone forever. And that is correct.\n  The Commonwealth of Virginia is home to some of our Nation's greatest \nnatural and historic resources--from the Shenandoah National Park, our \nCivil War battlefields throughout the region, to the wildlife refuges \non the eastern shore. The 20 national parks in Virginia have the fifth \nhighest visitor rate in the Nation. It surprises people when I make \nthat statement. We are No. 5 in the nation and located here in the \nEast. That is why I am the first eastern Senator to speak on behalf of \nthis distinguished nominee. I feel very strongly about it.\n  My State is very actively engaged with the national park system. In \nfact, I have just taken the initiative to create another wilderness \narea in my State. In my 23 years in the Senate, I have been involved \nwith a number of these wilderness areas, and I shall continue to press \nfor the establishment and the preservation of these national\n\n[[Page S628]]\n\ntreasures. We cherish, as Virginians, these resources and welcome a \nstrong partnership with the Department of the Interior. These sites \nprovide an outdoor classroom to tell the story of the founding of our \nNation and other significant events that have woven the fabric of our \nform of government and, indeed, of our great Nation.\n  I am drawn to the nominee's comments regarding the importance of \npartnerships between the Federal, State and local government, and \nprivate organizations. We have such partnerships in Virginia, and they \nwork well. Partnerships with the Park Service and local governments \nhave been tremendously successful in preserving historic battlefields, \nparticularly in the Shenandoah Valley. These partnerships ensure that \nsignificant historic landmarks can be preserved without the expense of \nFederal ownership.\n  The amount of land of natural and historic valve that should be \nsomehow preserved is enormous. The Federal taxpayer cannot begin to \nprovide the funds necessary to purchase all this land. In Virginia, we \nhave shown how a farmer can continue his or her operation and pass it \ndown through successive generations of their families and yet preserve \nthat farm, while allowing visitors to come and study where historic \nbattles, in the Shenandoah Valley for instance, were fought. It makes \nlittle difference to that visitor whether he or she is standing on \nFederal land or land preserved by the family.\n  I urge our new Secretary to explore further opportunities in this \narea of public/private partnerships.\n  In addition to our historic battlefields, Virginia is blessed with \ncritical habitat for migratory waterfowl in our coastal areas including \nthe Eastern Shore. We are home to six major national wildlife refuges. \nThese sites provide undisturbed lands for the American bald eagle, the \nperegrine falcon and hundreds of migratory ducks and songbirds.\n  Throughout my Senate career I have been pleased to work with local \ngovernments and local citizen organizations to expand our national park \nand our wildlife refuge system in Virginia. Permanent preservation of \nthese lands ensures that future generations will have a ``hands on'' \nexperience and that our wildlife will be able to flourish.\n  I fully endorse the nomination of Gale Norton to be Secretary of \nInterior and I look forward to working with her to strengthen our \nnational parks and wildlife refuges across this country.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner pertaining to the introduction of S. 201 \nand S. 202 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask that the Senator from Colorado \nbe recognized at this time. He asked for 10 or 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I thank the chairman for giving me an \nopportunity to respond.\n  I rise to respond to the comments from my dear friend and colleague \nfrom Oregon and also reemphasize what my colleague from Idaho had \ntalked about in regard to Gale Norton as Secretary of the Interior.\n  I agree with my colleague from Idaho that Gale Norton will be a \nlistener. Even more than just listening, she is going to understand. \nThe reason she is going to be able to understand is because she has a \nbroad background of experience. She started out her career actually \nworking here in Washington, DC. She worked in the Department of \nAgriculture. Then she went over to the Department of the Interior and \nworked there as associate solicitor. Then she went back to the State of \nColorado and was elected attorney general of the State of Colorado. She \nhas been able to see issues from the Federal perspective, and she \nunderstands the responsibility the Federal Government takes on many of \nthese issues.\n  She understands many of these issues from a State perspective because \nshe has had to be a spokesman for the State of Colorado, the citizens \nof Colorado, as various issues concerning the environment have come \nforward. Not only that, she has also served in the private sector. So \nas an American or as a Coloradan, she has had to deal with various laws \nthat have been passed by the Congress, signed by the President, and she \nhas had to live with those laws.\n  I have always believed that if you have walked in the shoes of \nsomebody who has had to live with the laws of this country, you have a \nbetter, balanced understanding of what is needed.\n  Gale Norton has had a good record on the environment. It started \nearly on when she was associate solicitor with the Department of the \nInterior--and she mentioned this in her testimony before the \ncommittee--where she pointed to helping prevent the California condor \nfrom becoming extinct as one of her greatest accomplishments. That was \npart of her responsibilities as associate solicitor.\n  She also worked in the State of Colorado to clean up a number of \nSuperfund sites we have there. In Leadville, we had a Superfund site. \nShe worked to clean that up. She worked hard to get started with \ncleanup of Rocky Flats, another Superfund site in Colorado. She worked \nhard to get things moving as far as the Rocky Mountain arsenal was \nconcerned. She has a good record for cleaning up the environment.\n  Her record has been misrepresented as far as the Summitville mine. I \nwill take a few moments to talk about that because my colleague from \nOregon mentioned that in his comments. The problem at the Summitville \nmine in Colorado--I might add, this has been a real catastrophe on the \nenvironment, and I have been very concerned about the fact that the \ncleanup of the Summitville mine has not been progressing along \nsatisfactorily--started in the 1980s.\n  At that time we had a Democrat Governor in the State of Colorado, and \nwe had a Democrat who was attorney general for the State of Colorado \nwhen they first began to deal with the problem. Gale Norton, then, was \nelected as attorney general in the State of Colorado just as the \nproblem of the Summitville mine began to bubble up in a public manner. \nNow, today, this Summitville mine problem is beginning to be resolved \nin a real, meaningful way. There has been a settlement, and the company \nhas agreed to pay $30 million in cleanup of the site.\n  Those of us who have lived in the State of Colorado understand the \nhard work she has done in trying to clean up the Summitville mine. It \nis not only myself, but the Denver Post, for example, has written an \narticle in support of Gale Norton and characterized the Summitville \nmine issue as a false blame toward Gale Norton. I ask unanimous consent \nthat that editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, Jan. 11, 2001]\n\n                       The Blame for Summitville\n\n       Blame for the Summitville environmental fiasco oozes thick \n     and wide through Colorado state government. Yet critics are \n     using Summitville to singularly bash Gale Norton, the former \n     Colorado attorney general whom President-elect George W. Bush \n     nominated as U.S. interior secretary. Norton should not be \n     slammed for other politicians' mistakes.\n       In fact, during her tenure as state AG, Norton struggled to \n     protect the public's interest at Summitville, despite \n     legislative mandates that ham-strung meaningful action.\n       In the late 1980s, the Colorado Legislature gutted the \n     state agency responsible for supervising environmental \n     compliance at hard-rock mines, leaving far too few mine \n     inspectors in the field. So when the Summitville gold mine \n     installed the liner for its heap leach pond, state experts \n     didn't take a close look at the design and implementation. \n     State inspectors also weren't around to discover numerous \n     other environmental goofs and lawbreaking at the site. The \n     pond liner eventually failed, spewing mine poisons into the \n     head-waters of the Rio Grande, one of our region's most \n     important rivers. Only later did authorities discover the \n     other mining law violations, too.\n       But Norton never was in charge of the state unit \n     responsible for the omissions.\n       Meantine, state lawmakers had imposed a ridiculously short \n     time frame in which authorities could bring charges when mine \n     operators committed wrong-doing. In the Summitville case, the \n     statute would have hogtied any Colorado AG, even the most \n     radical environmentalist. So, although The Denver Post \n     editorially bemoaned the state's inability to act, we were \n     haranguing the foolishness of the Colorado Legislature, not \n     Norton.\n       In fact, Norton barely had been in office a year when the \n     Summitville crisis broke in 1992. The fiasco's roots instead \n     had taken hold under the policies of a conservative \n     Republican legislature, and on the watch of a moderate \n     Democratic governor and attorney general, Roy Romer and Duane \n     Woodard.\n       Moreover, Washington critics are linking Summitville to \n     Colorado's self-audit law,\n\n[[Page S629]]\n\n     which lets businesses review their own environmental \n     compliance without risking regulatory wrath. The state has \n     tangled with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency over \n     the law. But the statute was enacted in 1994, two years after \n     the Summitville debacle.\n       EPA's own Summitville record isn't spotless, as the feds \n     squandered enormous sums accomplishing very little.\n       Summitville shamed Colorado. This newspaper, with its \n     active environmentalist agenda, repeatedly lambasted the \n     state-and EPA's handling of the matter.\n       But far from causing the problem, Norton was among the \n     civil servants trying to fix the mess under nearly impossible \n     circumstances.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. This appeared in the Denver Post on January 11. The \nheadline is ``The Blame for Summitville.'' It makes two cogent points \nthat I want to bring to the attention of the Members of the Senate. One \nof the paragraphs says:\n\n       In fact, Norton barely had been in office a year when the \n     Summitville crisis broke in 1992. The fiasco's roots instead \n     had taken hold under the policies of a conservative \n     Republican legislature, and on the watch of a moderate \n     Democratic Governor and attorney general, Roy Romer and Duane \n     Woodard.\n\n  The article points out that ``EPA's own record isn't spotless, as the \nFeds squandered enormous sums accomplishing very little.''\n  Gale Norton pursued this issue after getting into office. She reached \nin and tried to protect the assets of a company that was filing \nbankruptcy so as to get out of the responsibility of having to clean up \nthat mine. She yanked them out of the bankruptcy proceedings and \ncontinued to hold them responsible.\n  The individual who followed Gale Norton as attorney general for the \nState of Colorado is Ken Salazar. He is a Democrat. Ken Salazar made a \npublic statement in defense of the work of Gale Norton as attorney \ngeneral for the State of Colorado as it applied to the Summitville \nmine. He starts out his public statement by saying:\n\n       I believe former Colorado Attorney General Gale Norton \n     knows the environmental issues of Colorado and the West, is \n     smart, and has a passion for public service. She should be \n     given a chance to serve as Secretary of the Interior.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       In the past few days, former Attorney General Norton has \n     been unfairly criticized concerning two issues: Her support \n     for the environmental self-audit laws of Colorado, and her \n     role in the Summitville Mine environmental case in the \n     Alamosa River watershed in southern Colorado.\n\n  I point out that Ken Salazar grew up in that area close to the \nSummitville mine. He is familiar with the area and also with the case \nbecause he had to follow up on the work that the attorney general, Gale \nNorton, had started, and now the present attorney general, Salazar, is \nwrapping that up. In his statement, he goes on:\n\n       Concerning the Summitville mine matter, the State of \n     Colorado has been vigilant and aggressive in pursuing those \n     responsible for the release of pollution from the Summitville \n     Mine. Former Attorney General Gale Norton supported the \n     efforts to recover the proceeds from bankruptcy, and in 1996 \n     she also joined with the United States of America in the \n     lawsuit to recover expenses and natural resource damages from \n     those involved in the Summitville mine.\n\n  So it is definitely an unfair accusation, as viewed by many of us in \nColorado, Democrats and Republicans.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the statement by Attorney General \nSalazar be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement of Colorado Attorney General Ken Salazar concerning Gale \n            Norton's Nomination as Secretary of the Interior\n\n       Denver.--I believe former Colorado Attorney General Gale \n     Norton knows the environmental issues of Colorado and the \n     West, is smart, and has a passion for public service. She \n     should be given a chance to serve as Secretary of the \n     Interior.\n       I have worked with Gale Norton for more than a decade. In \n     her role as Colorado Attorney General, she represented me \n     while I served as Executive Director of the Colorado \n     Department of Natural Resources. Though I certainly do not \n     share all of former Attorney General Norton's views on the \n     environment and other matters, I respect her legal and policy \n     knowledge and constructive approach to difficult issues.\n       In the past few days, former Attorney General Norton has \n     been unfairly criticized concerning two issues: (1) her \n     support for the environmental self-audit laws of Colorado; \n     and (2) her role in the Summitville Mine environmental case \n     in the Alamosa River watershed in southern Colorado.\n       Gale Norton's position on Colorado's environmental self-\n     audit law has enjoyed very significant bipartisan support \n     here in Colorado. The original self-audit bill had a \n     Democratic sponsor and was signed into law by a Democratic \n     governor. As a Democrat, I supported the environmental self-\n     audit law because the law, when properly implemented, creates \n     incentives for businesses to protect the environment. I have \n     worked to resolve outstanding issues with the Environmental \n     Protection Agency and the Department of Justice on Colorado's \n     law, and on April 14, 2000 I issued a formal opinion that \n     sets forth the central legal principles of Colorado's \n     environmental self-audit law.\n       Concerning the Summitville Mine matter, the State of \n     Colorado has been vigilant and aggressive in pursuing those \n     responsible for the releases of pollution from the \n     Summitville Mine. Former Attorney General Gale Norton \n     supported the efforts to recover the proceeds from bankruptcy \n     and in 1996, she also joined with the United States of \n     America in the lawsuit to recover expenses and natural \n     resource damages from those involved in the Summitville Mine.\n       There are fair questions that should be asked in the course \n     of the Senate confirmation proceedings. These matters are \n     proper inquiries of any nominee for Secretary of the \n     Interior.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I wanted to take a few moments to \nrespond to the comments and accusations leveled against Gale Norton \nbecause I really believe she has a deep concern about our environment. \nShe comes from the State of Colorado. We call it colorful Colorado. She \nwants to keep Colorado that way, and certainly I think she will be very \nresponsible. She will do a good job as Secretary of the Interior. She \nhas a great background and the intellect to do the right thing for \nAmerica.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I see no other Members seeking \nrecognition at this time, although we have had an indication that one \nor two may come over. Senator Bingaman, who is the ranking member of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and I have agreed to share \nour time equally since we are both supporting the nominee, Gale Norton, \nfor Secretary of the Interior. How much time remains total for either \nside, or both?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls 9 remaining \nminutes, and the Senator from New Mexico has 43 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is my understanding that Senator Bingaman has \nagreed that we will try to accommodate those coming over and let the \ntime run out. It is our understanding that tomorrow the Senate will \ntake up, at 2:45, three nominations and that we have 90 minutes, I \nbelieve; is that correct--110 minutes, rather.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I have an extended statement, but I \nam sure the occupant of the Chair and others would be happy if I were a \nlittle briefer.\n  Madam President, I think it is fair to say that we have had a pretty \nunanimous consensus here of those speaking on behalf of Gale Norton for \nSecretary of the Interior. We only have one Member who opposes her, and \nI suspect we will have others tomorrow, inasmuch as time will allow for \nadditional Members to speak. I won't try to prejudge the level of \nsupport. But I think it is fair to say, as chairman of The Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, that we have had somewhat of a mandate \nwithin the committee makeup. We voted her out 18-2.\n  As I indicated earlier in my remarks, Ms. Norton has answered some \n224 written questions, having sat through her 2 days of testimony. I \nfound it rather humorous that, in spite of her willingness to answer \nthe questions presented by the Members--as we all note the good work of \nour staff, and the staff to a large degree repeated many of those \nquestions. Nevertheless, that is how it goes, and we all understand the \nprocedure and the fact that the staff does keep busy supporting us.\n  In any event, I think, to some extent, some of the characterizations \nof this particular nominee are what I object to. I think it is fair to \nsay that it is not a partisan issue. There was a cartoon in New York \nDaily News depicting Norton as a flack for the child poisoning \nindustry. In a parody of our President's campaign promise to leave no \nchild behind, it puts a slogan in her mouth: Leave no child alive. I \ndon't know. But\n\n[[Page S630]]\n\nI think many of us are of the opinion that the environmental groups \nthat support this kind of--well, it is hard for me to describe words of \nthat nature. But I think they have lost somewhat of their credibility \nwith these over-the-top attacks. I think a question of courtesy, a \nquestion of what is decent, and what is over the line has happened \nhere, and I think that is, indeed, unfortunate.\n\n  If I were a member of some of these environmental groups, I would \nwant to know who made the decision to spend thousands and in some cases \nmillions of dollars on advertisements in major newspapers that make \nfalse, inaccurate, inappropriate, and downright discourteous statements \nabout her record.\n  It seems to me, as I have indicated, that when the facts aren't on \nyour side, you attack the person. That is what has happened here.\n  I was listening to the Sunday service at the little church I attend \nthis Sunday. The priest made the comment: They can try to rub out the \nmessenger, but they can't rub out the message.\n  I thought of Gale Norton and her commitment to enforce the law. She \ngave her committee the assurance that she will enforce the law. To some \nextent, some of the criticism seems to cover her position on an issue \nthat involves my State of Alaska, and that is the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. The criticism seems to be that somehow this area is in \njeopardy by the Bush administration. And the experience we have had in \nthe Arctic in drilling for oil and gas associated with Prudhoe Bay \nsomehow has no parallel to the potential opening of this small area of \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Few people consider that the area itself is about 19 million acres--\nabout the size of the State of South Carolina. Even fewer recognize \nwhat has already taken place in that area. But out of that 19 million \nacres, 9 million acres has been set aside by Congress in a refuge in \nperpetuity. That means Congress isn't going to change it; that is it. \nAnd 8\\1/2\\ million acres have been set aside in wilderness in \nperpetuity. But Congress left 1\\1/2\\ million acres, called the 1002 \narea, for a determination to be made at a future date whether it should \nbe explored for oil and gas. The Secretary's position on this is she \nhappens to favor the opening, if it can be done safely and in \ncompatibility with the environment and the ecology. That is the \nposition that is taken by our President, President Bush, and our Vice \nPresident.\n  As a consequence, it should be pointed out that it is not her \ndecision, nor will it be her decision as to whether or not this sliver \nof the Coastal Plain will be open. When I say ``sliver,'' I am \nreferring to specifically the realization that there is only 1\\1/2\\ \nmillion acres in the 1002 area to be considered by Congress, and \nindustry tells us that with their new technology and ice roads and the \nrealization that there is only a short 60 miles of pipe that would have \nto be extended over to the existing infrastructure of the Trans-Alaska \npipeline where the 800-mile pipeline has been for some 27 years, that \nthe impact would be minimal.\n  That doesn't mean there won't be an impact, but it would be minimal. \nBut the footprint is what is significant. It is estimated to be about \n2,000 acres out of the million and half acres which is out of the 19 \nmillion acres. That is the perspective that our friends in the \nenvironmental community fail to recognize. They fail to recognize what \nwe have learned in Prudhoe Bay for 27 years.\n  We have seen the habitat of the central Arctic herd during that \ntimeframe, and those caribou increased dramatically from about 3,000 to \n4,000 to the numbers currently of about 26,000 to 27,000. They are \nprotected. The mild activity associated with that oil field does not \nthreaten either the caribou, their lifestyle, or their reproduction as \nevidenced by the fact that the herd has increased dramatically. To \nsuggest somehow that this same situation can't occur in the 1002 area \nof ANWR flies in the face of realism.\n  But it is appropriate that in the few minutes we have, since this has \ncome up continually in her nomination, that some of the inaccuracies by \nsome of the defenders of wildlife and others who are campaigning on \nthis issue to generate membership and dollars--they are using fear \ntactics, they are using inaccuracies, and they are using \nirresponsibility. One of the statements that was made in the U.S. news \nwire of January 25 entitled ``Defenders of Wildlife Launch Campaign To \nSave The Arctic Refuge'' was ``We know Americans overwhelmingly favor \nprotecting the Arctic range''. Of course. We all do. But they go \nfurther to suggest that the American public, as evidenced by public \nopinion polls, shows that two-thirds of Americans are against opening \nit. That is not related to any degree of accuracy.\n  The recent polling by the Christian Science Monitor on the issue was \nabout 58 in favor of opening it and about 34 favor closing it. The \nChicago Tribune had a poll limited to the Chicago area, which was about \nthe same--about 52 to 53 percent favor. So public opinion, I think, is \nobviously an important factor in determining the eventual outcome. But \nto suggest that public opinion opposes it is simply not true.\n  Further, the statement is made by the U.S. news wire that only the \nremaining 5 percent of Alaska's North Slope is not already open to \ndrilling. That is totally inaccurate, and not based on any fact. \nFactually, 14 percent of the 1,200-mile Coastal Plain is open. If you \ndo not believe it, go to the Department of the Interior and try to get \na lease there. Fourteen percent is open.\n  Further, Madam President, as we look at inaccuracies, we find that we \nare going to have on the web site an innovative computer animation on \nthe issue narrated by an actor to tell the story of the polar bears and \nthe cubs driven from their dens by the oil well on the refuge--the now \npristine Coastal Plain. Of course, there is no oil well on the area. \nThere is one well that has been driven. Further, if they had any degree \nof accuracy, they would recognize that the Coastal Plain is not the \nhome of the polar bear. The polar bears actually den out on the Arctic \nice.\n  Our information shows, scientists, and the State of Alaska, and other \nsources, that approximately 10 to 12 polar bears have been identified \nas denning on that Coastal Plain area of ANWR. They simply don't den \nthere. So it is quite infrequent. Now there are polar bears that come \ninto Point Barrow. There are polar bears that come into the Prudhoe Bay \narea. What they don't say is that the greatest benefactor of the polar \nbear is the non-natives. Non-natives cannot take them for trophy \nhunting. The law says that only the native people can take them for \nsubsistence. If you want a polar bear, where do you go? Go to Canada.\n\n  I might add, some people in the Canadian government are opposed to \nopening this area. It could be because of the competitive posture as a \nsupplier of energy to the United States. They look upon us as a \npotential competitor. That is all right. But the polar bear issue, keep \nit defined where it belongs. In Canada you can go out and shoot one. In \nRussia you can shoot one, but you can't shoot one in Alaska. That has a \nlot to do with the longevity of the polar bear.\n  We have a web site now, an innovative computer animation about the \npolar bear, but it doesn't tell the true story about the polar bear. It \nis going to suggest the polar bear abandon her cubs because of the oil \nactivity. It is simply not true.\n  Further, they say this is opening this area, sticking oil wells right \nsmack in the biological heart of the wildest place left in America. \nThey don't state that there is an Eskimo village there with 220 people \nliving there. There are radar sites. I encourage every Member of the \nSenate who wants to voice an opinion on this to come to Alaska and take \na look for themselves. Many Members have. We are extending an \ninvitation at the end of March and early April to take Members up there \nso they can see for themselves. To suggest it is the biological heart \nof the wildest place left if America, I argue that point.\n  They call it America's Serengeti. That is an understatement. It is an \ninteresting, beautiful, harsh, rugged environment. It is winter 9 \nmonths of the year. It is not a place that is warm, fuzzy and cuddly. \nIt is home of the polar bear, wolves, musk ox, millions of migratory \nbirds, caribou, and hundreds of other species. That is partially true. \nThe one area that Congress set-aside is different. It is not the home \nof\n\n[[Page S631]]\n\nthe wolves or the musk ox and the birds that come through into the \nwilderness and the refuge.\n  They further say there would be immense spills. They go one step \nfurther and suggest the greasy oil slick surrounding the Galapagos is \nsomehow connected to the danger and exposure to this area.\n  It is paramount to recognize the connection between the nominee for \nthe Secretary of the Interior and this particular issue. She will not \nbe making the decision. She will simply be forwarding the facts to the \nCongress and to the administration surrounding whether or not it can be \nopened safely.\n  I implore those following this debate to recognize one significant \nissue that concerns California today. If one will look at what has \nhappened to California as a consequence of a decision made some time \nago to depend on outside energy sources, outside the State of \nCalifornia, for their gas and for their electricity, and the \nconsequences of what has happened. Twenty- five percent of the energy \nof California comes outside that State. There hasn't been one new \ngenerating plant built there of any consequence in the last decade. \nCalifornia environmentalists made decisions and those decisions have \ncome back today. Those California environmentalists have to bear the \nresponsibility for those decisions. They are pretty hard to find right \nnow. You don't see them around saying, maybe we did make a mistake, \nmaybe we should have encouraged an energy supply within the State of \nCalifornia. They were very instrumental in saying we will buy the \nenergy from Washington State, we will buy it from British Columbia \nwhere they have a lot of hydropower. We won't develop it within our \nState.\n\n  They are paying the price now. Their two major utilities are in \nbankruptcy. A bankruptcy judge may come in and say, all right, \nCalifornia consumer, this is what it will cost you for your energy. I \nam not prepared to go into this at this time but the Energy and Natural \nResource Committee will be holding a hearing Wednesday and go into this \nmatter at length.\n  I draw the parallel. We know what happened in California today by \ndepending on outside energy sources. The parallel is, this Nation \ntoday, the United States of America, is 56 percent dependent on \nimported oil. Where is it coming from? It is coming from Saudi Arabia, \nit is coming from Mexico, it is coming from Venezuela. Where else is it \ncoming from? It is coming from Iraq, our old friend Saddam Hussein. We \nare importing 750,000 barrels a day of oil from Iraq. We fought a war \nover there in 1992. We lost 147 American lives. We had over 400 \nwounded. How quickly we forget.\n  What is Saddam Hussein doing? We know he is developing a missile \ncapability. We know he is developing a biological capability. Who is it \naimed at in the Middle East? Israel. Iraq is the greatest threat to the \npeace process in the Middle East--Saddam Hussein. What are we doing \nabout it? We are turning around and buying more oil, importing it to \nthe extent that we are 56 percent dependent today. The Department of \nEnergy suggests by the year 2004 we will be 64 percent dependent.\n  The parallel is there. California and their dependence on outside \nsources for their energy and the United States today dependent 56 \npercent on oil.\n  The energy bill we are proposing, we are committed to reduce our \ndependence to less than 50 percent by initiating exploration in the \ncontinental United States in the overthrust belt, Wyoming, Montana, New \nMexico, Montana, and my State of Alaska, and part of that involves \nopening up the small area of the coastal plain, using science and \ntechnology, the winter roads, the icy roads, and the expense we have \nhad for 30 years where there has never been a proven exposure to the \ncaribou associated with exploration for oil and gas.\n  So, let's remember this parallel. You depend on outsiders, you lose \nyour leverage, and you pay the price. It happened in California. It can \nhappen today. As far as I'm concerned, it is happening.\n  Whether we want to reduce that risk associated with this issue which \nhas become a part of the deliberation of Gale Norton is up to us. I \nthink it is fair to say we can probably terminate the debate on the \nnomination.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today \nin supporting the president's nomination of Mrs. Gale Norton to be the \nnext Secretary of the Department of the Interior.\n  As the ranking minority member on the appropriations subcommittee \nwhich provides funding for the Interior department, I have a particular \ninterest in this Cabinet position. I know that effectively managing \nthis department--an organization of 69,000 employees and an $8.4 \nbillion budget--is not an easy task. The Interior Secretary is charged \nwith overseeing the 379 parks of the National Park System, the 521 \nrefuges and the 66 national fish hatcheries of the Fish and Wildlife \nService, the 264 million acres of land managed by the Bureau of Land \nManagement, and serving the needs of 1.4 million American Indians. \nClearly, with a portfolio that broad, it is easy to see that the \nprograms under the jurisdiction of the Secretary have a direct impact \non every state in the union and nearly every American citizen.\n  I am aware of the controversy that has surrounded this nomination. I \nknow that there are those who do not see Mrs. Norton as an ally. There \nhave been many accusations made concerning the nominee's public policy \npositions, and she has been, in my opinion, unfairly derided as a \nresult of certain past working relationships. Despite this, I remain \nconfident that, as Secretary, Gale Norton will be responsive to the \nconcerns of the American people, particularly those concerns expressed \nby the Congress.\n  I have personally talked with Mrs. Norton, and while I will not say \nthat we had an in-depth discussion of all the issues which come before \nthe Interior Department, I can say that, with respect to those subject \nmatters we did discuss, I found Gale Norton to be well informed. More \nimportantly, I found her willing to consider various points of view. \nObviously, Senators cannot expect a Cabinet Secretary to agree with us \non all things at all times. But what we should expect is to have an \nopportunity to present our views, or present the case of those we \nrepresent, and to have those views heard in a fair and unbiased manner. \nI believe Mrs. Norton will deliver quite well on that expectation.\n  Madam President, I wish Gale Norton well as she embarks on a \ndifficult assignment, and she will work with the Congress to ensure \nthat we fulfill our land management and trust responsibilities to the \nAmerican people in a fair, economical, and efficient manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/29/senate-section/article/S631-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Madam President, I supported the nomination of Senator \nSpencer Abraham as the next Secretary of Energy, and I look forward to \nworking with him in his new position. While I know that Senator Abraham \nwill be facing a host of new issues at the Department of Energy, I \nwelcome his appointment.\n  I believe that Senator Abraham has a commitment to address the many \ncomplicated, intertwining energy, environmental, and economic questions \nthat he will be faced with on a daily basis as Energy Secretary. In \nrecent years, the Department of Energy has been rocked by high profile \nscandals and security breaches and criticism for failing to address \ncompounding energy policy problems. The Department of Energy has \nlongstanding internal problems regarding agency morale, a complicated \nsystem of laboratories, the cleanup of DOE's nuclear complex, and \ncompetition between fuel and industry interests. Secretary Abraham will \nhave a defining role in determining the needs and priorities for our \nnational security, energy policy, science and technology, and \nenvironmental management.\n  First and foremost, he will need to work with Congress in the \ndevelopment of a balanced, comprehensive national energy policy. If our \nultimate national\n\n[[Page S632]]\n\ninterests are ever to be achieved, we must address the overarching \nconcerns witnessed by the current price hikes in gasoline, home heating \noil, electricity, and natural gas. Though I am certain that, in time, \nthese crises will pass as most crises do, I fear that, as a nation, we \nwill sink back into energy somnolence. The alarm bells are ringing \nloudly today, and it is time to wake up and address our need for a \nserious comprehensive national energy strategy. At the same time, a \ncomprehensive energy strategy must also incorporate a strong \nenvironmental policy and economic incentives to benefit our nation as a \nwhole.\n  The new Energy Secretary agreed with me that coal is integral to any \nnational energy strategy. When I met with him, we discussed Clean Coal \nTechnologies and other research that can utilize many of our domestic \nenergy resources in economically and environmentally sound ways. Since \n1985, when I established the Clean Coal Technology initiative with a \nCongressional authorization of $750 million, more than $2.4 billion has \nbeen invested in this successful program. Secretary Abraham voiced \nAdministration support for these efforts. By utilizing our nation's \nknowledge and resources, we can meet our energy demands while also \nimproving the environment.\n  Additionally, I urged the new Energy Secretary to find ways to \naddress the global climate change challenge. I hope he will continue to \nsupport longstanding initiatives that can address climate change as \nwell as find more ways to deploy our advanced technologies in the \nmarket, both domestically and internationally. These new technologies \nand ideas have been paid for by the American people, tested in our \nlaboratories, and demonstrated with the support and assistance of the \nprivate sector, and must be deployed if the global community is ever \ngoing to seriously tackle the problem of global climate change.\n  In the coming months, there certainly will be debate over how best to \nprotect the environment, without risking the economic security of our \nown country. Adopting a commonsense national energy policy that takes \nadvantage of our advanced technologies, while also utilizing our vast \nenergy resources, can be a win-win situation for the environment and \nthe economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/29/senate-section/article/S632-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   COMMENDING THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS ATHLETES, COACHES, AND SUPPORTERS\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

A bill to authorize funding for Advanced Scientific Research \nComputing Programs at the Department of Energy for fiscal years 2002 \nthrough 2006, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nauthorizing the Secretary of Energy to provide for the Office of \nScience to develop a robust scientific computing infrastructure to \nsolve a number of grand challenges in scientific computing. This bi-\npartisan bill, which is referred to as the ``Department of Energy \nAdvanced Scientific Computing Act'' is co-sponsored by Senators Craig, \nSchumer, and Murray. Before discussing this program in detail, let me \nbriefly frame the proposed effort. First, I will outline the tremendous \nadvances made in the last decade for scientific computing. Second, I \nwill give a few examples of the ``grand challenges'' in scientific \ncomputing. Third, I will discuss how the proposed program at the Office \nof Science will give our nation's scientists the tools to meet these \ngrand challenges. I will conclude by demonstrating how this program \nintegrates with defense related computing programs at the DOE and \nacross the interagency.\n  Experts agree that scientific computing R is at a critical \njuncture. If the breakthroughs proceed as predicted, the information \nage could affect our everyday lives far beyond what we nonexperts \ncurrently grasp. It is terribly important that we, as a nation, ensure \nthat the U.S. maintains a leadership role in scientific computing R \nIf we fall beyond in this rapidly changing field, our nation could lose \nits ability to control the national security, economic and social \nconsequences from these new information technologies.\n  What are the possible breakthroughs in scientific computing that \nmerit such strong programmatic attention? Within the next five years we \nexpect that advanced scientific computing machines will achieve peak \nperformance speeds of 100 teraflops or 100 trillion\n\n[[Page S637]]\n\narithmetic operations per second; that is 100 times faster than today's \nmost advanced civilian computers. To put things in perspective, the \nfastest Pentium III available today can perform about 2 gigaflops (2 \nbillion operations per second), so a 100 teraflops machine is about \n50,000 times faster than today's fastest Pentium III. We call this new \nwave of computing ``terascale computing''. This new level of computing \nwill allow scientists and engineers to explore problems at a level of \naccuracy and detail that was unimaginable ten years ago. I will discuss \nthe scientific and engineering opportunities in more detail later. \nFirst, let me discuss some of the challenges in terascale computing.\n  The major advance that led to terascale computing is the use of \nhighly parallel computer architectures. Parallel computers send out \nmathematical instructions to thousands of processors at once rather \nthan waiting for each instruction to be sequentially completed on a \nsingle processor. The problem we face in moving to terascale computers \nis writing the computer software that utilizes their full performance \ncapabilities. When we say ``peak'' speeds we mean the ability to use \nthe full capability of the computer. This happens very rarely in \nparallel computers. For example, in 1990 on state-of-the-art Cray \nsupercomputers with about eight processors, we could obtain, on the \naverage, about 40-50 percent of the computer's ``peak'' speed. Today, \nwith massively parallel machines using thousands of processors, we \noften obtain only 5-10 percent of the machine's ``peak'' speed. The \nissue is how to tailor our traditional scientific codes to run \nefficiently on these terascale parallel computers. This is the foremost \nchallenge that must be overcome to realize the full potential of \nterascale computing.\n\n  Another problem we face as we move to terascale computing is the \namount of data we generate. Consider the following. Your PC, if it is \none of the latest models, has a hard drive that will hold about 10 \ngigabytes of data. If we successfully begin to implement terascale \ncomputing, we will be generating ``petabytes'' of data for each \ncalculation. A petabyte of data is one million gigabytes or the \nequivalent of 100,000 hard drives like the one on your PC. A teraflop \nmachine user will make many runs on these machines. But raw data isn't \nknowledge. To turn data into knowledge, we must be able to analyze it--\nto determine what it is telling us about the phenomena that we are \nstudying. None of the data management methods that we have today can \nhandle petabytes data sets. This is the second challenge that must be \novercome.\n  And, many more challenges exist.\n  To make effective use of today's and the future's computing \ncapability we need to establish a scientific program that is radically \ndifferent from what researchers are used to today. Future scientific \ncomputing initiatives must be broad multi-disciplinary efforts. \nTomorrow's scientific computing effort will employ not only the \nphysicist who wishes to probe the minute details of solid matter in \norder to say, built a better magnet, it will include a computer \nscientist to help ensure that the physicist's software makes efficient \nuse of the terascale computer. Terascale computing will also require \nmathematicians to develop specialized routines to adapt the solution of \nthe physicist's mathematical equations to these parallel architectures. \nFinally, terascale computers will require specialists in data \nnetworking and visualization who understand how to manage and analyze \nthe massive amounts of data.\n  I note these problems to highlight the complexities of tomorrow's \nscientific computing environment from the common information \ntechnologies that we employ today. However, because computing \ntechnology moves at such a rapid rate, elements of the issues that I \nhave described will surely impact us in the near future. Given the \nimpact information technologies have had only in ten years, it is \nimportant that we, as a nation, lead the initiative in these \nbreakthroughs so that we can positively control the impact that the \nthese revolutionary technologies will have on our economy and the \nsocial fabric of our Nation.\n  What are the important problems that we expect terascale computing to \naddress? We call these problems ``Grand Challenges''. Terascle \ncomputing will enable climate researchers to predict with greater \ncertainty how our planet's climate will change in the future, allowing \nus to develop the best possible strategies and policy for addressing \nclimate change. Terascale computing will help chemists understand the \nchemical processes involved in combustion, which will translate into \nmore efficient, less polluting engines. Terascale computing will allow \nmaterial scientists to design nanomaterials atom by atom, which will \nlead to stronger, yet lighter and hence more energy efficient \nmaterials. Terascale computing will assist nanoscience researchers by \nsimulating atom manipulation before undertaking complex and expensive \nexperiments. Nanotechnology will lead to whole new generations of \ncomputer chips, information systems, and stronger, yet lighter \nmaterials. Finally, terascale computing will enable biologists to \nunderstand the structure of the proteins encoded in the human genome, \nwhich will lead to better medicines and health for our citizens. These \nfundamental grand challenge problems are now addressable with the \nrecent advances in scientific computing. Due to the impact the grand \nchallenge problems will have on our lives, we as a nation, must take \nthe lead in their investigation.\n  What are the elements of the proposed effort? The program I propose \nwill build on the Department of Energy's decades of leadership in high \nperformance computing and networks to ensure that terascale computing \nand petabyte data visualization becomes a positive force for the U.S. \nThe proposed program has four parts. The first part is the \nestablishment of core teams of researchers who specialize in the grand \nchallenge problem itself. An example of a core team is one made up of \ngeologists and geochemists allied with computer scientists and applied \nmathematicians to write large software programs associated with oil \nexploration or the diffusion of waste in the subsurface. The scientific \nsimulation software created by these core teams will be the ``engines'' \nthat drive the scientific discovery process. The second element of the \nprogram enhances the research efforts in computer science and \ncomputational mathematics that underlie this software development \neffort. These specialists will ensure that the core teams effectively \nuse massively parallel computers--not at the current 5-10 percent but \nat 50 percent of the computer's peak running speed. These specialists \nwill also develop the software to manage and visualize the petabytes of \ndata that the core teams, as well as the next generation of \nexperimental facilities, generate. Third, this program will fund \nspecialists to develop the networking and electronic collaboration \nsoftware that will allow researchers all across the U.S.--in national \nlaboratories, universities, and industry to routinely use petabyte data \nsets. This new networking capability will translate quickly to the \nprivate sector in the areas of medicine, business transactions, and \neducation over the internet. Fourth, this program will fund the unique \ncomputer hardware required for scientific investigations of the ``Grand \nChallenges'' on a continuing basis. Many of the grand challenge \nproblems will benefit from specialized computers. This program will \nfund such specialized computers. For instance, IBM will build in the \nyear 2004 or 2005 a unique 1000 teraflops (1000 trillion operations per \nsecond) computer called ``Blue Gene''. Blue Gene will be 500,000 times \nfaster than your desk PC. This machine will be used by DNA researchers \nto predict the structure of proteins and in doing so allow drugs and \nmedicines to be optimized before they are commercially produced. We \npropose to place these one-of-a-kind computers at national user \nfacilities and make them available to U.S. researchers in national and \ngovernment laboratories, universities, and industry.\n\n  In summary, we are proposing a program that will substantially \nadvance our understanding of complex scientific phenomena that affect \nour daily lives. At the present we cannot fully understand these \nphenomena; it is critical that we master it in our national interest so \nto benefit our nation and its people.\n\n[[Page S638]]\n\n  Overall, this program will integrate into other DOE advanced \ncomputing efforts and into our national strategy for advanced \nscientific computing. In FY01, the DOE National Nuclear Security \nAgency, NNSA, funded the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative or \nASCI at $477 million dollars. ASCI's mission--to develop the capability \nto simulate the safety and surety of the nuclear weapons in our \nstockpile--is critical to the security of our nation. The ASCI program \nis a focused and classified program with one primary user--the nuclear \nweapons community. Its problems revolve around materials and plasmas \nundergoing rapid changes from a nuclear explosion. The Advanced \nScientific Computing Program I am proposing is unclassified and covers \nmany other areas of science critical to the long term well being of the \nnation. This program will involve interaction between researchers at \nthe nation's national and federal laboratories, universities, and \nindustry. That is not to say that there will be no integration between \nthese two worthy and important efforts. Both efforts involve terascale \ncomputers, so clearly we expect that many of the central tools common \nto both in terms of hardware design and underlying software for \nnetworks and visualization will be shared. Both programs will benefit \nby the two diverse communities working towards the common goal of \nterascale computing. And, the NNSA will be able to infuse fresh ideas \nfrom the universities and industry on parallel architectures and data \nvisualization into their efforts in ensuring the surety of our nation's \nnuclear weapons stockpile.\n  Within the U.S. Government, this effort will fall under the purview \nof the National Coordinating Office for Computing, Information and \nCommunications, ``NCO/CIC''. This Office is charged with coordinating \ngovernment-sponsored information technology research programs across \nall of the government agencies. The NCO/CIC provides a forum for DOE to \ncoordinate its scientific computing program with information technology \nprograms in NSF, DOD, NASA, NIH, NOAA, and other government agencies \ninterested in high-performance computing. Although the DOE program is \nfocused on its energy, environmental, and scientific missions, many \nbenefits will be derived by coordinating its activities with related \ncomputing activities in other agencies. Finally, I note that in our \nnational implementation plan for ``Information for the Twenty First \nCentury'', the NSF and the DOE were given the leadership for ``Advanced \nScientific Computing for Science, Engineering and the Nation''. The \nprogram I have outlined supports that role.\n  In summary, I have outlined a scientific computing program that will \nadvance our ability to understand complex but important physical, \nchemical, and biological phenomena. Advancing our understanding of \nglobal climate change will lead to a better understanding on the \nrelationship between our energy consumption and the climate on our \nplanet. Mastering materials and chemical processes at an atomic level \nwill enhance U.S. industrial competitiveness in many areas such as \nenergy efficient materials manufacturing and develop new computer chip \ntechnologies. Understanding the flow of contaminants in the groundwater \nwill help develop better strategies for cleaning up DOE's sites and \nhelp commercial oil and gas extraction. Predicting the structure of \nproteins will lead to more effective drugs with minimal side effects. \nBeyond solution of the ``Grand Challenges'' are the advancements that \nwill be made in advanced computing and networking technologies which \nwill benefit users in areas as diverse as medicine and business. These \nproblems are of national significance to the health of our citizens and \nour future economy in the 21st century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 194. A bill to authorize funding for successful reentry of \ncriminal offenders into local communities; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the \n``Offender Reentry and Community Safety Act of 2001,'' a bill I first \nintroduced last July. The bill is also a part of S. 16, the Democrat's \nomnibus crime legislation.\n  Too often we have short-term solutions for long-term problems. All \ntoo often we think about today, but not tomorrow. It's time that we \nstart looking forward. It's time that we face the dire situation of \nprisoners re-entering our communities with insufficient monitoring, \nlittle or no job skills, inadequate drug treatment, insufficient \nhousing and deficient basic life skills.\n  According to the Department of Justice, 1.25 million offenders are \nnow living in prisons and another 600,000 offenders are incarcerated in \nlocal jails. A record number of those inmates--approximately 585,400 \nwill return to communities this year. Historically, two-thirds of \nreturning prisoners have been rearrested for new crimes within three \nyears.\n  The safety threat posed by this volume of prisoner returns has been \nexacerbated by the fact that states and communities can't possibly \nproperly supervise all their returning offenders, parole systems have \nbeen abolished in thirteen states and policy shifts toward more \ndeterminate sentencing have reduced the courts' authority to impose \nsupervisory conditions on offenders returning to their communities.\n  State systems have also reduced the numbers of transitional support \nprograms aimed at facilitating the return to productive community life \nstyles. Recent studies indicate that many returning prisoners receive \nno help in finding employment upon release and most offenders have low \nliteracy and other basic educational skills that can impede successful \nreentry.\n  At least 55 percent of offenders are fathers of minor children, and \ntherefore face a number of issues related to child support and other \nfamily responsibilities during incarceration and after release. \nSubstance abuse and mental health problems also add to concerns over \ncommunity safety. Approximately 70 percent of state prisoners and 57 \npercent of federal prisoners have a history of drug use or abuse. \nResearch by the Department of Justice indicates that between 60 and 75 \npercent of inmates with heroin or cocaine problems return to drugs \nwithin three months when untreated. An estimated 187,000 state and \nfederal prison inmates have self-reported mental health problems. \nMentally ill inmates are more likely than other offenders to have \ncommitted a violent offense and be violent recidivists. Few states \nconnect mental health treatment in prisons with treatment in the return \ncommunity. Finally, offenders with contagious diseases such as HIV/AIDS \nand tuberculosis are released with no viable plan to continue their \nmedical treatment so they present a significant danger to public \nhealth. And while the federal prison population and reentry system \ndiffers from the state prison population and reentry systems, there are \nnonetheless significant reentry challenges at the federal level.\n  We need to start thinking about what to do with these people. We need \nto start thinking in terms of helping these people make a transition to \nthe community so that they don't go back to a life of crime and can be \nproductive members of our society. We need to start thinking about the \nlong-term impact of what we do after we send people to jail.\n  My legislation creates demonstration reentry programs for federal, \nstate and local prisoners. The programs are designed to assist high-\nrisk, high-need offenders who have served their prison sentences, but \nwho pose the greatest risk of reoffending upon release because they \nlack the education, job skills, stable family or living arrangements, \nand the substance abuse treatment and other mental and medical health \nservices they need to successfully reintegrate into society.\n  Innovative strategies and emerging technologies present new \nopportunities to improve reentry systems. This legislation creates \nfederal and state demonstration projects that utilize these strategies \nand technologies. The projects share many core components, including a \nmore seamless reentry system, reentry officials who are more directly \ninvolved with the offender and who can swiftly impose intermediate \nsanctions if the offender does not follow the designated reentry plan, \nand the combination of enhanced service delivery and enhanced \nmonitoring. The different projects are targeted at different prisoner \npopulations and each has some unique features. The promise of the \nlegislation is to establish the demonstration projects and then to \nrigorously evaluate them to determine\n\n[[Page S639]]\n\nwhich measures and strategies most successfully reintegrate prisoners \ninto the community as well as which measures and strategies can be \npromoted nationally to address the growing national problem of released \nprisoners.\n  There are currently 17 unfunded state pilot projects, including one \nin Delaware, which are being supported with technical assistance by the \nDepartment of Justice. My legislation will fund these pilot projects \nand will encourages states, territories, and Indian tribes to partner \nwith units of local government and other non-profit organizations to \nestablish adult offender reentry demonstration projects. The grants may \nbe expended for implementing graduated sanctions and incentives, \nmonitoring released prisoners, and providing, as appropriate, drug and \nalcohol abuse testing and treatment, mental and medical health \nservices, victim impact educational classes, employment training, \nconflict resolution skills training, and other social services. My \nlegislation also encourages state agencies, municipalities, public \nagencies, nonprofit organizations and tribes to make agreements with \ncourts to establish ``reentry courts'' to monitor returning offenders, \nestablish graduated sanctions and incentives, test and treat returning \noffenders for drug and alcohol abuse, and provide reentering offenders \nwith mental and medical health services, victim impact educational \nclasses, employment training, conflict resolution skills training, and \nother social services.\n\n  This legislation also re-authorizes the drug court program created by \nCongress in the 1994 Crime Law as a cost-effective, innovative way to \ndeal with non-violent offenders in need of drug treatment. This is the \nsame language as the ``Drug Court Re-authorization and Improvement \nAct'' that I introduced with Senator Specter last Congress.\n  Rather than just churning people through the revolving door of the \ncriminal justice system, drug courts help these folks to get their acts \ntogether so they won't be back. When they graduate from drug court \nprograms they are clean and sober and more prepared to participate in \nsociety. In order to graduate, they are required to finish high school \nor obtain a GED, hold down a job, and keep up with financial \nobligations including drug court fees and child support payments. They \nare also required to have a sponsor who will keep them on track.\n  This program works. And that is not just my opinion. Columbia \nUniversity's National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) \nfound that these courts are effective at taking offenders with little \nprevious treatment history and keeping them in treatment; that they \nprovide closer supervision than other community programs to which the \noffenders could be assigned; that they reduce crime; and that they are \ncost-effective.\n  According to the Department of Justice, drug courts save at least \n$5,000 per offender each year in prison costs alone. That says nothing \nof the cost savings associated with future crime prevention. Just as \nimportant, scarce prison beds are freed up for violent criminals.\n  I have saved what may be the most important statistic for last. Two-\nthirds of drug court participants are parents of young children. After \ngetting sober through the coerced treatment mandated by the court, many \nof these individuals are able to be real parents again. More than 500 \ndrug-free babies have been born to female drug court participants, a \nsizable victory for society and the budget alike.\n  This bill re-authorizes programs to provide for drug treatment in \nstate and federal prisons. According to CASA, 80 percent of the men and \nwomen behind bars in the United States today are there because of \nalcohol or drugs. They were either drunk or high when they committed \ntheir crime, broke an alcohol or drug law, stole to support their \nhabit, or have a history of drug or alcohol abuse. The need for drug \nand alcohol treatment in our nations prisons and jails is clear.\n  Providing treatment to criminal offenders is not ``soft.'' It is a \nsmart crime prevention policy. If we do not treat addicted offenders \nbefore they are released, they will be turned back onto our streets \nwith the same addiction problem that got them in trouble in the first \nplace and they will re-offend. Inmates who are addicted to drugs and \nalcohol are more likely to be incarcerated repeatedly than those \nwithout a substance abuse problem. This is not my opinion, it is fact. \nAccording to CASA, 81 percent of inmates with five or more prior \nconvictions have been habitual drug users compared to 41 percent of \nfirst-time offenders. Re-authorizing prison-based treatment programs is \na good investment and is an important crime prevention initiative.\n  This legislation is just a first step--but a necessary one. Someday, \nwe will look back and wonder why we didn't think of this sooner. For \nnow, we need to implement these pilot projects, help people make it in \ntheir communities and make our streets safer at the same time. I am \ncertain that in the end we will revel in the results.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 194\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Offender Reentry and \n     Community Safety Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) There are now nearly 1,900,000 individuals in our \n     country's prisons and jails, including over 140,000 \n     individuals under the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of \n     Prisons.\n       (2) Enforcement of offender violations of conditions of \n     releases has sharply increased the number of offenders who \n     return to prison--while revocations comprised 17 percent of \n     State prison admissions in 1980, they rose to 36 percent in \n     1998.\n       (3) Although prisoners generally are serving longer \n     sentences than they did a decade ago, most eventually reenter \n     communities; for example, in 1999, approximately 538,000 \n     State prisoners and over 50,000 Federal prisoners a record \n     number were returned to American communities. Approximately \n     100,000 State offenders return to communities and received no \n     supervision whatsoever.\n       (4) Historically, two-thirds of returning State prisoners \n     have been rearrested for new crimes within 3 years, so these \n     individuals pose a significant public safety risk and a \n     continuing financial burden to society.\n       (5) A key element to effective post-incarceration \n     supervision is an immediate, predetermined, and appropriate \n     response to violations of the conditions of supervision.\n       (6) An estimated 187,000 State and Federal prison inmates \n     have been diagnosed with mental health problems; about 70 \n     percent of State prisoners and 57 percent of Federal \n     prisoners have a history of drug use or abuse; and nearly 75 \n     percent of released offenders with heroin or cocaine problems \n     return to using drugs within 3 months if untreated; however, \n     few States link prison mental health treatment programs with \n     those in the return community.\n       (7) Between 1987 and 1997, the volume of juvenile \n     adjudicated cases resulting in court-ordered residential \n     placements rose 56 percent. In 1997 alone, there were a total \n     of 163,200 juvenile court-ordered residential placements. The \n     steady increase of youth exiting residential placement has \n     strained the juvenile justice aftercare system, however, \n     without adequate supervision and services, youth are likely \n     to relapse, recidivate, and return to confinement at the \n     public's expense.\n       (8) Emerging technologies and multidisciplinary community-\n     based strategies present new opportunities to alleviate the \n     public safety risk posed by released prisoners while helping \n     offenders to reenter their communities successfully.\n\n      SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Act of 1965 to \nestablish programs to recruit, retain, and retrain teachers, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today I am introducing the A Million \nQuality Teachers Act.\n  Thomas Jefferson once observed that of all the bills in the federal \ncode, ``by far the most important is that for the diffusion of \nknowledge among the people. ``No surer foundation,'' he said, ``can be \ndevised for the preservation of freedom and happiness.'' President Bush \nhas reminded us of the importance of education as well. In his \nInauguration Speech, he urged all of us to work together to rebuild our \nnation's education system: ``Together we will reclaim America's \nschools, before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives.''\n  As President Bush himself noted in that same speech, ``While many of \nour citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the justice, of \nour own country. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing \nschools, and hidden prejudice, and the circumstances of their birth.'' \nOur current foundation of elementary and secondary education is grossly \ninadequate to enable American children of all income levels and \nbackgrounds to best realize the ``American dream'' and the economic \nfreedoms that the ``American dream'' encapsulates.\n  Most companies dismiss the value of a high school diploma. Twelfth \ngrade students in the United States rank near the very bottom on \ninternational comparisons in math and science. The Third International \nMath and Science Study, the most comprehensive and rigorous comparison \nof quantitative skills across nations, reveals that the longer our \nstudents stay in the elementary and public school system, the worse \nthey perform on standardized tests.\n  High school graduates are twice as likely to be unemployed as college \ngraduates (3.9% vs. 1.9%). Moreover, the value of a college degree over \na high school degree is rising. In 1970, a college graduate made 136% \nmore than a high school graduate. Today it is 176%. Even more ominous \nare labor participation rates for high school graduates in an \ninformation economy. While labor force participation for adults is at \nan all time high in the American economy, this boom has masked a 10% \ndecline in participation rates for high school graduates since 1970 \nfrom 96.3% to 86.4%.\n  Our children cannot afford to be illiterate in mathematics and \nscience. The rapidly changing technology revolution demands skills and \nproficiency in mathematics, science, and technology. IT, perhaps the \nfastest growing sector of our economy, relies on more than basic high \nschool literacy in mathematics and science.\n  We have all heard about the impending teacher shortage. The \nDepartment of Education estimates that we will need over 2.2 million \nnew teachers in the next decade to meet enrollment increases and to \noffset the large number of baby boomer teachers who will soon be \nretiring. Additionally, although America has many high-quality teachers \nalready, we do not have enough, and with the impending retirement of \nthe baby boomer generation of teachers, we will need even more.\n  Many want to continue to devote significant resources to reducing \nclass size, and the concept to hire more teachers isn't a bad idea. \nStudies have shown that smaller class size may improve learning under \ncertain circumstances. But class size is only a small piece in the \nbigger puzzle to improve America's education system, not the catapult \nthat will launch us into education prosperity.\n  Unfortunately, there are too many teachers in America today who lack \nproper preparation in the subjects that they teach. My own state of \nTennessee actually does a good job of ensuring that teachers have at \nleast a major or minor in the subject that they teach--well enough to \nreceive a grade of A in that category on the recent Thomas Fordham \nFoundation report on teacher quality in the states. Even in Tennessee, \nhowever, 64.5% of teachers teaching physical science do not even have a \nminor in the subject. Among history teachers, nearly 50% did not major \nor minor in history. Many other states do worse.\n  Additionally, there is consensus that we are not attracting enough of \nthe best and the brightest to teaching, and not retaining enough of the \nbest of those that we attract. According to Harvard economist Richard \nMurnane, ``College graduates with high test scores are less likely to \nbecome teachers, licensed teachers with high test scores are less \nlikely to take jobs, employed teachers with high test scores are less \nlikely to stay, and former teachers with high test scores are less \nlikely to return.''\n  A Million Quality Teachers seeks to change that by recruiting, and \nhelping states recruit into the teaching profession top-quality \nstudents who have majored in academic subjects. We want teachers \nteaching math who have majored in and who love math. We want teachers \nteaching science who have majored in and who love science. This bill \nhelps draw those students into teaching for a few years at the very \nleast, and studies have shown that new teachers are most effective in \nthe first couple of years of teaching. This bill would attract new \nstudents, and different kinds of students, into teaching by offering \nsignificant loan repayment.\n  While teachers are one of our nation's most critical professions, it \nis often very difficult to attract highly skilled and marketable \ncollege students and graduates because of a profound lack of \ncompetitive salaries and the burden of student loans. In addition to \nthe loan forgiveness and alternative certification stipends, the \nlegislation will allow states to use up to $1.3 billion originally \ndesignated in a lump sum to hire more teachers to instead allow the \nstates to use that money more creatively in programs to attract the \nkind of quality teachers they need but cannot afford. Using innovative \ntools already tested by many states, such as signing bonuses, loan \nforgiveness, payment of certification costs, and income tax credits, \nstates will be able to once again make teaching an attractive and \ncompetitive career for our brightest college graduates. Additionally, \nthe legislation does not limit states to these tools, but allows them \nto receive grants to continue testing other innovative and new programs \nfor the same purposes.\n  There are two parts to the bill. Part I is a competitive grant \nprogram for States to enable them to run their own innovative quality \nteacher recruitment, retention and retraining programs. Part II is a \nloan forgiveness and alternative certification scholarship program to \nentice individuals with strong academic backgrounds into teaching.\n\n  The State grant program will help States focus on recruitment, \nretention and retraining in the way that best serves the individual \nState. Some states may decide to offer a teacher\n\n[[Page S644]]\n\nsigning bonus program like the widely publicized and very successful \nprogram in Massachusetts. Other states may choose to institute teacher \ntesting and merit pay, or to award performance bonuses to outstanding \nteachers. The program is very flexible, yet the State must be \naccountable for improving the quality of teachers in that State.\n  States who participate must submit a plan for how they intend to use \nfunds under the program and how they expect teacher quality to increase \nas a result, including the expected increase in the number of teachers \nwho majored in the academic subject in which they teach, and the number \nof teachers who received alternative certification, if the funds are \nused for recruitment activities. If the funds are used for retention or \nretraining, the State must focus on how the program will decrease \nteacher attrition and increase the effectiveness of existing teachers.\n  States must also report at the end of the three-year grant on how the \nprogram increased teacher quality and increased the number of teachers \nwith academic majors in the subjects in which they teach and the number \nof teachers that received alternative certification and/or how the \nprogram decreased teacher attrition and increased the effectiveness of \nexisting teachers.\n  The loan forgiveness provision is different than loan forgiveness \nalready in current law in that it targets a different population: \nstudents in college or graduate school today who are excelling in an \nacademic subject. The purpose is to attract students into teaching who \nmight not otherwise choose to pursue a teaching career and who are \nmajoring in an academic subject.\n  Any eligible student may take advantage of the loan forgiveness and \ndeferral. An eligible student has majored in a core academic subject \nwith at least a 3.0 GPA and has not been a full-time teacher \npreviously. Loan payments are deferred for as long as the student is \nobtaining alternative certification or teaching in a public school.\n  The premise of the bill is that teaching is, or will soon be, like \nother professions where there is at least some degree of transience. In \nfact, recent studies show that most new teachers leave within four \nyears. But these studies also show that new teachers are most effective \nin the first few years of teaching. This bill would attract new \nstudents, and different kinds of students, into teaching by offering \nsignificant loan repayment.\n  Alternative certification stipends will provide a seamless transition \nfor a student from school into teaching. The bill provides stipends to \nstudents who have received their academic degrees from a college or \nuniversity in order to obtain certification through alternative means. \nStudents who have received assistance under the loan forgiveness \nsection get first priority, but any student who has received a \nbachelors or advanced degree in a core academic subject with a GPA of \nat least 3.0 and who has never taught full-time in a public school is \neligible. Students would receive the lesser of $5,000 or the costs of \nthe alternative certification program, in exchange for agreeing to \nteach in a public school for 2 years.\n  The job of every new generation is to meet civilization's new \nproblems, improve its new opportunities, and explore its ever-expanding \nhorizons, creating dreams not just for themselves, but for all who come \nafter. Our job--the job of the current generation--is to help them do \njust that. Learning is the future. Education is the key. We must embark \nupon a national effort to bring it up to a standard demanded by the \nchallenge, and improving teacher quality is the first step. I hope that \nmy colleagues will concur.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 196. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na refundable personal credit for energy conservation expenditures, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Energy \nConservation Tax Credit Act. As the electricity crisis in California \ncontinues, the entire nation needs to conserve electricity and improve \nenergy efficiency. No solution to the energy problem is complete \nwithout addressing the need to improve the demand side of the equation.\n  The Energy Conservation Tax Credit Act would encourage efforts at \nenergy conservation through a refundable tax credit, grants to schools \nto retrofit buildings, and increased information to consumers on their \nuse of electricity.\n  The legislation would provide individuals with a refundable tax \ncredit for the cost of energy conservation measures, such as ceiling \ninsulation, weather stripping, water heater insulation blankets, low-\nflow showerheads, thermal doors and windows, clock thermostats, and \nexternal shading devices. The provisions eligible for the tax credit \nare passed on what was included in the California tax code from 1981 to \n1986. The bill also includes a provision allowing this list to be \nexpanded for other devices that the Secretary of Energy determines to \nbe effective in conserving energy.\n  The bill would also provide grants to school districts to retrofit \npublic school buildings to increase energy efficiency and conservation. \nMany school buildings are old and do not use energy efficiently. \nAccording to the California Energy Commission, making energy efficient \nimprovements can reduce a school's annual utility bills by 20 percent. \nUnfortunately, particularly in low-income districts, other priorities--\nsuch as textbooks and teachers--often push the need to retrofit down on \nthe priority list. My bill establishes a grand program to help local \nschools make these improvements.\n  Finally, for consumer information, the bill would require utility \ncompanies to provide information on electricity bills regarding the \namount of electricity used during peak and nonpeak hours and how much \nthe consumer is paying during each period.\n  This is not the complete answer to the energy situation in \nCalifornia. But, it is important, and would be helpful in reducing the \nnation's need for electricity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 197. A bill to provide for the disclosure of the collection of \ninformation through computer software, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, how would you feel if someone was \neavesdropping on your private phone conversations without your \nknowledge? Well, if it happened to me, I would be very disturbed. And I \nthink that most Americans would be very disturbed to know that \nsomething similar may be happening every time they use their computers.\n  The shocking fact is that many software programs contain something \ncalled spyware. Spyware is computer code that surreptitiously uses our \nInternet connection to transmit information about things like our \npurchasing patterns and our health and financial status. This \ninformation is collected without our knowledge or explicit permission \nand the spyware programs run undetected while you surf the Internet.\n  Spyware has been found in Quicken software, which is manufactured by \nIntuit, Inc. So let me use this as an example. Imagine you purchase \nQuicken software or download it from the Internet. You install it on \nyour computer to help you with your finances. However, unbeknownst to \nyou, Quicken does more than install financial planning tools on your \ncomputer. It also installs a little piece of spyware. The spyware lies \ndormant until one day when you get on the Internet.\n  As you start surfing the Internet, the spyware sends back information \nto Intuit about what you buy and what you are interested in. And all of \nthis happens without your knowledge. You could be on Amazon.com or \nresearching health issues and at the very same time Intuit spyware is \nusing your Internet connection, transmitting some of your most private \ndata to someone you never heard of.\n  In the months since it was reported that Quicken contained spyware, \nthe folks at Intuit may have decided to remove the spyware from \nQuicken. However, Quicken is not the only software program that may \ncontain spyware. One computer expert recently found spyware programs in \npopular childrens' software that is designed to help them learn, such \nas Mattel Interactive's Reader Rabbit and Arthur's Thinking Games. And, \naccording to another expert's assessment, spyware is present\n\n[[Page S645]]\n\nin four hundred software programs, including commonly used software \nsuch as RealNetworks RealDownload, Netscape/AOL Smart Download, and \nNetZip Download Demon. Spyware in these software programs can transmit \ninformation about every file you download from the Internet.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce the Spyware Control and \nPrivacy Protection Act. I first introduced this legislation during the \n106th Congress. At that time, Congress was debating how to best address \nthe Internet privacy issue. Unfortunately, Congress failed to enact \nmeaningful Internet privacy legislation before the close of the \nCongress. I am hopeful that the story will end differently during the \n107th Congress. I hope we will pass comprehensive legislation that \nenables Americans to regain control over their personal information, \nand that helps protect their privacy and the privacy of their families. \nI believe my spyware bill is essential to ensuring that these computer \nprivacy protections are complete, and I will work to make sure it is \nincorporated into any Internet privacy legislation that moves in the \nSenate.\n  My proposal is common-sense and simple. It incorporates all four fair \ninformation practices of notice, choice, access and security practices \nthat I believe are essential to effective computer privacy legislation.\n  First, the Act requires that any software that contains spyware must \nprovide consumers with clear and conspicuous notice--at the time the \nsoftware is installed--that the software contains spyware. The notice \nmust also describe the information that the spyware will collect and \nindicate to whom it will be transmitted.\n  Another critical provision of my bill requires that software users \nmust first give their affirmative consent before the spyware is enabled \nand allowed to start obtaining and sharing users' personal information \nwith third parties. In other words, software users must ``opt-in'' to \nthe collection and transmission of their information. My bill gives \nsoftware users a choice whether they will allow the spyware to collect \nand share their information.\n  The Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act allows for some \ncommon-sense exceptions to the notice and opt-in requirements. Under my \nproposal, software users would not have to receive notice and give \ntheir permission to enable the spyware if the software user's \ninformation is gathered in order to provide technical support for use \nof the software. In addition, users' information may be collected if it \nis necessary to determine if they are licensed users of the software. \nAnd finally, the legislation would not apply to situations where \nemployers are using spyware to monitor Internet usage by their \nemployees. I believe that this last issue is a serious one and deserves \nto be addressed in separate legislation.\n  Another important aspect of the Spyware Control and Privacy \nProtection Act is that it would incorporate the fair information \npractice known as ``access.'' What this means is that an individual \nsoftware user would have the ability to find out what information has \nbeen collected about them, and would be given a reasonable chance to \ncorrect any errors.\n\n  And finally, the fourth fair information practice guaranteed by my \nbill is ``security.'' Anyone that uses spyware to collect information \nabout software users must establish procedures to keep that information \nconfidential and safe from hackers.\n  Mr. President, spyware is a modern day Trojan horse. You install \nsoftware on your computer thinking it's designed to help you, and it \nturns out that something else is hidden inside that may be quite \nharmful.\n  I have been closely following the privacy debate for some time now. \nAnd I am struck by how often I discover new ways in which our privacy \nis being eroded. Spyware is among the more startling examples of how \nthis erosion is occurring.\n  Most people would agree that modern technology has been \nextraordinarily beneficial. It has enabled us to obtain information \nmore quickly and easily than ever before. And companies have \nstreamlined their processes for providing goods and services.\n  But these remarkable developments can have a startling downside. They \nhave made it easier to track personal information such as medical and \nfinancial records, and buying habits. In turn, our ability to keep our \npersonal information private is being eroded.\n  Even sophisticated computer software users are unlikely to be aware \nthat information is being collected about their Internet surfing habits \nand is likely being fed into a growing personal profile maintained at a \ndata warehouse. They don't know that companies can and do extract the \ninformation from the warehouse to create a so-called cyber-profile of \nwhat they are likely to buy, what the status of their health may be, \nwhat their family is like, and what their financial situation may be.\n  I believe that in the absence of government regulation, it is \ndifficult, if not impossible for people to control the use of their own \npersonal information. Consumers are not properly informed, and \nbusinesses are under no legal obligation to protect consumers' privacy.\n  I believe that the Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act is a \nreasonable way to help Americans regain some of their privacy. My \nlegislation does not prevent software providers from using their \nsoftware to collect a consumer's online information. However, it gives \nback some control to the consumer by allowing him or her to decide \nwhether their information may be gathered.\n  My bill protects consumer privacy, while enabling software companies \nand marketing firms to continue obtaining consumers' information if the \nconsumer so chooses. Confidence in these companies will be enhanced if \nthey are able to assure their customers that they will not collect \ntheir personal information without their permission.\n  Privacy protections should not stop with computer software. I am \nproud to have cosponsored the Consumer Privacy Protection Act, a much-\nneeded measure offered by Senator Hollings. This legislation would \nprevent Internet service providers, individual web sites, network \nadvertisers, and other third parties from gathering information about \nour online surfing habits without our permission. I intend to be an \noriginal cosponsor of the bill when it is re-introduced.\n  And during the last Congress, I introduced the Telephone Call Privacy \nAct in order to prevent phone companies from disclosing consumers' \nprivate phone records without their permission. I will be re-\nintroducing this bill soon.\n  Increasingly, technology is impacting our lives and the lives of our \nfamilies. I believe that while it is important to encourage \ntechnological growth, we must also balance new developments with our \nfundamental right to privacy. Otherwise, we may wake up one day and \nrealize that our privacy has been so thoroughly eroded that it is \nimpossible to recover.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Spyware Control and Privacy \nProtection Act and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 197\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to establish \na program to provide assistance through States to eligible weed \nmanagement entities to control or eradicate harmful, nonnative weeds on \npublic and private land; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Daschle to \nintroduce the Harmful Non-native Weed Control Act of 2000--to provide \nassistance to eligible weed management entities to control or eradicate \nharmful, non-native weeds on public and private land. I am pleased that \nSenators Baucus, Burns, Conrad, Crapo, Dorgan, Johnson, and Gordon \nSmith are joining us as original cosponsors.\n  I have stood before Congress for the past three years pushing \nlegislation and speaking on the issue of noxious weeds. I know some \nmembers tire of hearing me bring up this issue, but I have seen the \ndestruction caused when non-native weeds are not treated and are left \nto over take native species.\n\n[[Page S647]]\n\n  Non-native weeds threaten fully two-thirds of all endangered species \nand are now considered by some experts to be the second most important \nthreat to bio-diversity. In some areas, spotted knapweed grows so thick \nthat big game like deer will move out of the area to find edible \nplants. Noxious weeds also increase soil erosion, and prevent \nrecreationists from accessing land that is infested with poisonous \nplants.\n  Because of these problems, during the 106th Congress I introduced and \nworked to pass the Plant Protection Act. As you may recall, that bill \nprimarily dealt with Animal Plant Health Inspection Service's authority \nto block or regulate the importation or movement of a noxious weed and \nplant pest, and it also provides authority for inspection and \nenforcement of the regulations. Basically the bill focused on stopping \nthe weeds at the border.\n  Stopping the spread of noxious weeds requires a two pronged effort. \nFirst, we must prevent new non-native weed species from becoming \nestablished in the United States, which was the focus of the Plant \nProtection Act. Second, we must stop or slow the spread of the non-\nnative weeds we already have, which is the focus of the Harmful Non-\nnative Weed Control Act.\n  I have been working with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, \nPublic Lands Council, and the Nature Conservancy to develop the Harmful \nNon-native Weed Control Act. This legislation will provide a mechanism \nto get funding to the local level where weeds can be fought in a \ncollaborative way. Working together is what the entire initiative is \nabout.\n  Specifically, this bill establishes, in the Office of Secretary of \nthe Interior, a program to provide assistance through States to \neligible weed management entities. The Secretary of the Interior \nappoints an Advisory Committee of ten individuals to make \nrecommendations to the Secretary regarding the annual allocation to \nfunds. The Secretary, in consultation with the Advisory Committee, will \nallocate funds to States to provide funding to eligible weed management \nentities to carry out projects approved by States to control or \neradicate harmful, non-native weeds on public and private lands. Funds \nwill be allocated based on several factors, including but not limited \nto: the seriousness of the problem in the State; the extent to which \nthe federal funds will be used to leverage non-federal funds to address \nthe problem; and the extent to which the State has already made \nprogress in addressing the problems.\n  The bill directs that the States use 25 percent of their allocation \nto make base payments and 75 percent for financial awards to eligible \nweed management entities for carrying out projects relating to the \ncontrol or eradication of harmful, non-native weeds on public or \nprivate lands. To be eligible to obtain a base payment, a weed \nmanagement entity must be established by local stakeholders for weed \nmanagement or public education purposes, provide the State a \ndescription of its purpose and proposed projects, and fulfill any other \nrequirements set by the State. Weed management entities are also \neligible for financial awards--funds awarded by the State on a \ncompetitive basis to carry out projects which can not be funded within \nthe base payment. Projects will be evaluated, giving equal \nconsideration to economic and natural values, and selected for funding \nbased on factors such as the seriousness of the problem, the likelihood \nthat the project will address the problem, and how comprehensive the \nproject's approach is to the harmful, non-native weed problem within \nthe state. A 50 percent non-federal match is required to receive the \nfunds.\n  The Department of Agriculture in Idaho (ISDA) has developed a \nStrategic Plan for Managing Noxious Weeds through a collaborative \neffort involving private landowners, state and federal land managers, \nstate and local governmental entities, and other interested parties. \nCooperative Weed Management Areas (CWMAs) are the centerpiece of the \nstrategic plan. CWMAs cross jurisdictional boundaries to bring together \nall landowners, land managers, and interested parties to identify and \nprioritize noxious weed strategies within the CWMA in a collaborative \nmanner. The primary responsibilities of the ISDA are to provide \ncoordination, administrative support, facilitation, and project cost-\nshare funding for this collaborative effort. Idaho already has a record \nof working in a collaborative way on this issue--my legislation will \nbuild on the progress we have had, and establish the same formula for \nsuccess in other states.\n  As I have said before, non-native weeds are a serious problem on both \npublic and private lands across the nation. They are particularly \ntroublesome in the West where much of our land is entrusted to the \nmanagement of the federal government. Like a ``slow burning wildfire,'' \nnoxious weeds take land out of production, force native species off the \nland, and interrupt the commerce and activities of all those who rely \non the land for their livelihoods--including farmers, ranchers, \nrecreationists, and others.\n  I believe we must focus our efforts to rid our lands of these non-\nnative weeds. Noxious weeds are not only a problem for farmers and \nranchers, but a hazard to our environment, economy, and communities in \nIdaho, the West, and for the country as a whole. We must reclaim the \nrangeland for natural species. Noxious weeds do not recognize property \nboundaries, so if we want to win this war on weeds, we must be fighting \nat the federal, state, local, and individual levels. The Harmful Non-\nnative Weed Control Act is an important step to ensure we are diligent \nin stopping the spread of these weeds. I am confident that if we work \ntogether at all levels of government and throughout our communities, we \ncan protect our land, livelihood, and environment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 198\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Harmful Nonnative Weed \n     Control Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) public and private land in the United States faces \n     unprecedented and severe stress from harmful, nonnative \n     weeds;\n       (2) the economic and resource value of the land is being \n     destroyed as harmful nonnative weeds overtake native \n     vegetation, making the land unusable for forage and for \n     diverse plant and animal communities;\n       (3) damage caused by harmful nonnative weeds has been \n     estimated to run in the hundreds of millions of dollars \n     annually;\n       (4) successfully fighting this scourge will require \n     coordinated action by all affected stakeholders, including \n     Federal, State, and local governments, private landowners, \n     and nongovernmental organizations;\n       (5) the fight must begin at the local level, since it is at \n     the local level that persons feel the loss caused by harmful \n     nonnative weeds and will therefore have the greatest \n     motivation to take effective action; and\n       (6) to date, effective action has been hampered by \n     inadequate funding at all levels of government and by \n     inadequate coordination.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide assistance to eligible weed management \n     entities in carrying out projects to control or eradicate \n     harmful, nonnative weeds on public and private land;\n       (2) to coordinate the projects with existing weed \n     management areas and districts;\n       (3) in locations in which no weed management entity, area, \n     or district exists, to stimulate the formation of additional \n     local or regional cooperative weed management entities, such \n     as entities for weed management areas or districts, that \n     organize locally affected stakeholders to control or \n     eradicate weeds;\n       (4) to leverage additional funds from a variety of public \n     and private sources to control or eradicate weeds through \n     local stakeholders; and\n       (5) to promote healthy, diverse, and desirable plant \n     communities by abating through a variety of measures the \n     threat posed by harmful, nonnative weeds.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing with Senator Larry \nCraig and a number of my other colleagues the Harmful Non-native Weed \nControl Act of 2001. This legislation will provide critically needed \nresources to local agencies to reduce the spread of harmful weeds that \nare destroying the productivity of farmland and reducing ecological \ndiversity.\n  In the last few years, public and private lands in the west have seen \na startling increase in the spread of harmful, non-native weeds. In \nsouth Dakota, these weeds choke out native species, destroy good \ngrazing land, and cost farmers and ranchers thousands of dollars a year \nto control. On public lands in South Dakota and throughout the west, \nthe spread of the weeds has outpaced the ability of land managers to \ncontrol them, threatening species diversity and, at times, spreading on \nto private land.\n  This problem has become so severe that, last year, the White House \nhas created an Invasive Species Council to address it. Former Secretary \nBruce\n\n[[Page S649]]\n\nBabbitt noted, ``The blending of the natural world into one great \nmonoculture of the most aggressive species is, I think, a blow to the \nspirit and beauty of the natural world.''\n  Despite these efforts, the scale of this problem is vast. Some \nestimate that it could cost well into the hundreds of millions of \ndollars to control effectively the spread of these weeds. This \nlegislation will help to meet that need by putting funding directly \ninto the hands of the local weed boards and managers who already are \nworking to control this problem and whose lands are directly affected.\n  Specifically, this legislation authorizes new weed control funding \nand establishes an Advisory Board in the Department of Interior to \nidentify the areas of greatest need for the distribution of those \nfunds. States, in turn, will transfer up to 25 percent of it directly \nto local weed control boards in order to support ongoing activities and \nspur the creation of new control boards, where necessary. The remaining \n75 percent of funds will be made available to weed control boards on a \ncompetitive basis to fund weed control projects.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to thank Senator Craig for his work on this \nissue, and to thank the National Cattleman's Beef Association and the \nNature Conservancy, who have been instrumental to the development of \nthis bill. Now that this legislation has been introduced, it is my hope \nthat we can work with all interested stakeholders to enact it as soon \nas possible. I look forward to working with my colleagues during this \nprocess.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I join Senator Craig in sponsoring the \nHarmful Nonnative Weed Control Act of 2001. This bill will require the \nSecretary of the Interior to establish a program to provide assistance \nthrough States to eligible weed management entities to control or \neradicate harmful, nonnative weeds on public and private land. In a \nstate like Montana, where we depend heavily on the bounty of the land \nto support the lifestyle we enjoy, weed control has a very important \nplace in land management. Noxious weeds attack the natural balance of \nthe range and the entire ecosystem, along with threatening the health \nand productivity of public and private lands.\n  When I visit with Montana ranchers, farmers, recreationists, and \nothers who live close to the land, they continually mention their \nconcern over noxious weeds. These folks are worried about how the weeds \nare changing the face of the land, and I am too. When these weeds take \nhold and native plants are crowded out, wildlife habitat is \ncompromised, livestock carrying capacity is reduced, and the condition \nof the land is jeopardized. Over the last few years we have been able \nto secure appropriations to increase research efforts with respect to \nweeds management. I think this is a step in the right direction, but we \nalso need our land management agencies and to work with private land \nowners.\n  One thing is clear: this is not just a public lands problem, nor is \nit only a private landowner problem. Without cooperation from both \nsides, any efforts from the other group are compromised. This bill \npresents a great opportunity for cooperation, and a chance for the \nfederal government to demonstrate a commitment to stewardship of our \npublic lands. Sadly, this is a commitment we have not seen enough of \nlately.\n  Aside from the ongoing battle against nonnative weeds in the West, \nthis year we have an added urgency to do something real about the \nproblem. When fires swept over millions of acres of public and private \nland last summer, that land was made especially vulnerable to weed \ninfestation. Aside from repairing the immediate damage to structures \nand making sure we are able to control erosion and protect clean water, \nwe have an obligation to fight the weeds that will otherwise take over \nthese lands. As hard as we have worked in the Senate to create fire \nprograms that repair last year's damage and keep it from happening \nagain, it would be a step in the wrong direction to leave weed \nprevention by the wayside. Preventing non-native species from taking \nhold right now will be a much better investment than trying to control \nthe invasion later. We cannot afford to stand by and do nothing.\n  In some ways, the disease of weed infestation resembles the challenge \nof wildfire. Both are economically and environmentally devastating, and \ndo not distinguish between public and private land. A recent study \npresented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science \nestimates that non-native species cause $123 billion in damage \nannually. This figure is more than twice the annual economic damage \ncaused by all natural disasters in the United States.\n  There are no silver bullets here, and we won't be able to fix things \novernight, but with hard work and a commitment to this cause, I know we \ncan make a difference. It is time the federal government step up to its \nobligations to Americans, and take decisive action to fight nonnative \nweeds. This is a serious problem, and I am proud to be working with my \ncolleagues in the Senate to fix it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 199. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to authorize \nthe Secretary of Transportation to oversee the competitive activities \nof air carriers following a concentration in the airline industry, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today because I am deeply concerned \nwith the sudden increase in airline merger proposals. Many have \npredicted that if the proposed merger of United Airlines and US Airways \nis allowed to go forward, it will be followed by mergers of other major \nairlines, and we will soon have an industry dominated by mega-carriers.\n  American Airlines recently bought Reno Air, and now is proposing a \nmerger of American Airlines and Trans World Airlines. If this trend \ncontinues, we could end up with only three airlines in America. That \ncould drive prices sky high and cut the number of available flights, \nwhich will be terrible for consumers.\n  I know first hand that mergers can hurt consumers. In my own state, \nthe Reno-Tahoe International Airport lost flights when American \nAirlines bought Reno Air. Flights were reduced significantly and now it \nis harder for people to fly in and out of the Reno and Lake Tahoe \nareas.\n  The purpose of deregulation was to encourage competition. Evidence \nseems to support a reduction in competition. It seems to be having an \nopposite effect. I am very concerned with the recent airline merger \nproposals and the merger frenzy that may follow. We must maintain as \nmuch competition as possible in the airline industry.\n  This legislation will protect consumers against monopolistic abuses. \nI emphasize that this type of legislation is not my preferred \napproach--I would greatly prefer to continue to have consumers \nprotected by adequate competition in a free market.\n  I emphasize that the bill is not a ``deregulation'' bill. Airlines \nwill remain free to set prices and provide service without prior \ngovernment approval. However, the bill will give DOT authority to \nintervene if the airlines take unfair advantage of the absence of \nsufficient competition.\n  We are at a critical juncture for the future of a competitive airline \nindustry. The inescapable lesson of 22 years of deregulation is that \nmergers and a reduction in competition often lead to higher fares for \nthe American traveling public. We cannot stand idly by and allow the \nbenefits of deregulation to be derailed by a wave of mergers.\n  Mr. President, my bill will take effect as a result of consolidation \nor mergers that occur between two or more of the top seven airline \ncarriers, or if three or fewer of those air carriers control more than \n70% of domestic revenue passenger miles. Highlights of my Airline \nCompetition Preservation bill are as follows:\n  Monopolistic Fares--The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to \nrequire reduction in fares that are unreasonably high. The factors to \nbe considered include:\n  Whether the fare in question is higher than fares charged in similar \nmarkets; whether the fare has been increased in excess of cost \nincreases; and whether there is a reasonable relationship between fares \ncharged leisure travelers and those charged business travelers.\n  If a fare is found to be unreasonably high, the Secretary may order \nthat it\n\n[[Page S650]]\n\nbe reduced, that the reduced fare be offered for a specified number of \nseats and that rebates be offered.\n  Preventing Unfair Practices Against Low Fare New Entrants: If a \ndominant incumbent carrier responds to low fare service by a new \nentrant by matching the low fare, and offering two or more times the \nlow fare seats as the new entrant, the dominant carrier must continue \nto offer the low fare for two years.\n  Increasing Competition At Hubs: If a dominant carrier at a hub \nairport is taking advantage of its monopoly power by offering fares 5% \nor more above industry average fares, in more than 20% of hub markets, \nDOT may take steps to facilitate added competition at the hub.\n  Mr. President, no one wants the federal government to micro manage \nprivate industry. But our airways are not just a private industry--they \nare a public trust. People need to be able to fly across our vast \nnation--to do business, to see family members, and to enjoy their \nlives. If these mergers proceed without the competitive protections I \nam proposing, then the ultimate irony of deregulation will be that we \nwill have traded government concern for the public interest, for \nprivate monopoly control in the interests of the industry.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Airline Competition \nPreservation Act of 2001 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 199\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a national policy of basic consumer fair \ntreatment for airline passengers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this past holiday season saw a record number \nof Americans travel by air. Unfortunately, it also saw increases in \nsome common problems associated with air travel--delayed and cancelled \nflights, customer confusion, and occurrences of ``air rage.''\n  The number of delayed, cancelled and diverted flights has been \nincreasing steadily over the past few years, reaching record highs last \nyear. Last week, the Department of Transportation released a management \nreport indicating that, from 1995 to 1999, the number of flight delays \nrose 58 percent and cancelled flights grew by 68 percent. In just one \nyear, 1999, passenger complaints grew by 16 percent. During the\n\n[[Page S651]]\n\nfirst nine months of 2000, one of every four flights was cancelled, \ndelayed or diverted, affecting more than 119 million passengers. The \naverage delay was 50 minutes.\n  Disturbingly, the report also indicated an increase in the number of \nnear-misses and runway safety errors that could have led to collisions \nbetween aircraft both in the air and on the ground.\n  And amid these problems, the number of choices available to customers \nkeeps decreasing. Within the past few months, National Airlines \nterminated much of its service, United Airlines announced a merger with \nUSAir, and American Airlines announced its acquisition of TWA. If \napproved, these mergers would allow only three airlines to dominate the \ncommercial airline industry.\n  More than a year ago, the airlines announced voluntary pledges to \nimprove their customer service and reduce delays, and asked for time to \ncarry out their promises. But it's obvious that those voluntary \npromises have not worked. In addition to the increase in delays and \ncustomer complaints, a preliminary report by the Inspector General \nreleased last summer revealed a number of unfair and deceptive \npractices by the industry, including providing false or inaccurate \ninformation to passengers about the reasons for delays.\n  Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, recently confirmed by the \nSenate, warned a few days ago that flight delays this coming summer \nwill likely be as bad or worse than they have been the past two years.\n  It's time for Congress to take action.\n  Last year, I introduced S. 2891, the Air Travelers' Fair Treatment \nAct of 2000, which was aimed at addressing some of the most pressing \nproblems associated with air travel. Today, I am re-introducing a \nmodified version of that bill, which is titled the ``Air Travelers' \nFair Treatment Act of 2001.''\n\n  The new bill includes six main provisions:\n  (1) Flight delays: Air carriers would be required to provide \ntravelers with accurate and timely explanations of the reasons for a \nflight cancellation, delay or diversion from a ticketed itinerary. The \nfailure to do so would be classified as an unfair practice that would \nsubject the airline to civil penalties.\n  (2) Right to exit aircraft: Where a plan has remained at the gate for \nmore than 1 hour past its scheduled departure time and the captain has \nnot been informed that the aircraft can be cleared for departure within \n15 minutes, passengers would have the right to exit the plane into the \nterminal to make alternative travel plans, or simply to stretch their \nlegs, get something to eat, etc. I believe this provision will help \nprevent ``air rage'' incidents when passengers are forced to sit in \nparked planes for long periods of time.\n  (3) Right to in-flight medical care: Currently, each airline has its \nown policy regarding what kind of medical and first-aid equipment and \ntraining is provided on their flights, so that the available equipment \nand medical training varies widely between carriers. This bill would \ndirect the Secretary of Transportation to issue uniform minimum \nregulations for all carriers regarding the type of medical equipment \neach flight must carry and the kind of medical training each flight \ncrew should receive.\n  (4) Access to State laws: The Federal Courts have split on whether \nthe Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 pre-empts state consumer \nprotection and personal injury laws as applied to airlines. The Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals has held that passengers may sue airlines in \nstate court for violations of state fraud and consumer protection laws; \nin contrast, the Fourth Circuit has held that airlines are immune from \nstate law. The bill would clarify that the 1978 Act does not preempt \nstate tort and consumer protection laws, allowing passengers full \naccess to their consumer rights in whatever state they are in.\n  (5) Termination of ticket agents: Travel agencies provide a valuable \nservice to customers looking for the best prices. Yet airlines have \nenormous leverage over what kind of information they can and cannot \nprovide to customers, because they can withdraw their accounts without \nnotice from any travel agency for any reason--even if the only reason \nis that the travel agency is giving the customer the best rates. The \nbill requires carriers to provide written 90-day advance statement of \nreasons before canceling a travel agency's account with the airline, \nand to give them 60 days to correct the identified deficiencies.\n  (6) Safety records: Right now, many airlines are reluctant to release \ninformation to the public relating to their safety records, including \ntheir accident record and certification compliance records. But I \nbelieve that passengers should have the right to know whether the \nairline they are flying has complied with government safety standards, \nwhether it has been fined or penalized for safety violations, and how \nmany accidents or safety violations the airlines has been involved in. \nThis bill will include a new provision requiring the Secretary of \nTransportation to develop regulations under which the safety, \ninspection, certification compliance and accident records of the \nairlines will be made available to any customer upon request.\n  Mr. President, air travel has become a staple of modern society. All \nof us in this body rely on it frequently to return to our home states. \nBut by almost every measure, the quality and reliability of air travel \ncontinues to decline. I think it's past time that Congress stepped in \nand forced the airlines to do what they have been unwilling to do so \nfar on their own--to clean up their act. I ask my colleagues to join \nme.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Air Travelers Fair \nTreatment Act of 2001, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 200\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to rename Wolf Trap Farm Park for the Performing Arts \nas ``Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts''; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill to rename \nthe Wolf Trap Farm Park for the Performing Arts as the ``Wolf Trap \nNational Park for the Performing Arts''. Wolf Trap is the only unit of \nthe National Park System dedicated to the performing arts. It provides \nan unrivaled setting for live performances in the rolling countryside \nof Virginia outside of Washington, D.C.\n  To provide this unique experience, the National Park Service \ncollaborates with the Wolf Trap Foundation in a public/private \npartnership to offer cultural, natural, and educational experiences to \nthe community and to the nation. The National Park Service maintains \nthe grounds and buildings of Wolf Trap Farm Park. The Wolf Trap \nFoundation, a ``501(c)(3)'' not-for-profit organization, creates and \nselects the programming, develops all education programs, handles \nticket sales, marketing, publicity and public relations, and raises \nfunds to support these programs. The Park Service has an annual budget \nof just over $3 million to maintain the facility while the Wolf Trap \nFoundation has an annual budget of $22 million, 60% of which is \ngenerated through ticket sales with the rest raised through private \ndonations.\n  Wolf Trap offers a wide variety of educational programs including the \nnationally acclaimed Wolf Trap Institute for Early Learning Through the \nArts for preschoolers, scholarships and performance opportunities for \ntalented high school musicians, pre-performance preview lectures, the \nAmerica's Promise mentoring program, the Mars Millennium project \npartnership with Buzz Aldrin Elementary School, the Folk Masters Study \nUnits for teachers who want to incorporate the folk arts into their \ncurriculum, a highly competitive internship program for college \nstudents, and master classes for people with all skill levels and \ninterest. Wolf Trap has also gained world-wide recognition for its \nsummer residency program for young opera singers, the Wolf Trap Opera \nCompany.\n  This legislation recognizes Wolf Trap's status as one of the crown \njewels in the National Park System. Including Wolf Trap with the \nalready designated National Parks is intended to\n\n[[Page S653]]\n\nraise awareness of the unique roll this facility plays in the nation's \nnatural, cultural and educational life. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin recognizing the many achievements of Wolf Trap.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 202\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It is an \nunfortunate fact that too many federal employees are subjected to such \ntreatment with alarming regularity.\n  My bill will result in a more productive work environment by ensuring \nagencies enforce the laws intended to protect federal employees from \nharassment, discrimination and retaliation for whistleblowing.\n  The Federal Employee Protection Act contains three main provisions: \nNo. 1, when agencies lose judgments or make settlements in harassment, \ndiscrimination and whistleblower cases, the responsible Federal agency \nwould pay any financial penalty out of its own budget, rather than out \nof a general Federal judgment fund; No. 2, Federal agencies are \nrequired to notify their employees about any applicable discrimination, \nharassment and whistleblower protection laws; and No. 3, each Federal \nagency is required to send an annual report to Congress and the \nAttorney General listing: the number of cases in which an agency was \nalleged to have violated any of the discrimination, harassment or \nwhistleblower statutes; the disposition of each of these cases; the \ntotal of all monetary awards charged against the agency from these \ncases; and the number of agency employees disciplined for \ndiscrimination or harassment or retaliation. Additionally, the Federal \nEmployee Protection Act requires each Federal agency to submit a one-\ntime report to Congress and the Attorney General that includes the same \ninformation required for the annual reports going back for the last ten \nyears. This report will provide a historical perspective to help \nevaluate current agency behavior.\n\n  Under current law, agencies are not accountable financially when they \nlose harassment, discrimination and retaliation cases because any \nfinancial penalties are paid out of a government-wide fund and not the \nagency's budget. I firmly believe that because there is no financial \nconsequence to their actions, Federal agencies are essentially able to \nescape responsibility when they fail to comply with the law and are \nunresponsive to their employees' concerns.\n  Reports of Federal agencies being indifferent or hostile to \ncomplaints of sexual harassment and racial discrimination undermine the \nability of the Federal Government to enforce civil rights laws and \nhamper efforts to recruit talented individuals for Federal employment. \nThe Federal Government must set an example for the private sector by \npromoting a workplace that does not tolerate harassment or \ndiscrimination of any kind and that encourages employees to report \nillegal activity and mismanagement without fear of reprisal.\n  I believe the Federal Employee Protection Act of 2001 will give \nFederal employees the protections they need to perform their jobs \neffectively and will give the taxpayers a government with more \naccountability. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/29/senate-section/article/S653-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S653-S654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 29\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bond, the names of the Senator from Oklahoma \n(Mr. Nickles), the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Stevens), the Senator from \nAlabama (Mr. Shelby), the Senator from Michigan (Mr. Levin), and the \nSenator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle) were added as cosponsors of S. \n29, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for 100 percent of the health insurance costs of self-\nemployed individuals.\n\n\n                                 S. 49\n\n  At the request of Mr. Stevens, the name of the Senator from Alaska \n(Mr. Murkowski) was added as a cosponsor of S. 49, a bill to amend the \nwetlands regulatory program under the Federal Water Pollution Control \nAct to provide credit for the low wetlands loss rate in Alaska and \nrecognize the significant extent of wetlands conservation in Alaska, to \nprotect Alaskan property owners, and to ease the burden on overly \nregulated Alaskan cities, boroughs, municipalities, and villages.\n\n\n                                 S. 88\n\n  At the request of Mr. Rockefeller, the names of the Senator from \nMinnesota (Mr. Wellstone) and the Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski) \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 88, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986 to provide an incentive to ensure that all Americans gain \ntimely and equitable access to the Internet over current and future \ngenerations of broadband capability.\n\n\n                                 S. 127\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the names of the Senator from Maryland \n(Ms. Mikulski) and the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) were added \nas cosponsors of S. 127, a bill to give American companies, American \nworkers, and American ports the opportunity to compete in the United \nStates cruise market.\n\n\n                                 S. 141\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Kansas \n(Mr. Brownback) was added as a cosponsor of S. 141, a bill to provide \nfor enhanced safety, public awareness, and environmental protection in \npipeline transportation, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 157\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Boxer, the name of the Senator from New Mexico \n(Mr. Bingaman) was added as a cosponsor of S. 157, a bill to establish \na program to help States expand the existing education system to \ninclude at least 1 year of early education preceding the year a child \nenters kindergarten.\n\n\n                                 S. 174\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kerry, the name of the Senator from South \nDakota (Mr. Daschle) was added as a cosponsor of S. 174, a bill to \namend the Small Business Act with respect to the microloan program, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 177\n\n  At the request of Mr. Akaka, the names of the Senator from North \nDakota (Mr. Dorgan), the Senator from Michigan (Ms. Stabenow), and the \nSenator from New Jersey (Mr. Torricelli) were added as cosponsors of S. \n177, a bill to amend the provisions of title 19, United States Code, \nrelating to the\n\n[[Page S654]]\n\nmanner in which pay policies and schedules and fringe benefit programs \nfor postmasters are established.\n\n\n                                 S. 189\n\n  At the request of Mr. Enzi, his name was added as a cosponsor of S . \n189, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax \nrelief for small businesses, and for other purposes.\n  At the request of Mr. Hutchinson, his name was added as a cosponsor \nof S. 189, supra.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/29/senate-section/article/S654-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 4--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE \n   REGARDING HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND ENSURING A COMPETITIVE NORTH \n                  AMERICAN MARKET FOR SOFTWOOD LUMBER\n\n  Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Graham, Mr. \nHagel, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Bingaman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                             S.
