Madam President, yesterday the President made very \nclear what we have all known for a long time in steel country, and that \nis that he basically does not care whether the American steel industry \ngoes to Japan, Korea, Brazil, Russia, or some other place; that he is \nwilling to see it go as an industry but, much more importantly in terms \nof my comments, that he is willing to consider perhaps TAA health care \nbenefits for workers who have been destroyed by illegal importing \nproblems. But steelworkers do not count. He specifically, in his \nstatement of administration policy, said: I don't want steelworkers to \nhave any health care retirement--retirement in the sense they do not \nhave any more health benefits. I don't care about them. I want the \nRecord to be crystal clear on that.\n  It is a sad position. It is a terrible day for steel. Somebody is \ngoing to get up today, they are going to make a motion, and it is going \nto be a point of order probably. I don't know when it will happen, who \nwill do it, or how it will happen, but I want my colleagues to be aware \nof the situation.\n  Abandoning steelworkers, not allowing them to have health care \ncoverage--we are only talking about 125,000 people as we start the \nprocess, none of whom, incidentally, is from the State I represent, the \nState of West Virginia. But they are just being excluded from the \nprocess.\n  TAA is a wonderful program. We recognize when people are thrown out \nof work due to imports, they need certain protections. Health care \ncertainly needs to be one of those protections. Unfortunately, TAA does \nnot cover, under its definition, retirees. It only covers active \nworkers, not retirees.\n  You say retirees, that must be somebody who is in their seventies or \neighties, and we should not be doing that here. But it is a very \ndifferent situation in steel. A retiree in steel might be 35 years old, \nbut the company went chapter 7. That means they turned out the lights, \nclosed the door, pink slips, no health benefits, everything shut down--\nno bankruptcy problems, just no more existence.\n  The steelworkers go. They are called retirees, but in fact they are \npeople, younger than average age, but out of health care.\n  I think it is outrageous. The steelworkers in fact were subjected to \nimport surges which broke American Federal law, the 1974 Trade Act. \nOther countries did it at will. Our administration has refused to \nenforce that. So we have dumped steel, which has thrown people out of \nwork. The administration then says: No, steelworkers cannot have health \ncare benefits.\n  I do not understand how people come to think that way, what their \nvalue system is. But it is very clear in steel country that the \nPresident of the United States has abandoned the steelworkers of \nAmerica and that he has abandoned people who have been already thrown \nout of work and who have no health care benefits, and have children to \nfeed, even as he contemplates reluctantly the idea of doing health care \nbenefits for other eligible active workers.\n  Let me say this. The President got a lot of credit in steel country \nfor doing something called section 201. It was taking the dumping \ncrisis, the illegal dumping crisis, before the International Trade \nCommission. He got a lot of credit for that. He pretty much had to do \nthat, I would say--on political grounds, No. 1. But more importantly, \nthe Finance Committee had already voted to do it. The Finance Committee \nhas the same standing legally under the law as does the President, so \nit was going to happen anyway. So the result would have been the same. \nThe International Trade Commission would have voted unanimously the \nsteel industry was grievously injured by imports and people were \nhurting badly.\n  He did that knowing that it would make him somewhat popular in steel \ncountry because people were saying: Gee, we just solved the problem. It \nis not even the beginning of the problem. All that did was buy us time.\n  We have three steps we have to accomplish. One is we have to do \nsection 201, which buys us time to consider health care costs, which we \nhave to consider if we are going to have consolidation in the steel \nindustry to preserve an American steel industry. It is sort of one of \nthe great basic industries of this country.\n  We just passed a farm bill yesterday dumping billions and billions of \ndollars on farms for the hundredth consecutive year. Yet there was no \nconsideration whatsoever for steelworkers. I find that very odd, even \nas my colleagues make these kinds of judgments.\n  So, No. 1, he did section 2101. He had to do that. He had no choice \npolitically or procedurally. It just bought us some time. But we have \nto go on to retirement health care costs. He has washed his hands of \nthat. He says: I want nothing to do with it. He actually writes in the \nstatement of administrative--whatever the word is--practice that he \nparticularly opposes the majority leader's amendment which would \ninclude retired steelworkers. He makes that very clear. He wants them \ncut out of the deal. He wants them excluded.\n  That is only 125,000 and would probably cost $200 million or $300 \nmillion.\n  I think the farm bill we passed yesterday was $100 billion over 10 \nyears. The proportion in sort of the human dimension of this is rather \nextraordinary.\n  The President has also done a lot of tariff exclusions. He has taken \na lot of countries out of section 201 that had to pay tariffs because \nthey were illegally dumping steel in the United States and putting our \nworkers out of work. He started to exempt different countries. He has \ndifferent requirements for that--again, I think in violation of the \nspirit, if not the letter, of the 1974 Trade Act.\n  All of us have asked him to stop that. Again, he has washed his hands \nof steel. He has washed his hands, more importantly, of the \nsteelworkers who can also be called human beings with families--people. \nIt doesn't have to be an industry. They are called human beings. They \nare Americans. They pay taxes. They do things right. They work in a \nvery dangerous industry. So do farmers. Is a farmer more vulnerable \nthan a steelworker? I do not know. Maybe a farmer is, but not where I \ncome from.\n  I very much regret this action on his part. Let me conclude by saying \nthis: We now know that the President doesn't have a commitment to \nsteelworkers and to the steel industry. We know he has no regard for \nhow people's lives and entire communities are going to be affected. I \nhave believed that for a long time. Now it is proven. It is clear. He \nis moving aggressively with the help of some of our colleagues, \nunfortunately--most of them on the other side but a couple on this \nside--to simply walk away from steelworkers.\n  I think that is a kind of betrayal by somebody who claimed to be a \nfriend of the steel industry. The President and the Vice President were \nin steel country in my part of the world a number of times saying how \nimportant steel was to the national defense, how it is basic to \nAmericans, and how they were not going to let them down. When push came \nto shove, they let them down. They made it very clear.\n  I want to be incisively precise about that as we start this Thursday \nso that the people of America understand that.\n  I don't understand sometimes how people make decisions and what their \nvalue systems are, and what kind of fairness is within the fair trade \nor free trade system. But I do know this: The administration has \nabandoned any semblance of fairness toward some very decent people in \nthis country called steelworkers.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I commend my colleague from West \nVirginia for his diligence and compassionate concern for our \nsteelworkers.\n  Coming from Michigan, I share his deep disappointment and concern \nabout the administration's position.\n  I know the Senator from West Virginia has been in the Chamber over \nand over again speaking up for our steelworkers. I thank him on behalf \nof the steelworkers in Michigan--those in the Upper Peninsula, those \ndownriver in communities near Detroit, and those\n\n[[Page S4087]]\n\nwho were laid off for several months over the Christmas holidays as a \nresult of the mines having to shut down because of the unfair dumping \nfrom other countries. Our steelworkers and mills have been affected.\n  I can't think of a more passionate advocate, and I am so proud to \njoin with him in his continuing fight. I will be here with him in the \nChamber as we do everything possible to make sure we remember the \nsteelworkers, who have been the backbone of building this country, to \nmake sure their health care costs are covered and they are recognized \nas we look at how we make trade fair in this country.\n  I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4087-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4087-S4088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I want to speak to an issue that \nrelates to health care. I am so honored to join with our colleagues, \nparticularly on this side of the aisle in the Democratic caucus, who \ncontinue to work very hard to bring a sense of urgency to the question \nof health care for our families, to health care insurance, and to \naffordability for our small businesses and family farmers and the \nlarger business community.\n  We know today that one of the major costs economically and from a \nbusiness standpoint--and certainly for families, and particularly for \nour seniors--is the whole question of being able to provide health care \nand being able to afford health care for our families.\n  We also know the major reason we are seeing health care costs rise \nrelates to the uncontrollable increase in prescription drug coverage.\n  Today, I once again come to the floor to speak about the need for \nreal action now.\n  I challenge and invite our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nand those in the other Chamber who have come forward with principles--\nthe Speaker of the House and those who will be speaking today about a \nplan--to join with us in something that is real and tangible.\n  Words are not going to buy prescriptions for seniors. We know there \nare seniors watching right now who are deciding today whether to pay \nthat utility bill or eat supper tonight or do they do those other \nthings which they need to do in order to have the quality of life we \nwant for our parents and grandparents and older Americans of this \ncountry--or do they put all of their money into paying for lifesaving \nmedications? That is not a good choice.\n\n  Shame on us for having a situation where seniors have to make that \nchoice. Yet when we come to the floor, we talk about the need for a \nreal Medicare prescription drug benefit. And when we talk about the \nneed to lower prices for all of our families and lower prices for \neveryone so we have health care available for everyone in this country, \nwe get more words than we get actions.\n  I am deeply concerned today as we look at what has been proposed by \nour colleagues on the other side of the Congress, our Republican \ncolleagues in the House have said that they wish to lower the cost of \nprescription drugs now. Yet at the same time we see old proposals to do \nminimal kinds of discounts through discount cards and so on--things \nthat are already available which folks want to take political credit \nfor, maybe change the name or maybe put it under Medicare. But it \ndoesn't do anything to actually lower the prices and make prescription \ndrugs more available.\n  I am very concerned when we come forward with proposals that will, in \nfact, lower prices that we are not yet seeing the support.\n  We want that support to be there to be able to use more generic drugs \nwhen they are available after the patent has run out--the same drug and \nthe same formulation--and at a lower price.\n  We want to have the ability to open our borders so we can get the \nbest price of American-made drugs regardless of where they are sold \naround the world.\n  In Michigan, simply crossing the bridge to Canada, which is a 5-\nminute drive, cuts the price in half on American-made drugs. It is not \nright. We think when we are talking about fair trade we should open the \nborder to the one thing that we don't have fair and open trade on; that \nis, prescription drugs.\n  We also know the fastest growing part of the cost of that \nprescription bottle is advertising costs, and that the top 11 Fortune \n500 companies, last year, spent 2\\1/2\\ times more on advertising than \nresearch.\n  I was pleased to join with my colleagues earlier this week in \nintroducing legislation to simply say: If you are doing more \nadvertising than research, taxpayers are not going to subsidize it. We \nwill allow you to deduct the amount of advertising and marketing that \nyou do up to the level that you spend in research. We want more \nresearch. We want more innovative drugs. We do not want more market \nresearch; we want more medical research. So we propose items to lower \ncosts to help everyone, right now, to lower those prices.\n  We also come forward saying it is time to update Medicare for today's \nhealth care system. When Medicare was set up in 1965, it covered the \nway health care was provided in 1965. If you went into the hospital, \nmaybe you had a little penicillin, or maybe you had an operation in the \nhospital, and Medicare covered it.\n  Medicare is a great American success story. But health care \ntreatments have changed. I have a constituent who showed me a pill he \ntakes once a month that has stopped him from having to have open-heart \nsurgery. It is a great thing: One pill a month. The pill costs $400. I \nsaid: I want to take a close look at that pill. I hope it is gold \nplated. But the reality is, that pill stops expensive open-heart \nsurgery and allows this person to be able to continue living and \nenjoying a wonderful quality of life with his wife and family.\n  If he went in for that surgery, Medicare would cover it. They don't \ncover the pill. So that is what we are talking about. But we need this \nto be comprehensive.\n  When our colleagues come forward, and their second principle is \nguaranteeing all senior citizens prescription drug coverage, we say: \nYes, come join with us. Let's make it real. But, unfortunately, when we \nrun the numbers on what is being talked about--and the bill has not \nbeen introduced yet, but we have all kinds of information about what \nappears to be coming. From what we know, let me share with you some of \nthe numbers.\n  If you are a senior or if you are disabled and you have a $300-a-\nmonth prescription drug bill, which is not uncommon, when you get all \ndone with the copays and the premiums and the deductibles that they are \ntalking about, you would end up, out of $3,600 worth of prescriptions, \npaying, out of pocket, $2,920. So less than 20 percent of your bill \nwould be covered under Medicare.\n  That is not what we are talking about. That is not comprehensive \ncoverage under Medicare. That is really a hoax. That is a proposal \nbeing put forward to guarantee all seniors prescription drug coverage \nthat is words, not actions. Again, words will not pay the bills. Words \nwill not guarantee that seniors get one more prescription covered, that \nthey will get that blood pressure medicine, that they will get that \ncholesterol medicine, or make sure they have that pill that stops them \nfrom having to have that open-heart surgery.\n  So we come today to this Chamber to say: Yes, guarantee all seniors \nprescription drug coverage. But the proposal coming forward by the \nSpeaker of the House, and those on the other side of this building, \nwill not do it. Unfortunately, what is being talked about will add \ninsult to injury because they are talking about paying for their less-\nthan-20-percent coverage by another cut to hospitals.\n  I know the Presiding Officer from New York shares the same concern I \nhave because I know hospitals in New York have been cut, hospitals in \nMichigan have been cut. My colleague from Florida is in the Chamber. I \nknow he has the same stories--and our leader from Nevada. We know that \nwhether it is rural hospitals or urban hospitals or suburban hospitals, \nthey have had enough cuts under Medicare. It is unbelievable we would \nbe talking about another cut for hospitals while they are proposing \nthis minimal prescription drug benefit.\n  The other thing I find incredible is that they are talking about a \ncopay of $50 for home health visits. We already have seen dramatic \ncuts. We have had over 2,500 home health agencies close\n\n[[Page S4088]]\n\nacross this country because of the excessive cuts in home health care \npayments since 1997. Many of us have been saying: Enough is enough.\n  We cannot say that the home health help you need will cost more when \nwe are trying to give a little bit of help with prescription drugs \nbecause it is the combination of home health care and prescription \ndrugs that allows people to live at home when they have health care \nneeds. It allows families to take care of mom or dad or grandpa or \ngrandma, to make sure if someone is disabled and needs care at home, \nthat they are not inappropriately placed into a nursing home or out-of-\nhome care. The combination of home health care and affordable \nprescription medications will help our families care for their loved \nones and help people to live in dignity at home.\n  So I find it incredible that you would have, first of all, a minimal \nproposal on prescription drugs coming forward, and then it would be \ncoupled with the fact they are talking about cutting hospitals and \ncopays for home health care to pay for it. This is an amazing situation \nto me.\n  We need to be strengthening Medicare, not undermining it. Many of the \nother parts of this proposal would turn Medicare over to private \ninsurance companies. It would basically create a situation where the \ndrug companies or insurance companies may believe they benefit but at \nthe expense of our seniors.\n  I am going to yield a moment to my colleague from Florida, who I know \ncares deeply about this subject. I thank him for coming to the floor \ntoday to join me, as we rise to say to our Republican colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives: Come join with us. Come join with us to make \nsure we can, in fact, put the words into action. Words are not enough. \nWe need comprehensive Medicare prescription drug coverage. We need to \nlower prices now.\n  I yield time to my colleague from Florida.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nyielding. I want to underscore a number of the remarks the Senator from \nMichigan made--this issue of health care, home health care, and \nprescription drugs.\n  I start my comments by saying, has the Bush administration taken \nleave of its senses with regard to a number of these proposals? What \nthe Senator from Michigan has just said in relation to copayments for \nhome health care, home health care is something we want to encourage. \nHome health care is certainly an alternative to being in a nursing home \nfrom a cost standpoint. It is certainly a cost incentive as an \nalternative to being in a hospital. But home health care, if it is the \nright kind of medical care, is also a lot better quality of life for \nthe patient than having to be in a nursing home or a hospital, if that \nis the appropriate medical care, because they are surrounded by family \nin their home.\n  The Bush administration now wants to propose a new copayment. \nTherefore, for senior citizens who are having difficulty paying medical \nbills as it is, because Medicare does not cover everything, now the \nBush administration wants, in fact, them to pay more in order to be \neligible for home health care? Have they taken leave of their senses?\n  Take, for example, what the Senator mentioned on prescription drugs. \nThe Bush administration is saying: Oh, we want a prescription drug \nbenefit. Well, certainly all of us do. Why? Because Medicare was set up \nin 1965 when health care was organized around acute care in hospitals. \nBut 37 years later, health care is a lot different. Thank the Good Lord \nfor the miracles of modern medicine.\n  So to provide those miracles of modern medicine--otherwise known as \nprescription drugs--to our senior citizens, we ought to be modernizing \nMedicare by adding a prescription drug benefit.\n  The administration says: Yes, we want it. But they are saying, $190 \nbillion over 10 years. That is a drop in the bucket.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Time for morning business has \nexpired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nI may proceed for 5 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, that would be fine. It may necessitate \nhaving the vote at 5 after rather than on the hour.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have no objection, provided we then still keep the \nperiod of time prior to the next vote the same amount of time and the \nvote will have to slip 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Florida, I also got a nod from the \nminority that that is fine. We will ask that the vote be scheduled for \n5 after 11 and that the Senator from Florida be recognized for an \nadditional 5 minutes--I am sorry, 11:35.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank my colleagues. They are very generous \nwith the time. I thank the Chair.\n  I was talking about prescription drugs and providing a realistic \nprescription drug benefit by modernizing Medicare. We talked about a \nlevel in the last campaign. This was a primary topic of concern. In \nevery television debate I had, this issue came up. The level we were \ntalking about was in the range of $300 to $350 billion for a \nprescription drug benefit over a 10-year period.\n  The fact is, the escalating cost of prescription drugs is going to be \nmore than that. Of course, with a budget that now has no surplus--we \nhad about 14 months ago an ample surplus for the next decade--it is \ngoing to be very difficult. But we are going to have to face that fact. \nAnd don't talk about window dressing of $190 billion over a decade \nbecause that is not going to cut it. For example, why don't we step up \nto the plate on Medicare reimbursement? Look at the doctors and the \nhospitals that are having difficulty making it because Medicare is not \nreimbursing on a realistic payment schedule. We are going to have to \naddress that.\n  I say to my colleague from the great State of Michigan, the fact is, \neventually this country is going to have to face the fact of health \ncare reform in a comprehensive way. What are we going to do about 44 \nmillion people in this country who don't have health insurance? The \nfact is, they don't have health insurance, but they get health care. \nThey get it at the most expensive place, at the most expensive time; \nthat is, when they get sick. They end up in the emergency room, which \nis the most expensive place at the most expensive time because without \npreventative care, when the sniffles have turned into pneumonia, the \nconsequence is that the costs are so much higher.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my colleague be willing to yield for a moment?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Certainly.\n  Ms. STABENOW. He raises such an important point about prevention. \nThat is why I know we care so much about the issue of prescription \ndrugs. By making prescription drugs available on the front end, that is \npart of that prevention, along with comprehensive care, making sure \nthat people are able to receive the medicine they need before they get \ndeathly sick and need to go into a hospital or need an operation.\n  My colleague raises such an important point, and it is one of the \nreasons we are working so hard to make Medicare available with \nprescription drugs and to also lower the prices for everyone. Part of \nthat prevention is making sure that seniors have access to the medicine \nthey need to prevent more serious injuries and illnesses from \nhappening.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. And comprehensive health care reform has to \ndeal with the 40-plus million who don't have health insurance by \ncreating a system whereby they are covered. That then allows the \nprinciple of insurance to work for you because the principle of \ninsurance is that you take the largest possible group to spread the \nhealth risk, and when you do that, you bring down the per-unit cost. \nThus, any comprehensive plan is going to have to have pooling of larger \ngroups. It is going to have to have consumer choice. It is going to \nhave to have free market competition to get the most efficiency, and it \nis going to have to have universal coverage.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to join the debate on \nprescription drugs.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4089-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4089]]\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Hanen, of Texas, to be U.S. District Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas;\n  Samuel H. Mays, Jr., of Tennessee, to be U.S. District Judge for the \nWestern District of Tennessee;\n  Thomas M. Rose, of Ohio, to be U.S. District Judge for the Southern \nDistrict of Ohio.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour of debate on the nominations, to be equally divided \nbetween the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today the Senate is considering, as the \nChair has reported, four more of President Bush's judicial nominees. We \nwill begin voting on those nominees in about an hour.\n  I rarely predict the outcome of votes in the Senate. Having been here \n28 years, I have had enough chances to be wrong in my predictions, but \nI will predict, with a degree of certitude, that these will be another \nfour of President Bush's judicial nominees that we will confirm.\n  These confirmations demonstrate, as has been demonstrated with each \nof the judges we have confirmed in the past ten months, with the \nexception of one, that we have taken up nominees in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, that they have gone through the committee and, \nwhen they have reached the floor, have been confirmed.\n  Democrats have demonstrated over and over again that we are working \nwith the President on fundamental issues that are important to this \ncountry, whether it is our support for the war on terrorism, support \nfor strong and effective law enforcement, or our effort to work \ncollaboratively to lower judicial vacancies.\n  For a bit of history, when the Democrats took over the full Judiciary \nCommittee in July of last year, there were 110 vacancies. My Republican \ncolleagues had not held any judicial confirmation hearings at all prior \nto the time we took over, despite the fact that there were a number of \npending nominations when they first came into power. Then there were, \nof course, nominations that President Bush sent to the Senate in May. \nBut as of July, when we took over, the Republican-controlled committee \nhad not held any hearings. Ten minutes after we took over the committee \nand I became chairman, we announced hearings on a number of the \nPresident's nominees.\n  I mention this to put in perspective that we have tried to move \nquickly. We inherited 110 vacancies. Interestingly enough, most of the \nvacancies occurred while the Republicans were in control of the Senate, \nnotwithstanding the fact that former President Clinton had nominated \npeople to fill most of those vacancies. But those nominees were never \ngiven a hearing. They were never allowed, under Republican leadership, \nto go forward.\n  Last Friday, when the Democratic Senators were out of town on a long \nplanned meeting, President Bush spoke about what he now calls the \n``judicial vacancy crisis.'' I was disappointed that the White House \nspeech writers chose a confrontational tone and tried to blame the \nDemocratic Senate majority, which has actually been the majority in the \nJudiciary Committee for only about 10 months.\n  The fact is, we inherited 110 judicial vacancies on July 10, 2001. \nThe fact is, the increase in vacancies had not occurred on the watch of \nthe Democratic Senate majority but in the period between January 1995 \nand July 2001, when the Republican majority on the committee stalled \nPresident Clinton's moderate nominees and overall vacancies rose by \nalmost 75 percent--from 63 to 110. That is what we inherited because \nthe other side would not hold hearings. Vacancies on the courts of \nappeals rose even more. They more than doubled, from 16 to 33.\n\n  I don't expect President Bush to know these numbers or to be that \ninvolved with them. But his staff does, and when they write his \nspeeches, they ought to do him the favor of being truthful. They ought \nto know that the Federal judiciary is supposed to be independent and \noutside of partisan political battles, and they should not have drawn \nhim into one, which makes it even worse.\n  It is bad enough when Republicans in the Senate threaten and seek to \nintimidate on this issue, but we are now being threatened with a \nshutdown of the Senate's business, a shutdown of committee hearings, a \nrefusal to work together on unemployment, trade, and other important \nmatters. It was bad enough when they utilized secret holds and stalling \ntactics in considering President Clinton's moderate judicial nominees, \nbut now they bemoan the judicial vacancies that were created and take \nno responsibility for creating these vacancies. They seek to blame \nothers. It is really too bad that the White House now appears to be \nrejecting all of our efforts--and they have been significant--at \nreconciliation and problem solving. Instead, the White House has joined \nthe partisan attack.\n  The fact is, since last July, when we took over the majority, we have \nbeen working hard to fill judicial vacancies. We have had more hearings \non more judicial nominees and confirmed more judges than our Republican \npredecessors ever did over any similar period of time. Actually, it is \nhard to know when there was a similar period in time. The Senate and \nthe Judiciary Committee had to work in the aftermath of the attacks of \nSeptember 11 and we kept on meeting. We were in this Chamber on \nSeptember 12. We had the anthrax attacks on the Senate, on Majority \nLeader Daschle and, I hate to say, one on me, as chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. The New York Times reported it as the most deadly \nof all. While working to fill judicial vacancies, we were also \napproving executive branch nominees--Attorney General Ashcroft and \nothers--and we were considering the Antiterrorism Act.\n  In my 28 years here, I have never known a time when the Judiciary \nCommittee, or any committee, was hit with so many things that it had to \ndo in such a short period of time and under so much pressure. The Hart \nBuilding, housing half of the Senators, was closed down. At times, this \nbuilding was closed down. Senator Daschle and I and our staffs were \nunder actual physical attacks with the anthrax letters. I mention that \nbecause this afternoon we are going to hold our 18th hearing for \njudicial nominees within 10 months--unless, of course, the other side \nobjects to our proceeding.\n  By the end of today, the Senate will have confirmed 56 new judges, \nincluding 9 to the courts of appeals, within the last 10 tumultuous \nmonths--an all-time record.\n  I am sorry that the White House and our Republican colleagues do not \nacknowledge our achievements but choose, instead, to only criticize. I \nregret that the White House and our Republican colleagues will not \nacknowledge that the obstructionism of the Republican Senate majority \nbetween 1996 and 2001 is what created what they now term a ``vacancy \ncrisis.''\n  When they were engaged in those tactics, some Republicans defended \ntheir record then by arguing that 103 vacancies was not a crisis. They \nactually did that. They said in an op-ed piece that having 103 \nvacancies was not a crisis. They let it go to 110.\n\n  The Democratic majority has cut back those vacancies. We have not \nonly\n\n[[Page S4090]]\n\nkept up with attrition, we have cut them back. Under a Democratic \nPresident, some Republicans said 103 vacancies was not a crisis, but \nnow, with a Republican President, they say that 84 vacancies is a \ncrisis--even as we confirm judges at a record pace.\n  I have been here with six Presidents--Republican and Democrat. I have \nnever seen a time when any White House has made the issue of the makeup \nof the Federal judiciary such a partisan issue. I am a lawyer, as is \nthe distinguished Presiding Officer. I have argued cases before Federal \ncourts, both at the district level and at the appellate level.\n  One thing I have always known when I walked into a Federal court in \nAmerica is that it is an impartial court, where you are not looked at \nas a Republican or a Democrat, whether you are rich or poor, whether \nyou are white or black, plaintiff or defendant, or liberal, \nconservative or moderate. You can always go into a Federal court here \nand think that you will be treated on the merits of your case. That is \nwhy I regret the lack of balance and the bipartisan perspective that \nwas lacking in the President's speech and in the comments of some of my \ncolleagues.\n  The Senate would do a disservice to the country if we allowed \nideological court packing of the left or the right, if we were to put a \nstamp on Federal courts and say: ``He who enters here, if you do not \nfit the ideological rubber stamp of this court, if you cannot respond \nand say you fit in a certain mold, according to the speeches of the \nPresident's advisers--a very narrow ideological spectrum--forget about \nit when you come in here.'' If anybody would take time to read a \nhistory book, they would understand that it is the Senate's role to \nensure that the judges it confirms meet the standards for impartiality \nand fairness.\n  A very popular President, a wartime President, Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt, a revered President, tried to pack the courts, and the \nSenate said: no, you cannot do that. Every historian will tell you \ntoday: Thank goodness the Senate has stood up to a popular wartime \nPresident and said you cannot pack the courts because it would destroy \nthe independence of the Federal judiciary.\n  I say this because sometimes we sit here and think we have to decide \non issues just for today. We have a responsibility in the Senate to \ndecide issues for history's sake and for the good of this country. I \nwant to know that each one of us can go back to our constituents and \nsay that we have preserved an independent judiciary. That does not mean \njust all one party. I have voted for hundreds upon hundreds of judges \nwho stated that they were Republicans. I have voted for hundreds of \njudges nominated by Republican Presidents. But I will not allow an \nideological shift one way or the other on the courts.\n  I have voted for judges whom I know have a different personal view on \nthe right-to-life issues than I and who have taken different positions \non the death penalty. But I knew they would be fair judges. I will \ncontinue to do that. That is our responsibility as Senators to our \ncountry, to the judiciary, and to history.\n  With today's votes, the number of Federal judges confirmed since the \nchange in Senate majority 10 months ago now totals 56. Under Democratic \nleadership, the Senate has confirmed more judges in 10 months than were \nconfirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate in the 1996 and 1997 \nsessions combined. We have accomplished in less than 1 year what our \npredecessors and critics took 2 years to do. It took a staunchly \nRepublican majority 15 months working closely with the Reagan \nadministration to reach this number of confirmations, confirmations we \nhave achieved in just 10 months.\n  Of course the ``anniversary'' of the reorganization of the Judiciary \nCommittee after the shift in majority last year is not until July 10, \nmore than 2 months from now. On July 10 last year we inherited 110 \njudicial vacancies, including 33 on the courts of appeals. Since then, \n30 additional vacancies, including 5 on the courts of appeals have \narisen. This is an unusually large number. Nonetheless, through hard \nwork and great effort, the Democratic majority in the Senate has \nproceeded with 17 hearings involving 61 judicial nominees, the \ncommittee has voted on 59 nominees, and, today, the Senate is set to \nhold its 18th hearing involving four more judges and to approve four \nmore new judges--bringing the working total to 56 confirmations in just \n10 months.\n  The number of judicial confirmations over these past 10 months, 56, \nexceeds the number confirmed in 4 out of 6 full years under recent \nRepublican leadership, during all 12 months of 2000, 1999, 1997, and \n1996. And we have confirmed more judges at a faster pace than for all \nthe years of Republican control.\n  Fifty-six confirmations exceeds the number of confirmations in the \nfirst year of the Reagan administration by a Republican Senate \nmajority. It is almost double the number of confirmations in the first \nyear of the Clinton administration by a Democratic Senate majority. And \nit is more than triple the number of judges confirmed for the George \nH.W. Bush administration by a Senate of the other party. In fact, with \n56 confirmations for President George W. Bush, the Democratic-led \nSenate has confirmed more judges than were confirmed in 7 of the 8 \nwhole years of the Reagan administration, that Senator Hatch \nacknowledges as the all-time leader in judicial appointments.\n  The confirmations of Justice Leonard Davis, Andrew Hanen, Samuel \nMays, and Judge Thomas Rose today illustrate the progress being made \nunder Democratic leadership, and the fair and expeditious way in which \nwe have considered nominees. Many of the vacancies that will be filled \nby today's votes arose during the Clinton administration and are a \nprime and unfortunate legacy of recent Republican obstructionist \npractices.\n  The confirmations of Justice Davis and Mr. Hanen will make the third \nand fourth district court judgeships we have filled in Texas and the \neighth and ninth judgeships we have filled overall in the Fifth Circuit \nsince I became chairman last summer. Included among those confirmations \nis the first new judge for the Fifth Circuit in 7 years.\n  On February 5, the Senate confirmed, by a vote of 93 to 0, Judge \nPhilip Martinez of Texas to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Texas. On March 18, the \nSenate confirmed, by a vote of 91 to 0, Robert (Randy) Crane to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy on the District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas. The Senate has confirmed Judge Kurt Engelhardt and \nJudge Jay Zainey to fill vacancies on the District Court for the \nEastern District of Louisiana. The Senate has confirmed Judge Michael \nMills to fill a vacancy on the District Court for the Northern District \nof Mississippi. Despite the unfounded claim of some Republicans that \nthe Senate will not confirm conservative Republicans, these nominees \nwere all confirmed and treated more fairly and expeditiously than many \nof President Clinton's nominees for the Federal Bench.\n  Mr. Hanen was nominated to fill the vacancy created by the retirement \nof Judge Filemon B. Vela in May 2000. I recall just 2 years ago when \nRicardo Morado, who served as mayor of San Benito, TX, was nominated to \nfill this vacancy in the Southern District of Texas and never received \na hearing from the Republican-controlled Senate. President Clinton \nnominated Ricardo Morado on May 11, 2000, and his nomination was \nreturned to President Clinton without any action on December 15, 2000. \nIn filling a judicial emergency vacancy that has been pending for more \nthan 700 days, Mr. Hanen will be the 17th judicial emergency vacancy \nthat we have filled since July and the 10th since the beginning of this \nsession.\n  With the confirmation of Mr. Hansen, there will no longer be any \nvacancies on the District Court for the Southern District of Texas, a \nCourt which has faced an extraordinary caseload and has the third \nhighest number of filings of criminal cases in the country. With Judge \nCrane and Judge Hanen, we have provided much needed help to this court.\n  It was not long ago when the Senate was under Republican control, \nthat it took 943 days to confirm Judge Hilda Tagle to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Texas. She was first \nnominated in August 1995, but not confirmed until March 1998. When the \nfinal vote came, she was confirmed by unanimous consent and without a \nsingle negative vote, after having been stalled for almost 3 years. I \nrecall the nomination of\n\n[[Page S4091]]\n\nMichael Schattman to a vacancy on the Northern District of Texas. He \nnever got a hearing and was never acted upon, while his nomination \nlanguished for over two years. These are district court nominations \nthat could have helped respond to increased filings in the trial courts \nif acted upon by the Senate over the last several years. In addition to \nthese nominees, the Republican-led Senate failed to provide any \nhearings on nominees to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, \nwhich includes Texas, during the entire 6 years of their majority in \nthe Clinton administration.\n  Many of the vacancies in the Fifth Circuit are longstanding. For \nexample, despite the fact that President Clinton nominated Jorge \nRangel, a distinguished Hispanic attorney, to fill a fifth circuit \nvacancy in July 1997, Mr. Rangel never received a hearing and his \nnomination was returned to the President without Senate action at the \nend of 1998. On September 16, 1999, President Clinton nominated Enrique \nMoreno, another outstanding Hispanic attorney, to fill a vacancy on the \nfifth circuit but that nominee never received a hearing either. When \nPresident Bush took office last January, he withdrew the nomination of \nEnrique Moreno to the fifth circuit.\n  The surge of vacancies created on the Republicans' watch is being \ncleaned up under Democratic leadership in the Senate. The Senate \nreceived Justice Davis's and Mr. Hanen's nominations the last week in \nJanuary. Their ABA peer reviews were not received by the committee \nuntil late March and early April. Both participated in a confirmation \nhearing on April 25, were considered and reported by the committee last \nweek and are being considered and confirmed by the Senate today.\n  Justice Davis has been serving as Chief Justice of the Court of \nAppeals in Tyler, TX, since 2000 and has extensive experience \npracticing as a litigator before State and Federal courts. Mr. Hanen \nhas legal experience working as a civil trial attorney and in private \npractice for over 20 years, and has been a leader in establishing \nprograms to serve the needs of the disadvantaged.\n  The confirmations of Mr. Mays of Tennessee and Judge Rose of Ohio, \nwill fill two judgeships in the sixth circuit. They will make the \nfourth and fifth district court judgeships we have filled overall in \nthe sixth circuit since I became chairman last summer, including the \nthree earlier confirmations from Kentucky.\n  The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals currently has eight vacancies, \nmany of which are longstanding. Six of those vacancies arose before the \nJudiciary Committee was permitted to reorganize after the change in \nmajority last summer. None, zero, not one of the Clinton nominees to \nthose vacancies on the sixth circuit received a hearing by the \nJudiciary Committee under Republican leadership.\n  One of those seats has been vacant since 1995, the first term of \nPresident Clinton. Judge Helene White of the Michigan Court of Appeals \nwas nominated in January 1997 and did not receive a hearing on her \nnomination during the more than 1,500 days before her nomination was \nwithdrawn by President Bush in March of last year. Kathleen McCree \nLewis, a distinguished lawyer from a prestigious Michigan law firm, \nalso did not receive a hearing on her 1999 nomination to the sixth \ncircuit during the years it was pending before it was withdrawn by \nPresident Bush in March 2001. Professor Kent Markus, another \noutstanding nominee to a vacancy on the sixth circuit that arose in \n1999, never received a hearing on his nomination before his nomination \nwas returned to President Clinton without action in December 2000.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle held these seats open for years \nfor another President to fill, instead of proceeding fairly on \nconsensus nominees. Some were unwilling to move forward knowing that \nretirements and attrition would create four additional seats that would \narise naturally for the next President. That is why there are now eight \nvacancies on the sixth circuit. That is why it is half empty or half \nfull.\n  Long before some of the recent voices of concern were raised about \nthe vacancies on that court, Democratic Senators in 1997, 1998, 1999, \nand 2000 implored the Republican majority to give the sixth circuit \nnominees hearings. Those requests, not just for the sake of the \nnominees but for the sake of the public's business before the court, \nwere ignored. Numerous articles and editorials urged the Republican \nleadership to act on those nominations. Fourteen former presidents of \nthe Michigan State Bar pleaded for hearings on those nominations.\n  The former chief judge of the sixth circuit, Judge Gilbert Merritt, \nwrote to the Judiciary Committee chairman years ago to ask that the \nnominees get hearings and that the vacancies be filled. The chief judge \nnoted that, with four vacancies--the four vacancies that arose in the \nClinton administration--the sixth circuit ``is hurting badly and will \nnot be able to keep up with its work load due to the fact that the \nSenate Judiciary Committee has acted on none of the nominations to our \nCourt.'' He predicted:\n\n       By the time the next President is inaugurated, there will \n     be six vacancies on the court of appeals. Almost half of the \n     court will be vacant and will remain so for most of 2001 due \n     to the exigencies of the nomination process. Although the \n     President has nominated candidates, the Senate has refused to \n     take a vote on any of them.\n\n  Nonetheless, no sixth circuit hearings were held in the last 3 years \nof the Clinton administration, despite these pleas. Not one. Since the \nshift in majority the situation has been exacerbated as two additional \nvacancies have arisen.\n  With our April 25 hearing on the nomination of Judge Gibbons to the \nsixth circuit, we held the first hearing on a sixth circuit nomination \nin almost 5 years. And, with the confirmations of Judge Rose and Mr. \nMays, we have now confirmed all the nominees to the district courts in \nthe sixth circuit for whom we have received nominations. I note that \nthe White House has still not sent nominees for the six remaining \nvacancies that exist on the district courts in the sixth circuit.\n  As our action today demonstrates, again, we are moving at a fast pace \nto fill judicial vacancies with nominees who have strong bipartisan \nsupport. Partisan critics of these accomplishments ignore the facts. \nThe facts are that we are confirming President Bush's nominees at a \nfaster pace than the nominees of prior presidents, including those who \nworked closely with a Senate majority of the same political party.\n  The rate of confirmation in the past 10 months actually exceeds the \nrates of confirmation in the past three presidencies. For example, in \nthe first 15 months of the Clinton administration, 46 judicial nominees \nwere confirmed, a pace on average of 3.1 per month. In the first 15 \nmonths of the first Bush administration, judges were confirmed at a \npace of 1.8 judges per month. Even in the first 15 months of the Reagan \nadministration, when a staunchly Republican majority in the Senate was \nworking closely with a Republican President, 54 judges were confirmed, \na pace of 3.6 per month. In fewer than 10 months since the shift to a \nDemocratic majority in the Senate, President George W. Bush's judicial \nnominees have been confirmed at a rate of 5.6 judges per month, a \nfaster pace than for any of the past three Presidents.\n\n  During the 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control of the Senate, judicial \nconfirmations averaged 38 per year--a pace of consideration and \nconfirmation that we have already exceeded under Democratic leadership \nover these past 10 months in spite of all of the challenges facing \nCongress and the Nation during this period and all of the obstacles \nRepublicans have placed in our path. As of today, we have confirmed 56 \njudicial nominees in fewer than 10 months. This is more than twice as \nmany confirmations as George W. Bush's father had over a longer \nperiod--27 nominees in 15 months--than the period we have been in the \nmajority in the Senate.\n  The Republican critics typically compare apples to oranges to \nmischaracterize the achievements of the last 10 months. They complain \nthat we have not done 24 months of work in the 10 months we have been \nin the majority. Ironically, with today's confirmations, we even meet \nthat unfair standard: Within the last 10 months we have confirmed more \njudges than were confirmed by the Republican majority in the entire \n1996 congressional session and in all of 1997 combined--we have now \nexceeded their 2-year figure in 10 months.\n  A fair examination of the rate of confirmation shows that Democrats \nare\n\n[[Page S4092]]\n\nworking harder and faster on judicial nominees, confirming judges at a \nfaster pace than the rates of the past 20 years. The double standards \nasserted by Republican critics are just plain wrong and unfair, but \nthat does not seem to matter to Republicans intent on criticizing and \nbelittling every achievement of the Senate under a Democratic majority.\n  The Republican attack is based on the unfounded notion that the \nSenate has not kept up with attrition on the district courts and the \ncourts of appeals. Well, the Democratic majority in the Senate has not \nonly been keeping up with attrition but outpacing it, and we have \nstarted to move the vacancies numbers in the right direction--down. By \ncontrast, from January 1995 when the Republican majority took over \ncontrol of the Senate until July 2001, when the new Democratic majority \nwas allowed to reorganize, Federal judicial vacancies rose by almost 75 \npercent, from 63 to 110. When Members were finally allowed to be \nassigned to committees on July 10, we began with 110 judicial \nvacancies.\n  With today's confirmations of Justice Davis, Mr. Hanen, Judge Rose, \nand Mr. Mays, we have reduced the overall number of judicial vacancies \nto 84. Already, in fewer than 10 months in the majority, we more than \nkept up with attrition and begun to close the judicial vacancies gap \nthat grew so enormous under the Republican majority. Under Democratic \nleadership, we have reduced the number of district court vacancies by \nnearly 30 percent and the overall number of judicial vacancies by \nnearly 25 percent.\n\n  Overall, in 10 months, the Senate Judiciary Committee has held 17 \nhearings involving 61 judicial nominations and is scheduled this \nafternoon to hold its 18th hearing today involving four more judicial \nnominees. That is more hearings on judges than the Republican majority \nheld in any year of its control of the Senate--twice as many as they \nheld during some full years. Recall that one-sixth of President \nClinton's judicial nominees--more than 50--never got a committee \nhearing and committee vote from the Republican majority, which \nperpetuated longstanding vacancies into this year.\n  Despite the new-found concern from across the aisle about the number \nof judicial vacancies, no nominations hearings were held while the \nRepublicans controlled the Senate during the first half of last year. \nNo judges were confirmed during that time from among the many qualified \ncircuit court nominees received by the Senate on January 3, 2001, or \nfrom among the nominations received by the Senate on May 9, 2001.\n  The Democratic leadership acted promptly to address the number of \ndistrict and circuit vacancies that had been allowed to grow when the \nSenate was in Republican control. The Judiciary Committee noticed the \nfist hearing on judicial nominations within 10 minutes of the \nreorganization of the Senate and held that hearing on the day after the \ncommittee was assigned new members.\n  That initial hearing included two district court nominees and a court \nof appeal nominee on whom the Republican majority had refused to hold a \nhearing the year before. Within 2 weeks of the first hearing, we held a \nsecond hearing on judicial nominations that included another court of \nappeals nominee. I did try to schedule some district court nominees for \nthat hearing, but none of the files of the seven district court \nnominees pending before the committee was complete. Similarly, in the \nunprecedented hearings we held for judicial nominees during the August \nrecess, we attempted to schedule additional district court nominees but \nwe could not do so if their paperwork was not complete. Had we had \ncooperation from the Republican majority and the White House in our \nefforts, we could have held even more hearings for more district court \nnominees. Nevertheless, including our hearing scheduled for this week, \nin 10 tumultuous months, the committee will have held 18 hearings \ninvolving 65 judicial nominations.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding regular hearings on \njudicial nominees and giving nominees a vote in committee, in contrast \nto the practice of anonymous holds and other obstructionist tactics \nemployed by some during the period of Republican control. The \nDemocratic majority has reformed the process and practices used in the \npast to deny committee consideraiton of judicial nominees. We are \nmoving away from the anonymous holds that so dominated the process from \n1996 through 2000. We have made home State Senators' blue slips public \nfor the first time.\n\n  I do not mean by my comments to appear critical of Senator Hatch. \nMany times during the 6\\1/2\\ years he chaired the Judiciary Committee, \nI observed that, were the matter left up to us, we would have made more \nprogress on more judicial nominees. I thanked him during those years \nfor his efforts. I know that he would have liked to have been able to \ndo more and not have to leave so many vacancies and so many nominees \nwithout action.\n  I hope to hold additional hearings and make additional progress on \njudicial nominees. In our efforts to address the number of vacancies on \nthe circuit courts we inherited from the Republicans and to respond to \nwhat the President, Vice President Cheney and Senator Hatch now call a \nvacancy crisis, the committee has focused on consensus nominees. This \nwill help end the crisis caused by Republican delay and obstruction by \nconfirming as many of the President's judicial nominees as quickly as \npossible.\n  Most Senators understand that the more controversial nominees require \ngreater review. This process of careful review is part of our \ndemocratic process. It is a critical part of the checks and balances of \nour system of government that does not give the power to make lifetime \nappointments to one person alone to remake the courts along narrow \nideological lines, to pack the courts with judges whose views are \noutside of the mainstream of legal thought, and whose decisions would \nfurther divide our nation. The Senate should not and will not rubber \nstamp nominees who would undermine the independence and fairness of our \nFederal courts. It is our responsibility to preserve a fair, impartial \nand independent judiciary for all Americans, of all races, all \nreligions, whether rich or poor, whether Democrat or Republican.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle have falsely charged that if a \nnominee has a record as a conservative Republican, he will not be \nconsidered by the committee. That is simply untrue. Take, for example, \nthe nomination of Mr. Mays. Mr. Mays has been involved in more than 50 \npolitical campaigns on behalf of Republican candidates for President, \nSenate, Governor, and local offices. He is a member of the Republican \nNational Lawyers Association. He was a delegate to the Republican \nNational Convention in 2000, and he was on the Executive Committee of \nthe Tennessee Republican Party from 1986 through 1990. Thus, it would \nbe wrong to claim that we will not consider President George W. Bush's \nnominees with conservative credentials. We have done so repeatedly.\n  The next time Republican critics are bandying around charges that the \nDemocratic majority has failed to consider conservative judicial \nnominees, I hope someone will ask those critics about Mr. Mays, or all \nthe Federalist Society members and Republican Party activists this \nSenate has already confirmed. I certainly do not believe that President \nBush has appointed 56 liberal judges and neither does the White House.\n  The committee continues to try to accommodate Senators from both \nsides of the aisle. The court of appeals nominees included at hearings \nso far this year have been at the request of Senators Grassley, Lott, \nSpecter, Enzi, Smith, and Thompson, six Republican Senators who each \nsought a prompt hearing on a court of appeals nominee who was not among \nthose initially sent to the Senate in May 2001.\n  The whipsawing by the other side is truly remarkable. When we proceed \non nominees that they support and on whom they seek action, we are \ncriticized for not acting on others. When we direct our effort to \ntrying to solve problems in one circuit, they complain that we are not \nacting in another. Since these multiple problems arose on their watch \nwhile they were in the majority, it is a bit like the arsonist who \ncomplains that the local fire department is not responding fast enough \nto all of his destructive antics.\n  I imagine that today we will be hearing a refrain about the most \ncontroversial of President Bush's nominees who\n\n[[Page S4093]]\n\nhave not yet participated in a hearing. Some of them do not have the \nnecessary home-State Senate support needed to proceed. Some will take a \ngreat deal of time and effort for the committee to consider. In spite \nof all we have done and all we are doing, our partisan critics will act \nas if we have not held a single hearing on a single judicial nominee. \nThey will not acknowledge their role in creating what they now call a \njudicial vacancies crisis. They will not apologize for their harsh \ntactics in the 6\\1/2\\ years that preceded the shift in majority. They \nwill not acknowledge that the Democratic majority has moved faster on \nmore judges than they ever did. They will not acknowledge that we have \nbeen working at a record pace to seek to solve the problems they \ncreated.\n  Each of the 56 nominees confirmed by the Senate has received the \nunanimous, bipartisan backing of the committee. Today's confirmations \nmake the 53rd through 56th judicial nominees to be confirmed since I \nbecame chairman last July. I would like to commend the members of the \nJudiciary Committee and our Majority Leader Senator Daschle and \nAssistant Majority Leader Senator Reid for all of their hard work in \ngetting us to this point. The confirmation of the 56th judge in 10 \nmonths, especially these last 10 months, in spite of the unfair and \npersonal criticism to which they have each been subjected, is an \nextraordinary achievement and a real example of Democratic Senators \nacting in a bipartisan way even when some on the other side have \ncontinued to make our efforts toward progress as difficult as possible.\n  I again invite the President to join with us to fill the remaining \njudicial vacancies as quickly as possible with qualified, consensus \nnominees, nominees chosen from the mainstream and not for their \nideological orientation, nominees who will be fair and impartial judges \nand will ensure that an independent judiciary is the people's bulwark \nagainst a loss of their freedoms and rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am grateful for this opportunity to talk \nabout some of the things that are going on with regard to judges.\n  I believe that my chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee and \nthe record we established during the Clinton administration have been \nviciously attacked through the last number of months. There seem to be \na number of illusions floating around Capitol Hill relating to this \ncommittee's handling of judges during my tenure.\n  I am here to set the record straight. I am here to help everybody \nelse know what that record is.\n  The Democrats are in power. They set the pace and agenda for such \nnomination hearings, and they have a right to do so. I want to shine a \ncandle through five points that never seem to have seen the light of \nday in past discussions of confirmations.\n  First, there is a seemingly immortal myth around here that it was the \nRepublicans who created the current vacancy crisis by stalling \nPresident Clinton's nominees. That is purely and unmistakably false. \nThe fact is, the number of judicial vacancies decreased by 3 during the \n6 years of Republican leadership while I was chairman over what it was \nwhen the Democrats controlled.\n  There were 70 vacancies when I became chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee in January of 1995 and President Clinton was in office, and \nthere were 67 at the close of the 106th Congress in December 2000 and \nthe end of President Clinton's Presidency. The Republicans did not \ncreate or even add to the current vacancy crisis.\n  Each Member of this Senate is entitled to his or her opinion on what \nhappened, but not to his or her own set of facts. Enron-type accounting \nshould not be employed regardless of which liberal interest group is \ninsisting on it when we are talking about something as serious as our \nindependent judiciary.\n  Second, there has been considerable sleight of hand when it comes to \nthe true overall record of President Clinton's nominations. I worked \nwell with President Clinton. I did everything in my power to help him \nwith his nominations. One person does not control everything, but I did \neverything I knew how.\n  The undisputed fact is that Republicans treated a Democratic \nPresident equally as well as they did a Republican. We did not use any \nlitmus tests, regardless of our personal views, whether it was \nabortion, religion, race, or personal ideology. I am disappointed to \nnote that seems to be precisely what is happening with the Democrat-\ncontrolled Senate now.\n  Let's be honest and look at the facts. During President Clinton's 8 \nyears in office, the Senate confirmed 377 judges, essentially the same \nas, only 5 fewer than, the all-time confirmation champion, Ronald \nReagan, who had 382. President Reagan enjoyed 6 years of his own party \ncontrolling the Senate, while President Clinton had only 2. President \nClinton had to put up with 6 years of a Republican-controlled Senate.\n  This proves that the Republicans did not let partisanship get in the \nway of principle when it came to judicial nominations. True, there were \nindividual instances where a handful of nominees did not move, but it \nwas nothing like the systematic and calculated stalling tactics being \nemployed by this Democratic Senate to stop President Bush's highly \nqualified nominees.\n  At this point, I should also add the Clinton nominees we confirmed \nwere no mainstream moderates as some of us have been led to believe. We \nconfirmed nominees--and I am going to mention four--in one circuit; all \nfour were moved up to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We confirmed \nNinth Circuit nominees such as Judge Marcia Berzon, Judge Richard Paez, \nJudge Margaret Morrow, and Judge Willie Fletcher, and I could go on \ndown the line. These nominees were confirmed with my support as \nchairman. I can tell you not a single one of these would be \ncharacterized, by any measure of the imagination, as nominees with \npolitical ideology within the moderate mainstream. I have personal \npolitical views almost completely opposite them, but they were \nconfirmed.\n\n  I applied no litmus test to them. I reviewed them on their legal \ncapabilities and qualifications to be a judge, and that is all I am \nasking from the Democrat majority. That is not what is happening. It is \nclear there is this wholesale, calculated, slow-walking of President \nBush's nominees and particularly for the circuit court nominees.\n  Last year on this very day, May 9, we had 31 vacancies in the circuit \ncourts of appeals. Today there are 29--2 fewer. We are not making a lot \nof headway on these very important circuit court nominations.\n  I might add, yes, it took a lengthy period to go through some of \nthese nominees. Sometimes it was because objections were made; \nsometimes it was because of further investigation that had to occur; \nsometimes it was just because I had to fight with my own caucus to get \nthem through. But they did get through.\n  The third point I wish to make is that an illusion has been created \nout of thin air that the Republicans left an undue number of nominees \npending in a committee without votes at the end of the Clinton \nadministration. Again, more Arthur Andersen accountings. Get ready for \nthe truth.\n  There were 41 such nominees--I repeat, 41--which is 13 fewer than the \n54 whom Democrats who controlled the Senate in 1992 left at the end of \nthe first Bush administration. That is 41 under my chairmanship and 54 \nunder the Democrat-controlled Senate in 1992, at the end of the first \nBush administration.\n  My fourth point is, as you can see from this particular chart, I \nbelieve President Bush is being treated very unfairly. I will try to \npoint this out.\n  President Reagan and the first President Bush got all of their first \n11 circuit court nominees confirmed. All 11 were confirmed well within \none year of their nominations. This is a stark contrast to today: 8 of \ncurrent President Bush's first 11 nominations are still pending without \na hearing, despite being here for a whole year at the end of yesterday. \nAll have their ABA ratings. All are rated either well qualified, the \nhighest rating possible, or qualified, a high rating, and all but one \nhave their home State Senators' support, and that one is a North \nCarolina nominee for whom Senator Edwards has yet to return a blue \nslip.\n  I might add that the North Carolina nominee was nominated in the \nfirst\n\n[[Page S4094]]\n\nBush administration. So he has been pending for over 10 years. John \nRoberts--who is considered one of the two or three greatest appellate \nlawyers in this country by everybody who knows intimately what he has \ndone, both Democrats and Republicans--has been sitting here for 1 solid \nyear.\n  My fifth point, shown in this chart, is that President Clinton had \nthe privilege of seeing 97 of his first judicial nominees confirmed. \nThe average time from nomination to confirmation was 93 days. Such a \nrecord was par for the course until the current Senate leadership took \nover last year. President Reagan got 97 of his first 100 judicial \nnominations confirmed in an average of 36 days. Again, he had 6 years \nof a Republican Senate to help him. President H.W. Bush saw 95 of his \nfirst 100 confirmed in an average of 78 days, and for most of his \ntenure he had a Democrat-controlled Senate.\n  The ground rules obviously have been changed as the extreme interest \ngroups have reportedly instructed my Democratic colleagues. As we sit \nhere today, the Senate has confirmed only 52--only 52--not the 97 \nPresident Clinton got, but only 52 of President Bush's first 100 \nnominees, and the average number of days to confirm these nominees is \nover 150 and increasing every day.\n  The reason I mention these five points is that there are some people \nwho read the title of what we are doing today, and they hear what my \ncolleagues have to say, and ignore the fact that, of President Bush's \nfirst 11 nominations, only 3 of them have gotten through. Those 11 were \nmade on May 9 of last year. There is no historical justification for \nblocking President Bush's choices for the Federal judiciary. First, I \ndo not want to accuse my colleagues on the other side of doing that.\n  Second, there simply is no historic justification for blocking \nPresident Bush's first 11 or first 100 judicial nominees. Nor is there \nany truth to the myth that the vacancies we have today were caused by \nthe Republican Senate. They were caused by retiring judges. In other \nwords, anything conjured up from the past and dressed up as a reason to \nthwart the requests of President Bush should be dismissed.\n  Now I want to switch gears a little bit and say something I consider \nto be personal, even though it has had--and still could have--a lot of \nbearing on this process. Back before I became chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee in 1995, I was personally affected by several events that \noccurred under the auspices of advise and consent. These events \nincluded the mistreatment of nominees including Sessions, Bork, Thomas, \nRyskamp, Rehnquist, and others. In fact, even Justice Souter was not \ntreated really well when he came before the committee, and the main \nreason was they thought he might be anti-abortion.\n  I saw how politics can affect the human spirit both in success and \ndefeat. I saw how baseless allegations can take on a life of their own \nand how they can take away the life from their victims.\n  By the time I became chairman, I was determined to change the process \nthat had gotten so vicious. I worked to restore dignity back to the \nnominations process both in the Committee and the Senate. I championed \nthe cause of President Clinton's Supreme Court nominee Ruth Bader \nGinsburg, even though she was criticized by many as a liberal activist \nand was a former general counsel of the ACLU, nothing that bothered me. \nI used my influence to quiet her detractors. I helped secure her vote \nof 96 to 3.\n  Under my chairmanship, I ended the practice of inviting witnesses to \ncome into hearings to disparage the district court and circuit court \nnominees. In other words, I would not allow an outside group to come \nin. And there were plenty of them that wanted to. I dealt with the FBI \nbackground issues in private conference with Senators, never mentioning \nthem in public hearings. Now that is a practice I am concerned has not \nbeen followed.\n  It is a matter of great concern because sometimes we do have to delay \na hearing. We may have to put off some things because of further \ninvestigation, which may turn out be innocuous, or because of some \nserious charges that were raised, or because of something that has \narisen that needs to be discussed. Anytime somebody indicates we have \nto put off a hearing because of an FBI report--that essentially comes \ndown to telling everybody in the world. At the very least, it makes the \npublic draw the conclusion that there must be something wrong with this \nnominee. Of course, in most cases there is not.\n  Now I told interest groups, even the ones with which I agree and \nwhose work I like in other areas, that they were not welcome to come in \nand smear Clinton nominees. I refused to alter the 200-year tradition \nof deference to Presidents by shifting the burden onto nominees, and I \ninformed the White House of problems that could, if made public, lead a \nnominee to a humiliating vote so that the nominee could withdraw rather \nthan face that fate. These are the reasons we were able to confirm 377 \nClinton nominees.\n  Anybody who thinks they were within the mainstream did not look at \nthose nominees. We included some pretty contentious ones, such as the \nones I have mentioned earlier in my remarks, and I only mentioned four \nbecause they were from the one circuit. I could mention many. If we had \napplied the same litmus tests as our colleagues are applying to \nPresident Bush's judges, very few of President Clinton's nominees would \nhave gotten through.\n\n  I worked to get them confirmed. I stuck my neck out for them, and I \nstill believe to this day I did the right thing, even though I am \nincreasingly pessimistic that someone on the other side of the aisle \nwill step up to the plate and reciprocate for any Bush nominees who \nmight be in the same circumstance.\n  I urge and call upon the Democratic majority to show some leadership \nand put partisanship and the politics of personal destruction behind. \nGive fair hearings and confirmations of qualified nominees and keep the \njudiciary independent, as our forefathers intended. Keep the left-wing \ninterest groups out of the nominations process. Do not let them smear \nour people.\n  I will introduce some of the nominees that have been held hostage in \nthe Judiciary Committee this whole year. John Roberts, who is one of \nthe most qualified and respected appellate lawyers in this country, has \nargued 37 cases before the Supreme Court. He just won a Supreme Court \ncase 2 weeks ago for environmentalists. That was a historic property \nrights case. Miguel Estrada, who is a true American success story, \narrived in this country from Honduras as a teenager, taught himself \nEnglish, graduated with high honors from both Columbia and Harvard Law \nSchool, and has argued 15 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court--an \nexceptional Hispanic young man.\n  Professor Michael McConnell, from my State of Utah, one of the \ngreatest legal minds of our generation, is supported by top liberal \nlegal scholars Laurence Tribe of Harvard, Cass Sunstein of Chicago Law \nSchool, and many others. He is widely known to possess all the \nintelligence, temperament, and personal qualities that can make for an \noutstanding judge.\n  Jeffrey Sutton, a top legal advocate who graduated first in his class \nat the Ohio State College of Law, served as a law clerk to the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  There they are: John Roberts, Miguel Estrada, Michael McConnell, and \nJeffrey Sutton on the top of this chart.\n  I will go a little bit further. Then there is Deborah Cook at the \nSixth Circuit, who has overcome formidable obstacles in her personal \nlife and legal career, including breaking a glass ceiling when she \nbecame the first female attorney in her law firm. She has served with \ndistinction on the Ohio State Supreme Court.\n  Then there is Judge Dennis Shedd. He has a long and admirable record \nin public service. He was chief of staff of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and he is now a judge on the Federal district court. He \nalready knows his way around the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals where \nhe has been nominated to serve because he has already been designated \nby that court to hear over 30 of their cases and write a number of \nopinions. I should also note that Judge Shedd has the bipartisan \nsupport of both home State Senators.\n  Then there is Priscilla Owen of Texas, who is a litigator with 17 \nyears' experience and currently serving her 7th year as a justice on \nthe Texas Supreme Court. She is only the second woman even to sit on \nthat bench. She has been sitting, as have all these others, for over a \nyear now.\n\n[[Page S4095]]\n\n  Last but certainly not least, there is Judge Terrence Boyle, a judge \nwith 14 years' experience, who is a thoughtful, fair, and nonpartisan \njurist who has been waiting for a hearing for 11 years, ever since the \nfirst President Bush nominated him in 1991, and who has been designated \nto sit with the Fourth Circuit Court during 12 terms and has written \nmore than 20 circuit court opinions. That is how much they have honored \nhim. He was nominated, as I say, over 10 years ago and still has not \nhad a hearing.\n\n  These are all superbly qualified, mainstream jurists who are \ncommitted to the principle that judges should follow the law and not \nmake it up from the bench. They are also President Bush's selections. \nThey enjoy bipartisan support. They are not ideologues. The Senate \nDemocrats who are blocking them from having hearings should treat these \nnominees and the President who nominated them with fairness. I do not \nthink the process is fair now and have to speak out.\n  It is time for this Senate to examine the real situation in the \nJudiciary Committee rather than to listen to the more inventive ways of \nspinning. We have lots of work to do. Let us put the statistics judo \ngame behind us and get to work. We have been elected to do a job and \nlet's do it instead of making up excuses for why we are not doing it.\n  If we look at these eight nominees, John Roberts, unanimously well \nqualified by the gold standard according to our colleagues on the other \nside, the American Bar Association; Miguel Estrada, unanimously well \nqualified by the American Bar Association; Michael McConnell, \nunanimously well qualified by the American Bar Association; Jeffrey \nSutton, a majority qualified, a minority well qualified; Deborah Cook, \nunanimously qualified; Priscilla Owen, unanimously well qualified; \nDennis Shedd, a majority of the ABA committee found him well qualified; \nTerrence Boyle, unanimously qualified. There is no reason why they \nshould have sat there for 1 solid year.\n  I think the American people are disappointed; they want the Senate to \nhelp, not hinder, President Bush. I urge my friend across the aisle to \nfocus on this situation and step up the pace of hearings and votes and \ndo what is right for the country.\n  Having said that, I understand there are only four of the six judges \npending on the floor that will be voted on today. Unfortunately, one of \nthem who will not be voted on is a judge we recommended from Utah who \nis truly beloved out there and by many throughout the country. He is \none of the finest law professors in the country. He came out of the \ncommittee with a vote of only four of our committee voting against him. \nWhenever members of the committee had judges, I did everything in my \npower to put them to the head of the line and to get them through. \nThese two judges, Judge Paul Cassell, who is already approved by the \ncommittee, has been here for almost a year and will not get a vote \ntoday; and Judge Michael McConnell, who some say is probably one of the \ntwo or three greatest legal geniuses in the country, is still without a \nhearing--and I am ranking member.\n  This is bothering me to a large degree because I do not treat my \ncolleagues on the other side the way they are treating our nominees. I \nbelieve it has to change. I will do everything in my power to change \nit. Should we get back in the majority, I will move to do a lot better \njob than has ever been done before and, hopefully, we can correct some \nof the ills that we have all complained about in the past.\n  We have a 100-person body and it is not easy sometimes to get people \nthrough. I have to say, in comparison, we treated President Clinton's \nnominees fairly. There are some exceptions--I have to admit; there \nalways are--whether the Democrats or Republicans are in control of the \ncommittee. Look at the figures and facts. They were treated very \nfairly.\n  It is interesting to note how much my colleagues have changed their \ntune in the last year or so. Moments ago, my colleague criticized our \nPresident, President Bush, for using the phrase ``judicial vacancy \ncrisis.'' My colleague called this ``confrontational.'' Yet in June of \n1998, the Democrat leader of the Senate said that the ``vacancy crisis \nis the most serious problem.'' Has the phrase ``judicial crisis'' taken \non a new connotation, or is this simply another example of the shoe \nbeing put on the other foot? I don't think we should be tit for tat in \nthis body. Yes, we can always point to some nominees you wish could \nhave gotten through, whether Joe Biden was chairman or whether Orrin \nHatch was chairman. I know we both worked very hard to get them \nthrough.\n  I am concerned. I don't think President Bush is being treated fairly. \nI don't think the courts are being treated fairly. I don't think \nlitigants are being treated fairly when half of a circuit in the Sixth \nCircuit is without judges. That means the civil cases virtually cannot \nbe heard because they have to go to the criminal cases first, and many \nof those cannot be heard.\n  Justice delayed is justice denied. That is happening all over our \ncountry. I believe we have to change that.\n  Madam President, I support the confirmation of Samuel ``Hardy'' Mays, \nJr., to the United States District Court for the Western District of \nTennessee.\n  I have had the pleasure of reviewing Mr. Mays' distinguished career, \nand I can say without hesitation that he will be an excellent addition \nto the Federal judiciary.\n  Mr. Mays graduated in 1961 from Amherst College and attended Yale Law \nSchool, where he served on the editorial board of the law journal. \nAfter receiving his Juris Doctorate, Mr. Mays began an over-20-year \nassociation with the law firm presently known as Baker, Donelson, \nBearman & Caldwell. Mr. Mays became a partner in 1979. His law practice \nranged from trial work--where he represented clients such as small, \nfamily-owned businesses in litigation matters--to banking and health \ncare transactions.\n  In 1995 Mr. Mays entered government service as Tennessee Governor \nSunquist's legal counsel. Here his responsibilities included reviewing \nall legislation requiring the Governor's approval; reviewing all \nclemency matters and extraditions; advising the Governor on matters of \njudicial administration; reviewing and recommending all judicial \nappointments; and supervising, on behalf of the Governor, all \nlitigation to which the State of Tennessee was a party.\n  In 1997, recognizing Mr. Mays' hard work and legal talents, Governor \nSunquist promoted him to Deputy to the Governor and Chief of Staff. As \nChief of Staff, Mr. Mays became, in effect, the Chief Operating Officer \nof a State with approximately $19 billion in annual revenue. After \nleaving government service in 2000, he rejoined his old firm of Baker, \nDonelson.\n  No description of Mr. Mays' life would be complete without mentioning \nhis active membership on numerous committees and boards, whose purpose \nis to enrich the lives of the people of Memphis.\n  Mr. Mays is eminently qualified to be a member of the Federal bench. \nI comment President Bush for another extraordinary judicial nominee, \nand I sincerely hope that the Senate will begin to deal with the \ngrowing judicial crisis that this Nation is facing.\n  Madam President, I support the nomination of Andrew Hanen to be U.S. \nDistrict Judge for the Southern District of Texas.\n  It should be noted that in 1992 Mr. Hanen was nominated to the same \nposition by the first President Bush, but, regrettably, he was not \ngiven a hearing by the Democratic Senate. Still, as was the case 10 \nyears ago, I am confident he will serve with distinction on the Federal \ndistrict court.\n  Following graduation from Baylor University School of Law, where he \nfinished first in his class, Mr. Hanen clerked for a year with Chief \nJustice Joe Greenhill of the Texas Supreme Court. In 1979 Mr. Hanen \njoined the firm of Andrews & Kurth, handling medical malpractice \ndefense cases, commercial litigation, products liability, and legal \nmalpractice defense cases. In addition, he represented clients in cases \nin the areas of FELA, ERISA, lender liability, civil rights, and \nantitrust.\n  Following his unsuccessful nomination to the Federal bench in 1992, \nMr. Hanen, along with two others, opened his own law firm, which is now \ncomposed of 17 employees. Mr. Hanen has represented clients in \ncontract, patent litigation, toxic tort, mass tort, and personal injury \nmatters.\n  Mr. Hanen is a leader in the Houston Volunteer Lawyers Program. While\n\n[[Page S4096]]\n\nserving as president of the Houston Bar Association, Mr. Hanen has led \neffort to raise funds for additional pro bono work. Mr. Hanen has also \nbeen active in promoting and instituting pro bono legal services for \nAIDS and HIV-affected individuals. He volunteers with Habitat for \nHumanity, ADR programs, and various nonprofit groups.\n  I am very proud of this nominee and I know he will make a great \njudge.\n  Madam President, I support the nomination of Leonard E. Davis to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Eastern District of Texas.\n  I have had the pleasure of reviewing Judge Davis' distinguished legal \ncareer, and I have concluded, as did President Bush, that he is a fine \njurist who will add a great deal to the Federal bench in Texas.\n  Upon graduation from Baylor University School of Law, where he \nfinished first in his class, Leonard Davis joined the Tyler, TX, law \nfirm of Potter, Guinn, Minton & Roberts. He became a partner in 1979 \nand was managing partner from 1983 to 1990.\n  At the outset of his legal career, Judge Davis concentrated on \ninsurance defense work. He also handled a diverse caseload including \ncases involving worker's compensation, section 1983, automobile \naccidents, deceptive trade practices, products liability, and \nmalpractice. Later, as his practice developed, he focused primarily on \ncommercial litigation. In addition, Judge Davis was appointed to defend \nseveral indigents in Federal and State criminal cases involving murder, \naggravated assault, interstate transportation of stolen cattle, and tax \nevasion.\n  Judge Davis served on the Texas State Ethics Advisory Commission from \n1983-88 and on the State Judicial Districts Board from 1988-92. Judge \nDavis was appointed by then-Governor George W. Bush as Chief Justice of \nthe Twelfth Court of Appeals in Tyler, TX, where he has served since \n2000.\n  I have every confidence that Judge Leonard E. Davis will serve with \ndistinction on the Federal district court for the Eastern District of \nTexas.\n  Madam President, I rise in support of the confirmation of Judge \nThomas Rose to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nOhio.\n  After reviewing Judge Rose's distinguished legal career, I can state \nwithout reservation that he is a man of integrity and honesty and will \nbe a welcome addition to an already taxed judiciary.\n  Judge Rose graduated from Ohio University in 1970 with a Bachelors of \nScience in Education. He then went on to receive this Juris Doctorate \nfrom the University of Cincinnati College of Law in 1973.\n  After graduating law school, Judge Rose worked as a Greene County \nAssistant Prosecutor while maintaining a private practice. As a \nprosecutor, his responsibilities included addressing a wide range of \nissues from juvenile matters to capital murder cases. During this \nperiod, my colleague and good friend, Senator DeWine, was also a \nprosecutor for Greene County. Senator DeWine discovered that one of his \nsuperiors had bugged his office. Senator DeWine took the only honorable \naction available and resigned in protest. Judge Rose also resigned \nbecause he felt the office's integrity had been violated. Clearly, this \nshows that Judge Rose, who was not involved in this incident in any \nmanner, is a man who will put the interests of justice and fairness \nabove his own personal gain.\n  Judge Rose is also a man deeply devoted to his community. After \nleaving the prosecutor's office, he became Chief Juvenile Court Referee \nfor the Greene County Court of Common Pleas. In this position, he was \nresponsible for working with delinquent, neglected and abused children. \nCurrently, he is a Board Member of the Xenia Rotary Club and a member \nof three local Chambers of Commerce.\n  Later, under a new Greene County Prosecutor, Judge Rose became Chief \nAssistant Prosecutor in Charge of the Civil Division. In 1991, he rose \nto the bench as a Judge for the Greene County Common Pleas Court, \nGeneral Division. Currently, Judge Rose handles approximately 400 civil \nand 400 felony criminal cases annually.\n  Judge Rose's nomination is yet another example of the quality of \njudicial nominations that President Bush is making. I believe that we \nshould all follow the example set by the President when he said that it \nis time to provide fair hearings and prompt votes to all nominees, no \nmatter who controls the Senate or the White House. This is what I tried \nto do when I was chairman, and it is a standard to which we should now \naspire.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I wanted to say just a few words on \nthis subject of judicial nominations.\n  Not everyone realizes how important the Federal courts are. They are \nextraordinarily important. Once judges are confirmed by the Senate, \nthey hold lifetime appointments. Although the focus tends to be on the \nSupreme Court, the reality is that well over 99 percent of all cases \nnever reach that court. These cases are decided by district judges and \ncircuit judges who most Americans have never heard of. The final \ndecisions made by these judges resolve the most fundamental questions \nabout our civil rights and individual rights. Every single day, these \njudges make decisions that literally make and break people's lives.\n  So it is critical that we examine nominations to the Federal bench \nvery carefully, particularly when those nominations raise serious \nquestions.\n  Of course, being deliberate does not mean being dilatory. But Madam \nPresident, the truth is that the Senate is confirming large numbers of \nnominees. As of today, the Senate will have confirmed 56 judges, \nincluding 9 to the courts of appeals. That is a faster pace than in the \nlast 6 years of the Clinton administration. In those six years, the \nnumber of vacancies in the Federal appeals courts more than doubled, \nfrom 16 to 33. Today, that vacancy level is down from 33 to 29.\n  To sum up, I believe that when it comes to judges, we are doing our \njob carefully, and we are doing our job well.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I am very pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering the nomination of Samuel Mays, whom everybody in Tennessee \nknows as ``Hardy,'' to be a U.S. District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Tennessee.\n  I am grateful to Chairman Leahy and the Judiciary Committee and its \nstaff for moving Mr. Mays's nomination so quickly. The need is quite \nurgent. The Western District of Tennessee typically has four judges \nassigned to hear cases in Memphis, along with a fifth who hears cases \nin Jackson. Only two of those four seats are currently filled with \njudges hearing cases, and the nomination of one of those two judges to \nthe Court of Appeals is now pending before the Senate. A third seat, \nthe one to which Mr. Mays has been nominated, is vacant. The fourth \njudge is currently on disability leave. So moving Mr. Mays's nomination \nso promptly is imperative for litigants with cases pending in the \nWestern District.\n  Hardy Mays is very well known to the bar of the Western District of \nTennessee. He was born and raised in Memphis. He graduated from Amherst \nCollege in 1970 and in 1973 from Yale Law School, where he served as an \neditor of the law journal.\n  He returned home to Memphis, where he joined the law firm that is \ntoday known as Baker, Donelson, Bearman & Caldwell, at which he \npracticed law for over 20 years, and which was also the firm of our \nformer colleague, Senator Howard Baker, now U.S. Ambassador to Japan. \nAlthough Mr. Mays started his practice as a tax and banking lawyer, he \nsoon shifted his focus to litigation. He represented clients before the \nlocal, State, and Federal courts in west Tennessee in a wide variety of \ncivil cases. While his practice continued to evolve into one primarily \nconcentrated on banking law issues, Mr. Mays continued to try cases \nuntil 1985. During his time as a litigator, Mr. Mays tried over 25 \ncases to judgment. Many of these cases were in Federal court. His peers \nrecognized his standing at the bar and selected him as a member of the \nboard of directors of the Memphis Bar Association, a position he held \nfrom 1985 to 1987.\n  In 1987, he became managing partner of his firm, a move that forced \nhim to give up litigation. He helped turn the firm into a regional law \nfirm, opening offices in Nashville and Chattanooga. He gave up his \nposition as managing partner of the firm in 1988 and returned to the \nfull-time practice of law. By then, his practice had again evolved into \none focused on health law and related practice areas.\n\n[[Page S4097]]\n\n  In 1995, Mr. Mays joined the administration of Governor Don Sundquist \nas his legal counsel. Two years later, he became the Governor's chief \nof staff. In these positions, he served the people of Tennessee ably \nand tirelessly. He was highly regarded during his tenure with Governor \nSundquist.\n  In 2000, he returned to his former law firm, where he has continued \nto practice law focused on representing health care providers.\n  Mr. Mays is highly regarded by the bar for his intellect, legal \nability, fairness, and his unfailing good humor. I am confident that he \nhas the ideal temperament to serve in the stressful position of a trial \njudge. Mr. Mays enjoys broad, bipartisan support. I know the Judiciary \nCommittee has heard from a number of prominent Democrats, including \nMemphis Mayor Willie Herenton; President Clinton's U.S. Attorney in \nMemphis, Veronica Coleman-Davis; former Tennessee Governor Ned \nMcWherter; and our former colleague, Senator Harlan Matthews, in \nsupport of the nomination of Mr. Mays.\n  In addition to his record of professional accomplishments, no \nrecitation of Mr. Mays's career would be complete without reference to \nhis extraordinary commitment to his community. While I will not take \nthe time to detail the full scope of his community involvement, \nincluding his significant political activities, I do want to focus on \none aspect of his involvement with his neighbors: the arts in Memphis \nwould be far poorer without his contributions. He serves or has served \nas a director of the Memphis Orchestra, Opera Memphis, the Memphis \nBallet, the Playhouse on the Square, the Decorative Arts Trust, and the \nMemphis Brooks Museum, and the Memphis Botanic Garden.\n  Hardy Mays is an excellent choice to serve as Federal district judge \nin Memphis. I appreciate the President's decision to nominate him, and \nI am grateful to the Judiciary Committee for considering his nomination \nso promptly. I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, the Senate and the Judiciary Committee \nhave been under Democratic leadership for 10 months. During that 10 \nmonths, Chairman Leahy and the Judiciary Committee staff have worked \novertime to establish a steady process to fill judicial vacancies. In \nthe 10 months, each one of my Democratic colleagues has taken time from \ntheir busy schedules to chair multiple nominations hearings.\n  Hearings on nominees began less than a week after the Senate \nreorganized, and have continued on a monthly, or twice monthly basis, \nright up to this afternoon. As you have heard repeatedly today, in 10 \nmonths we have confirmed 52 judges, and have 4 more awaiting \nconfirmation today. We have held hearings on 13 Court of Appeals \nnominees. This afternoon, I will convene a hearing on four additional \nnominees including one for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Our \nrecord on confirmations is good.\n  So it has been a continual surprise to me that my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have complained day after day, that the Senate \nwas not confirming judges. This is particularly surprising as those \ndoing the complaining sit beside me week after week as we continue to \nhold hearings and vote these nominees out of the Committee.\n  The problem is not that the Senate has not been confirming judges. \nAny reasonable examination of the record makes clear that the Committee \nis working hard to confirm more judges than in past years. We have \nconfirmed many strong Republican judges who are impartial, ethical, and \nwho bring to their decision making an open mindedness to the arguments \npresented. My own experience in reviewing the record of nominees who \nhave come before me makes clear that judges who are qualified, moderate \ncandidates, who are held in high esteem by lawyers in their community, \nand who have a record of fair-minded decision making will be promptly \nconfirmed.\n  The problem is that a few controversial nominees have not yet \nreceived hearings. President Bush last year nominated individuals to \nthe Circuit Court of Appeals who are among the most conservative the \nSenate has ever considered. Many of these nominees have long records of \ndecisions and writings that are far outside mainstream thinking. They \nhave records that call into question their commitment to upholding \nprecedent, and to respecting individual rights. When questions like \nthese are raised about a nominee, the Committee must undertake a \nthorough examination of the nominee, and that takes time.\n  The Supreme Court hears fewer than 100 cases per year and circuit \ncourt judges make the final decisions in hundreds of cases a year that \nset precedent for thousands of additional cases. Senate confirmation is \nthe only check upon federal judges appointed for life. I take seriously \nthe responsibility to carefully review these nominees and to reflect \nupon the power they will hold to affect the lives of ordinary Americans \nin the workplace, the voting booth, and in the privacy of their home.\n  When the Senate confirms nominees to fill the remaining existing \nvacancies, as I am confident that it will, 11 of the 13 Circuit Courts \nwill be dominated by conservative jurists. These same courts have \nincreasingly issued rulings that have curtailed the power of Congress \nto enact laws to protect women from domestic violence, prevent \ndiscrimination based on disabilities, and to protect the environment. \nRulings have increasingly limited the ability and the opportunity for \nwomen to exercise their right to reproductive freedom; limited the \nopportunity for education and advancement by curtailing programs \npromoting racial and ethnic diversity in our schools and workplaces; \nand overturned laws protecting workers. Balance in each of the branches \nof our government is a key precept of our democracy, and balance in the \nFederal judiciary is, in my opinion, crucial to ensure that the \nAmerican public maintains its unquestioned respect for and deference to \nthe rulings of our Federal judiciary.\n  Americans in huge numbers favor reproductive choice, and the right to \nwork in a safe workplace free from injury and regardless of physical \ndisability. They believe in the need for government to take steps to \nprotect our environment for future generations, and to protect \nconsumers from unfair and deceitful business practices. These are the \nvalues that are placed in jeopardy by extreme nominees. It is the \nresponsibility of the Senate and of the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee to ensure that the people we seat on the Federal bench share \nthe same respect for these rights.\n  The reality is appointments to the judiciary have become more \npoliticized over the past 20 years. If the Senate is truly interested \nin filling all the outstanding vacancies as quickly as possible, we \nmust work together to find nominees who can help to correct the current \nimbalance on the courts. We need to see more cooperation and \nconsultation between the White House and the members of the Senate, and \na willingness to compromise on nominees who do not present a threat to \nvalues and rights that mainstream Americans accept and welcome. We have \nan amazing pool of talent in our legal community, and it would be a \nsimple matter to nominate more mainstream nominees.\n  It is my hope that as we continue to work to fill existing vacancies, \nthat it will become more possible to work together to find candidates \nfor nomination who unite, not who seek to divide.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, today, May 9, 2002, marks one year to \nthe date that I was at the White House when President Bush announced \nthe nominations of Deborah Cook and Jeffrey Sutton for the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. However, one year later, no action has been \ntaken on these Ohioans, as well as five other nominees to the Sixth \nCircuit. In fact, the entire judicial nominee process has been \negregiously delayed over this past year.\n  There are currently over 96 vacancies in the Federal courts, enough \nthat the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, William Rehnquist, \nreferred to the vacancy crisis is ``alarming.'' It certainly is \nalarming to note that these vacancies exist despite the fact that \nPresident Bush has nominated nearly 100 judges in his first year of \noffice, more judges than any President in history. At the same point in \nhis administration, President Clinton had nominated only 74 judges. In \naddition, former President Bush had nominated 46 and President Reagan \nhad nominated 59.\n\n[[Page S4098]]\n\n  Despite this overwhelming number of nominees, as of April 12, 2002, \nthe Senate has only confirmed 42 of President Bush's 98 nominees. More \negregious is the fact that only 7 of President Bush's 29 nominees to \nthe circuit courts have been confirmed. No circuit has felt this delay \nmore powerfully than the Sixth.\n  Since 1998, the number of vacant judgeship months in the Sixth \nCircuit has increased from 13.7 to 60.9 and is currently the highest in \nthe Nation. The median time from the filing of a notice of appeal to \ndisposition of the case in the Sixth Circuit was 15.3 months in 2001, \nwell above the 10.9 months national average, and second in the Nation \nonly to the Ninth Circuit.\n  Clearly the Sixth Circuit is in crisis and the reason is the inaction \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  When I talk to Ohio practitioners, I hear many complaints about the \noveruse of visiting judges throughout the Sixth Circuit. One lawyer \ntold me that one of the visiting judges on his panel was from as far \naway as the Western District of Louisiana. In fact, the Sixth Circuit \nhas the highest number of visiting judges providing service: 59 \nvisiting judges participated in the disposition of 1,626 cases for the \n12-month period ending September 30, 2001.\n  It is time to put a stop to this logjam of Sixth Circuit nominees and \nallow our overburdened appeals courts to operate free of partisan \nwrangling. In particular, it is time to give Justice Deborah Cook and \nJeffrey Sutton a hearing, and allow their nominations to be considered \nby the full Senate.\n  In all candor, I can not think of two individuals more qualified or \nbetter prepared to assume the solemn responsibilities of the Sixth \nCircuit bench than Deborah Cook and Jeffrey Sutton.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing Deborah Cook for over 25 years. \nThroughout, I have found her to be a woman of exceptional character and \nintegrity. Her professional demeanor and thorough knowledge combine to \nmake her truly an excellent candidate for an appointment to the Sixth \nCircuit. Deborah Cook has served with distinction on Ohio's Supreme \nCourt since her election in 1994 and reelection in 2000. My only regret \nis that with her confirmation to the Sixth Circuit, we will lose her on \nthe Supreme Court of Ohio.\n  With a combined 10 years of appellate judicial experience on the Ohio \nCourt of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court, Deborah Cook uniquely \ncombines keen intellect, legal scholarship and consistency in her \nopinions. She is a strong advocate of applying the law without fear or \nfavor and not making policy towards a particular constituency. Deborah \nCook is a committed individual and a trusted leader, and it is my \npleasure to give her my highest recommendation.\n  I am also very pleased to speak on behalf of Jeffrey Sutton, a man of \nunquestioned intelligence and qualifications, with vast experience in \ncommercial, constitutional and appellate litigation. Jeffrey Sutton \ngraduated first in his law school class, followed by two clerkships \nwith the United States Supreme Court, as well as the Second Circuit. As \nhe was the State Solicitor of Ohio when I was Governor, I worked with \nhim extensively when he represented the Governor's office, and in my \njudgment, he never exhibited any predisposition with regard to an \nissue. He has contributed so much and his compassion for people and the \nlaw is so evident. In my opinion, Jeffrey Sutton is exactly what the \nfederal bench needs: a fresh, objective perspective.\n  Jeffrey Sutton's qualifications for this judgeship are best evidenced \nthrough his experience. He has argued nine cases before the United \nStates Supreme Court, including Hohn v. United States, in which the \nCourt invited Mr. Sutton's participation, and Becker v. Montgomery, in \nwhich he represented a prisoner's interests pro bono. He has also \nargued twelve cases in the Ohio Supreme Court and six cases in the \nSixth Circuit. While his participation in controversial cases has, in \nsome instances, led to a clouding of his qualifications and \naccomplishments, what his detractors fail to mention is how he argued \npro bono on behalf of a blind student seeking admission to medical \nschool or how he filed an amicus curiae brief with the Ohio Supreme \nCourt in support of Ohio's Hate Crimes law on behalf of the Anti-\nDefamation League, the NAACP and the Ohio Human Rights Bar Association. \nJeffrey Sutton should not be criticized on assumptions that past legal \npositions reflect his personal views. Instead, he should be lauded for \nalways zealously advocating his client's interests, no matter the \nissue. I know Jeff. He is a man of exceptional character and \ncompassion. For these and many other reasons, Jeffrey Sutton will be an \nunquestioned asset to the Federal Bench.\n  As you may know, the Sixth Circuit is in desperate need of judicial \nappointments. Fourteen judicial vacancies now exist, one of which has \nbeen vacant since 1995. Furthermore, the Administrative Office of the \nU.S. Courts has declared five of these vacancies to be judicial \nemergencies within the U.S. federal court system.\n  Given the crisis in the Sixth Circuit and the exemplary records of \nJustice Cook and Jeffrey Sutton, I respectfully urge the Judiciary \nCommittee to hold hearings on their nominations as soon as possible, \nand expeditiously move them to the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees. President Bush says that we need to \nmove these nominees swiftly and fairly. He wants our support for his \nnominees. I agree. The Senate needs to act to fill these vacancies and \nensure that the Federal courts are operating at full strength.\n  Right now, President Bush has sent a number of extremely qualified \nmen and women to the Senate for consideration to the Federal bench. But \nunfortunately, many of these outstanding individuals are still waiting \nfor a hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe 47 nominees \nare still pending. We need to move these judicial nominations quickly, \nbecause they are all good men and women.\n  I want to talk about a few facts and figures. We've heard a lot of \nnumbers being thrown around by both the Democrats and the Republicans \nabout who delayed who the longest, who denied hearings to whom, and on \nand on, so we are left in a numbers daze. I get dizzy from all the \nnumbers. But this what I think is the bottom line. When President Bush \nSr., left office, he had 54 nominees pending with a Democratic Senate. \nThe vacancy rate was 11.5 percent. When President Clinton left office, \nhe had 41 nominees pending with a Republican Senate. The vacancy rate \nwas 7.9 percent. So the way I see it, Senate Republicans gave the \nDemocratic President a better deal. The other bottom line is that a \nyear, 365 days, after President Bush nominated his first 11 circuit \ncourt nominees, only 3 have been confirmed. By contrast, each of the 3 \nprevious Presidents enjoyed a 100 percent confirmation rate on their \nfirst 11 circuit nominees, and they were all confirmed within a year. \nThe way I see it, President Bush is getting the short end of the stick \nwith his nominees.\n  I'd like to talk about some of President Bush's nominees, \nspecifically the 8 nominees of the 11 original circuit court nominees \nsent up last May who are still pending without action. Today a full \nyear has gone by, 365 days, with only 3 of President Bush's first 11 \nnominees having seen any action at all. And of those 3, I understand 2 \nwere judges previously nominated by President Clinton. The Senate needs \nto do better than that. These individuals of exceptional experience, \nintellect and character deserve to be treated fairly and considered by \nthe Senate promptly.\n  Let me say a few words about each of these nominees. I know that some \nof my colleagues may have already given many details about these \nindividuals, but I think that it is important that Americans see what \nquality individuals President Bush has sent up to the Senate. These \nindividuals have all excelled in their legal careers and I'm sure, if \nconfirmed, they will all make excellent judges.\n  Judge Terrence Boyle is President Bush's nominee for the Fourth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. He is currently the Chief Judge of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, appointed by \nPresident Reagan in 1984. He has served in this post with distinction. \nHe was nominated to the Fourth Circuit in 1991 by President Bush Sr., \nbut he did not receive a hearing from the Democrat-controlled Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Justice Deborah Cook is President Bush's nominee to the Sixth Circuit\n\n[[Page S4099]]\n\nCourt of Appeals. After graduation from law school, Justice Cook became \nthe first female attorney hired at the oldest law firm in Akron, OH, \nand just 5 years later, she was named a partner. She then served on the \nOhio Court of Appeals for 4 years, and in 1994 she became a justice on \nthe Ohio Supreme Court. Her pro bono work is laudable: Judge Cook is a \nfounder and trustee of a mentored college scholarship program in Akron, \nand I understand she and her husband personally fund efforts to help \ninner-city children go to college.\n\n  Miguel Estrada is one of President Bush's nominees to the D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals. He has an incredible story, having immigrated \nto the United States when he was young without even speaking English, \nto then graduate with honors from Columbia College and Harvard Law \nSchool. He clerked for the Second Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court, \nthen served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of \nNew York, where he became Deputy Chief of the Appellate Section in the \nOffice. Mr. Estrada acted as Assistant to the Solicitor General for 5 \nyears in both the Bush and Clinton administrations. If he is confirmed, \nMr. Estrada would be the first Hispanic judge on the D.C. Circuit Court \nof Appeals.\n  Michael McConnell is President Bush's nominee to the Tenth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. He graduated from the University of Chicago Law \nSchool and then clerked for Judge Skelly Wright on the D.C. Circuit, \nand Justice William J. Brennan on the U.S. Supreme Court. Professor \nMcConnell was a tenured professor at the University of Chicago Law \nSchool for more than a decade before accepting the Presidential \nProfessorship at the University of Utah College of Law in 1997. He has \nearned the reputation of being one of the top constitutional scholars \nin the country.\n  Justice Priscilla Owen is President Bush's nominee to the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Justice Owen spent 17 years as a litigator \nwith a top Houston law firm. Currently, Ms. Owen is serving her 7th \nyear as Associate Justice on the Texas Supreme Court, she is only the \nsecond woman ever to sit on that bench. She has great professional \ncredentials, and has demonstrated a strong commitment to her community.\n  John Roberts is President Bush's other outstanding nominee to the \nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. He is one of the most qualified and \nrespected appellate lawyers in the country. Mr. Roberts has had a \ndistinguished record in private practice, and he has performed a \nsignificant amount of pro bono legal service. He also served as Deputy \nSolicitor General of the United States. Mr. Roberts' background in \npublic office and private office are outstanding.\n  Judge Dennis Shedd is President Bush's nominee to the Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. He has a long and admirable record of public service, \nboth in the legislature and in the Federal courts, as well as in \nprivate practice and academia. Judge Shedd worked as the Chief Counsel \nand Staff Director for the Senate Judiciary Committee under then-\nChairman Strom Thurmond. He was appointed a district court judge for \nthe District of South Carolina in 1990, where he has served with \ndistinction.\n  Jeffrey Sutton is President Bush's nominee to the Sixth Circuit Court \nof Appeals. Mr. Sutton clerked for Justices Scalia and Powell on the \nU.S. Supreme Court, then spent three distinguished years as Solicitor \nfor the State of Ohio. Since that time, Jeffrey Sutton has worked in \nprivate practice and served as an adjunct professor of law at the Ohio \nState University College of Law.\n  These eight outstanding nominees are still waiting for a hearing, \neven though they are some of the most respected judges and lawyers and \nprofessors in the country. They have excellent qualifications, are of \nhigh moral character, and will serve our country well. They all have \nratings of ``well qualified'' or ``qualified'' by the American Bar \nAssociation, the so-called ``gold standard'' by the Democrats on the \nJudiciary Committee. It's clear that the Senate Judiciary Committee \nneeds to do its job and schedule them for a hearing and markup.\n  Let's give these good men and women what they deserve, to be treated \nwith respect. They need a prompt hearing and markup. They have waited \ntoo long. The Senate has to act. Like the President said, the American \npeople deserve better.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for \nthe confirmation of Samuel Hardwicke Mays, Jr., of Memphis TN, as U.S. \nDistrict Judge for the Western District of Tennessee. I am also \ngrateful to President Bush for his nomination of an individual who I \nknow will act with fairness to all in a way which will make all of us \nproud.\n  Hardy Mays is a Memphis institution. No one lives life more to the \nfullest than Hardy whose passion for the arts, a good book, the law and \npublic service is known to all.\n  As have so many others, I first sought his counsel when I decided to \nrun for the United States Senate. Since then, I have turned to Hardy \nfor advice on a variety of occasions, and I value the thoughtful, \nbalanced approach he can bring to any issue. And I am proud to call him \nmy friend.\n  More importantly, he is an outstanding lawyer with a keen intellect. \nHe is fair and impartial, and has enormous compassion for his fellow \nman. Hardy has demonstrated, both in his distinguished legal career \nwith the Baker, Donelson firm in Memphis, and his life in public \nservice as Legal Counsel and Chief of Staff to Governor Don Sundquist, \nhis unique ability to hear all sides of an issue, to work with people \nfrom all walks of life, and to find equitable solutions to virtually \nany challenge. His personal and professional integrity are above \nreproach, and his even temperament is ideally suited for the federal \nbench.\n  Many outstanding Tennesseans have added their support to Hardy's \nnomination. They most often have mentioned to me his brilliant mind, \nsense of fair play and lack of personal bias, good wit, and respect for \nother's views and opinions.\n  Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1776 that our judges ``should always be men \nof learning and experience in the laws, of exemplary morals, great \npatience, calmness and attention.'' Samuel Hardwicke Mays, Jr., \ncertainly fits President Jefferson's description. He will serve our \ncountry with distinction, and his talent, experience and energy will be \nan asset to our Federal judicial system.\n  I ask unanimous consent after Senator Feingold speaks that Senator \nHutchinson be permitted to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, does the Senator have the \ntime? How much time is remaining on both sides? I don't want to object, \nbut I know the Republican and Democrat leader have 11:35 for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 5 minutes 41 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD: Madam President, today the Senate is going to confirm \nfour more of President Bush's nominees to the Federal bench. While \nthere is no controversy about these particular nominees, there has been \nmuch debate here on the floor about the pace of confirmations. And \ntoday, because this is the anniversary of President Bush's announcement \nof his first batch of judicial nominations, we have been told to expect \na series of events designed to criticize the majority leader and the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee for their conduct of the \nconfirmation process and to pressure them to move this process along \nfaster.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues on the floor this morning to make \na few points about this.\n  First, though I am sure the complaints will never stop, on the basis \nof the numbers alone, it is awfully hard to find fault with the pace of \njudicial confirmations. Since the Democrats took control of the Senate \nlast June, we have confirmed 52 judges, not including the four whom we \nwill vote on today, which will bring the total to 56. In under a year, \nthat is more judges than were confirmed in four out of the six years of \nRepublican control of the Senate under President Clinton.\n  Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy has vowed not to treat \nPresident Bush's nominees as badly as our predecessors treated \nPresident\n\n[[Page S4100]]\n\nClinton's nominees. I believe he is fulfilling that pledge, but \nfrankly, he doesn't have to work all that hard to do that.\n  For example, our friends on the Republican side are complaining that \nsome of President Bush's nominees from last May 9 have not yet been \nconfirmed. On today's anniversary of those nominations, I'm sure we'll \nhear a lot about that. So let's just put that in perspective.\n  Let's assume for the sake of argument that these individuals have \nactually waited 365 days, a full year. We all know that at this time, \nthat's not really accurate. First, Democrats took control of the Senate \nin June 2001. Our committee was not organized so that nominations \nhearings could be held until July 10, 2001. So it's really been only 10 \nmonths that we have been in a position to confirm any of the May 9 \nnominees.\n  Second, and just as significantly, under this administration, the \nAmerican Bar Association can't start its review of a nomination until \nafter the nomination is formally announced. During the Clinton \nadministration, as under all previous administrations, Republican and \nDemocrat, dating back to President Eisenhower, the ABA conducted its \nreviews of nominations before they were sent to the Senate. President \nBush's unfortunate decision to change the way the White House handles \nthe ABA review has added 30-60 days to the process as compared to prior \nyears. That has to be factored into any claims. They are the result of \nthe President's own choice of cutting the ABA out of the process.\n\n  Assume for the sake of argument that all these nominees have been \nwaiting 365 days to be considered by the Senate. That is still 140 days \nshy of the 505 days that Richard Lazarra waited between his nomination \nby President Clinton and his confirmation by the Senate. And Judge \nLazarra, now serving on the district court of Florida, didn't wait the \nlongest. No, the period between his nomination and confirmation is only \nthe 15th longest of the Clinton appointed judges. So when nominees of \nPresident Bush have been waiting a year, however that is calculated, \nthey won't even crack the top 15 of the Clinton judges who waited the \nlongest to be confirmed.\n  Actually, the longest wait during the Clinton administration was \nendured by Judge Richard Paez, now on the Ninth Circuit--1,520 days--\nover four years. That's in another league altogether from the delay, if \nyou can call it that at this point, on some of President Bush's May 9 \nnominees. Nine Clinton judges waited more than 2 years before they were \nconfirmed. If all of the May 9 judges still awaiting confirmation are \nstill pending in the committee on May 9, 2003, then maybe we should \ntalk about a delay. I am absolutely certain that will not be the case.\n  Now so far, I have been talking about judges who were ultimately \nconfirmed. But we all know that not all of President Clinton's nominees \nwere confirmed. Far from it. In fact, 38 judicial nominees never even \ngot a hearing in the last Congress, including 15 court of appeals \nnominees. Three other nominees received hearings but never made it out \nof committee. The nominations of eight court of appeals nominees who \nnever got a hearing and one who got a hearing but no committee vote, \nwere pending for more than a year at the end of the 106th Congress. In \nall, more than half of President Clinton's nominees to the circuit \ncourts in 1999 and 2000 never received a hearing.\n  Those who are concerned about circuit court vacancies, if they are \nbeing honest, must lay the problem directly at the feet of the majority \nin the Senate during President Clinton's last term. Many of those who \nare now loudly criticizing Chairman Leahy  refused to recognize the \nresults of the 1996 election and dragged their feet for 4 years on \njudicial nominations. Some of the vacancies that President Bush is now \ntrying to fill actually date back to 1996 or even 1994.\n\n  So what are we to do about this? One alternative is to simply rubber \nstamp the President's nominees. That is what some would have us do. I, \nfor one, am thankful that that is not the approach of Chairman Leahy or \nMajority Leader Dashcle. We have a solemn constitutional obligation to \nadvise and consent on nominations to these positions on the bench that \ncarry with them a lifetime term. We must closely scrutinize the records \nof the nominees to these positions. It is our duty as Senators.\n  That duty is enhanced by the history I have just discussed. If we \nconfirm the President's nominees without close scrutiny, we would \nsimply be rewarding the obstructionism that the President's party \nengaged in over the last six years by allowing him to fill with his \nchoices seats that his party held open for years, even when qualified \nnominees were advanced by President Clinton.\n  The most important part of the scrutiny we must do is to look at the \nrecords of these nominees. Many of them are already judges, at the \nState level or on a lower court. There is nothing wrong with examining \ntheir work product; indeed, that is the best indicator of how they will \nperform in the positions to which they have been nominated.\n  Some have complained that it is improper for the committee to ask to \nsee copies of the unpublished opinions of judges nominated for the \nCircuit Court who are currently serving as District judges. I disagree. \nLet me be clear that we have not, as the Wall Street Journal editorial \npage recently stated, asked judges to go back and write ruling in cases \nwhere they have ruled orally from the bench. That is laughable. No, we \nsimply asked for the judge's work product--the judge's written rulings. \nUnpublished opinions are binding on the parties in the case. They are \nthe law. They are the judge's decisions. And we who are charged with \nevaluating the fitness of a sitting judge for a higher court have every \nright to examine those decisions--before making our decision.\n  I commend Chairman Leahy on his work on nominations thus far. Fifty-\nsix confirmations in less than a year as chairman is an admirable \nrecord. I am sure he won't keep any nominee waiting for 4 years before \ngetting a confirmation vote. I am sure we won't finish this Congress \nhaving held hearings for fewer than half of the President's circuit \ncourt nominees. Most of all, I'm sure he will continue to treat this \nconfirmation process with the dignity and respect and care it deserves. \nThe courts, our system of justice, and the American people deserve no \nless.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield time to the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the distinguished \nSenator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I have been listening to the debate \ntoday. I certainly want to say I have a very good friend who is a \nnominee for the Fifth Circuit, who was nominated 1 year ago today, \nPriscilla Owen, who I hope will get a fair hearing because she is one \nof the most qualified people who has ever been nominated for the Fifth \nCircuit.\n  But I want to use my time this morning to give the due accolades to \ntwo judges on whom we will vote who are district judges. The circuit \ncourt judges are the ones about whom everyone has been talking and \nabout whom people are very concerned. But we have two very qualified \ndistrict judges who are going to be confirmed today. I want to speak \nfor them.\n  The first nominee is Andy Hanen. Andy Hanen was nominated in June of \n2001 to serve as Federal judge for the Southern District of Texas. He \nwas also nominated for this judgeship 10 years ago by former President \nBush. His nomination expired at the end of the congressional session \nand was not renewed by President Clinton.\n  Andy is a 1975 cum laude graduate of Denison University in Ohio, \nwhere he studied economics and political science. In 1978 he earned his \nlaw degree from Baylor University School of Law. He ranked first in his \nclass and was president of the Student Bar Association and a member of \nthe Baylor Law Review.\n  As a founding partner of the Houston law firm Hanen, Alexander, \nJohnson & Spalding, he has gained extensive civil trial experience, \nhalf of which was in Federal court. He went on to win a number of \naccolades, including Outstanding Young Lawyer of Texas, awarded by the \nState bar. He was elected president of the Houston Bar Association in \n1998 and is currently a director of the State Bar of Texas. He has \ndistinguished himself throughout his\n\n[[Page S4101]]\n\ncareer through civic and volunteer committees. He is an active member \nof the community and contributes his time to charities such as Habitat \nfor Humanity, Sunshine Kids, and the Red Cross.\n  The Southern District of Texas is one of those that are in dire need \nof all the judicial vacancies being filled. I am very pleased to \nsupport Andy Hanen.\n  Leonard Davis has been nominated to serve on the Eastern District of \nTexas. He is a judge on the Circuit Court of Appeals for Texas, with an \noutstanding record. He, too, was nominated by former President Bush, \nbut the nomination expired and was not renewed by President Clinton.\n  He earned a mathematics degree from UT Arlington and a master's \ndegree in management from Texas Christian University. He earned his law \ndegree from Baylor University School of Law, where he graduated first \nin his class. He went on to practice civil and criminal law for 23 \nyears and handled hundreds of cases in State and Federal courts. He was \nappointed to his current position as Chief Justice of the 12th Circuit \nCourt of Appeals of the State of Texas by then-President George W. Bush \nand has enjoyed strong bipartisan support and no opposition to his \nreelection in November of 2000.\n  He has served on numerous boards and commissions, including the State \nEthics Advisory Commission, the State Bar of Texas's Legal Publications \nCommittee, and the American Heart Association's Board of Directors.\n  Judge Leonard Davis is a long-time friend of mine. I believe he, too, \nwill serve our country well.\n  I urge my colleagues to support both of these Texas nominees for \ndistrict court benches--Andy Hanen and Leonard Davis.\n  Madam President, I also would like to say one more thing about Judge \nPriscilla Owen, a justice of the supreme court, and ask that she be \nconsidered for her Fifth Circuit nomination.\n  Every newspaper in Texas endorsed Justice Owen for her reelection bid \nin 2000 for the Supreme Court of Texas. On February 10 of this year, a \nDallas Morning News editorial said:\n\n       Justice Owen's lifelong record is one of accomplishment and \n     integrity.\n\n  During her reelection campaign, the Houston Chronicle said, in a \nSeptember 24, 2000, editorial:\n\n       A conservative, Owen has the proper balance of judicial \n     experience, solid legal scholarship, and real world know-how \n     to continue to be an asset on the high court.\n\n  I do hope Justice Owen will receive due consideration for her \nnomination to the Fifth Circuit, and certainly I hope the Senate will \nact on these circuit court judge nominees. We have many vacancies that \nneed to be filled. I urge the Senate to take action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 8 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And the Senator from Utah?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Senator from Ohio has asked for time \nto make a statement. I yield that time to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nconfirmation of Judge Thomas M. Rose, whom the President has nominated \nfor the post of U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Ohio, \nWestern Division. I first met Tom Rose 29 years ago when we were both \nserving as assistant county prosecuting attorneys in Greene County, OH. \nI can tell you without reservation that he is a man of great integrity, \nhonor, and intelligence. I do not know a more qualified, more \nexperienced candidate for this judgeship.\n  Tom, who comes from Laurelville, OH, graduated from Ohio University \nin 1970, and received his law degree from the University of \nCincinnati's College of Law in 1973. Also in 1973, he was appointed as \nAssistant County Prosecutor in Greene County; he became the first \nMagistrate in the Greene County Juvenile Court in 1976; and he became \nthe Chief Assistant Prosecutor in charge of the Civil Division in 1978. \nIn 1991, he became the Judge of the Court of Common Pleas in Greene \nCounty.\n  During these last 11 years on the Common Pleas Court bench, Ohio's \nhighest trial court, Judge Rose has presided over a wide range of cases \nfrom criminal cases to civil cases to administrative appeals. He has \nfaced a tremendous volume of cases, many of which have been of \nunprecedented complexity. For example, Judge Rose recently presided \nover Ohio's first pro se murder case in which the defendant could have \nreceived the maximum sentence of death.\n  In addition, he has heard hundreds of the kinds of civil cases and \nadministrative appeals that dominate a common pleas docket, tax \nappeals, annexation questions, school districting disputes, and \ninsurance issues. In a particularly complex civil case, Judge Rose \nruled on a case of first impression involving an ordinance enacted by a \nlocal Ohio city to put impact fees on developers.\n  In both criminal and civil cases, he has ruled on hundreds of motions \nto suppress and other constitutional issues, such as search and seizure \nand Miranda rights.\n  All of this demonstrates, that without question, Judge Rose is right \nfor this job. His background and the depth of his wide-ranging \nexperience on the bench, the experience that makes him so well \nqualified for the Ohio district judgeship. I am confident that he will \ndischarge his duties of Federal judge with the fairness, integrity, \nsound judgment, and energy that the people of Ohio and this Nation \ndeserve. I whole-heartedly support his confirmation, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I truly believe, as I said in the debate, \nDemocrats have been and will continue to be more fair than the \nRepublicans were to President Clinton's judicial nominees. The fact is \nthat more than 50 of President Clinton's nominees never got a vote. \nMany languished for years before they were returned without even having \na hearing. Others waited for years, up to even 4 years to be confirmed.\n  We are moving through, as we have these last 10 months, in filling \nvacancies with consensus nominees.\n  I voted for the vast majority of these nominees. I voted for all but \none of these nominees.\n  They are going to be Republicans. We know they are going to be \nconservatives. That is fine.\n  But I am not going to vote for somebody who will put a sign up over \nthe Federal court saying this is no longer an independent court.\n  If the White House would only work with us instead of working against \nus, we could end the vacancy crisis by the end of next year.\n  Many partisans in the other party appear, unfortunately, to have \ndecided to make judges a domestic agenda item on which this \nadministration is intent on winning partisan, political, and \nideological victories. Given the closely divided Senate--and the \nCongress--and the narrow electoral victory of the President, the better \ncourse would have been to work together on vacancies that we inherited \nfrom the Republican Senate.\n  Republicans held court of appeals judgeships open for years. Now they \nsee their chance to pack the courts and stack the deck with \nconservative judicial activists in order to tilt the outcomes on these \ncourts.\n  The American people do not want--and our justice system does not \nneed--a finger on the scales of justice. It is up to the Senate to \nmaintain the independence of the courts and the balance on them. That \nmeans resisting the appointment of ends-oriented and ideologically-\ndriven nominees. Do not be fooled about what the fight over circuit \ncourt nominations is about.\n  Republicans, perhaps brilliantly from a political point of view, but \ndisastrous from the point of view of the independence of the courts, \nkept vacancies on the Fifth, Sixth, and D.C. Circuits open for the last \n5 years. Now they have a President with a list of what he views as \n``reliable nominees.'' They are trying to get these ideological \nnominees through.\n\n  This is not a political fight that we in my party have chosen. \nIndeed, the President's recent fundraising campaign swing through the \nSouth and the\n\n[[Page S4102]]\n\nantagonistic efforts of his political adviser, Karl Rove, make clear \nthat the Republicans have chosen this fight because they think it \nserves their political advantage.\n  They are deadly serious about their efforts to gain control of the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit, the Sixth, and the Fifth Circuits, and \nothers--even to the point of questioning the religious background of \nmembers of the Senate Judiciary Committee, something I have never seen \nin 28 years in the Senate. It is one of the most reprehensible tactics \nthat I have seen in my time in the Senate. I respect the religious \nbackground of every Member. I do not know the background of most; it is \nnone of my business. I would never question the religious background of \nany nominee.\n  I resent greatly people on the other side of the aisle questioning my \nreligion or the religion of members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  This battle is over whether the circuit courts have judges who will \nfollow precedent, respect congressional action, and act to protect \nindividual rights of Americans, or become dominated by ideologically-\ndriven activists.\n  I will continue to evaluate all of President Bush's nominees fairly, \nand to work in spite of the obstructionism and unfair criticism coming \nfrom the Republican side.\n  In the weeks and months to come we will be called upon to vote on \nsome very controversial activist nominees. The rights of all Americans \nare at stake.\n  We have to ask whether a fair-minded, independent judiciary will \nsurvive to protect our fundamental civil liberties and constitutional \nrights, and whether our children and grandchildren will be able to look \nto the Federal judiciary for even-handed justice and protection.\n  That is what hangs in the balance.\n  I again invite the President and all Republicans to join with us in \nworking to fill the remaining judicial vacancies with qualified, \nconsensus nominees chosen from the mainstream, and not chosen for their \nideological orientation--nominees who will be fair and impartial \njudges, and who will ensure that an independent judiciary will be the \nbulwark against the loss of our freedoms and rights.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the American people are right to ask why \nthis unprecedented departure from the past is happening. My colleague \njust accused me of accusing him of religious discrimination. He has \nmischaracterized my pleas for civility and fairness.\n  Some of my Democrat colleagues have made no bones about the fact that \nthey are slowing down the President's nominees because they are \nimposing, for the first time, an ideological litmus test. This is \nsomething I can not accept.\n  Many Americans are concerned that the abortion litmus test that some \nDemocrats are imposing on judicial nominees would have the same effect \nas a religious test. Let me explain how. Most people who are pro-choice \nhold their position as a matter of ideology. Some even allow their \nchosen ideology to trump the tenets of their religion. They do so in \ngood conscience no doubt, and I respect that and would not judge them \nfor that.\n  But the great majority of people who are pro-life come to their \npositions as a result of their personal religious convictions. We view \nunborn life as sacred. Many Americans hold this view as a religious \ntenet, but this view does not affect their ability to interpret the law \nand precedent, just as skin color does not.\n  In effect, what is ideology to my Democrat friends is a matter of \nreligious conviction to a large portion of the American people, \nregardless of their position on abortion. But many rightly fear that a \njudge with private pro-life views, which often derives from religious \nconviction, will ever again be confirmed in a Democrat-led Senate.\n  To impose an abortion litmus test on private views, call it \nideological if you want to, is to exclude from our judiciary a large \nnumber of people of religious conviction, who are perfectly prepared to \nfollow the law. I fear this is the door this Democrat-led Senate could \nbe opening. If a nominee who was personally pro-life came before the \ncommittee and said they could not follow Supreme Court precedent \nbecause of their pro-life views, then I would have a problem with that \nnominee too. But to simply discriminate against them and say that we \ncan not trust you, despite your assurances to the Senate, to follow \nprecedent, because you hold certain personal view, is pure and simple \nreligious discrimination.\n\n  I can understand why people would believe that a religious test is \nbeing imposed. They fear as I do that the result would be a federal \njudiciary that neither looks like America nor speaks to America.\n  I am afraid that what is now occurring is far beyond the mere tug-of-\nwar politics that unfortunately surrounds Senate judicial confirmation \nsince Robert Bork. Some of my colleagues are out to effect a \nfundamental change in our constitutional system, as they were \nreportedly instructed to do by noted liberal law professors at a \nretreat early last year.\n  Rather than seeking to determine the judiciousness of a nominee and \nwhether a nominee will be able to rule on the law or the Constitution \nwithout personal bias, they want to guarantee that our judges all think \nin the same way, a way that is much further to the left of mainstream \nthan most Americans.\n  The legitimacy of our courts, and especially the Supreme Court, comes \nfrom much more than black robes and a high bench. It comes from the \npeople's belief that judges and justices will apply a judicial \nphilosophy without regard to personal politics or bias.\n  So I am protecting the Senator's right to free religion, not \ndisparaging his religion. This is nothing like the often-used and \noffensive race-card that the Democrats often used.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \neach of the four nominees.\n  I also urge the Senate and the administration to work at keeping the \nimpartiality of the Federal judiciary.\n  I urge those on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue to stop making \nthis a political partisan game but to do what is best for the country.\n  I yield any time remaining that I may have.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield whatever time I may have remaining.\n\n\n                 Vote on Nomination of Leonard E. Davis\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk briefly this afternoon in \nmorning business about a matter that I know is of great importance to a \nnumber of people across the country, an issue that was the subject of \nsome discussion in the health committee just this morning.\n  Students are borrowing too much, and students are working too much in \norder to finance rising college costs.\n  Sixty-four percent of all students borrow Federal student loans to \nfinance a college education today. The typical undergraduate student \ngraduates with about $17,000 in Federal loan debt.\n  Student debt is skyrocketing. As a result, many students find \nthemselves saddled with unimaginable levels of student loan debt and \nexperience difficulty in repaying their loans. An estimated 39 percent \nof all student borrowers today graduate with unimaginable student loan \ndebt.\n  The administration, in late April, proposed to exacerbate the current \ncircumstances in ways that were inexplicable to many of us. They \nproposed to raise student loan interest rates for consolidated loans by \nchanging the consolidation loan interest rate from a fixed to variable \nrates. This proposal has come along, as I noted, when millions of \nstudents are struggling to pay for college.\n  According to the Department of Education, the typical borrower now \ngraduates with almost $17,000 in Federal student loan debt, as I noted \na moment ago. And more than half of all Pell grant recipients graduate \nwith student loan debt as well. The typical Pell grant recipient who \nborrows graduates with almost $19,000 in loan debt.\n  The Office of Management and Budget, on April 25, released a third \n``Offset Options for the Supplemental'' appropriations bill that is \ncurrently pending in the House. Many of us were intrigued with the \noffset option that they chose to use involving student loan \nconsolidation. I will quote from the document. It is under the category \n``For $1.3 billion for the Pell Grant shortfall, Student loan \nconsolidation proposal.'' And they stipulate that would raise $1.3 \nbillion. Now I am quoting from the OMB document:\n\n       Changing the interest rate formula from fixed to variable \n     is a good thing as fixed rate consolidation loans: can result \n     in significant Federal costs; have higher average costs to \n     borrowers; needlessly penalize borrows who consolidate their \n     loans when variable interest rates are high; and, can have a \n     destabilizing effect in the guaranteed loan program.\n\n  The proposal that the administration made through the OMB would cost \nthe typical student borrower $2,800, and the typical Pell grant \nrecipient, who borrows, $3,100 over the life of their loans.\n  So in order to raise that $1.3 billion for which they are proposing \nto offset, in part, the costs of the supplemental, what they want to do \nis charge the typical borrower an additional $2,800 and the typical \nPell grant recipient $3,100 over the life of the loan.\n  Senator Kennedy has held a hearing this morning. We were very pleased \nthat the administration appears now to have had a change of heart, for \nthey have announced they are reversing their position. They now \nrecognize that this was a major error and that they will now no longer \nadhere to that offset as they look to ways in which to find the money \nto pay for the supplemental.\n  We are very pleased with the administration's announcement that they \nwill not advocate this additional burden on students, both for student \nloans as well as Pell grants.\n  But I must say, I thank the distinguished chair of the HELP Committee \nfor calling this to the attention of our colleagues, for calling it to \nthe attention, really, of the educational community. Because of his \nstalwart advocacy, and the extraordinary attention that this issue has \ngenerated over the last couple of weeks, I am not surprised that \nthe administration has now had a change of heart.\n\n  This was not a good idea. And, obviously, they have now come to that \nconclusion as well.\n  So it is good news for students. It is good news for education. And \nit is especially good news for those advocates, as Senator Kennedy has \npersonified, who have called for this change of heart from the day it \nwas announced.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to preface my question with \nthis observation: Under the leadership of Senator Daschle, there were \n46 Members of the Senate--under his leadership and Senator Reid's, and \nothers--who wrote a letter to the President some 10 days ago, \nrecognizing that if this policy of the administration went ahead, it \nwould be like increasing taxes for the average working family by \n$3,700. That would be the average increase if they did not consolidate. \nIt could go as high as $10,000.\n  I am wondering, I did not hear that we ever received a response to \nthat letter requesting the deferral of that action.\n  As Senator pointed out, I think all of us in this body want to, \nfirst, give the assurances to young people in college that we are going \nto do everything we possibly can to make college affordable.\n  And this is my question to the leader: Doesn't the leader believe \nthat we have a real responsibility to do everything we possibly can to \nmake sure college is going to be more affordable for working families \nand for the middle income, and that we are also going to stand to make \nsure we meet our commitment we made to the American people and to the \nschoolchildren with regard to the early education bill, that we are \ngoing to try to meet our commitment to those students, to the families, \nto the parents, and to the local communities as well?\n  I am interested in hearing, as the majority leader of the Senate, how \nimportant you think it is that we continue the effort to ensure we are \ngoing to make the dreams of our young people attainable--through \nquality education in K-12, and through higher education--and how \nstrongly the leader is committed to doing that, after thanking the \nadministration for changing their position.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, no one knows more about the commitment we \nhave made to the students who want to be involved in higher education \nthan the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. He can probably tell \nus the very day it was done. But in recent times, we have increased the \ncap, the availability of resources through both loans as well as the \nPell grants to students in order to accommodate their additional costs.\n  We have recognized that their costs continue to go up. We have \nrecognized how serious the financial problems are that many of these \nstudents have experienced. As a result, we have increased the caps. \nThat is why the original OMB decision is so mystifying. Because as we \nraise the caps, if we raise the cost, then we have not done anything to \nhelp the students, so we have made this raise in eligibility for \nadditional assistance virtually meaningless.\n  I might say, there is a trend here because that is basically what we \ndid with the No Child Left Behind Act as well. We provided more \nopportunities for students in many respects, but then we underfund by \nmore than $1 billion the resources we should be providing to ensure \nthat act is fully funded.\n\n  So there appears to be rhetoric, and then there is the reality. There \nis the rhetoric, and then there is the resources. The rhetoric is: We \nwant to help all these students. The rhetoric is: We don't want to \nleave any child behind. The reality is, we do not provide the resources \nto see that it happens--whether it is an OMB decision on student loans \nor the decision that the budget implies on the part of the \nadministration to fund the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would like to thank the leader personally on behalf \nof hundreds of thousands of students\n\n[[Page S4105]]\n\nand their families in Michigan for his leadership on this issue. And I \nalso thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership.\n  When I first heard about what the administration was proposing, I was \nastounded. I received calls from so many students and families in \nMichigan.\n  We all know, as you indicated, that Pell grants are important, \nparticularly to lower income students. But so many middle-income \nfamilies rely on the loan program, and rely on the ability to receive \nthe lowest possible interest rate in order to be able to send their \nchildren to college.\n  I have to say, on a personal note, having had a son go through \ncollege and a daughter who is now in college, for myself with loans, I \ncertainly appreciate what families feel.\n  When we saw the proposal to increase, essentially, the interest \nrates, it was nothing more than a tax on the ability of young people to \nbe able to go to college and pursue the American dream. And we all \ncertainly have a stake in making sure we do that.\n  So I thank the majority leader for his leadership. I know that the \nSenator from Massachusetts, as well, has been vigilant.\n  It is good news that they have appeared to change their minds, but we \ncertainly know that minds can be changed again. As we go through this \nprocess, I know we will all stand together to make sure that this is an \narea we do not touch. I cannot imagine something more important than \nmaking sure the young people, the adults, and families of this country \nhave the opportunity to get the skills they need to be successful in \nour economy. I am proud to stand with the majority leader in support of \nthis goal.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Michigan. She has been a \ntremendous advocate for education ever since the day she was sworn. I \nam grateful to her for her engagement and her willingness to continue \nto work with us. She was one of the signatories on the letter the \nSenator from Massachusetts has referenced. I thank her very much.\n  She made an interesting point. She said, what the administration has \ndecided could be decided in another direction at some later date, and \nwe might find ourselves in yet another set of circumstances involving \nthe very same problem; that is, the rhetoric versus the reality, the \nrhetoric versus the resources. We will be going into appropriations. I \nworry about the rhetoric versus the resources once again. Are we going \nto be able to ensure that we can provide the commitment to students at \nall levels, that the resources will be there to match the rhetoric that \nwe hear coming from the administration with regard to their commitment \non education? I have my doubts.\n  We have at least two instances now so far--the student loan issue as \nwell as the no child left behind question--where the rhetoric has far \nexceeded the results and the reality and the resources. I appreciate \nher comment in that regard.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I had been traveling around Minnesota a couple years ago \nwhile seeking this office, and I was stunned by the increasing number \nof students who were relying on loans and by the increased amount of \nmoney that undergraduates and graduates were building up in debt before \nthey even got their first job in the workplace. It is $25,000 for \nsomebody attending a 4-year public institution in Minnesota; $50,000, \neven in a couple cases over $100,000, for people who have come out of \ngraduate programs. Have you had that same experience in South Dakota in \nthe last few years?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Minnesota is exactly right. I don't \nknow what the amount is in South Dakota for the typical student, but \nthe typical student nationally now graduates with about $17,000 in \nFederal loan debt. My guess is, it is somewhat lower in South Dakota. I \nhave talked to a lot of students who are very concerned about paying \noff that debt, very concerned about the debt service they have to pay \non a regular basis when they graduate. This is something about which \nthey are very concerned. Thirty-nine percent of all student borrowers \ngraduate today with what is termed an unmanageable student loan debt.\n  There is no question, this is a matter that is of increased concern \nto students all over the country, especially those in the Upper Midwest \nsuch as Minnesota and South Dakota. This is why we were so mystified \nwhen they said, we are going to ask students, on top of all the debt \nthey currently have, to pay an additional $2,800 for a typical loan or \n$3,100 for a Pell grant recipient. I can't imagine how we would want to \nexacerbate their problems by adding even further cost on to the \noverwhelming loan debt that many of them already have.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I wanted the leader to be here because he mentioned it \nbriefly. I wanted to pick up on the fact that we have all joined in the \nletter sent to the President. I say ``joined'' because we depend on the \nSenator from Massachusetts for so many things. I want to see if the \nleader will agree--and I know he does--the Senator, as we know, has a \ngreat pedigree, but there is no one who serves in the Senate--I am not \ntoo sure has ever served in the United States--who has been more \ninterested and more concerned about the people who have no one here to \nrepresent them.\n  I made a couple of notes. On seniors, we have had no leader in the \nSenate such as the senior Senator from Massachusetts, whether it is \nMedicare, whether it is prescription drugs--you list the issues seniors \nare interested in, including Social Security--he is always leading the \ncharge in that regard.\n  If you talk about the poor, bankruptcy, food stamps, he is always out \nin front, as well as on the minimum wage, Medicaid. And then when you \ntalk about education, of course, his committee has written legislation, \nnot the least of which is the work that was done in leaving no child \nbehind, which is a great piece of legislation. We need to make sure \nthere is money there. The environment, hate crimes, nuclear victims, I \nam so impressed with the work the Senator from Massachusetts does.\n  And while people come to us all the time--you certainly more than I, \ndeservedly--about the things we have done, we usually, on many of the \nissues I have mentioned, take the lead from the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Would the Senator agree with me that, in the history of the Senate, \nthere have been very few Ted Kennedys who have been able to do things \nsuch as this, and every college student and parent who is paying off a \nloan I am sure can understand what I am saying. Would the Senator \nagree?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. In the history of the Senate, I would say there has only \nbeen one Ted Kennedy. But the point is so well taken. For 35 years, \nthis giant of the Senate has done remarkable things, probably has more \nlegislation attributable to his contribution in this body than anybody \nin recent times. We certainly recognize his many accomplishments. It is \nnot only the level of accomplishment and achievement but the manner in \nwhich he accomplishes them that is noteworthy. I appreciate very much \nhis calling attention to this issue as well.\n  This is another example. This became an issue when the country, \nthrough his committee and his leadership, was put on notice about the \nimplications of this $1.3 billion offset. We are very grateful to him \nfor his work in this regard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield, I am grateful to both of my \ncolleagues for their kind and overly generous remarks. I plan to be \nhere for a while longer.\n  Let me just carry on and ask the majority leader, the President, with \nwhom we worked on education, was in southern Wisconsin earlier this \nweek talking about the Federal Government having a responsibility. He \nsaid: Generally that responsibility is to write a healthy check. We did \nso in 2002; $22 billion for secondary, elementary education, a 25-\npercent increase. We have increased money 35 percent for teacher \nrecruitment, teacher retention, and teacher pay.\n  Does the Senator not find it somewhat perplexing that we see in this \nchart the Bush proposed increase for 2002 is 3.5 percent? It increased \nin 2002 as a result of the leadership of the Senators from South Dakota \nand Nevada and the Democrats. We got it up to 20 percent. The President \nis taking credit\n\n[[Page S4106]]\n\nfor it out here in the Midwest. And now we have this year 12.8 percent. \nDo we find that somewhat perplexing when we have the President saying \nwe have our responsibilities to write a healthy check? Well, the check \nwas written and we increased it, but the Bush proposal is at 2.8 \npercent.\n  I wanted to mention, in the area which is of such central importance \nto educational reform, that is, having a quality teacher in every \nclassroom, of all the educational issues, and there are many--\nafterschool programs, the construction issues, smaller class sizes--\nhaving a well-trained teacher in every classroom was key.\n  The President was out in the Midwest another day talking about all \nthe work they have done, increasing teacher recruitment, retention, and \npay, 35 percent. That is represented in this $742 million. We supported \nevery penny of it.\n  Well, now, look at this fiscal year's proposed budget for the very \nsame function. Zero. Not even the cost of living. Zero. I am just \nwondering; when the Senator talks about the difference between rhetoric \nand reality, there must be people in the Senator's own State who have \nto wonder about that as well. I am just, again, wondering whether it \nisn't important for us, as we are coming into the debate and national \nelections in 2002--money doesn't solve everything, but money is a \npretty clear indication of a nation's priorities. I know the leader \nreached his hand out to the Republican leader and we passed a strong \nbipartisan bill that had reform. I think most of us thought we needed \nreform and resources.\n  This is enormously troublesome to me in terms of the K through 12, as \nthe efforts by the administration are to prohibit consolidation. I \nwonder whether the leader agrees with me that education is a key \npriority and that we are going to have to watch every aspect of it as \nwe continue through this legislative session so that we are going to \nmeet our responsibilities to families across the country and sharing \nquality education, K through 12, and even earlier education and college \neducation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I heard someone say the other day: You \ncan't fool all the people all the time, but why not give it a try.\n  I think that is, in essence, what we find the administration \nattempting to do when it comes to education--simply assert that they \nare for it and try to fool all the people all the time. But the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts points out the problems with that strategy. You \ncan't fool all the people all the time, when the resources simply don't \nspeak to the reality.\n  That is exactly the problem the administration continues to face. The \nresources don't speak to the reality. The resources fall far short of \nthe reality. We can all assert we are for education and that we are not \ngoing to leave any child behind. But I can tell you, there are South \nDakota children left behind, there are Massachusetts children left \nbehind, and Nevada and Minnesota children are left behind. I think that \nis the question we are going to continue to face throughout the \nremainder of the year: Will we leave these children behind because this \nadministration refuses to provide the resources? I hope not.\n  Today, we got a good indication that, at least in one instance, they \nhave changed their minds. When it comes to students, they will provide \nthe resources that match the initial reality. We have a lot more of \nthese instances in store, but I think we have made the first \ndownpayment in the effort. I thank and applaud the Senator from \nMassachusetts for doing so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4106-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4106-S4108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, last week Senator Campbell and I sent a \nletter to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee expressing our \nconcern about the state of the judicial confirmation process. We shared \nwith the chairman our thoughts on the serious injustice being served on \nthe American people by the committee's failure to provide hearings for \nthe President's judicial nominations.\n  It is unfortunate that the citizens of the United States must bear \nthe consequences of the Judiciary Committee's delaying tactics. It is \nunfortunate that the citizens must bear the burden of delayed justice. \nOne year ago, President Bush forwarded his first 11 judicial circuit \ncourt nominees to the Judiciary Committee. Every person in this group \nof nominees received a ``qualified'' or ``well-qualified'' rating from \nthe American Bar Association. Now, 365 days later, 8 of the original 11 \nnominees are yet to receive a hearing. One year later, we are still \nwaiting to have a hearing for 8 of those 11 nominees.\n  This weekend also marks the 1-year anniversary since the President \nnominated Tim Tymkovich for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. So, \ntoday, 1 year since he was nominated by the President, I stand before \nyou still hoping Mr. Tymkovich will have a hearing, still hoping to \nfill the 3-year vacancy in the Tenth Circuit, and still hoping that the \npeople of Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Nebraska will no \nlonger be victimized by a vacant bench--a bench paralyzed by a lack of \npersonnel to move quickly through an overwhelming caseload.\n  So now Mr. Tymkovich, the former solicitor general of Colorado, waits \nindefinitely for the opportunity to serve his country. He waits \nindefinitely for his opportunity to help administer the justice that \nour constitutional Government guarantees. And the people of the United \nStates wait for the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duties.\n  The events of the past year clearly demonstrate an active effort by \nthe enemies of the United States to destroy the liberties and freedom \nof our great Nation. The most basic of our country's values and \ntraditions are under attack. Congress has responded by enacting new \nlaws and by providing financial assistance to businesses and families \nand defense. We acted swiftly to suffocate terrorists and destroy the \nhateful organizations that work to undermine our society.\n  Yet the instruments through which justice is served are being denied \ntheir chance to serve by ugly, partisan politics. For a year, Mr. \nTymkovich's nomination has languished in the committee without action. \nToday, once again, I urge you to move forward with his confirmation. \nMr. Tim Tymkovich is highly qualified and will serve his country with \nthe utmost of patriotism and respect for adherence to constitutional \nprinciples. The committee must provide a hearing for the Tenth Circuit \nseat because the seat has remained vacant entirely too long.\n  A necessary component of providing justice is an efficient court \nsystem--a system equipped with the personnel and resources that enable \nit to fulfill its role as a pillar of our constitutional system of \ngovernment.\n  The current state of judicial nominations is simply unacceptable. It \nhas evolved into a petty game of entrenchment, creating a vacancy \ncrisis that prevents the service of the very justice upon which our \ngreat Nation depends. The simple fact remains: Justice cannot be \ndelivered when one of every six judgeships on the appellate level \nremains vacant. I will repeat that: One out of every six judgeships on \nthe appellate level remains vacant.\n  It is unfortunate--perhaps even shameful--that the confirmation \nstalemate continues. How much longer will the American people have to \nwait? How much longer? Many people across the country are asking this \nsame question and responding by urging the chairman to act quickly and \nprovide hearings for qualified judges. The sentiment is being echoed \nacross the pages of every major newspaper in the Nation and the State \nof Colorado. They all agree that the Senate must act to fill judicial \nvacancies and end this vacancy crisis.\n  Mr. President, I wish to share with you some of the statements made \nin the editorial pages of these papers. They all recognize that the \ntreatment of certain Bush nominees has established a pattern of \npolitical partisanship. I ask that these editorials be printed in the \nRecord upon completion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALLARD. The first article is by the Denver Post, dated Monday, \nMay 6, 2002. The other article I ask to be\n\n[[Page S4107]]\n\nprinted is an editorial by the Rocky Mountain News from May 8, 2002. \nNext is an editorial by the Colorado Springs Gazette, dated May 8, \n2002. Next is an editorial by the Rocky Mountain News, dated May 9, \n2002.\n  Mr. President, the Denver Post editorial states:\n\n       The U.S. Constitution grants to the president the power to \n     appoint judges with the ``advice and consent'' of the Senate. \n     There is nothing in that provision that anticipates a process \n     in which a president nominates replacements to the federal \n     bench and the Senate acts as if it has no responsibility to \n     cooperate.\n\n  The Post continues in its editorial:\n\n       . . . it is difficult to think of a single reason why [Mr. \n     Tim Tymkovich] has been denied a confirmation hearing and an \n     up-or-down vote in the full Senate. Such a vote is the \n     prescribed solution for cases where there is disagreement \n     between the Senate and the president.\n  The Post also expresses the frustration that the American people are \nfeeling:\n\n       Unless the Democrat leadership abandons its delay tactics, \n     we think the treatment of judicial nominees ought to be a \n     front-and-center issue in the upcoming elections.\n       If the Senate won't vote to end the judicial logjam, maybe \n     the citizens should.\n\n  The Rocky Mountain News notes that Mr. Tim Tymkovich is not the only \nTenth Circuit nominee awaiting a hearing, there are two vacancies, both \nof whom were appointed 1 year ago. This means the committee is \ndepriving the court of two qualified judges. Unfortunately, it is the \npeople of the United States who suffer, the people who turn to the \ncourts to address their grievances. The committee does not face the \ndaily injustice served on the people, nor does it face the costly court \ndelays caused by an overwhelming docket. The committee does not face \nthe frustration of citizens as they pursue justice in front of an empty \nbench.\n  The Rocky Mountain News reveals that the chairman is blaming the \nPresident for the delay. According to the chairman, ``Controversial \nnominations take longer.'' But as the paper points out, there is little \ncontroversy regarding the nomination of Tim Tymkovich. Yet he still has \nnot received a hearing.\n  Outside the city of Denver, newspaper headlines herald the same \nmessage, citing the stalemate as ``justice delayed'' and calling for \naction. The Colorado Springs Gazette states:\n\n       There is a slate of looming vacancies on the federal bench \n     across the country thanks in large part to backlogged \n     nominations, and its risks paralyzing the courts.\n\n  The Gazette concludes by adding that swift justice is supposed to be \na hallmark of our system; its prospects do not look good while \npolicymakers are making it harder to get before a judge at all.\n  Mr. Tymkovich is an outstanding choice for the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, and he will serve this Nation well, but he must be given the \nopportunity to do so. In Colorado, his nomination enjoys broad \nbipartisan support and the support of our State's legal community.\n  He has also passed the litmus test of the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, and is deemed qualified by the American Bar \nAssociation. The committee must move to end the confirmation stalemate \nand restore the people's faith that our judicial system is, indeed, \nbuilt to provide all the judicial resources that are needed to provide \naccess to the courts of law.\n  It must diligently perform its duty to provide hearings so that the \nvacancies that plague our courts may be filled. The President has asked \nfor the forging of a bipartisan consensus in favor of fair and \nefficient consideration of all judicial nominations--I do not think \nthat is an unreasonable request--regardless of the pattern of party \ncontrol of the political branches of Government. I urge the committee \nto answer this call and move forward with the judicial nomination \nprocess and prove to the American people that the committee is, indeed, \ninterested in serving justice.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                  [From the Denver Post, May 6, 2002]\n\n                         Politics and the Bench\n\n       There is a fresh reminder of how political the judicial \n     selection process has become. Colorado's two senators, Ben \n     Nighthorse Campbell and Wayne Allard, both Republicans, have \n     written a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman \n     Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, pointing out that it was a full \n     year ago that President Bush nominated Denver attorney \n     Timothy Tymkovich to a seat on the 10th Circuit Court of \n     Appeals.\n       The two senators complained, and we agree, that ``the \n     current state of judicial nominations . . . devolved into a \n     petty game of entrenchment'' that has created a vacancy \n     crisis.\n       The recent treatment of a Charles Pickering, a Bush nominee \n     to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, consumed a great deal \n     of the committee's time and established a pattern of \n     political partisanship.\n       The issue for the committee and the nation is whether such \n     treatment--and ultimate rejection on a straight party-line \n     vote in committee--is a pattern the Democratic leaders of the \n     Senate want to repeat. It will be no bargain for the country \n     if the Senate committee adopts a strategy of simply delaying \n     all Bush judicial nominations.\n       The U.S. Constitution grants to the president the power to \n     appoint judges with the ``advice and consent'' of the Senate. \n     There is nothing in that provision that anticipates a process \n     in which a president nominates replacements to the federal \n     bench and the Senate acts as if it has no responsibility to \n     cooperate.\n       Because Tymkovich is well-known in Colorado, having served \n     as the state's solicitor general, it is difficult to think of \n     a single reason why he has been denied a confirmation hearing \n     and an up-or down vote in the full Senate. Such a vote is the \n     prescribed solution for cases where there is disagreement \n     between the Senate and the president.\n       Unless the Democratic leadership abandons its delay \n     tactics, we think the treatment of judicial nominees ought to \n     be a front-and-center issue in the upcoming elections.\n       If the Senate won't vote to end the judicial logjam, maybe \n     the citizens should.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Rocky Mountain News, May 8, 2002]\n\n     Bush Nominees to Denver-Based Court Still Waiting for Hearings\n\n                           (By Robert Gehrke)\n\n       Washington.--A year ago, it looked like smooth sailing for \n     Michael McConnell.\n       President Bush had made the conservative University of Utah \n     law professor one of his first appeals court nominees, naming \n     him to the 10 Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver. Approval by \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee, then chaired by Sen. Orrin \n     Hatch, R-Utah, seemed certain.\n       Bush also nominated Colorado attorney Tim Tymkovich to the \n     10th Circuit.\n       A year later, Democrats control the Senate, and McConnell, \n     Tymkovich and five other judges Bush nominated last spring \n     are still awaiting a hearing.\n       Hatch, McConnell's leading backer, has criticized Judiciary \n     Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., for moving too slow on \n     judicial nominees, and frequently cites McConnell's case as \n     an example.\n       ``They know that Mike McConnell is one of the truly great \n     Constitutional scholars. They know he's on the fast rack to \n     the Supreme Court, so they're going to delay this as long as \n     they can,'' said Hatch.\n       Keeping McConnell off the bench, Hatch said, keeps him from \n     compiling the type of judicial experience he would need \n     before moving up to the Supreme Court.\n       Sens. Wayne Allard and Ben Nighthorse Campbell, both R-\n     Colo., urged Leahy last month to hold a hearing for \n     Tymkovich.\n       ``The current state of judicial nominations is \n     unacceptable,'' they wrote in a letter to Leahy. ``It has \n     devolved into a petty game of entrenchment, creating a \n     vacancy crisis that prevents the service of the very justice \n     upon which our great nation depends.''\n       McConnell and Tymkovich would fill the only two vacancies \n     on the 10th Circuit, which handles appeals from U.S. district \n     courts in Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, Oklahoma and Nebraska. \n     Other circuits have more vacancies.\n       Leahy spokesman David Carle defended the pace of \n     nominations, saying Democrats confirmed 16 more justices in \n     their first 10 months in control than the Republicans did in \n     their first 10 months in 1995.\n       Women's groups, gay-rights advocates and church-state \n     separationists have all voiced concerns about McConnell and \n     Tymkovich's records.\n       McConnell, 46, has represented several groups that have \n     claimed government discrimination because of their religious \n     beliefs. He has argued against a secular government in favor \n     of an arrangement that accepts all religious on an equal \n     footing.\n       He opposes abortion and co-wrote a law review article \n     challenging the constitutionally of legislation that \n     prohibited protests blocking abortion clinics.\n       He represented the Boy Scouts of America when they argued \n     they should not be forced to accept homosexual leaders.\n       As Colorado's solicitor general, Tymkovich defended a state \n     constitutional amendment prohibiting municipalities from \n     adopting ordinances outlawing discrimination against \n     homosexuals.\n       He also defended a Colorado law prohibiting state financing \n     of abortions in cases of rape or incest.\n       Adam Shah of the Alliance For Justice, which helped defeat \n     the nomination of Judge Charles Pickering to the Fifth U.S. \n     Circuit of Appeals in New Orleans, said the group has not \n     worked against McConnell or Tymkovich but is examining their \n     records.\n\n[[Page S4108]]\n\n       ``We understand that the president has the right to name \n     nominees that he chooses,'' Shah said recently. ``We are \n     willing to look at the record and their political views and \n     see if they will make good judges . . . and not turn back the \n     clock on civil rights, women's rights and environmental \n     protections.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Colorado Springs Gazette, May 8, 2002]\n\n                            Justice Delayed\n\n\n blocking nominees is an old political game--and it's undermining our \n                                 courts\n\n       Let's not be naive about how presidential picks, especially \n     for the judiciary, quickly can become political pawns for \n     members of Congress. Holding up a nominee to the bench or to \n     any other office requiring the Senate's advice and consent \n     has become nothing less than a venerated tradition. And it's \n     a bipartisan affair even as each side howls with indignation \n     when the other does it.\n       Sometimes it's indulged for philosophical reasons--a \n     judicial nominee's stance on abortion or capital punishment, \n     for example. Other times the stonewalling is mundanely \n     political--perhaps some senators want a president to back off \n     of a threatened veto of major legislation. A pending \n     nomination can prove a useful bargaining chip. It all makes \n     for a very old game, and it has been that way almost every \n     time the White House has changed tenants over the years.\n       But that doesn't make it right. More to the point, the \n     inclination of senators to make judicial appointees cool \n     their heels interferes with the administration of justice. \n     The latest joust between the Senate and the presidency is no \n     exception.\n       To their credit, Colorado Republican U.S. Sens. Ben \n     Nighthorse Campbell and Wayne Allard have written a letter to \n     the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick \n     Leahy, D-Vt., making just that point.\n       ``The current state of judicial nominations is \n     unacceptable. It has devolved into a petty game of \n     entrenchment, creating a vacancy crisis that prevents the \n     service of the very justice upon which our nation depends,'' \n     they wrote.\n       Of particular concern to the Colorado delegation is the \n     status of Colorado's former solicitor general, Tim Tymkovich, \n     who was nominated by President Bush in 2001 to fill the \n     Colorado vacancy on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. \n     Saturday will mark the one-year anniversary since Tymkovich's \n     nomination was sent to the Judiciary Committee.\n       It's not as if there are some glaring blemishes on the \n     man's resume. On the contrary, his nomination enjoys the \n     broad support of our state's legal community, and he was \n     deemed qualified when rated by the American Bar Association. \n     and still he remains in limbo.\n       To reiterate, we're not being naive here. This is an old \n     syndrome that conforms to no political boundaries. Indeed, a \n     couple of years ago, it was Allard who for a time helped \n     delay the nomination of a Clinton administration pick for the \n     10th Circuit bench.\n       But the underlying point the Senators make in their letter \n     to Leahy is well taken. Quite simply, there's a slate of \n     looming vacancies on the federal bench across the country \n     thanks in large part to backlogged nominations, and it risks \n     paralyzing the courts.\n       Whatever reservations members of either party might harbor \n     about any given nominee, and however substantive those \n     concerns may actually be on occasion, at some point they pale \n     next to the need for any judge at all to attend to the logjam \n     in federal courts.\n       Swift justice is supposed to be a hallmark of our system; \n     its prospects don't look good while the likes of Leahy are \n     making it harder to get before a judge at all.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Rocky Mountain News, May 9, 2002]\n\n                   GOP May Protest Delay on Hearings\n\n\n               coloradan is among bush judicial nominees\n\n                        (By M.E.

Wayne Allard, R-\n     Loveland.\n       Last week, President Bush called the situation a ``vacancy \n     crisis,'' especially in the 12 regional Courts of Appeals, \n     where one in six judgeships remains vacant. The Denver-based \n     10th Circuit is still waiting for nominees Tymkovich and \n     Michael McConnell of Utah to get hearings.\n       In response, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Pat \n     Leahy, D-Vermont, pointed out that the Senate had confirmed \n     52 of Bush's nominees since Democrats took control 10 months \n     ago. He said Bush should share the blame for other delays.\n       ``Controversial nominations take longer, and the President \n     can help by choosing nominees primarily for their ability \n     instead of for their ideology,'' Leahy said in a release.\n       Some groups have questioned McConnell's nomination, \n     claiming that the University of Utah professor would weaken \n     the separation of church and state. They also question his \n     views because he once represented the Boy Scouts of America \n     in its bid to exclude homosexuals. McConnell backers say the \n     fears are based on misunderstandings and that he has been \n     endorsed by several Democratic academics.\n       But there is little controversy over Tymkovich, Colorado's \n     former solicitor general.\n       Last month, Allard and Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-\n     Ignacio, wrote Leahy, demanding that Tymkovich get a hearing.\n       ``It has devolved into a petty game of entrenchment, \n     creating a vacancy crisis that prevents the service of the \n     very justice upon which our nation depends,'' they wrote.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I saw for more than a year the President's \nand this administration's deep commitment and involvement to reforming \nand fully funding our education legislation and our commitment to our \nelementary and secondary education, special education under IDEA, and \nthe bilingual and other programs that were reauthorized in this \nlegislation.\n  We have incredible leadership in the White House, and that is why \nthis bipartisan legislation passed by over 80 votes in the Senate. It \ndisappoints me and hurts me to hear my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle attack this administration and question its commitment to \neducation. We saw in 30 years under Democrat control an education \npolicy that got us nowhere, in which the learning gap between high-\nachieving and low-achieving students never narrowed, in which test \nscores, instead of rising, continued to fall.\n  Now we have a President who has said: Let's try something different; \nlet's put real accountability into education; yes, let's increase \nfunding, with dramatic increases in title I, dramatic increases in \nIDEA, special education, and dramatic reforms and increases in \nbilingual education; but let's accompany spending increases with \naccountability; let's not just spend more, let's spend smarter.\n  I, for one, stand and applaud the President for his leadership. I can \nonly say as the President's poll numbers soar on leadership in \neducation and Republicans in general score better on education than \never before, that is the only explanation for the misguided attack on \nthe President on the education issue which we just heard today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4108-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4108-S4111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the tragic hold \nup of our circuit court nominees to the Federal bench. It takes only a \nfew numbers to show the dramatic vacancy crisis we are facing in the \nFederal court system: 10 percent of Federal judgeships are vacant right \nnow, 85; 20 percent of judicial seats at the Federal courts of appeals \nare vacant. With eight openings, half of the entire Sixth Circuit is \nnow vacant. It is operating at half strength.\n  The Judiciary Committee has held a hearing on only one of President \nBush's seven nominees for the Sixth Circuit, and that hearing was held \njust a week and a half ago after pending for over 6 months. Two of the \nSixth Circuit nominees, Jeffrey Sutton and Deborah Cook, were nominated \na year ago today but have not yet had a hearing.\n  Do they question their ability? The ABA rated both nominees as \nunanimously qualified, but they have languished for a year.\n\n[[Page S4109]]\n\n  The numbers simply do not lie: 44 nominations are currently pending \nbefore the Judiciary Committee. Unfortunately, 22 of those unconfirmed \nnominees are for circuit courts, the court of last resort for most \ncases.\n  In 1996, the current Judiciary Committee chairman called a vacancy \nrate of only two-thirds as high as the one we face today a judicial \nemergency. It is even more so today, and we are doing even less about \nit.\n  Of the current 85 vacancies, 37 are considered judicial emergencies \nby the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. This is calculated \nbased on the number of years the judgeship has been open and the size \nof the court's caseload.\n  Perhaps the most staggering fact is this: Of the President's first 11 \ncircuit court nominees submitted to the Senate on May 9, 2001, only 3--\nMr. President, only 3--have even received hearings by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  This is a crisis by any definition, by any measure, and it is \ninexcusable.\n  One of the nominees who has been waiting almost a year is from my \nhome State of Arkansas.\n  He is a very distinguished, very qualified jurist named Lavenski \nSmith. This is my friend Lavenski Smith.\n  It is very easy to talk numbers. Numbers come and go. People come to \nthe Chamber and argue numbers and statistics, but I want to put a face \non what we are really talking about.\n  Judge Smith was nominated for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals \nalmost a year ago, on May 22, 2001. I brought this picture of Lavenski \nSmith in the hopes this might put a human face on at least one of the \npeople we are hurting by these unjust and inexcusable delays. Judge \nSmith has received broad support from both of his home State Senators, \nfrom colleagues on the bench in Arkansas, from colleagues from his days \nof practicing law. He has received the support of the American Bar \nAssociation. He has received the support of the president of the \nArkansas NAACP. He has received the support of editorial boards of both \nthe left and the right ends of the political spectrum in the State of \nArkansas.\n  That is broad support. That is support from the left and the right. \nThere is support from every colleague who has ever worked for him. \nThere is support from his colleagues on the Arkansas Supreme Court. \nThere is support from the American Bar Association. There is support \nacross the board.\n  The NAACP president has written asking for a hearing. Yet Judge \nSmith's nomination languishes. Why? If he is confirmed, Judge Smith \nwill be the first African-American Arkansan on the Eighth Circuit. I \nwonder what the ladies and gentlemen of the press would be saying about \nthis nomination were the tables reversed, were Republicans in control \nand a Democrat nominee, an African American, who would be the first on \nthe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, had languished for almost a year \nwithout even a hearing.\n  Ever since this nomination, I have looked forward to the day when I \ncould sit next to Judge Smith in the Senate Judiciary Committee and I \ncould give a glowing introduction of my friend at that hearing. I have \nbeen waiting, I have been waiting, and I have been waiting. I have \nwritten Senator Leahy over and over, and I have talked to Senator \nLeahy. Others have written and pleaded for a hearing, and yet nothing \nhas happened.\n  I would like to tell my colleagues about my friend. Lavenski Smith \nearned both his bachelor's degree and his law degree from the \nUniversity of Arkansas. Following law school and 3 years working in \nprivate practice, Judge Smith served the poorest and the neediest \ncitizens of Arkansas as the staff attorney for Ozark Legal Services. At \nOzark Legal Services, he represented abused and neglected children. \nThese were children whose own parents were unwilling or unable to act \nin their best interest, putting the children in danger. So Judge Smith \nstepped in.\n  Judge Smith helped these children. He represented them in our complex \nlegal system and navigated the foster care system for them. He helped \nfind the safest place for these children to grow and to thrive. So he \nis committed to the needy. He is committed to the poorest, and he has \ndemonstrated that with his life, not just with his rhetoric.\n  In addition to this public service, Lavenski Smith has volunteered \nhis spare time to charitable endeavors such as raising funds for the \nSchool of Hope, a school for handicapped children in his hometown of \nHope, Arkansas. After Judge Smith spent years working at Ozark Legal \nServices, Judge Smith opened the first minority-owned law firm in \nSpringdale, AR, handling primarily civil cases. He then taught business \nlaw at John Brown University and took several positions in public \nservice, including working as the regulatory liaison for Governor Mike \nHuckabee in the Governor's office. He currently serves as a \ncommissioner on our Public Service Commission.\n  Now I mentioned he has this very broad support, and indeed he has. So \nlet me share some of the statements of support for Judge Lavenski \nSmith, former Arkansas Supreme Court Justice, who was nominated almost \na year ago to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and has not been \ngranted even the courtesy of a hearing before our Judiciary Committee.\n  Dale Charles, the president of the Arkansas NAACP, President Charles \nwrote:\n\n       He's a fine person individually and in his time on the \n     Supreme Court he represented himself and the court well. I \n     encourage them to question him and let his record speak for \n     itself. I do not foresee his confirmation being in jeopardy.\n\n  This is Dale Charles, president of the Arkansas NAACP. Dale Charles \nwrote this letter some time back. He wrote more recently on April 8 a \nspecific letter to Chairman Leahy, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthis letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      National Association for the\n\n\n                                Advancement of Colored People,\n\n                                   Little Rock, AR, April 8, 2002.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Chairman, Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: As the President of the Arkansas State \n     Conference of Branches NAACP, I am writing to express our \n     concern that Attorney Lavenski Smith, who is from Arkansas, \n     has not been given a confirmation hearing. President Bush \n     nominated Mr. Smith approximately a year ago for the Eighth \n     Circuit Court, however, he has not been given a hearing \n     before the Judiciary Committee.\n       While I understand there are some partisan issues involved, \n     I am asking you as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee to, \n     immediately, schedule a hearing on behalf of the confirmation \n     of Mr. Smith for the Eighth Circuit Court. It is my opinion \n     that Mr. Smith is a fine individual and has served the people \n     of Arkansas well in his capacity as a public official.\n       For additional information, you may contact me at (501) \n     227-7231 or by e-mail at dhcharles@prodigy.net.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Dale Charles,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I would like to share with my colleagues what the \nPresident of the Arkansas chapter of the NAACP wrote concerning my \nfriend Lavenski Smith:\n\n       Dear Chairman Leahy, as the President of the Arkansas State \n     Conference Branch of the NAACP, I am writing to express our \n     concern that attorney Lavenski Smith, who is from Arkansas, \n     has not been given a confirmation hearing. President Bush \n     nominated Mr. Smith approximately a year ago for the Eighth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. However, he has not been given a \n     hearing before the Judiciary Committee. While I understand \n     there are some partisan issues involved--\n\n  That is the greatest understatement ever made--\n\n       I am asking you, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to \n     immediately schedule a hearing on behalf of the confirmation \n     of Mr. Smith for the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. It is \n     my opinion that Mr. Smith is a fine individual and has served \n     the people of Arkansas well in his capacity as a public \n     official. Sincerely, Dale Charles, NAACP.\n\n  What kind of support does one have to have to get a hearing? How long \ndoes one have to wait to get a hearing?\n  In June of 2001, the American Bar Association, which has been called \nthe gold standard of qualifications, agreed and made a unanimous \nqualified determination. Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court, \nW.H. ``Dub'' Arnold, well-respected jurist in the State of Arkansas, \nwrote on behalf of Lavenski Smith:\n\n       He is a great man. He is very intelligent. He did a great \n     job for us on the Arkansas Supreme Court. I think he'll make \n     a great Federal judge. I think President Bush made the best \n     possible nomination he could have made.\n\n\n[[Page S4110]]\n\n\n  Now, Justice Arnold is a Democrat, but he is a fair-minded Democrat \nand he is a distinguished jurist and he weighs in and says President \nBush made the best possible nomination he could have made.\n  We put in a call to Judge Smith to let him know I would be making \nthese remarks on his behalf in this Chamber. Judge Smith said: Well, go \nahead. I do not think it will make much difference, but go ahead.\n  I was so crushed that he is so cynical about the process that has \nalready delayed this nomination for a year and not even given him a \nhearing, that his attitude about pushing hard for it really will not \naccrue to any results.\n  Mike Huckabee, Governor of the State of Arkansas stated:\n\n       He just has all the equipment to be an outstanding jurist. \n     I'll be the first to predict that his next stop will be the \n     United States Supreme Court.\n\n  Governor Huckabee is a Republican. So we have Dub Arnold, a Democrat, \nand we have Mike Huckabee, a Republican. We have the NAACP. We have the \nAmerican Bar Association in June of 2001 saying that a unanimous \nqualified determination has been made regarding Judge Smith's \nnomination. Yet he waits. It has now been almost 1 year since he was \nnominated.\n  I have thought and thought, why? I understand a nomination that is \ncontroversial, a nomination that has severe opposition within the State \nof Arkansas--perhaps if the letter from the president of the NAACP had \nbeen a critical letter or perhaps if his colleagues on the Arkansas \nSupreme Court had come out publicly and said they question his \nqualifications, perhaps then there would be some way to understand why \nthere has not even been a hearing for Judge Smith.\n  So I have thought about why, and the only opposition I can find, I \nsay to my distinguished colleagues and to our Presiding Officer today, \nto Judge Smith's nomination is found on two Web sites. One is NOW, the \nNational Organization for Women, and the other is NARAL.\n  Judge Smith, for all of his qualifications, all of his distinguished \nservice, all of his commitment to the poor, needy, and handicapped in \nour society, has one grave shortcoming: He is pro-life. There are those \non the Judiciary Committee who have said: Don't send us a pro-life \nnominee. They are dead on arrival. That is tragic.\n  To those who for years have denounced the idea of a litmus test to \nthe Federal bench, that we only look at whether one is qualified or \nnot, no one raised the issue of whether Judge Smith is qualified. Yet \nthe only opposition has been NARAL and the National Organization of \nWomen, and they say he is pro-life; he has a record of being pro-life. \nHow can we possibly consider him for the Eighth Circuit Court of \nAppeals? That is a litmus test if there ever was one, and they are \nblatant about it. So we wait. And Judge Smith waits.\n  Holding up judicial nominees is not just a political game. The \nconfirmation process is not a payback opportunity for perceived wrongs \nof the past, nor should it be viewed as a chance to throw a roadblock \nbefore a new President's administration. The American people are \nwatching the Senate's failure to fulfill its constitutional duty, and \nthey are wondering if we understand what our role is.\n  Last week, I received a call from a constituent in Arkansas. She had \npreviously written to me asking me why the President's very well-\nqualified nominee to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, Lavenski \nSmith, has been waiting for close to a year without the courtesy of a \nhearing. I responded the way I am sure many Members do, by pointing out \nthe letters I have written supporting Judge Smith's nomination, urging \nquick attention by the Judiciary Committee. I told her I was working \nhard to convince the committee to examine his qualifications, as I knew \nthey would find his stellar record more than adequate for the job. I \nwrote to this lady, my constituent, that Senate procedure required the \nnominations to be reported out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  She received my letter and called me last week. She said she had \nlooked through her Constitution and wanted to read to me article II, \nsection 2.2, which states that the President shall appoint justices \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate--not the Judiciary Committee. \nShe wanted to know why the Senate was allowing a partisan hijacking of \nSenate procedure to prevent fulfillment of our constitutional duty.\n  I tell this story to illustrate that the vacancy crisis in the \njudiciary is having affects beyond the administration of justice. Our \nfailure does not just create backlogs that allow dangerous criminals on \nthe street longer, leaves the innocent waiting longer for vindication \nand slow victims access to justice. When we leave half of the bench of \na court of appeals empty and another one only two-thirds full, the \nAmerican people start to doubt our ability and our will to carry out \nour constitutional duties.\n  I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle share my reverence \nand respect for the Constitution. I hope we will move forward and \nconfirm, or at a very minimum, have hearings and votes on the 44 \nnominees still pending, including my very qualified and very dear \nfriend, Lavenski Smith, who would be a very able jurist and judge on \nthe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. This will set an important \nprecedent for this circuit court of appeals by serving as the first \nAfrican American on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  I ask once again, after nearly a year, for a hearing for my friend \nand for movement on these very important judicial nominations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there have been a couple of speeches on \njudges. I will say a few things pertinent to the discussion regarding \njudges.\n  There is no better place to start than a few statements made by the \nRepublicans in recent days. In 1999, the Republican leader, Senator \nLott, said:\n\n       I am saying to you, I am trying to help move this thing \n     along, but getting more Federal judges is not what I came \n     here to do.\n\n  That is the Republican leader.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, said on November 11 \nof 2001:\n\n       The delays are a result of ``rank partisanship by Tom \n     Daschle.''\n\n  But this is what he said on the 18th day of August the year 2000:\n\n       A number of my Republican colleagues are not likely to rush \n     President Clinton's lifetime judicial nominees through the \n     confirmation process when they think there is a chance \n     another party could occupy the White House in January.\n\n  My friend, Senator Craig of Idaho, said in June of 1996:\n\n       There is a general feeling . . . that no more nominations \n     should move. I think you'll see a progressive shutdown.\n\n  Now what he is saying:\n\n       There seems to be a concerted effort to operate very slowly \n     around here.\n\n  My friend, Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the committee, talked about \nhis ideology. He said, when chairman of the committee a couple years \nago:\n\n       I led the fight to oppose the confirmation of these two \n     judges because their judicial records indicated they would be \n     activists who would legislate from the bench.\n\n  A couple of months ago he said:\n       I would like to address some recent attempt to reinvent \n     history by repeating this convenient myth that I, as \n     chairman, blocked President Clinton's nominations on the \n     basis of political ideology.\n\n  That is what he said.\n  Again, my friend, the Republican leader said:\n\n       The reason for the lack of action on the backlog of Clinton \n     nominations was his steadily ringing office phone saying ``no \n     more Clinton Federal judges.''\n\n  Senator Lott said he received a lot of phone calls saying ``No more \nClinton judges.'' So that is what he did.\n  He said to the Bulletin's Frontrunner, a newspaper:\n\n       Until we get 12 appropriations bills done, there is no way \n     any judge, of any kind, or any stripe, will be confirmed.\n\n  Senator Hatch said:\n\n       The claim that there is a vacancy crisis in the Federal \n     courts is simply wrong. Using the Clinton administration's \n     own standard, the Federal Judiciary currently has virtual \n     full employment.\n\n  We have established the vacancies in the Federal judiciary created by \nRepublicans. Senator Hatch said don't worry.\n  Although just a short time ago he said:\n\n       If we don't have the third branch of government staffed, \n     we're all in trouble.\n\n  The Republicans say they want hearings. I heard my friend from \nArkansas say they want hearings.\n\n[[Page S4111]]\n\n  These are people President Clinton nominated who never ever got a \nhearing--not 2 days later, 2 weeks later, 2 months later, 2 years \nlater. They never got a hearing. Fine people.

There is a \nHispanic nominee they say has not moved quickly enough.\n  Jorge Rangel, who was nominated in July of 1997, never got anything. \nEnrique Moreno, Fifth Circuit, nominated in 1999, didn't get anything. \nChristine Arguello, July of 2000--nothing happened. Ricardo Morado, \nsouth Texas--nothing happened. Anabelle Rodriguez--these are just some \nof the names.\n  I suggest before the tears run too heavily down the cheeks of my \nRepublican friends, they should go back and read their own statements \ngiven by their own Senators, and find out the States where people who \nwere nominated by President Clinton never got a hearing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper).

So after 5 minutes I would like to then have an opportunity to \nspeak out of our time on this side.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Then, Mr. President, I will yield to the \nSenator from Minnesota. He has a time problem.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, that is very gracious.

Mr. President, last week I learned of the \ndeath of three men. They lived apart from each other--one in Florida, \none in Virginia, and one in Maryland--but they shared a special past.\n  All three played in baseball's Negro Leagues. They did not receive \nmillion-dollar contracts. They did not get endorsement deals. They just \nplayed baseball.\n  Sadly, these three men were part of a group of about 165 players who \nnever received a pension for their time in the leagues.\n  The Negro League was founded in 1920 by Andrew ``Rube'' Foster. With \n72 teams and more than 4,000 players, the Negro Leagues lasted until \n1960, when its last team folded.\n  For half a century, most of the Negro League players were denied the \nopportunity to play in the Majors.\n  Even though Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in 1947, it took \nanother decade for Major League Baseball to really become integrated. \nAll the while, baseball had its antitrust exemption to unfairly compete \nagainst the Negro Leagues, and systemically discriminated against most \nNegro League players for many years after 1947.\n  That is the crux of the argument many of these old-timers have about \nnot getting even a small pension.\n  Though Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig sought to fix some of the \nproblems of the past when, a few years ago, he awarded an annual \n$10,000 pension benefit to some of the Negro Leaguers, he left out \nthose who played solely in the Negro Leagues from 1948 to 1960.\n  Major League Baseball contends they were left out because the sport \nwas integrated during that time. But an accurate reading of history \nshows it took the Big Leagues many years to integrate following Jackie \nRobinson's debut. In fact, the Boston Red Sox didn't have a single \nblack on its team until 1959--more than a decade after Robinson's move \nto the Majors.\n  The players still seeking a small retirement have been reaching out \nto Commissioner Selig now for 5 long years now. But their requests have \nbeen ignored. I joined them last year in trying to find some resolution \nto this dispute, but my efforts to meet with Commissioner Selig also \nhave been ignored.\n  Meantime, these ex-players are getting old. Three of them died late \nlast month--two on the same day.\n  On April 23, we lost James ``Pee Wee'' Jenkins, a native of Virginia. \nJenkins pitched for the New York Black Cubans.\n  Just last year, Jenkins threw out the first pitch at Shea stadium, as \nthe 2001 Mets--dressed in Black Cuban uniforms--paid tribute to Jenkins \nand the rest of his fellow 1947 Negro League World Series champions.\n  James Cohen, Sr., of Washington DC, also died on April 23. A World \nWar II veteran, he pitched for the Indianapolis Clowns from 1946 to \n1952, earning the nickname ``Fireball.''\n  In his last year with the Clowns, he played with the great, legendary \nHank Aaron. Mr. Cohen went on to be a postal clerk for 35 years. And in \n1994, he was honored at the White House by Vice President Al Gore.

Mr. President, last week I said to people in northern \nMinnesota--specifically northeast Minnesota on the Iron Range--that I \nthought we had a real breakthrough. I thought it was part of fast track \non trade adjustment authority, including legacy costs, and a 1-year \nbridge where health care costs would be covered. Through no fault of \nany of the retirees, a lot of these companies, including LTV, declared \nbankruptcy and walked away from health care benefits, which is \nterrifying to people in their older age.\n  Yesterday, the administration came out with a statement about this \ntrade adjustment assistance package:\n\n       Specifically, the administration opposes the Daschle \n     substitute last-minute addition of health insurance \n     assistance for steel retirees.\n\n  There is a nightmare. I say to my colleague from Mississippi that \nthis is an absolute nightmare for people on the range.\n  The President talked about how concerned he is. But this is just a 1-\nyear bridge to help pay for these retirees' health care costs until we \nput together a package that deals with the legacy costs for the future.\n  The President crushed the hopes of people with this position that the \nWhite House has now taken.\n  The President says: Look what I have done for the steel industry. He \ntalks about section 201, but now there are 1,000 exceptions to the kind \nof trade relief we thought we were going to get through section 201.\n  In Minnesota, we were concerned about what was happening to the \ntaconite industry. We were talking about the unfair competition from \nsemifinished slab steel.\n  Basically, the administration came up with a tariff quota, and it was \n7 million tons of slab steel a year, which is what is being dumped \nright now on the range. It didn't give us any relief whatsoever.\n  But, most important of all, what is happening now with this statement \nof position by the administration is they are just walking away from \ndealing with the legacy costs.\n  Jerry Fowler, who testified before the HELP committee a couple of \nweeks ago, president of Local 4108, talked about the pain on the range, \nand talked about all of these people. Gosh. You talk about what we say \nwe believe in--people who have just worked their heads off all of their \nlives, taconite workers, helping to produce steel, which is so critical \nto our national security, and a part of all of our military efforts. \nPeople are really proud and are proud of their families. They are proud \nof the range. Through no fault of their own, 32 steel companies have \ndeclared bankruptcy, and then they walk away from these people.\n  They say they can no longer cover their health care benefits, nor \ntheir retiree benefits. Many people are afraid of no longer having \nprescription drug coverage.\n  People were really hopeful, and I was able to report last week, and I \nwas proud. I thank Senators Rockefeller, Mikulski, Stabenow, Levin, and \ncertainly my colleague Mark Dayton. We worked hard to have iron ore and \ntaconite included.\n  This was a pragmatic part of the trade adjustment assistance--only a \n1-year bridge, but it was a start. It would give people some security, \nand it was the right thing to do.\n  The President has talked about his concern for steelworkers. Over and \nover again, he professed his concern for steelworkers. Then, \nspecifically, the administration opposes the Daschle substitute last-\nminute addition of health insurance assistance for steel retirees.\n  We know there is going to be a point of order and a budget challenge \non this amendment. I believe what the White House has now done is \nbasically sealed its fate. We are not going to be able to have this \nbridge. We are not going to be able to have this assistance for people.\n  I question this fast track for a lot of reasons, but, at the very \nminimum, when people are out of work through no fault of their own--or \npeople work for an industry that has been besieged with unfair trade--\nthe only thing they are asking for is a bridge to make sure retirees \ndon't lose their benefits.\n  All of us have worked so hard together--Senator Specter and Senator \nDeWine--to get this done. Now the administration comes out yesterday \nand torpedoes the whole thing.\n  Mr. President, are you for the taconite workers on the Iron Range? \nAre you for the steelworkers? You say you are.\n  We will be back on this over and over again. But this is a huge blow \nfor the Iron Range in Minnesota and for me as a Senator from Minnesota \ntrying to do my best to represent people.\n  Yesterday the President made it very clear that all of his talk about \nhelping the hard-working men and women of the U.S. steel industry is \njust that--talk. His latest pronouncement is that steelworker retirees \ndon't need the assistance this bill would have provided to help them \nfor 1 year to pay for health insurance they are losing because their \ncompany has gone bankrupt.\n  This is outrageous--these are hard-working, decent, compassionate men \nand women who have devoted their lives to the steel industry--an \nindustry that is essential to our national security--and now they find \nthemselves without health insurance they were promised in their \nretirement because their companies have gone bankrupt, they're out in \nthe cold without the resources to pay for health insurance, and the \nPresident says, oh, no, they don't need the 1-year lifeline this bill \noffers.\n  Frankly, President Bush talks about what he's done for the steel \nindustry and for steel workers. But there is not a lot of substance \nthere.\n  First, we had a section 201 decision that is looking more and more \ncosmetic. It may have brought relief to some sections of the steel \nindustry, except that now the administration is entertaining all sorts \nof exceptions--there are over 1,000 exceptions to the President's \nsection 201 decision and Secretary O'Neill is reported as saying that \n``a significant portion of them will be favorably decided.''\n  Then there is the fact that the decision did nothing to help \nMinnesota's Iron Range--nor the iron industry as a whole--deal with \nimport surges of semi-finished slab steel. While the President imposed \ntariffs on every other product category for which the International \nTrade Commission had found injury, for steel slab he decided to impose \n``tariff rate quotas.'' This brings us virtually no relief. Nearly 7 \nmillion tons of steel slab can continue to be dumped on our shores \nbefore any tariff is assessed. For folks on the Iron Range, the injury \nwill continue.\n  Then, the President in his section 201 decision--and subsequently--\nhas totally ducked the serious legacy cost problem that is suffocating \nthe domestic steel industry. In the last 2 years, 32 U.S. steel \ncompanies have filed for bankruptcy, and these companies represent \nnearly 30 percent of our domestic steel making capacity. These failures \nweren't the fault of the workers at these companies. These failures \nresulted from unfair and predatory practices of our trading partners \nover an extended period. Yet despite the moral and economic imperative \nto do something about this legacy cost problem so that the steel \nindustry, so essential to our national security, can rebuild and \nrevitalize itself, the President has washed his hands of the matter. It \nis somebody else's problem he says.\n  And now there is the current bill. Those of us who are serious about \nthis legacy cost problem, and it is a bipartisan group, have introduced \nS. 2189, the Steel Industry Retiree Benefits Protection Act of 2002, to \naddress the legacy cost question in a comprehensive way. In the \nmeantime, however, recognizing that every day steelworker retirees \nwhose companies are going bankrupt are losing their heath insurance, \nSenator Daschle introduced provisions to provide stop gap assistance--\n\n[[Page S4113]]\n\n1 year of health insurance to retirees who right now are losing their \nbenefits--to tide folks over while we work on the larger problem.\n  And that, incredibly, is what President Bush yesterday announced his \nopposition to. It is now abundantly clear, if there had been any doubt, \nthat this President is not interested in health and well-being of our \nsteelworker families.\n  In Minnesota, on the Iron Range, there are several thousand retirees \nwho find themselves in desperate need of assistance and this \nadministration is turning its back on them.\n  Earlier this year, the HELP Committee held hearings on the need for \nlegacy cost legislation both for retirees and for the industry. The \ntestimony was riveting. The need compelling. My good friend, Jerry \nFallos, president of Local 4108 of the United Steelworkers of America, \ntestified at those hearings. The stories he had to tell were grim \nindeed.\n  As Jerry said, the people of the Iron Range are used to hard times. \nThey have weathered any number of challenges over the years. They are \ngood people, proud, hard working--the best you can find anywhere. They \nare survivors--and they will get through these difficult times as well. \nThey have given much to their country, and now they need our help.\n  The good people of the range have responded to their country in its \ntimes of needs. Over the years our Nation's economy flourished and our \nmanufacturing industries boomed from the iron ore produced through the \nlabors of steelworkers on the range.\n  Yesterday, when President Bush announced his opposition to helping \nthese steelworker retirees he said it would cost too much. We think his \n$800 million estimate is way off, but even if you accept it at face \nvalue, it pales in comparison to the billions and billions of dollars \nof tax giveaways this administration is happy to make available to \nmultinational corporations and the wealthy.\n  We are talking about $120 billion over 10 years to make the estate \ntax permanent, and $400 billion over 10 years to make all of the tax \ncuts permanent. Are these our priorities--$400 billion to multinational \ncorporations and wealthy individuals as opposed to $400 million to help \nsteelworker retirees keep their health insurance for 1 year?\n  I have asked many time before: Where are our priorities; where are \nour values? How can we tolerate such choices--tax breaks to help \nmultinationals over health insurance for steelworker retirees?\n  These families need our help. I urge my colleagues not to turn our \nbacks on these men and women who have served their country so well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4113-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4113-S4115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have been wanting to speak about the \nsituation with regard to the President's judicial nominations. I have a \nnumber of points I wish to make.\n  I know there were some discussions about the nominations earlier this \nmorning and even this afternoon. The major point we are trying to make \ntoday is that today is the 1-year anniversary of eight of the \nPresident's nominations to serve on circuit courts. These minorities, \nmen and women, have not even had the courtesy of a hearing, let alone a \nvote in the Judiciary Committee.\n  I have learned over the years that when you are talking about judges \nand judicial nominations each side will have their statistics about \nwhat happened in the Clinton years, what happened in the Reagan years, \nand what happens right now. But the fact is, these eight nominees have \nnot even had a hearing; they have been pending for a full year.\n  There are actually 11 nominees who were sent forward in a group--the \nfirst nominations of President Bush. Three of those have been \nconfirmed. Two of those, I might add, were recycled, in effect, because \nthey were Democrats, or were selected by Democrats, and they were \nqualified. The President resubmitted their names. They got through the \nprocess. But these eight have not had any further consideration for a \nfull year.\n  You can argue statistics. But usually Presidents get their circuit \nnominations confirmed within a year of having them sent forward.\n  The President sought men and women of great experience and who meet \nthe highest standards of legal training, temperament, and judgment--for \nall of his nominations, but particularly for this first group of \ncircuit court nominees.\n  He sought out nominees who respect the powers given to them by the \nConstitution and who will interpret the law--not make the law. He \nsought out nominees who have reputations as lawyers of skill, \ndiscernment, and high character. He even sought out nominees who had a \ngreat deal of experience in arguing cases before the Supreme Court. In \nthis group of eight nominees, they have collectively appeared before \nthe Supreme Court over 60 times. One of the nominees has alone argued \nbefore the Supreme Court 30 times. In terms of their education, their \nexperience, and their integrity, this group is unimpeachable and quite \nremarkable.\n  Here are these individuals' pictures. I think a picture helps inform \nour debate, because it takes the debate away from the realm of just \nstatistics or mere names.\n  Mr. President, when we are talking about judges who have been \ndelayed, we are talking about Miguel Estrada, who was born in Honduras, \nand has lived the American dream. He has tremendous experience in his \nprofession, including serving as Assistant U.S. Solicitor General under \nPresident Clinton, a Supreme Court law clerk, arguing 15 cases before \nthe Supreme Court, and working as a Federal prosecutor. He also \ngraduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School--not an institution \nknown for turning out conservative lawyers, or judges--but certainly \nan eminently respected institution as far as quality, high standards, \nand academic rigor are concerned. Yet Estrada has been denied a fair \nhearing.\n\n  Why? Noone has suggested he is not qualified by education, by \nexperience, or by professional or personal integrity.\n  Does he have a conservative philosophy? Does he believe in strict \nconstruction of the Founder's intent in interpreting the Constitution? \nYes. Does that disqualify him? It should not.\n  I voted for Justice Ginsburg when she came before the Senate. I did \nnot agree with her judicial or legal philosophy. I knew she would rule \nquite often in ways with which I would not agree. While most justices \nexercise discretion, you can't always count on how they may rule. But \nshe was qualified by experience, by education, and by personal \nintegrity and demeanor and I voted for her regardless of the fact that \nher philosophy was contrary to my own.\n  Unfortunately, I cannot think of any other reason than ideological \nprejudice for why Miguel Estrada has not had a hearing and an \nopportunity to be voted on--despite the fact that he was unanimously \ngiven the ABA's highest rating, ``well qualified'' by the American Bar \nAssociation which is supposed to be the Democrat's Gold Standard for \nevaluating nominees judicial qualifications. Yet, Miguel Estrada has \nnot even had a hearing.\n  Another example, which is clearly one that is hard to understand, is \nthe delay in considering Justice Priscilla Owen, a nominee to the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I have a special feeling in my heart about \nthis circuit because it does include my State of Mississippi. Judge \nOwen has served on the Texas Supreme Court since 1994. She has been \ninvolved in business in the private sector. She is an outstanding \ngraduate of Baylor Law School in Texas.\n  Again, by education, by experience, and by personal integrity, this \nis a lady who should have been accorded a hearing and a vote by now in \nthe Judiciary Committee and on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, why do we need another pound of flesh concerning the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals? Is Judge Charles Pickering who has \nalready been voted down in the Judiciary Committee not enough. If we \nare looking for tit for tat, how about just saying: OK, good, take \nthat, Mr. President, Trent Lott, Republicans, we repaid you what you \ndeserved from the past? But how does all of that apply to Priscilla \nOwen? Why has this lady not been accorded a hearing? Remember,\n\n[[Page S4114]]\n\nonce again, that she has been pending for a full year.\n  One interesting thing of note, Mr. President, is that two of these \nnominees, were actually nominated by the first President Bush. So they \nin a sense have been waiting over 10 years to get a fair hearing and be \nconfirmed to the circuit courts.\n  John Roberts is one of those two, and has again been nominated to the \nDC Circuit Court of Appeals. He is one of the Nation's leading \nappellate lawyers, having argued 36 cases before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, and serving as a Deputy Solicitor General for our Nation. He \nalso graduated magna cum laude from Harvard. So again, by education, by \nincredible experience, and by personal integrity, he has stellar \nqualifications to serve as a circuit court judge. Yet, he too has been \ndenied a fair hearing and an opportunity to be considered by the Senate \nby the majority of Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's fourth President, James Madison, was \ncertainly correct when he said that the courts exist to ``exercise not \nthe will of men, but the judgment of law.'' This President has gone to \ngreat lengths to nominate the kind of men and women who will do that \nonce they are confirmed.\n\n  Another nominee who has been delayed for over a year without cause or \njustification, is Justice Deborah Cook, nominated to the Sixth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. She has served as a justice on the Ohio Supreme Court \nsince 1994. Before becoming a judge, she was the first woman partner at \nAkron's oldest law firm. She is a graduate of the University of Akron \nLaw School.\n  This is the circuit where half of the judicial seats are vacant. \nThere is a long history on why that is, but the fact is that again the \nnominee is an eminently qualified nominee. And she has been waiting 52 \nweeks for a hearing even though the ABA voted unanimously that she was \nqualified.\n  So what is the problem, Mr. President? There are no allegations of \nimproper conduct. There are no allegations that she is not qualified by \nexperience, by education, or by demeanor, yet she is still waiting on a \nhearing.\n  Yet another nominee unjustifiably delayed is Judge Terrence Boyle, a \nnominee to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. He was unanimously \nconfirmed to be a Federal district judge in 1984.\n  Mr. President, one of the things that struck me as very interesting \nabout Judge Pickering's treatment by the Democrats was that he has been \na sitting federal district court judge since 1990, over 12 years. And \nnow we have a nominee who has been a Federal district judge for almost \ntwo decades, who was unanimously confirmed in 1984. The former chairman \nof the State Democratic Party in North Carolina even supports his \nnomination. He is a graduate of American University's Law School. This \nis one of the two nominees, the other being John Roberts, who was first \nnominated to be a circuit court judge back during the first President \nBush's administration. He was younger and well experienced then, and he \nnow has another decade of experience as a Federal district court judge \nto his credit. And here he is back again, only to be denied a fair \nhearing by the Democrats.\n  So, in each and every one of these cases, there is no explanation for \nthe year-long delay in giving President Bush's first group of nominees \nprompt and fair treatment.\n  Michael McConnell has been nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court of \nAppeals and again he is an eminently qualified legal scholar. He is one \nof the Nation's leading constitutional scholars, the author of legal \nbooks, and a prolific contributor to law journals. He has argued 11 \ncases before the Supreme Court. His reputation for fairness and \nintegrity has generated support from numerous law professors. He is a \ngraduate of the University of Chicago Law School. Again, on what \npossible grounds is such an extraordinarily qualified individual denied \na hearing for over a year?\n  Judge Dennis Shedd, a nominee to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nwas another nominee unanimously confirmed to be a Federal district \njudge in 1990--yet another sitting Federal district judge, Mr. \nPresident. He is strongly supported in his home State by both \nSenators--Senator Fritz Hollings and Senator Strom Thurmond--and served \nin the past as chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He is \none of ours no less. Yet, he has been waiting unjustifiably for over a \nyear for a fair hearing and a vote.\n  Mr. President, I believe I have talked about each one of the \nnominee's personal qualifications to serve on the circuit courts of \nAmerica. I should note that, back in January, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee indicated there would be a hearing for Justice \nPriscilla Owen, Michael McConnell, and Miguel Estrada--and that they \nwould have hearings this year. Now, I guess we have 4 more months that \nhave expired, another 4 months in which they have not been given a \nhearing much less a vote.\n  I hope they will given more than the courtesy of a hearing, which \nseems the minimum they should have. They should have a vote in the \nJudiciary Committee and then a vote here in the full Senate.\n  Mr. President, the delay in confirming such well qualified nominees \nto be judges has had an adverse impact on the judicial system itself. \nThe number of vacancies has gone up over the past year--there are now \nalmost 100 judgeships vacant--while 44 nominations languish in the \nSenate. As a result, justice is being delayed as the caseload burden \nincreases for almost every current judge in the nation.\n  I would take a moment to note one curious thing about today's efforts \nregarding judges. We had six judges on the calendar ready to be voted \non; but only four were moved, the other two were not. One of the two \nnominees has a very close association with Senator Hatch. The other one \nis the lone circuit judge on the calendar. So, once again, it appears \ncircuit judges are receiving worse treatment by the Judiciary Committee \nthan are the Federal district court nominees.\n  I realize around here we get to thinking: Well, wait a minute, \ncircuit courts are more involved in the interpretation of the law. \nMaybe they are more important. But I will tell you what, if you ever \npracticed a day of law, the ones you see who really are dealing with \nthe law every day are the Federal district judges. I do not understand \nthe big dichotomy here and why the circuit judges are being delayed and \ntreated so unfairly.\n  I want to point out what is happening in terms of these circuit \njudges nominated by President Bush as compared to the treatment that \nwas afforded circuit court nominees during President Clinton's first \ntwo years in office.\n  First off, I should note that while President Bush sent his first \nnominations up on May 9, 2001, a year ago, President Clinton did not \nsend up his first batch of nominations to the Senate until August of \nhis first year in office.\n  So, there was actually less time to actually get President Clinton's \nnominees confirmed than there has been to get George Bush's out.\n  Yet you can see from the chart what is actually happening with Bush's \nnominees, particularly with respect to the circuit judges. President \nClinton, in the 14 months after his first nominee was sent up, got 86 \npercent of them confirmed by the time Congress adjourned. Ultimately, \nover the course of the following Congress, Clinton ended up getting \nalmost all of the judges he nominated during his first Congressional \nterm. Again, I am not going to get into great arguments over the exact \npercentages or numbers, but there is clearly a problem here. While \nClinton got 86 percent of his circuit judges by the time his first \nCongress adjourned, President Bush only has 30 percent so far. And at \nthe current pace the judiciary is considering Bush's nominees, it looks \nlike Bush is not going to break 50% by the end of this Congress.\n  It looks as if we might get two or three more circuit judges by the \nend of the year, but it surely is moving deliberately slowly. The \nAmerican people recognize this is a problem for the country. When you \nhave a circuit like the 6th circuit that has a 50-percent vacancy rate, \nthen you begin to wonder, do we have enough judges to cover all the \ncases, even the truly important ones?\n  This is a question of law and order, Mr. President, drug cases, \nterrorist cases.\n  Justice Rehnquist, the Chief Justice, has decried the vacancy crisis \nas\n\n[[Page S4115]]\n\n``alarming.'' More than 10 percent of Federal judgeships are currently \nvacant. So this problem for our nation that is very serious, \nparticularly after the terrorist attacks in New York and here in \nWashington.\n  I have talked to Senator Daschle about it. Senator Nickles and I, \nalong with Senator Hatch, have talked to Senator Leahy and Senator \nReid. I know, having been majority leader, that sometimes these \nproblems are hard to resolve. The Judiciary Committee doesn't always \nfollow instructions even from the elected leaders. But this creates a \nproblem. We have been trying to resist slowing down or blocking \nmeetings or progress on the legislative process because we want to move \nforward on these important bills. But we have to point out that there \nis a blatant unfairness here, to the country and to the nominees. I \ncan't help but think of the cliche that justice delayed is justice \ndenied. That is what is happening here.\n  I know my time is running out. I probably will come back and talk \nmore about this later. I ask for fairness, fairness for these eight \ncircuit judges. We can argue about the others later, the other circuit \nnominees, other district judges, but after an entire year President \nBush's first eight nominees should have a hearing. They should have a \nvote on the Senate floor. No criticisms have been raised against them \nother than un-attributed hints that they are conservative, and the \ncurrent majority in the Senate is looking for some sort of a litmus \ntest or conformance, I guess, based on philosophy and ideology. I don't \nthink that either fair or appropriate. It is not what is called for \nunder the Constitution. I hope that the Senate will ultimately find a \nway to make progress in this area and give these nominees the \nopportunity to be fairly considered based upon their temperament, \nprofessional and educational qualifications, and their personal \nintegrity.\n  As President Bush has noted in making the case for getting his \nnominees confirmed, Federal judges are key to making sure America \nfunctions well. Every day they uphold the rights of an individual, they \nprotect the innocent, they punish the guilty. Their rulings are \nessential to the rule of law in our nation. To discharge their \nresponsibilities the federal courts must have judges.''\n\n  Because of the number of vacancies in our nation's courts, Americans \nare being forced to wait for justice, and the burden on federal judges \nis growing heavier.\n  Mr. President, one newspaper, the Wichita Eagle, got it exactly right \non the judges issue back in March in part I think because it is located \nin the heart of America when it said: ``But just as presidents have an \nobligation not to nominate the incompetent or unqualified to the \nfederal bench, presidents deserve the broad authority in making their \nchoices for such judicial posts. And the Senate has a responsibility to \ngive those choices every possible consideration and, barring some \nglaring defect, confirm them quickly. Yet the backstabbing and stalling \non judicial confirmations has escalated to the point of obstructing \njustice. It needs to stop.''\n  This President's nominees are men and women of distinction and great \naccomplishment. They are solidly within the mainstream of American \nlegal opinion, and they share a principled commitment to follow the \nlaw, not legislate it from the bench.\n  Mr. President, President Bush' nominees should be given fair \nhearings, voted on, and confirmed by the Senate as soon as possible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the past year's \njudicial nominations, which is something on which several people have \nspoken today. I just came from a meeting with the President where he \nwas talking about his frustration in getting judicial nominees \nconsidered. He was quite animated and discouraged that we have not been \ngetting more judicial nominees through the system--particularly circuit \ncourt judges. That is what he was stating. That is what the meeting was \nabout. He wants to see more happening and more of them occurring, and \nwe need to do so. People have been pretty clear on the information of \nwhat technically and specifically has happened.\n  Since May 9 of last year, we have had 11 judicial nominees for the \nU.S. circuit courts of appeal. Those eleven were nominated 1 year ago. \nSince that time, only 3--including 2 Democrats--have been confirmed. Of \nthe remaining 8, not one has even been scheduled for a hearing. We have \nnot held hearings on these individuals. We need to get this done and \nstart to move them forward. It is an issue that is engaging the \ncountry, and I think increasingly so, as we move into the fall. We have \na number of pieces of legislation that I think, in the post 9-11 \nenvironment, will be considered and looked at by the courts and need to \nbe reviewed. We need to have a fully staffed court. Right now we have a \n20-percent vacancy on the circuit court; and within some of the \ncircuits, it is even a much larger one.\n  In the Sixth Circuit there are 16 positions and only half of those \nare filled.\n  What is even more troubling is that we have had a long and \nestablished tradition of giving the President--regardless of his \npolitical affiliation--a good deal of deference on his nominees who \nmight be unfairly targeted as being extremists.\n  However, as we found out during the Charles Pickering nomination and \nsubsequent hearings, the real extremism is being employed by those \npeople who are artfully using the terms ``balance'' and ``moderation'' \nto set the stage for ending deference to the President and excluding \nperfectly qualified judges. Judge Pickering was an individual nominated \nto go on the circuit court. He served on the Federal bench for over 10 \nyears.\n  This practice does not bode well for the future of this committee \nwhen it may have to deal with Supreme Court nominees in the near \nfuture. To highlight just how bad it can be, it might be helpful to see \nhow many Supreme Court Justices of the past would fare under the \nideological litmus test that is now plainly evident and used on the \ncommittee.\n  Would some of our great Justices of the past survive the litmus test \nbeing put forward by the committee now?\n  John Marshall, the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and \nauthor of some of the most important legal decisions for this Nation, \nwould likely be rejected today by the Judiciary Committee because his \nview on interstate commerce in the Gibbons v. Odgen would be seen as \ntoo pro-federalism.\n  Oliver Wendell Holmes, perhaps the greatest Supreme Court justice, \nwould have trouble because he affirmed a state law providing for the \nsterilization of the mentally ill in Buck v. Bell. Felix Frankfurter, \nan ACLU member and a ``liberal'' Roosevelt appointee, would be rejected \nbecause he did not believe that the fourth amendment required the \nexclusion of evidence seized\n\n[[Page S4116]]\n\nby State police officers without a warrant in the 1961 Mapp v. Ohio \ncase. Nor would his argument in West Virginia Board of Education v. \nBarnette that the first amendment prohibited schools from requiring \nstudents to salute the American flag pass muster with the committee \ntoday.\n  Even Earl Warren, the most liberal chief justice ever and author of \nBrown v. Board of Education, would have a tough confirmation battle \nunder the committee's new standard. After all, he took the reactionary \nposition of not supporting extension of the first amendment protection \nto flag burning.\n  Louis Brandeis, the great liberal craftsman, would no doubt be \nrejected because he supported federalism against New Deal legislation \nand voted to strike down legislation in the Schecter case as being \nbeyond the power of Congress.\n  Byron White, President Kennedy's nominee, whose recent passing was \nmourned and elegantly eulogized around the Nation, would of course be \nrejected today because he committed the unpardonable sin of disagreeing \nwith Roe v. Wade.\n  The question facing the President on this anniversary date is what he \ncan do to move judges to the floor for swift confirmation. Given the \nextremist tactics of outside interest groups and their influence over \ncommittee members, the President could consider compromising on his \nphilosophy of nominating judges, men and women of experience who meet \nthe highest standards of legal training, temperament, and judgement. As \nhistory has shown, however, it would mean overlooking the kind of \njudges who have made our judiciary a model for the world. Unlike some \nissues, the integrity of the law and the qualifications of judges who \nwill interpret and uphold them cannot be compromised.\n  I join my colleagues in urging Chairman Leahy of the Judiciary \nCommittee and Majority Leader Daschle in scheduling hearings and floor \nvotes as soon as possible. I believe we have had ample time to make our \npoints. It's now time to act.\n  I think if we do not act, this is going to continue to fester across \nthe country, and that will embroil us even greater this fall, with the \nPresident leading the charge on this issue of why the Senate isn't \nacting. Why isn't the Senate moving these judges through--particularly \ncircuit court judges? It will be a much more engaged and animated issue \nthis fall, with the President leading the charge.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in morning business on the \ntopic that has been the issue du jour--the question of Federal judges. \nIt is my great honor to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee. I have \nwitnessed and experienced personally the Clinton administration and \ntheir efforts to fill vacancies on the Federal bench, and the first \nBush administration--President George W. Bush--and his efforts to fill \nvacancies on the Federal bench.\n  I find it extremely interesting that today appears to be the national \nday for members of the Republican Party to complain about the pace of \napproval of President Bush's judicial nominees. What I find interesting \nabout that complaint is that, just on its face, it makes no sense \nbecause we just approved four more Federal nominees who were brought to \nus by President Bush, bringing the total to 56.\n  Now, 56 Federal judges--to put it into historic context--is more than \nthe Republicans, in any similar period of time, approved while \nPresident Clinton was in the White House during his entire tenure. In \nany given year, the Republicans failed to approve as many judges for \nPresident Clinton as the Democrats have already approved for President \nBush. Today, the total number came to 56.\n  Now, I understand where the Republicans are coming from on this. They \nwant them all. They want to fill every vacancy with a proposed nominee \nfrom President Bush, and they want this to happen immediately. It is \nmore than just rewarding their friends and giving them lifetime \nappointments to the Federal bench. What is at issue here, even more \nimportantly, is putting people with a certain philosophy on these \nFederal courts. Of course, their decisions as Federal judges are going \nto be meaningful to the Nation for generations to come--whether we are \ntalking about rights of privacy or the environment, all of these things \ndecided by judges.\n  Historically, we think, when we talk about courts and their impact, \nthat we should focus on the Supreme Court. Of course, we should. It is \nthe highest court in the land. But just consider for a moment this \nstatistic: Last year, the Supreme Court of the United States decided \napproximately 80 cases. The courts of appeal, circuit courts, decided \nover 57,000 cases.\n  For most people looking for justice through the Federal court system, \nthe court of appeals for their region is the last stop, the final word. \nThese courts make binding decisions relative to statutes that have been \npassed by Congress and issues that are important to the American people \non a regular basis, on a daily basis.\n  So when we consider nominees by the Bush White House for lifetime \nappointments to these important appellate level courts, I hope you can \nunderstand that those of us on the Democratic side feel a \nresponsibility to know something about the nominees, and, more \nimportantly, to make certain those nominees come close to meeting \nseveral basic standards. One of those standards, of course, is legal \nskill. We insist on that. I hope that is something that is not \ndebatable. Second is integrity, which is certainly not debatable. \nThird, and most important, we are looking for people who take a \nmoderate point of view.\n\n  There are lawyers who I have met that have extreme positions on the \nright and the left. The Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee \nsent word to the Clinton White House: Do not send us any left-wing \njudges because they are going nowhere. True to their word, anyone who \nlooked like they were liberal did not have a chance when it came to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee in the Clinton years.\n  Interestingly enough, it appears the Bush White House believes they \nare not burdened by the same restriction. They are sending nominees for \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee to consider who, frankly, are out of the \nmainstream, much more extreme in their points of view on the right than \nanyone ever nominated by President Clinton on the left.\n  When they send these controversial nominees to us, then we run into a \nposition where it takes longer. We have to delve into their \nbackgrounds, we have to establish their record, we have to answer the \ncriticisms that have been raised within and without the committee about \nwhether this person should be given a lifetime appointment to a \ncritical Federal position.\n  This morning my colleague on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator \nSchumer of New York, held an interesting subcommittee hearing. His \nhearing related to what he calls the ghost of the nomination process \nfrom the Clinton years. I was glad Senator Schumer did that because on \nthis day of national complaint by the Republicans, we brought to \nWashington four Clinton nominees who were not approved by that same \nSenate Judiciary Committee when Republicans controlled it. We did this \nso people who are following this debate could get an idea of the \nnominees rejected by the Republican Senate Judiciary Committee when \nPresident Clinton nominated them.\n  Frankly, as I look at the people who were brought before us, they are \namazing in terms of their records and their backgrounds and what they \nbrought to the job.\n  Let me speak for a moment about the Fifth Circuit which has become a \nfocal point of discussion. Senator Lott a few minutes ago was talking \nabout the Fifth Circuit which, if I remember, includes the States of \nTexas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. This circuit has the highest \nminority population of any Federal circuit in America. The population \nof African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans is larger in that \ncircuit than any other circuit.\n  Naturally, when President Clinton was in office, he tried to address \nthis by appointing people to the circuit court who represented the \ndiversity of the circuit in which they would serve. Two of his nominees \ncame before us today.\n  Jorge Rangel, 54 years of age, is currently an attorney in private \npractice in Corpus Christi, TX. He was nominated to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for\n\n[[Page S4117]]\n\nthe Fifth Circuit by President Clinton in 1997. Mr. Rangel was never \ngranted a hearing by the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee. \nNever. He graduated from the University of Houston and Harvard Law \nSchool. He went on to a distinguished career of 20 years in private \npractice with a Corpus Christi law firm where he had a mix of Federal \nand State work.\n  In 1983, he was appointed to a judgeship on the Texas State district \ncourt, and then was elected to serve for 2 years before returning to \nprivate practice. Jorge Rangel has also been very active in legal and \ncommunity organizations, including time as an officer of the board of \ngovernors of the bar association of the Fifth Circuit and the American \nBoard of Trial Advocates. He volunteered for many legal organizations, \ncommunity organizations, and charitable organizations. He has written \nno controversial opinions or writings. He was affiliated with no \nliberal groups and gave no one any reason whatsoever to question his \ncredentials and fitness for the Federal bench.\n\n  The American Bar Association took a look at Jorge Rangel and \nconcluded he was ``well qualified'' to serve as a Federal appellate \ncourt judge. Yet, for purely political reasons, Jorge Rangel's \nnomination was held up more than a year from July 1997 until the end of \n1998, a total of 15 months, with no explanation or hint of opposition \nto him.\n  Consider that for a minute. When you listen to this man's background, \nhis rating of ``well qualified'' from the American Bar Association, why \nin the world would he be held up? It turns out that the two Senators \nfrom his home State opposed him, and because they were of opposite \npolitical faith with the President of the United States, they made \ncertain he did not get a chance for even a hearing before the \ncommittee.\n  When you watch that happening, and when you listen to his testimony, \nyou have to wonder: Where is the fairness? When you listen to the \ncomplaints today, even though the Senate Judiciary Committee under \nDemocrat control has approved 56 nominees, many of whom are Hispanic \nand racial minorities, and rejected only 1, when you look at this you \nwonder: Why would we apply a different standard when it comes to \nClinton nominees than we do to Bush nominees? That really has created \nthe problem we face.\n  The simple fact is this: The nominees President Clinton sent to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee were held to a higher professional, \npolitical, and personal standard than the nominees being sent by the \nBush White House, and many of them, even when they met those standards, \nwere never given the courtesy of a hearing.\n  In that same Fifth Circuit was Enrique Moreno, 47 years old, an \nattorney in private practice in El Paso, a native of Mexico. Mr. Moreno \ngraduated from Harvard University and Harvard Law School. He was \nnominated by President Clinton in September of 1999 to serve on the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals. He was give the highest rating by the \nAmerican Bar Association--``well qualified.'' He received significant \nsupport from community groups. He waited 15 months and, as had Mr. \nRangel, he was never even given the courtesy of a hearing before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  Excuse me. When I hear my colleagues on the other side come to this \nChamber and complain that we are not moving fast enough in approving \nthe Bush nominees, consider what happened to Mr. Rangel and Mr. Moreno. \nWhat happened to them was sad, it was wrong, and it is unforgivable.\n  I could go through the long list of accomplishments of Mr. Moreno. \nTrust me, it is a long page of extraordinary accomplishments, and yet, \nwhen it came right down to it, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee were determined he would never even receive a hearing, and he \ndid not.\n  Let me refer to Kent Markus. Kent Markus was before our subcommittee \ntoday. He is 46 years old. He was nominated by President Clinton in \nFebruary 2000 to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth \nCircuit. The interesting thing about Mr. Markus is he had the approval \nof both his home State Senators, two Republicans: Senator Mike DeWine \nand Senator George Voinovich. Despite bipartisan support, despite being \nqualified by the American Bar Association and his excellent record of \nachievement and service, he was never, ever given the courtesy of a \nhearing before the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee. \nFinally, at the end of the 106th Congress, his nomination was returned \nto the White House.\n\n  Again, I will make it a matter of my official record in my statement, \nbut trust me, his biography, his resume, are impeccable.\n  A final nominee I will mention today who testified before us is \nBonnie Campbell. She was nominated by President Clinton in 2000 to \nserve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. She was \nsupported by both of her Senators, Democrat Tom Harkin of Iowa and \nRepublican Chuck Grassley of Iowa. She was given a qualified rating by \nthe American Bar Association. She was given a hearing before the \nJudiciary Committee a few months after she was nominated and given a \nchance at her hearing to answer any questions about her work. There \nwere no objections voiced at all during her hearing before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. No opposition surfaced in any quarter.\n  However, despite a noncontroversial, really unremarkable hearing, Ms. \nCampbell was never scheduled for a committee vote. No explanation was \never given to her. Her nomination languished until the end of the 106th \nCongress, and despite President Clinton's attempt to renominate her, \nPresident Bush did not do the same. Her nomination died.\n  Consider those four people and what they went through at the hands of \nthe Republican Senate Judiciary Committee and then put that in context \nof the Republican complaints which we hear today, when we have already, \nunder Democratic control, approved 56 nominees. I think it really makes \nthe case.\n  Judicial nominees have a right, whether the Judiciary Committee is \ncontrolled by Democrats or Republicans, to expect fair and impartial \ntreatment. But, equally, the American people have a right to expect \nfair and impartial judges.\n  Now let us get down to the bottom line. The President will find that \nthis Senate Judiciary Committee, under the control of Democrats, will \nprovide more approvals of his judicial nominees than Republican \nJudiciary Committees have done for Democrat Presidents in the past. I \nthink that is a standard we can live up to. We have already lived up to \nit.\n  We are going to treat people fairly. We are going to give them a \nchance. Does that mean President Bush will get every name he sends \nbefore the Judiciary Committee approved? No. That is not going to \nhappen because if the President sends people who, frankly, do not meet \nthe test of moderation, legal skill and integrity, there is going to \nbe, of course, an investigation, as there is with every nominee. There \nwill be hearings in many cases, and some will not survive that.\n  The message to the President is very clear: As long as he will send \nus people who are moderate and not too extreme, he will be very \nsuccessful. He already has 56 judicial nominees approved.\n  I think the single best thing this White House could take from this \nall-day debate about judicial nominees is this: If the President \ndecided and said, We are going to take these four nominees--Bonnie \nCampbell, Jorge Rangel, Enrique Moreno, and Kent Markus--all nominees \nunder the Clinton White House, and we are going to send them to Capitol \nHill in a show of bipartisan good faith, I think we could start to make \nprogress. I think we could start having some balance in terms of the \npeople who will be appointed to these critical positions. But if this \nis going to be confrontation after confrontation, then I am sorry to \nsay it is going to continue almost indefinitely. I hope it does not.\n\n  Let me give a list of those who never received a hearing before \nCongress during the Clinton years, judicial nominees sent to Capitol \nHill by President Clinton while there were Republicans in charge of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee: Wenona Whitfield of Illinois, Leland Shurin \nof Missouri, Bruce Greer of Florida--none of these received a hearing \nbefore the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Sue Ellen Myerscough of Illinois; Cheryl Wattley of Texas; Michael\n\n[[Page S4118]]\n\nSchattman of Texas; James Beaty and Rich Leonard of the Fourth Circuit, \nNorth Carolina; Annabelle Rodriguez of Texas--none of those received a \nhearing. Their names were sent to Capitol Hill, to the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate Judiciary Committee; no hearings.\n  Then in the next Congress, there were 10: Helene White of Michigan; \nJorge Rangel I mentioned earlier, of Texas; Jeffrey Coleman of \nIllinois; James Klein of the District of Columbia; Robert Freedberg of \nPennsylvania; Cheryl Wattley of Texas; Lynette Norton of Pennsylvania; \nRobert Raymar for the Third Circuit; Legrome Davis, Pennsylvania; Lynne \nLasry of California; Barry Goode of the Ninth Circuit, California--all \nof those names, judicial nominees, sent to Capitol Hill by President \nClinton never even received the courtesy of a hearing before the \nRepublican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  In the 106th Congress, 33 names sent by the President who were not \ngiven the courtesy of a hearing: Alston Johnson of Louisiana; James \nDuffy of Hawaii; Elana Kagan of the D.C. Circuit; James Wynn of North \nCarolina; Kathleen McCree-Lewis of Michigan; Enrique Moreno of Texas; \nJames Lyons of Colorado; Kent Markus of Ohio; Robert Cindrich of \nPennsylvania; Stephen Orlofsky of New Jersey; Robert Gregory of \nVirginia; Christine Arguello of Colorado; Elizabeth Gibson, North \nCarolina; Rich Leonard of North Carolina; Patricia Coan of Colorado; \nDolly Gee, California; Steve Bell, Ohio; Rhonda Fields, District of \nColumbia; David Fineman, Pennsylvania; Linda Riegle, Nevada; Ricardo \nMorado, Texas; Gary Sebelius, Kansas; Ken Simon, Hawaii; David Cercone, \nPennsylvania; Harry Litman, Oklahoma; Valerie Couch, Oklahoma; Marion \nJohnston, California; Steve Achelphol of Nebraska; Richard Anderson of \nMontana; Stephen Liberman of Pennsylvania; and Melvin Hall of Oklahoma.\n  These 52 names of judicial nominees I have read were sent to the \nRepublican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee under President \nClinton and they were never even given the opportunity for a public \nhearing, never given a chance for a vote. I knew some of them \npersonally, and I can say it is a great hardship on a professional like \nan attorney, where their name is pending before a committee and there \nis uncertainty about their future.\n  Some of these went on for literally years. Some of them were never \ngiven a hearing, and during that period of uncertainty their family \nsuffered, their law practice suffered, their efforts to be part of \npublic service were never realized. I think that is unfortunate.\n  That is why we are back to the point I made earlier. President Bush \nand those working for him and with him in the White House want to break \nthrough this situation and want to see more cooperation and want to \nfind more balance, as we do, in terms of the judiciary.\n\n  I submit to them the four names of the nominees from the Clinton \nWhite House which we considered today, people who came before the \nJudiciary Committee today. Earlier, the minority leader spoke of a \nnominee for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals who is Hispanic, and I \ncertainly think we need more Hispanic Americans on the bench.\n  President Bush should have a chance. Jorge Rangel is prepared to \nserve on the Fifth Circuit. Enrique Moreno is also prepared to serve on \nthe Fifth Circuit. These are Hispanic Americans who should be \nrenominated and given a chance to serve.\n  At the current time, we have looked at Hispanic nominees and \nPresident Bush has sent us five nominees of Hispanic origin. Of those, \nthree have already been confirmed by the Senate under Democratic \ncontrol. Two are pending: Miguel Estrada in D.C. and Jose Martinez in \nFlorida.\n  Under President Clinton, Hispanic nominees who were not confirmed by \nthe Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee include: Jorge \nRangel of the Fifth Circuit; Enrique Moreno of the Fifth Circuit; \nChristine Arguello of the Tenth Circuit; Ricardo Morado of Texas; \nAnabelle Rodriguez, Puerto Rico.\n  I think that takes us to the point where we have to ask ourselves if \nour friends on the Republican side really do want to see balance and \nwant to see fair treatment, whether they will give that same fair \ntreatment to people who were summarily rejected when the Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate Judiciary Committee. I think we have a chance to \nbe very careful in our selection, but also to meet our national needs \nand obligations.\n  Today, incidentally, during the course of a press conference on this \nsubject, we brought in a number of people who have had bad experiences \nin court to dramatize what is at stake. This debate is not a matter of \nrewarding an attorney, who has skills, with a new title and an \nopportunity to serve on the bench. It is also to create an opportunity \nfor public service where people can make decisions that really have an \nimpact on families' lives across America.\n  Today, Denise Mercado came to see us. She is the mother of three from \nFayetteville, NC. She is the legal guardian of her son, Danny, who has \ncerebral palsy and severe mental retardation. Due to his disabilities, \nDanny is eligible for Medicaid funding. Jane Perkins is an attorney at \nthe National Health Law Program in Chapel Hill, NC. Jane has \nrepresented Denise and many other clients in efforts to compel States \nto fulfill their legal obligations under Medicaid, to cover children \nlike Danny. Currently, four Federal courts of appeals are considering \nwhether States have sovereign immunity from such lawsuits, as at least \none district court has ruled.\n  So the men and women appointed to these court positions will make \ndecisions which have an impact on families with children with \ndisabilities. That is just part of their responsibility, but it tells \nus about the gravity and seriousness of this decisionmaking process.\n  Rose Townsend and Bonnie Sanders are residents of South Camden, NJ. \nThey live in a small neighborhood called Waterfront South. It contains \n20 percent of the city's contaminated waste sites. The residents of \nthis neighborhood suffer from a disproportionately high rate of asthma \nand other respiratory ailments. Last year, these two people joined with \nother residents to block the placement of a cement processing facility \nin their neighborhood. In December, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals \nruled they could not compel the State to comply with Federal \nenvironmental regulations that implement the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n  Whether it is a matter of public health, or environmental safety, \nthese judges make critical decisions. These are just some of the people \nwho were impacted by judges put on the Federal courts. These are \nimportant decisions. They should be handed out fairly and evenly, with \nsome balance. The Judiciary Committee has met that standard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I listened with interest to comments \nof the Senator from Illinois, looking at the whole 8 years of the \nClinton administration. It is important to reiterate the only clear way \nto look at the 8 years of the Clinton administration is to compare them \nto the 8 years of the Reagan administration. President Reagan got more \njudges confirmed than any other President, 382. He had a distinct \nadvantage because 6 of the 8 years he was President his party \ncontrolled the Senate. President Clinton came in a close second, 377 \njudges confirmed, 5 fewer, but he was in a disadvantage because his \nparty only controlled the Senate for 2 of his 8 years. It is hard to \nmake the case that President Clinton was treated unfairly by the \nRepublican Congress.\n  What we want to talk about today is the first 2 years of any \nPresident's term--how were they treated at the beginning of their 8 \nyears. Particularly, we focus on the circuit judge nominations.\n  During the first 2 years of President Clinton's term, when his party \ncontrolled the Senate, he got 86 percent of his nominees confirmed for \nthe circuit courts. During the first President Bush's first 2 years, \nwhen his party did not control the Senate, he got 95 percent of his \ncircuit court nominees confirmed in his first 2 years. President \nReagan, in his first 2 years, got 95 percent, as well, 19 out of 20.\n  Let's focus on the first 2 years, the beginning of what I certainly \nhope will be an 8-year period of the Presidency of George W. Bush. \nGeorge W. Bush has gotten a mere 30 percent of his circuit\n\n[[Page S4119]]\n\ncourt nominees confirmed, compared to 86 percent for President Clinton, \n95 percent for the first President Bush, and 95 percent for President \nReagan.\n  I call attention, since this is the 1-year anniversary of the first \n11 nominations of President George W. Bush to the circuit courts. Only \nthree have been confirmed, eight languish 1 year later without so much \nas a hearing to get a chance to explain their credentials to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and to the larger Senate as well. Eleven \ndistinguished and diverse men and women were nominated by President \nGeorge W. Bush a year ago today. Only three have been confirmed. Of the \nremaining eight, none, not a single one, has even been afforded the \ncourtesy of a hearing, not to mention a vote--a hearing by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Everyone in America is entitled to have their day in court. Even a \njudge is entitled to have their day in court. Our colleagues on the \nother side continually assure this side they are pushing fast to \nconsider the President's judicial nominees, but my Republican \ncolleagues and I have seen neither hide nor hair of these nominations \nin the Judiciary Committee. Frankly, some in the committee are worried \nabout what might have happened to them. Where could they possibly be? A \nfew people may recognize these individuals by sight. After all, none of \nthem have even had a hearing. All most people know is a name attached \nto the nomination. No one knows what they look like; their whereabouts \nare a mystery. It is my hope citizens around the world would notify the \nJudiciary Committee if they spot these missing nominees somewhere out \nin America so maybe a hearing can be quickly scheduled on their behalf.\n  We have become accustomed to seeing missing children's pictures on \nmilk cartons around America. We thought it might be appropriate to put \nthe names of some of the nominees on milk cartons, so if any of our \npeople across the country have seen any of them, maybe they could \nreport them to the Judiciary Committee and the missing people could \nactually be given an opportunity to be heard.\n\n  A good first person to put on the milk carton is Miguel Estrada, \nnominated 365 days ago, this very day last year, to the D.C. Circuit \nCourt. The ABA gave Miguel Estrada a unanimous well qualified. That is \nvery hard to do. It is very tough to even get a partial well-qualified \nrating from the ABA but to get a unanimous rating of well qualified is \ntruly extraordinary.\n  Miguel Estrada's life and his career is a great American success \nstory. I am married to one of those immigrants who came to this country \nand didn't speak a word of English at 8, so I am very familiar with \nthese wonderful stories of coming to America, particularly those who \nhave been thrown into our public schools at an early age, not speaking \nEnglish and coming to grips with that.\n  That is exactly what happened to Miguel Estrada. He came from \nHonduras, emigrated to the United States as a teenager, speaking \nvirtually no English. Yet he graduated phi beta kappa from Columbia in \nNew York and was editor of the Harvard Law Review. Miguel Estrada came \nto this country, not speaking a word of English, an honor student at \nColumbia, elected to the Law Review at Harvard, unanimously ``well \nqualified'' by the American Bar Association, an inspiration to \nimmigrants all across America and particularly to Hispanic immigrants. \nHe has argued 15 civil and criminal cases before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. But Americans do not know what he looks like. He has never had a \nhearing. He has never been able to show up in public and make his case \nthat maybe this immigrant success story, an example to look up to by \neveryone in America, but particularly our immigrant population who came \nhere and had to deal not only with learning the language but learning a \nnew culture, this hero of the immigrant community has been languishing \nin the Judiciary Committee for 365 days. There is no indication in \nsight that he will be given a hearing.\n  To anyone who may be looking, if you have seen this man, you might \nwant to report it to the Judiciary Committee so he can get a hearing.\n  Another nominee from a year ago, arguably pending for a decade, John \nRoberts has been waiting over 10 years for a hearing. He was nominated \nby the first President Bush over a decade ago to the D.C. Circuit Court \nand back then was pending for over a year without ever receiving a \nhearing. The current President Bush renominated Mr. Roberts 365 days \nago, a year ago today, to the same court, the D.C. Circuit Court. \nAgain, he has not had a hearing. This outstanding lawyer, again, \nunanimously rated ``well qualified'' by the ABA--and it is very tough \nto get a rating such as that--has actually been waiting for 2 years, 2 \nyears just to get a hearing, an opportunity to tell his story. So we \nthought maybe he ought to be on the milk carton, too.\n  This unanimously well-qualified nominee has a long and distinguished \ncareer in public service, including serving as principal deputy to the \nSolicitor General from 1989 to 1993, and associate counsel to President \nReagan from 1982 to 1986. The previous nominees had 15 arguments before \nthe U.S. Supreme Court; this nominee has argued 36 cases before the \nU.S. Supreme Court and 20 cases in the U.S. appeals court across the \ncountry.\n  Has anyone seen John Roberts? Does anyone even know what he looks \nlike? Has he been dropped into a black hole? Another great nominee of a \nyear ago missing in action, not even given a hearing.\n  Also nominated a year ago today was Jeffrey Sutton. The ABA gave \nhim--a majority--``qualified,'' and the rest gave him ``well \nqualified.'' So it was a split rating. The minority gave him ``well \nqualified''; the majority gave him ``qualified''--a very good rating.\n  Mr. Sutton graduated first in his class from Ohio State University \nCollege of Law. He has argued nine cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, \nboth as a private attorney and as solicitor for the State of Ohio. He \nhas taught constitutional law at Ohio State for the last 8 years.\n  Has anyone seen Jeffrey Sutton? Does anybody know what he looks like? \nHe hasn't had an opportunity to be seen in public. Maybe he, too, \nshould be put on a milk carton so somebody could recognize this guy and \nmaybe report to the Senate Judiciary Committee that they have seen him. \nHe really does exist. Maybe he ought to get an opportunity to be heard.\n  Jeffrey is a nominee for the Sixth Circuit, and I want to dwell on \nthat for just a moment. Kentucky happens to be one of the States in the \nSixth Circuit: Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. It is 50 \npercent vacant. That is not because the President has not sent up \nnominations. There are seven nominations up here. But not a single \nnominee from the Sixth Circuit has been confirmed. We have a judicial \nemergency. The Sixth Circuit is dysfunctional, not because the \nPresident has not made nominations.\n  I mentioned Miguel Estrada's success story. Here is a nominee from \nMichigan who, if confirmed, would become the first Arab American on a \ncircuit court in American history, a nominee from the State of Michigan \nwho, if confirmed, would become the first Arab American on a circuit \ncourt in the Nation's history. He has not yet had a hearing.\n  Jeffrey Sutton has been sitting there for 365 days, also for the \nSixth Circuit. He is from the State of Ohio. If anybody sees Jeffrey \nSutton, I want you know what he looks like. This is what he looks like. \nSend his picture in to the Judiciary Committee. Maybe he could at least \nget a hearing and an opportunity to state his qualifications for the \ncourt.\n  Deborah Cook: She has been a justice on the Ohio Supreme Court for \nthe last 8 years--again, a Sixth Circuit nominee. This is the circuit \nthat is 50 percent vacant--not because the President has not sent up \nnominations but because they have not been acted upon. Deborah Cook has \nbeen sitting there for 365 days. She was nominated a year ago today in \nthe first batch sent up by President Bush.\n  Prior to her service on the Ohio Supreme Court, she was an appellate \ncourt judge for 4 years. She has been unanimously rated ``qualified'' \nby the American Bar Association. Has anybody seen Justice Cook? I \nwanted to make sure we could get a sense of what she looked like. This \nis a picture of Deborah Cook. If anyone wants to call her \nqualifications to the attention of the Judiciary Committee, they might \ntake this opportunity to do that.\n\n[[Page S4120]]\n\n  Terence Boyle is another nominee who arguably has been waiting 10 \nyears for a hearing. He was nominated a decade ago by the first \nPresident Bush and waited for over a year without receiving a hearing \nat that time. He was nominated again 365 days ago, a year ago today, to \nthe Fourth Circuit. The ABA unanimously rated him well qualified, just \nlike Miguel Estrada--unanimously ``well qualified.'' That is as good as \nit gets. That means the committee of the ABA unanimously found this \nnomination to be of the highest order.\n  This nominee currently serves as the chief judge of the U.S. District \nCourt for the Eastern District of North Carolina and has been on that \ncourt since 1984 when his nomination to that court was unanimously \nconfirmed by the Senate.\n  Has anyone seen Judge Boyle? We know he exists. We have seen his name \non paper. This is what he looks like. If anybody sees Judge Boyle, they \nmight call the Judiciary Committee and say maybe this unanimously well \nqualified nominee ought at least to get an opportunity to be heard, a \nchance to be questioned by the members of the committee, so we can make \na determination as to whether or not he deserves a chance to be voted \nupon.\n  Michael McConnell--I wish this fellow were related to me, but he is \nnot. In fact, I found out after he was nominated that he is from my \nhometown. I went to high school in Louisville, KY. I never knew him. I \nam not related to him or his parents, but I wish I were. What an \noutstanding nominee.\n  He was nominated for the Tenth Circuit 365 days ago, a year ago \ntoday. Again, the ABA found him, unanimously, ``well qualified.'' Like \nMiguel Estrada, like several of the other nominees I have mentioned, \nthat is as good as it gets--unanimously well qualified.\n  Mr. McConnell is a distinguished law professor at the University of \nUtah College of Law and has served as an Assistant Solicitor at the \nU.S. Department of Justice. He is widely regarded as an authority on \nconstitutional law, particularly issues involving the first amendment \nand religious clauses.\n  Mr. McConnell has received the support of over 300 college law \nprofessors, including the noted liberal professors Cass Sunstein and \nSanford Levinson. Support for Mr. McConnell is across the ideological \nspectrum from the people who know him best, law professors around \nAmerica.\n  Has anybody seen Michael McConnell? I want you to be able to \nrecognize him. This is his picture. This nominee, unanimously ``well \nqualified'' by the ABA, surely could at least be given a hearing before \nthe committee to have an opportunity to state his qualifications and be \nasked questions.\n  Justice Priscilla Owen is on the Texas Supreme Court. She was \nnominated 365 days ago, a year ago today. She has served with \ndistinction on the Texas Supreme Court for the past 8 years. Now she is \nbeing nominated for the Fifth Circuit. The ABA has unanimously rated \nher well qualified.\n  This is a situation where we have a judicial emergency. A judicial \nemergency has been declared here. Yet we have a nominee who has been \nlanguishing for a year with not even so much as a hearing.\n  So, this is what Justice Priscilla Owen looks like. She is an \nattractive, nice looking woman, smart lawyer.\n  If anybody sees her here in the hall, they might direct her down to \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. Maybe she could ask somebody for a \nhearing.\n  Dennis Shedd was nominated 365 days ago--1 year ago today--to the \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals. He served as a sitting Federal judge \nfor the U.S. District Court for South Carolina since 1990. The ABA \nrated him ``well qualified.'' He taught at the University of South \nCarolina from 1989 to 1992 and has been chief counsel to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee right here in the Senate.\n  I am sure there are people over in the Senate Judiciary Committee who \nknow what Dennis Shedd looks like because he used to run that committee \nstaff. Maybe we don't need to send them a picture of Dennis Shedd. \nMaybe some of them actually remember him. You would think Dennis Shedd, \nas a matter of common courtesy, having formally been staff director \nover at the Judiciary Committee, could at least get a hearing so he \ncould state his qualifications and have a chance to make his case.\n  The message for today is that it has been a year since the President \nsent up his first 11 nominations for the circuit courts. Eight of them \nhave dropped into a black hole and have literally disappeared.\n  That is why we thought it might be a good idea to have a picture of \nsome of them in case it might help in recognizing them and giving them \nan opportunity for fundamental fairness. We are in the first 2 years of \nGeorge W. Bush's Presidency--not the last 2 years, not the last year, \nnot the last 6 months. I think we can all concede that toward the end \nof a President's term, nominations frequently don't move. But there is \nno precedent--none--for this kind of slow walking and stonewalling in \nthe beginning of a President's term. President Clinton got 86 percent \nof his circuit court nominees in the first 2 years. His party \ncontrolled the Senate. I am, frankly, surprised that it wasn't 100 \npercent because his party controlled the Senate in the first 4 years of \nhis term. But he got 86 percent.\n  The first President Bush got 95 percent of his nominees in his first \n2 years and his party did not control the Senate.\n  President Reagan got 95 percent of his circuit court nominees in his \nfirst 2 years and his party did control the Senate.\n  As you can see the pattern here, no matter who has been in the \nmajority of the Senate, and no matter who has been in the White House \nin the first 2 years, these games have not been played in the past. \nThis is unprecedented. You can throw the statistics around as much as \nyou want, but we are talking about the first 2 years of a President's \nadministration. It has never been done before.\n  The good news is it is not too late. This is May 9. There is a month \nleft. It is never too late for salvation.\n  It is my hope that these outstanding nominees missing in action and \nwho have seemingly dropped down a black hole will get an opportunity to \nbe heard as a matter of fundamental fairness.\n  I had an opportunity, along with others, to meet with the President \nearlier today on this issue. I heard some suggestions made on the other \nside of the aisle that this is really all about in effect telling the \nPresident who to send up. In other words, Mr. President, send up a \ncertain kind of nominee or you won't get action. I can't speak for the \nPresident, but I have the clear impression that this President \nbelieves, as all other President's believe, that the business of \nselecting nominees to the circuit court level and to the Supreme Court \nlevel are Presidential prerogatives. I don't think this President is \ngoing to operate any differently on that issue than President Clinton \nor President Carter or President Roosevelt. We all know that Senators \nhave an opportunity to make suggestions on district court nominees. \nThat has not changed. But circuit court nominees and Supreme Court \nnominees have historically and will be forever the prerogative of the \nPresident.\n  The thought that any of us are going to be able to dictate to this \nPresident or any other President who those nominees might be is absurd. \nIt is not going to happen tomorrow. It is not going to happen a month \nfrom now. It is not going to happen ever. No President--Republican or \nDemocrat--is going to allow the Senate, no matter which party controls \nthe Senate, to in effect tell him or her who they are going to pick for \nthe circuit courts.\n  It is time for a fair hearing. And it is time to vote. If the members \nof the Judiciary Committee want to vote down these nominees, that is \ncertainly their prerogative. They have done that already once this \nyear. But it is time to quit hiding out. It is time to stand up and be \ncounted. It is time to allow these missing people to be seen and heard, \nand to vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4121-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4121]]\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have spoken to my counterpart, Senator \nNickles. He wishes to speak for 15 minutes. That would go past the time \nset aside for morning business.

Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nexpressing real disappointment in the fact that we have eight nominees \nto the U.S. circuit courts of appeals, who were nominated a year ago, \nwho have yet to have a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Nineteen of 30 circuit court nominees have yet to have a hearing--19 \nout of 30. I have stated to my colleagues--and I state this on the \nfloor of the Senate, just as sincerely as possible--we should treat all \njudicial nominees fairly.\n  Some people say: Well, we are having a little retribution because you \ndidn't treat people well in President Clinton's last year.\n  The tradition of the Senate has always been to give a President his \nor her nominees pretty good access to the Senate for confirmation \npurposes in the first 2 or 3 years of their Presidency. The tradition \nof the Senate, also, is to kind of slow it down in a President's last \nyear.\n  Certainly, if you look at what happened in the last three \nPresidencies, that is what has happened. Unfortunately, the current \nPresident Bush has not had fair treatment for his judicial nominees, \nespecially circuit court nominees, in his first 2 years. That is just a \nfact.\n  The chart I have shows that we have only confirmed 9 out of 30. That \nis 30 percent. There is another nominee who is pending on the calendar. \nHopefully, that will be cleared fairly quickly. That would be 10 out of \n30. That is one out of three nominated judges confirmed.\n  If you look at President Clinton's first 2 years, he got 19 out of \n22. If you look at President Bush I, he got 22 out of 23. President \nReagan got 19 out of 20. So President Reagan and President Bush I got \n95 percent of their circuit court nominees confirmed in their first 2 \nyears. President Clinton got 19 out of 22. That is 86 percent.\n\n  We should always be confirming those kinds of percentages unless they \nnominate people who are totally unqualified and are undeserving of the \nposition. But we are not doing that.\n  Also, if you look at the total numbers, President Reagan got 98 \npercent of all the judges that he nominated confirmed in his first 2 \nyears. President Bush I got 93 percent of the judges he nominated \nconfirmed in his first 2 years. And President Clinton had more judges \nconfirmed than either of the two by a considerable amount; he had 129 \njudges confirmed in his first 2 years, which is 90 percent.\n  For the current President Bush, we have now done 56 percent. We are \nmoving along, at least now, at 60-some odd percent for district court \njudges. But the big discrepancy is, we are way behind in circuit court \nappellate judges--way behind--and these individuals are not being \ntreated fairly. They are eminently qualified. And to think that eight \nwere nominated a year ago.\n  Somebody said: Why are you making such a fuss now? Because enough is \nenough. Eight of these outstanding, qualified individuals were \nnominated a year ago today, and they have not had a hearing. Why? Are \nthey not qualified? Well, let me just look at some of their \nqualifications.\n  John Roberts was nominated to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. He has \nargued 37 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. Evidently, the private \nsector thinks he is eminently qualified. He was unanimously rated \n``well qualified'' by the ABA. He is a Harvard Law School graduate, \nmagnum cum laude. He was managing editor of the Harvard Law Review. He \nwas a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Rehnquist. And he also was the \nPrincipal Deputy Solicitor General for the United States from 1989 to \n1993.\n  You will be hard-pressed to find anybody more qualified than John \nRoberts anywhere in the country to sit on any bench. Yet, he cannot get \na hearing, and he was nominated a year ago. I am embarrassed we have \nnot been able to schedule a hearing for John Roberts.\n  I hope, in the course of this dialog, Senator Leahy or Senator \nDaschle will join me. I would like to ask the question, why can't we \nget a hearing for him?\n  Miguel Estrada is also nominated to the DC Circuit, a partner of the \nDC firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. He has argued 15 cases before the \nU.S. Supreme Court. He was unanimously rated ``well qualified'' by the \nABA. He immigrated to the United States as a teenager from Honduras \nand, at the time, hardly even spoke English. Yet, he graduated from \nHarvard Law School magnum cum laude. He was an editor of their Harvard \nLaw Review. He was a law clerk to Justice Kennedy. And he is a former \nAssistant Solicitor General and Assistant U.S. Attorney. He has been a \nprosecutor. He worked as a law clerk for a Supreme Court Justice. He \nargued 15 cases before the Supreme Court. He is eminently qualified. He \nis Hispanic. And we can't get a hearing?\n  The District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals has four vacancies. \nA year ago, they were saying they really needed at least three judges. \nAnd we can't get a hearing for two of the most qualified people \nanywhere in the country for these two positions. This is unbelievable.\n  Priscilla Owen was nominated to the Fifth Circuit Court. She has \nserved on the Texas Supreme Court since 1994. She was unanimously rated \n``well qualified'' by the ABA. She is a Baylor Law School graduate, \nwith honors, and a member of the Baylor Law Review. She had the highest \nscore on her Texas bar exam, and 17 years of prior experience as a \ncommercial litigator.\n\n  Just another example. Why is she not entitled to have a hearing? I \nthink when these individuals have hearings, it is going to be obvious \nthey are well-qualified. There will be no reason whatsoever to attack \nthem or to vote no. So people do not want to have a hearing because \nthey know if they have a hearing, they are going to be confirmed.\n  Terrence Boyle was nominated to the Fourth Circuit. He is presently \nthe chief judge in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District for \nNorth Carolina, and has been since 1997. He was unanimously rated \n``well qualified'' by the ABA. He is a graduate from American \nUniversity, Washington College of Law. He also served as minority \ncounsel for the House Subcommittee on Housing, Banking, and Currency \nfrom 1970 to 1973, and legislative assistant to Senator Helms.\n  We usually treat former Senate staffers with a little courtesy. We \nusually give them a hearing. This is a person who has had a little \nexperience in the Senate working on the Judiciary Committee, in \naddition to serving as a district court judge from 1984 to 1997. We \ncan't even give him a hearing? I don't think that is right.\n  Michael McConnell is nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nHe is presently a Presidential professor of law at the University of \nUtah. He was unanimously rated ``well qualified'' by the ABA. He is a \nrenowned constitutional law expert. He has argued 11 cases before the \nU.S. Supreme Court. He graduated at the top of his class from the \nChicago Law School. He was a law clerk for Justice Brennan, and also \nserved as a prior Assistant Solicitor General. Michael McConnell was \nnominated a year ago and has yet to even have a hearing.\n  Deborah Cook is nominated to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. She \nis presently serving as a justice on the Supreme Court of Ohio, and has \nsince 1994. She was unanimously rated ``well qualified'' by the ABA. \nShe is an Akron School of Law graduate, and practiced with Akron's \noldest law firm. She sat on the Ohio District Court of Appeals from \n1991 to 1995. She also chaired the Commission on Public Legal \nEducation, and has also been a member of the Ohio Commission on Dispute \nResolution. She is more than qualified.\n  Jeffrey Sutton is also nominated to the Sixth Circuit Court.\n  On the Sixth Circuit, there are 8 vacancies out of the 16. One-half \nof the circuit court of appeals is vacant, desperately needing some \nassistance.\n  Mr. Sutton a partner in the law firm of Jones, Day. He is rated well \nqualified by the ABA minority and qualified\n\n[[Page S4122]]\n\nby the ABA majority. He graduated first in his class from Ohio \nUniversity College of Law. He is a former law clerk to Supreme Court \nJustices Powell and Scalia. He has argued 9 cases and over 50 merits \nand amicus briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court, and he is a prior \nState solicitor in the State of Ohio.\n  Dennis Shedd, nominated to the Fourth Circuit Court, is a U.S. \ndistrict court judge in South Carolina and has been since 1991. He is \nrated well qualified by the ABA and had 20 years of private practice \nand public service prior to becoming a district judge. His law degree \nis from the University of South Carolina, and he has a master of law \ndegree from Georgetown. He is a former chief counsel and staff director \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee and counsel to the President pro \ntempore from 1978 to 1988. He is supported by both of South Carolina's \nSenators. Again, he is a former staffer.\n  The Senator from Nevada knows, as I mentioned this before--we used to \nhave a tradition that we would give former staffers an expeditious \nhearing. But Dennis Shedd was nominated a year ago.\n  These are eight of the most qualified individuals you will find \nanywhere in the country for any such position. The fact that they have \nnot had a hearing when they were nominated a year ago brings real \ndisrespect and disrepute on this body. Shame on us. Shame on the \nSenate. We have only confirmed one-third of the district court of \nappeals judges nominated by President Bush. Eight people have to wait a \nyear for a hearing? We are making these nominees wait around while \ntheir friends and associates are asking: When will you be confirmed? I \nunderstand you were nominated. You were nominated a year ago. You \nhaven't even had a hearing.\n  How disrespectful of the judicial process can we be? I am ashamed of \nthis record. I will state for the record now that I believe at various \npoints we may well be back in the majority. I have been in the Senate--\nmajority, minority, majority, minority. I think we will be back in the \nmajority. I am committed to making sure that all judicial nominees are \ntreated fairly regardless of who is in the White House and regardless \nof who runs the Senate. I think we owe it to the nominees. I think we \nowe it to the process. We owe it to the division of power between the \nexecutive branch, the judicial branch, and the legislative branch.\n  The legislative branch is wrecking this balance of power by not \nstaffing and not allowing judicial nominations to be heard, to be voted \non, to be confirmed. We have checks and balances. I believe the \nforefathers would be rolling over if they realized how slowly we were \ngoing on certain judges, circuit court appellate judges especially.\n  With all sincerity, there are ways we can go in this body to get \npeople's attention to make sure these individuals get fair \nconsideration. My hope and desire is to give them fair consideration \nwithout exhibiting a pattern of ``we will hold this up and hold this \nup; you will not be able to mark this up; not be able to get a quorum; \nyou will not be able to do business.'' I hope we don't have to resort \nto that.\n  Senator Reid is one of my very dear friends, Senator Daschle, Senator \nLeahy. I urge them, give these people a chance. Give these eight people \nwho were nominated to the appellate level a year ago, give them a \nhearing, and let's vote. There is no question they are eminently \nqualified. We should be voting. That is our constitutional \nresponsibility. Let's do it. I will commit we will do it in the future \nas well.\n\n  I hope people will hear these comments made by myself and others and \nlisten to us. Let's work together and treat judicial nominees fairly so \nwe don't have to resort to various types of threats and intimidation \nand lack of cooperation to make our point to get these individuals \nconsideration on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4122-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I was waiting to hear from the two \nleaders. Senator Lott and Senator Daschle have spoken on a number of \noccasions. Senator Daschle is extremely anxious to get on with some \nsubstantive legislation in the Senate. The trade bill is pending. We \nvirtually have been waiting all day for some Senators to come up with a \nproposal.\n  I have been told by the Republican leader that that answer will come \nat 4:15 today. I hope that is the case. I would therefore ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, be recognized \nto speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes, and then the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, although I think Senator McCain may \nhave been here first.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't wish to speak as in morning business.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding the Senator from Arizona wishes to \nbe recognized for purposes of a unanimous consent request. I ask that \nhe be recognized for up to 5 minutes to make whatever statement he \nwishes in regard to that unanimous consent request and that, after that \ntime, morning business be concluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4122-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL PROCEDURES\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nworking this out for morning business. I have sought recognition to \ncomment about two matters.\n  First, I compliment my colleague from Oklahoma for the comments he \nhas made about the need to move ahead with nominees. It would be my \nhope that from the current disagreement we might work out a permanent \nprotocol to solve the problem which exists when the White House is \ncontrolled by one party and the Senate by another party. The delays in \ntaking up judges has been excessive.\n  This is the 1-year anniversary where some nine circuit judges, well \nqualified, have not even had hearings. But in all candor, a similar \nproblem existed when President Clinton, a Democrat, was in the White \nHouse and we Republicans controlled the Senate.\n  I have advocated a protocol. Within a certain number of days after a \nnomination, the hearing would be held; within a certain number of \nadditional days, there would be action by the Judiciary Committee on a \nvote; and within another specified time, there would be floor action, \nall of which could be expanded for cause. And an additional provision, \nnot indispensable, is that if there were a strict party-line vote in \ncommittee, the matter would automatically go to the floor.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield back the remainder of that time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I intend to propose a unanimous consent \nrequest that we take up the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication \nAct.\n  It is vital that we address this issue. ATPA expired on December 4 \nbecause Congress had not taken action on the legislation. The House of \nRepresentatives passed an extension on November 16, and the Senate has \nfailed to do its work on this issue.\n  These countries need our help. It is in the United States' national \ninterest not to see these countries degenerate into economic, political \nand, in the case of Colombia, armed chaos. We need to act on this \nissue. Why it has been tied to TPA and TAA is something I do not \nunderstand.\n  Perhaps the Trade Promotion Act and the Trade Adjustment Assistant \nAct are important. I think they are of the highest priority, but the \nAndean Trade Preferences Act--referred to as ATPA--is of time \ncriticality. It expired. There are tariffs that these countries will \nhave to pay.\n  These are poor countries. They have unemployment rates of 30, 40, 50 \npercent. Colombia is degenerating into\n\n[[Page S4123]]\n\nchaos. Peru is in a situation--if I might quote from the Christian \nScience Monitor:\n\n       Rebel groups' presence growing near Peru's capital. The \n     Shining Path wants to show that democracy is weak, it can't \n     handle problems with crime and corruption, and the \n     government's inability to improve the country's economy.\n\n  Andres Pastrana wrote in the Washington Post on April 15:\n\n       Finally, continued U.S. support for planned Colombia and \n     final Congressional passage of the Andean Trade \n     Preferences Act will strengthen Colombia's economic \n     security. The trade act will have a minuscule impact in \n     the United States but will create tens of thousands of \n     jobs in Colombia and across the Andean region. Enhanced \n     ATPA now being considered in Congress will foster new \n     business investment in Colombia.\n\n  These countries are in trouble. If these countries are not allowed to \nengage in economic development, are not given our assistance, with \nwhich we have provided them since 1991--this Trade Preference Act--then \nwe are going to pay a very heavy penalty. We have already had to \nallocate a billion dollars to Colombia to help them militarily. \nSituations now are arguably worse than 2 years ago when we first began \nthis matter. Every objective observer will tell you Colombia is in \nterrible shape. In Peru, people are losing confidence in democracy. In \nEcuador--I have read stories about Hezbollah and other terrorist \nentities locating in these countries.\n  We don't have the time to waste fooling around with aid to \nsteelworkers, or adjustments to health care, which are directly related \nto the Trade Promotion Act, not to the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug \nEradication Act. I hope we can have some debate and discussion about \nthat.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of H.R. 3529; further, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate immediately proceed to its consideration, all after the \nenacting clause be stricken, and the text of S. 2485, the Andean Trade \nPromotion and Drug Eradication Act, be inserted in lieu thereof. I \nfurther ask consent that the bill be read the third time and the Senate \nproceed to a vote on passage of the bill, with no other intervening \naction or debate.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nclarify the request that my colleague from Arizona made.\n  The request is we would move immediately to the Andean Trade \nPreference Act, which is a continuation of the current law going back \nto 1991 which would assist four countries--the Senator mentioned the \nfour countries: Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia, all of which \ndesperately need our help.\n  The Senator's intention is to continue to assist those countries so \nwe do not have punitive tariffs hit, I believe, by the 15th of this \nmonth, next week; is that correct?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Arizona. I \nhope we can do this and pass an Andean trade bill. I believe the vote \non it will be 90-plus votes in favor of it. If we are successful in \npassing this, then we can continue to wrestle with and hopefully pass \ntrade promotion authority and trade adjustment assistance. Correct me \nif I am wrong, this in no way would keep us from passing trade \npromotion and trade adjustment assistance in the future.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It would have no impact.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand the frustration of the Senator \nfrom Arizona. Magnify that 1,000 percent for the majority leader. We \nhave a bill on the floor----\n  Mr. LOTT. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. The underlying vehicle is the Andean trade bill. I think we \nshould move on to the trade bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution \nprovides that the President ``shall nominate, and by and with the \nAdvice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the \nsupreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States . . . .''\n  The debate before us today involves this clause of the Constitution, \nand this debate is a very important one. We should put aside \npartisanship and examine the very roots of our Republic to determine \nthe respective responsibilities of the three branches of our \ngovernment.\n  The magnificence of the ``Great Experiment,'' a term used by the \nskeptics of the work of our founding fathers, is what has enabled our \nRepublic to stand today, after over 200 years, as the longest surviving \ndemocratic form of government still in existence.\n  But, the survival of that ``Great Experiment'' is dependent upon the \ncontinuous fulfillment of the balanced, individual responsibilities of \nthe three branches of our government.\n  Let's reflect on the historical roots of the ``advice and consent'' \nclause.\n  During the Constitutional Convention, the Framers labored extensively \nover this clause, deferring a final decision on how to select federal \njudges for several months.\n  Some of the Framers argued that the President should have total \nauthority to choose the members of the Judiciary. Others thought that \nboth the House of Representatives and the Senate should be involved in \nproviding ``advice and consent.''\n  Ultimately, a compromise plan, put forth by James Madison, won the \nday--where the President would nominate judges and only the Senate \nwould render ``advice and consent.''\n  Such a process is entirely consistent with the system of checks and \nbalances that the Framers carefully placed throughout the Constitution. \nPresidents select those who should serve on the Judiciary, thereby \nproviding a philosophical composition in the judicial branch. However, \nthe Senate has a ``check'' on the President because it is the final \narbiter with respect to a nominee.\n  Throughout the debates of the Constitutional Convention, there \nappears to have been little debate on what factors the Senate should \nactually use when evaluating presidential nominees. It is likely that \nthis silence was intentional.\n  The first test case arose with our First President! Soon after the \nConstitution was ratified it became clear that the Senate did not take \nits ``advice and consent'' role as one of simply rubber-stamping \njudicial nominees. This became evident when the Senate rejected a \nnomination put forward by our first President and a founding father, \nPresident George Washington.\n  President Washington nominated John Rutledge to serve on the U.S. \nSupreme Court. And, even though Mr. Rutledge had previously served as a \ndelegate to the Constitutional Convention, the Senate rejected his \nnomination. It is interesting to note that many of those Senators who \nvoted against the Rutledge nomination were also delegates to the \nConstitutional Convention.\n  From the earliest days of our Republic, the nomination process has \nworked. We must now reconcile and make sure it continues to work.\n  Based on history, it is clear to me that the Senate's role in the \nconfirmation process is more than just a mere rubber-stamp of a \nPresident's nomination; but it is the Senate's Constitutional \nresponsibility to render ``advice and consent'' after a fair process of \nevaluating a President's nominee.\n  This process illustrates well how our three branches of government \nare interconnected yet independent.\n  Thomas Jefferson remarked on the independence of our three branches \nof government by stating, ``The leading principle of our Constitution \nis the independence of the Legislature, Executive, and Judiciary of \nEach other.''\n  But, I would add that each branch of government must perform its \nrespective responsibilities in a fair and timely manner to ensure that \nthe three branches remain independent.\n  In my view, we must ask ourselves, is the current Senate posture of \nthe nomination and ``advice and consent'' process during the early days \nof the Bush\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\nAdministration consistent with our country's experience over the last \n200 plus years since our Constitution was ratified? That is for each \nSenator to decide.\n  Currently, more than 10 percent of Federal judgeships are vacant. \nAnd, for the 12 Circuit Court of Appeals, nearly 20 percent of the \nseats are vacant. Is our federal Judiciary able to fulfill its \nobligations? That is for each Senator to decide.\n  In day to day court workloads, judicial vacancies result in each of \nthe active and senior status judges having a greater caseload. This, in \nturn, often results in a longer time period for cases to be decided.\n  The ultimate effect is that Americans who have turned to the court \nsystem seeking justice in both civil and criminal matters are left \nwaiting for a resolution of their case. And, all too often, justice \ndelayed is justice denied.\n  Our current Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Judge William \nRehnquist, has expressed his views on this subject several times during \nboth the Clinton and Bush Administrations. Judge Rehnquist recently \nreiterated remarks he made first in 1997 when he stated, ``the \nPresident should nominate candidates with reasonable promptness, and \nthe Senate should act within a reasonable time to confirm or reject \nthem. Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a \nSenate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote.''\n  I am in complete agreement with the Chief Judge. We must act in a \ntimely fashion to fill judicial vacancies.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, our friends on the other side of the \naisle are right about one thing: it is important to fill vacancies on \nthe Federal bench in a timely manner.\n  In his remarks last week, President Bush cited Chief Justice \nRehnquist's report about the alarming number of vacancies in the \nfederal courts.\n  He's right. Let me read some of Chief Justice Rehnquist's report: \n``vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without \neroding the quality of justice.''\n  Except that's from the report he wrote in 1997.\n  Democrats, independent-minded observers, and the Chief Justice of the \nUnited States Supreme Court have all raised concerns about the judicial \nvacancy crisis for years.\n  But our Republican colleagues never seemed to hear those concerns \nwhen they ran the Senate. The fact that they now recognize the \nseriousness of the situation is--I suppose--progress.\n  It appears, however, that there are some facts on which they are \nstill unclear. I'd like to take a few minutes to set the record \nstraight:\n  First, the judicial crisis developed when Republicans ran the Senate.\n  Under Republicans, total court vacancies rose by 75 percent--from 63 \nat the beginning of 1995 to 110 by the time Democrats took control of \nthe Senate.\n  Circuit court vacancies more than doubled--from 16 to 33.\n  As the vacancy rate was skyrocketing, more than half--56 percent--of \nPresident Clinton's circuit nominees in 1999 and 2000 never received a \nhearing or a vote.\n  Second, Democrats have reduced the number of vacancies.\n  The judicial nominations process has significantly improved under \nDemocratic leadership.\n  As of this afternoon, in only 10 months, the Democratically \ncontrolled Senate has confirmed 56 nominees--more judicial nominees \nthan the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed for President Reagan in \nhis first 12 months in office.\n  Our 10-month number is also greater than the number of judicial \nnominations confirmed in four of the 6 years Republicans controlled the \nSenate during the Clinton administration.\n  It also exceeds the average number of judicial nominees the \nRepublicans confirmed during the time they controlled the Senate--when, \nfrom 1995-2001, confirmations averaged only 38 per year.\n  But Democrats aren't just improving the numbers, we're improving the \nnomination process. Under Senator Leahy's stewardship, the process is \nnow faster, fairer--and more productive.\n  Senator Leahy has restored a steady pace to the judicial nominations \nprocess by holding regular hearings and giving nominees a vote in \ncommittee. Despite the chaos of September 11 and the disruption caused \nby anthrax, the Judiciary Committee has held 15 hearings involving 48 \njudicial nominations in the past 10 months, and is planning an \nadditional hearing this week to consider another 7 nominations.\n  In addition to increasing the total number of hearings, Senator Leahy \nis reducing the amount of time it takes to confirm a nomination. The \nJudiciary Committee has been able to confirm nominations, on average, \nwithin 86 days after a nominee was eligible for a hearing. This is more \nthan twice as fast as the confirmation process under the most recent \nRepublican-controlled Senate.\n  Senator Leahy has also made the process more fair.\n  Unlike our Republican colleagues, who would sit on nominations for \nyears--many never receiving a hearing, Senator Leahy has ensured that \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees are treated evenhandedly. Senator \nLeahy has also eliminated the practice of secret holds within the \njudiciary, that were often used to delay and defeat nominees for \npolitical reasons.\n  Third, the confirmation of judges is part of a constitutional \nobligation we take very seriously.\n  Democrats have been clear: We will make the process move more fairly, \nand more quickly--but we will not abdicate our constitutional \nresponsibility to advise and consent.\n  I believe the President has a right to appoint to his cabinet and \nadministration men and women with whom he is personally and \nideologically comfortable.\n  But Federal judges and Supreme Court justices do not serve at the \npleasure of the President. Their term does not end when the President \nleaves office. These are lifetime positions. Their decisions will have \nprofound consequences for years, possible decades, to come. For that \nreason, they deserve special scrutiny. The Constitution requires the \nSenate to evaluate the President's judicial nominees, nominees, offer \nadvice, and grant--or withhold--its consent.\n  Fourth, I'm concerned that the real issue isn't numbers, but using \nJudiciary to achieve a political agenda.\n  Appointing judges that are out of the mainstream is a way that the \nright-wing can achieve through the judiciary what they can't get \nthrough Congress, the President, or any other office represented by \nthose who reflect the will of the people, and need to stand for \nelection before them.\n  Most Americans simply don't want to see a judiciary that will turn \nback the clock on decades of progress for civil rights, women's rights, \nworkers rights, and the environment. Most of us don't either.\n  Senator Lott and Senator Nickles both hinted after Judge Pickering's \nnomination was defeated in committee that they would find ways to \nretaliate. The irony is: By shutting down the Senate today, they are \npreventing the Senate from doing the very thing they claim to want.\n  Right now, their tactics are preventing the Judiciary Committee from \nholding hearings on 4 of the President's nominees. And last August they \nwouldn't give us consent to carry pending nominees over the recess--\nfurther slowing the process. Amazingly, their judges are falling victim \nto their own tactics.\n  There are 77 days left in this Congress--only 46 days if you don't \ninclude Mondays and Fridays.\n  Shutting down the Senate at a time when there are so many major \nquestions facing our nation, and so few working days left in this \nCongress--is not the way to achieve their stated goal of confirming \njudges.\n  When all the facts are thoroughly examined and honest comparisons are \nmade, it is clear that the judicial nominations process has \nsignificantly improved under Senator Leahy's stewardship, and \nDemocratic leadership.\n  There are real differences between our parties on many issues.\n  We have shown time and time again, on issue after issue, that we can \nwork through those differences for the good of the nation.\n  Today, I ask our Republican friends to join with us in helping--and \nnot obstructing--the Senate as we work to meet the needs of the \nAmerican people, and perform our constitutional obligation regarding \nfederal judges.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4125-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4125]]\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, our goal this afternoon is to get to a \nprocess or an agreement that allows the Senate to deal with the very \nimportant issues pending before the Senate: trade promotion authority, \nthe Andean Trade Preservation Act, the GSP, as well as the trade \nadjustment assistance. These are four very big issues, very important \nfor our country and other countries--in the case of the Andean area--\nand for the workers of this country.\n  The way it has been put together, it is very difficult to work \nthrough all of these issues and get a result. Serious efforts are \nunderway to see if we can achieve an agreement that produces a result.\n  We also have to deal with a process issue, how to make that happen. A \nfew moments ago, I filed a first-degree amendment to the Andean Trade \nPreference Act and filed cloture. I think that is the way to proceed. I \nthink we need a showing of who wants to get trade promotion authority \nand how we will move this to a conclusion. I want to do that and I know \nSenator Daschle wants to do that, too--find a way to get to conclusion \nand produce a result.\n  I was within my rights to seek that recognition and offer that \namendment. I did so in good faith with the recognition that if I \ndidn't, some further motion or procedure might have been offered by \nSenator Daschle or Senator Reid.\n  Having said that, Senator Reid and Senator Nickles and others were in \nthe Chamber. They had an agreement on how to proceed, and they felt \nthis was not fair under the understanding that had been worked out. I \nalways try to make sure we play above board and fair with everybody. \nSenator Reid has always been fair with both sides, and he felt this was \nnot the right way to proceed at this point.\n  After a lot of discussion, I will move to vitiate that action. But I \ndo want to emphasize--and then I presume Senator Daschle may announce \nwe would have a period of further discussion as we continue to work on \nthis issue--I do think this is the correct way to proceed. We should \nnot get off the trade legislation and go to any other issue. We are on \nthe verge of beginning to make progress. If we let up, I think the \nmomentum will stop.\n  I had to explain what happened and why I am doing this. I have heard \nstories from the past of how Senators have come to the aid of Senators \non the other side of the aisle saying, no, this was not the fair way to \ndo it, even if it might have appeared to be fair. We want to always try \nto do that with each other.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3399 Withdrawn\n\n  Therefore, I ask to vitiate the cloture motion I filed and withdraw \nthe amendment I filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3399) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Next week at this time, the Andean Trade Preference Act expires \nand back tariffs will be levied on four impoverished countries, one \nwhich is experiencing a revolution. The majority leader does understand \nthe reason for the cloture motion, but I understand there will be an \nobjection if we wanted to move to ATPA, and that is why the Republican \nleader filed the cloture motion.\n  I hope the majority leader understands this is an issue that is \npressing in time.

I have attempted in many \ndifferent ways over the last several weeks to\n\n[[Page S4126]]\n\nfind the right formula to bring this about. I have talked about it, \nliterally, for months. I will work with the Senator from Arizona and \nothers. We are very aware of the May 16 deadline. I am very hopeful we \ncan find a way with which to accommodate that deadline and make sure \nthis job can be done.\n  We are sensitive to the tremendous economic repercussions that will \nresult if we are not successful. The stakes get higher with each \npassing hour, which is why I have been frustrated in my effort to move \nthe process along all week.\n  We spent a lot of time on the farm bill. We spent a lot of time \nwaiting for some sort of negotiation when I think sometimes the best \nthing to do is just offer amendments. That is what we do in the Senate \nif there is a disagreement: At some point you offer an amendment, have \na vote, and move on to the next amendment.\n  There are those in the Senate who want the package to be just so, \nprior to the time they even allow us to move forward on a package.\n  We will continue to work with those who have been in negotiation. I \nhope we can resolve this matter soon.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. We did vitiate the cloture, withdraw the first-degree \namendment, but I ask that we consider filing cloture on the underlying \namendment, just ATPA.\n  My cloture and amendment had been both trade promotion and Andean \ntrade. If we file cloture on just the Andean Trade Preservation Act, \nthat would ripen Monday night or Tuesday if we got an agreement, and it \nwould at least guarantee we would be able to get that issue resolved \nand hopefully sent to the President by Tuesday or Wednesday, thus \ndealing with this problem that Senator McCain addresses. If we don't, \nwe are going to have this deadline that we are facing.\n  I say this in a bipartisan, nonpartisan spirit. It would be one way \nto make sure we get a vote on that. We could still get an agreement and \nvitiate if we had to and get the trade promotion authority and trade \nassistance also.\n  I might say that I understand we need to try to make progress. But we \nhave only spent about 12 hours on this bill and really only one serious \namendment has been offered.\n  I know you, Senator Daschle, would have liked to have had more \namendments offered. Certainly we assume that will occur, perhaps even \nstill. But we have not spent much time on the trade bill itself. I \nwould address the question--urge you to consider, even today, within \nthe next hour, filing cloture on the underlying ATPA. We could still \nget progress on these other bills without prejudicing this particular \nprovision.\n  That is the kind of thing I think Senator McCain would like to see us \ndo. He is pressing me to file cloture on the underlying Andean Trade \nPreference Expansion Act. Would you consider that as we proceed this \nafternoon?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we are trying to make the most of what \nfew days we have before the Memorial Day recess. That is an option. We \nhave entertained it in the past. We have talked about it in the past. \nThat would mean, of course, that TAA and TPA would fall if cloture is \ninvoked, and I am not sure we would be able to get to it again prior to \nthe Memorial Day recess, given all the other things we have to do. But \nthat is an option. So we will weigh that carefully and consider what \nother choices we have, subject to some report from our colleagues. We \nwill continue to negotiate.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If my colleague will yield, I think Senator Lott and \nSenator McCain have a good idea. I urge you to seriously consider that. \nI hope it will not take cloture to pass any of the three bills. I \nlikewise tell the majority leader, I think you will find Members on \nthis side of the aisle--I think the majority leader has complicated his \nprocess by trying to put three bills together.\n  Historically, we have passed Andean trade, passed trade promotion or \nfast track, and we passed trade adjustment assistance--independently \nand overwhelmingly, usually with 70-some votes. I believe there are \nstill 70-some votes. The Senate historically has pretty much favored \nfree trade.\n  I think we would be happy to assist the majority leader to pass all \nthree. We may have some differences, particularly on trade adjustment \nassistance. Maybe we will have to have a few amendments on each side. \nWe will help you get a time agreement where we can pass all three bills \nby the Memorial Day recess. Maybe by separating the three bills we can \naccommodate the Andean countries that are in desperate shape. It would \nbe a shame if we imposed tariffs on those poor countries, a tariff \nincrease that they have not had for 10 years, if we do not get our work \ndone on that bill by next week, by the 15th or 16th.\n  Likewise, it would be a real mistake if this Senate doesn't pass \ntrade promotion and trade adjustment assistance, however this Senate \ndefines it.\n  I tell the majority leader, I think if he breaks the three up, we \ncould come up with time agreements and a limitation of amendments to \nfinish all three bills.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his generous offer \nof assistance. I would love nothing more than to get time agreements.\n  I am told there is opposition to time agreements on both sides on \neach bill. As we know, given the time it takes to get through a motion \nto proceed if there is a filibuster, given the time it takes to get \nthrough a bill itself, procedurally, if there is a filibuster--each \nbill will take over a week if you did nothing more than move as \nexpeditiously as you can given our Senate rules.\n  Instead of doing three sequential filibuster-cloture, filibuster-\ncloture, filibuster-cloture motions, we thought it might be better to \ndo one and accommodate all the procedural impediments at once.\n  That may or may not prove to have been the right strategy. But, \nclearly, we know it will take a long time. If it is the case, we will \nhave to take these bills up sequentially, as I am told is the case \nright now. Maybe time will prove Senators will reconsider and be \nwilling to move into a time agreement, at least on ATPA.\n  We will try to vet that and perhaps we can move that. I think we \nought to explore that possibility. But a sequential effort on each one \nof these will take us well into the middle of June, and I am not sure \nwe have that kind of time.\n  I appreciate the Senator's interest in working with us.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield a little further, I will be \nhappy to shop it on our side. I do happen to think there are \noverwhelming majorities--probably on both sides of the aisle. We passed \nTPA out of the Finance Committee 18 to 3. Andean trade passed \nunanimously, I believe, in the Finance Committee. Trade adjustment \nassistance was considered and, frankly, the trade adjustment assistance \nthat is in this bill never passed committee and some of us object to \nthat. We are willing to have amendments to it. We are willing to find \nout where the votes are, if that is the way we have to go. Hopefully, \nsome of the negotiations that are taking place today can help solve \nsome of those problems. But we all know we need to move forward on all \nthree pieces of legislation. I urge our colleagues, let's do it.\n  I do question the wisdom of putting all three together. \nHistorically--I remember Senator Byrd and I having a big debate on \nline-item veto and I used to say we should have a bill veto. Is it fair \nto the President of the United States to submit all three bills, each \ndifferent, and say take it all or leave it all? He loses his Executive \npower or ability to sign or veto individual pieces of legislation.\n  I hope we will consider trying to expedite this, come up with time \nagreements, pass all three bills, and let's see if we can get all three \ndone by the Memorial Day break.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma will be \nprepared to work with us on his side, we will see what prospects there \nare for doing something like that on one or more of the bills in the \nSenate in the next day.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think it sounds good to have some \ncooperation with respect to time. But there is frustration on all sides \nwith respect to this legislation. The issue of trade promotion \nauthority, for example, came to\n\n[[Page S4127]]\n\nthe floor. Then we had to go off, I believe for 12 hours, debating the \nAgriculture conference report, which took the better part of 2 full \ndays.\n  We have now, I believe, voted on only one amendment on trade \npromotion authority. That was the amendment I offered. And that was \nheld over. We couldn't clear it after we had a tabling amendment. That \nwas held over several days in order to clear that.\n  Senator Dayton has an amendment. I have two additional amendments. I \nknow other colleagues have amendments to trade promotion authority, but \nwe have not been able to get at that, and my understanding was we had \npeople on the floor on the other side saying they were not going to let \nus do anything until all of this gets negotiated to some successful \nconclusion.\n  I think the way to legislate, I say to the majority leader, would be \nto allow us to proceed with the amendments. If there are those on the \nfloor who are blocking it, perhaps the Senator from Oklahoma and the \nSenator from Mississippi, if it is on your side, might help us remove \nthat block and let us get to the amendments and have votes on the \namendments.\n  Trade promotion authority is a reasonably controversial measure. \nPeople will have a fair number of amendments, but we have had one so \nfar. It seems to me we ought to get at them and have votes on them.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will respond to that. I think that is what we should do. \nThat is what I just did; I offered an amendment. But because of concern \nabout the fact we were in morning business, I withdrew it.\n  I think that is the way to go. Hopefully, maybe we will come to an \nagreement this afternoon that will allow us to move forward on all \nthree bills. If we do not, then what I urge we do is stay on the trade \nbill, have amendments, and go forward.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Senator Byrd informed me, while he intended to speak as \nin morning business today, he is going to postpone his speech on \nMother's Day until tomorrow. So the floor is open, I notify all \nSenators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. While the leaders are still on the floor, especially the \nRepublican leader, I want everyone to know that what he did was \nentirely within his rights. What he did not know when he came on the \nfloor is my counterpart, Senator Nickles, and I had an agreement. The \nmajority leader had asked I keep us in a quorum call. That is what I \nintended to do.\n  What Senator Lott did was in keeping with the rules of the Senate. \nWhat he did following, to vitiate his request, is not in the rules of \nthe Senate. He did that because of the goodness of his heart, and I \nappreciate that very much. We have to work here, recognizing that no \nmatter in what situation you may find yourself, it may not be one of \ntotal understanding at the time you do it. I appreciate very much \nSenator Lott withdrawing the cloture motion. I also appreciate his \nwithdrawing the amendment. He did not have to do that. No one could \nhave forced him to do that. We could have gotten into a procedural \nsituation where we would move to table his amendment and things of that \nnature, but that would not have gotten us to the goal we wanted.\n\n  I also express my appreciation to my friend from Oklahoma who \nexpressed to the Republican leader what the arrangement was he and I \nhad.\n  Of course, I appreciate very much the majority leader working his way \nthrough this. I think it will be better for us all that we approach it \nin this manner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4127-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4127-S4132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank Senator Byrd. He came over to me \na few minutes ago. He was in line to take the next slot, and I \nappreciate his willingness to give me the opportunity to speak.\n  I am here on the anniversary of the President's first nominations to \nthe circuit court to, once again, focus the Senate on what really is a \ngreat obstruction of justice that is occurring as a result of the \nactions within the Judiciary Committee.\n  We have seen the first 11 nominees the President put up for the \ncircuit court--which is the appellate court in this country at the \nFederal level, and then you have the Supreme Court, obviously. We have \n11 nominees the President put forward. Three were moved. But they were \nthree holdovers from the prior administration. The first original, if \nyou will, Bush nominees have not even had a hearing. If they were eight \npeople who had very little to account for, if they were people who were \nnot considered well qualified, if they were people who had clouds \nhanging over their nominations, that would be one thing. But not one of \nthem has received anything but well qualified, and the vast majority \nwere well qualified by Senator Leahy's and the Judiciary Committee's \nstandard, which is the American Bar Association, which is not \nnecessarily friendly to Republican nominees for the court.\n  We have a situation where we have preeminent jurists and litigators \nwho are being held in committee for a year without a hearing, and \nwithout explanation. That is sort of the remarkable thing throughout \nthis entire discussion. There is no explanation as to why any one of \nthese nominees is being held up.\n  We haven't had any discussion, to my knowledge, on the floor or in \nthe press as to the specific reason any one of these nominees has been \nheld back. There is no cloud that I am aware of. It is simply stopping \nthe President's judicial nominees, and stopping qualified jurists from \nserving.\n  These are people who have been nominated, and when you are nominated \nfor a position such as this--the Presiding Officer knows; he was \nGovernor--in State office or Federal office, they have to begin to sort \nof unwind their affairs. They have to begin the process of setting \nthemselves up, because who knows how quickly they could be considered \nand moved through the Senate?\n  In the case of Nebraska, I guess there is one house in which they go \nthrough in the process.\n  We have eight people of impeccable integrity who began that process a \nyear ago. Where are they? They are hanging out there. Their lives are \nin limbo. That is not fair to them. It is not fair to the people who \nare not getting justice and not having their cases heard on appeal, or \nare having long delays in getting the resolution of their cases.\n  That is not fair either. That impacts the administration of justice, \nparticularly on the civil side, which tends to suffer. We are getting \ncriminal cases through because they are a high priority. But you have \npeople whose lives are almost in limbo because they are not getting the \nquickest administration of justice that they deserve in our court \nsystem.\n  I want to talk about one particular nominee. He is from Pennsylvania. \nI will give you sort of the rundown of where we are in Pennsylvania.\n  We had 11 openings on the district court level in Pennsylvania. We \nhave two circuit nominees who are Third Circuit nominees--who are sort \nof Pennsylvanian, assigned to Pennsylvania in this informal agreement \nwe have across the country. One of the nominees for the circuit court--\nthe only nominee so far, because the other circuit vacancy just \noccurred a few weeks ago--is Judge D. Brookes Smith. Judge Smith is the \npresent judge of the Western District in Pennsylvania. He is a very \ndistinguished jurist. He has been on the court for over 10 years and \nhas served on the Common Pleas Court in Blair County and Altoona. But \nhe is from Altoona. He is from just an impeccable law firm and \npracticed before he was judge. He has great reputation as a common \npleas court judge in Pennsylvania, and now as a district court judge.\n\n  Again, he has a flawless reputation. He is a man of highest \nintegrity. He is rated well qualified unanimously by the ABA. \nThankfully, we had a hearing on Judge Smith. But that hearing was \nroughly 3 months ago. Judge Smith continues to be held in committee. \nAgain, if you look at what I said before about your life being held in \nlimbo,\n\n[[Page S4128]]\n\nhere is someone who has already had a hearing and is being held for \nmonths without being moved through the process.\n  Are there serious allegations about any actions Judge Smith has taken \nwhile he has been a member of the Western District of Pennsylvania? Are \nthere any decisions out there that have been seriously attacked? The \nanswer is no. There is no ``gotcha'' case, or line of cases, or \nopinions Judge Smith has offered that has caused any problems.\n  The only issue I am aware of with respect to Judge Smith is that he \nbelonged to a rod and gun club in Pennsylvania. We are very proud of \nour sportsmen activities in Pennsylvania. We are a great hunting and \nfishing State. He belonged to the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun Club.\n  Some of you who can think 20-odd years ago and of Spruce Creek, you \nthink of Jimmy Carter. That is where Jimmy Carter used to go. You may \nremember the incident about the rabbit on the boat. That was in Spruce \nCreek.\n  Judge Smith was an avid fisherman and someone who belonged to this \nclub for years, and belonged to it when he was confirmed as a judge in \nthe first Bush administration.\n  Comments were made that this club did not allow women members. They \nallow women to go to the club and participate in activities, but they \ndon't allow them to be voting members of the club. When asked about \nthat, Judge Smith said he would try to change that policy.\n  There is a woman who is a county commissioner who served with him \nwhen he was a common pleas judge in Blair County who is a member of \nNOW, a Democrat, who came out and said she knew of nobody who had done \nmore to help women and to promote women in the legal profession than \nJudge Smith--he has an impeccable record on women's issues--and the \npromotion of women within the legal system and the court system.\n  We had five litigators come to Washington, DC, most of whom were \nDemocrats, and all of them practiced in front of Judge Smith. They went \nthrough story after story about how he, unlike, unfortunately, some \nother members of the bench, treated women with particular dignity and \nrespect and was very accommodating to some of their concerns. One of \nthem happened to be pregnant during the trial. He was very \naccommodating to her particular needs.\n  So he has a great record.\n  What is NOW saying? They opposed Judge Smith because he belonged to a \ngun club that didn't permit women members. It permitted women on the \npremises. It permitted women to participate in their activities. But it \ndid not permit them to be members.\n  Judge Smith during his initial confirmation said he would go back and \ntry to change that. He did. Every time there was a meeting and the \nbylaws were reviewed, Judge Smith attempted to change it. He tried I \nthink four or five times. When he felt that he could no longer stay in \nthe club because he didn't see any hope that in fact they would change \nthat policy, he left.\n  I will make the argument against NOW's position--that he stayed there \nafter he had been made aware of that and he should have left right \naway. Had he left right away, there would have been no chance that the \nclub would have changed. Judge Smith did stay in there to fight to \nchange it.\n  If you wanted to argue anything, you could argue that Judge Smith \nshould be faulted for not still being in the club trying to change it. \nBy walking away from the club, you could make the argument that he \nwalked away from a fight he shouldn't have walked away from. That is \nnot their argument. The argument is he shouldn't have fought in the \nfirst place, he should have just gotten up and left.\n  That is not how we change things in America. We change things by \nstanding up for principles and fighting for them. And Judge Smith \nfought for women membership. And now, because he did, he is not \nqualified to be a Federal appeals court judge?\n  He has been a judge for over 15 years. They have looked at all his \ncases. There are no complaints about any of the cases. The reason they \noppose him is because he stayed in a gun club too long, fighting for \nallowing women to become members. That is the great sin. That is the \nreason why. Although we will have no admission of this, so far, \npublicly, I am told the reason Judge Smith is still in committee is \nbecause of that--a man who has incredible credentials, a man who has \nbeen a fighter for women in the legal profession, a man who has fought \nin the ``Old Boys Club'' to admit women as members.\n  We are saying now that he should not be elevated to the third circuit \nbecause he fought for women. How remarkable a place this can be \nsometimes. How remarkable a place this can be. I would suspect that \nmaybe had he quit, they would have come back and argued: See, he quit. \nHe should have stayed and fought. And they would oppose him for that \nreason.\n  This is wrong. This is a man of incredible integrity, terrific \ncredentials, great judicial temperament, who is scholarly, gentlemanly, \nand he is being subjected to being called anti-women. Even though he \nhas staked out, in his judgeship in the Common Pleas in Blair County, \nin his judgeship in the Western District, and now as one of the \nPresident's nominees, that one of his highest priorities has always \nbeen the promotion of women in the court, he has been targeted as anti-\nwomen.\n  This is wrong. This is wrong. This is what is going on here. These \nare the attacks that are leveled at people who want to serve.\n  His nomination is being held in committee, and has been for months. \nIt is wrong. This is a man who has worked diligently for women. We had \nlawyer after lawyer after lawyer from the Western District come here, \nthe Women's Bar Association, supporting Judge Smith. We have not heard \nanybody from the Western District, who has appeared before Judge Smith, \nwho is a woman saying anything negative. It is just the opposite. I \nreceived letter after letter in support of Judge Smith.\n  So you say: Well, that seems unfair. Yes, it is. If you were Judge \nSmith, imagine how you would be dealing with this. This is a human \nbeing. I know we all put these charts up in the Chamber, and we show \nthe numbers--such and such percent get through, and such and such do \nnot--but we are talking about a human being who has dedicated his life \nto serve, with a particular emphasis on the inclusion of women in the \nlegal profession.\n  I have to tell you, I come from western Pennsylvania. At times, I \nhave to say that our area of the country has not always been the most \nprogressive when it comes to promoting women to the bench. He has \nbucked a lot of the ``Old Boy'' network in doing what he's done for \nwomen. And this is what he gets rewarded with, these kinds of \noutrageous charges which are not based on fact. It is based on the fact \nthat Judge Smith happens to be moderate to conservative.\n  You see, if you are anywhere right of center here, and if you are \nlooking at the third circuit or you are looking at the sixth circuit or \nyou are looking at any other circuit, you need not apply because we \nwill find some reason--some outrageous, silly reason--that has nothing \nto do with the incredible track record that you put together through \nyour career; we will find some bogus reason to hold you up and tar \nyou--the politics of personal destruction on decent people who are \nworking hard to make this country better, all for this agenda that no \none will talk about. No excuse will be given.\n\n  This is one example. I am sure you heard earlier today about others. \nWe have eight people nominated for the circuits that have been sitting \nout here for a year and, unlike Judge Smith, have not even been given a \nhearing, have not even been given the decency of presenting their \ncredentials to the committee and saying: Evaluate me based on me, my \nmerits, my record, my temperament, and my ability. The committee has \nsaid: No, we are not going to give you the opportunity. The President \nhas selected you, we understand. But we don't even believe you deserve \nthe opportunity to convince us.\n  Why? That is the question I keep asking. Why? Don't we have to ask \nourselves why the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the committee \nhave decided not to even give these people the opportunity to present \nthemselves to the committee? What are they afraid of?\n  Let's be very honest about this. If these eight people are that bad, \nif they are that ``out there,'' if they are that dangerous, if they are \nthat destructive\n\n[[Page S4129]]\n\nto the judicial system, then it would be in your favor to bring them up \nhere and show how bad they are, how subversive they would be to the \nlaws of the country, how dangerous they would be to the litigants who \nwould come to their court--but nothing.\n  What are you afraid of? Are you afraid if you put Miguel Estrada up \nthere, and you listen to this articulate, brilliant, competent, well-\ntempered man, that this charade that you have been putting on will come \ncollapsing down upon you? Is that what you are afraid of? That is a \nlegitimate fear.\n  But what you are doing to these people, what you are doing to the \nlitigants in this country, what you are doing to the President is \nwrong, it is unfair, it is unjust. If you have a case against them, \npresent the case. Bring them before the committee. Present the case. If \nyou don't have a case against them, then treat them justly.\n  These are outstanding men and women who deserve their day in court, \nwho deserve the opportunity to present themselves to the committee and \nthe Senate. They have earned it because they have earned the trust of \nthe President of the United States, who has nominated them for these \npositions.\n  What are you afraid of? Or is it something even more sinister than \nthat? I hope not.\n  It has been a year. It has been a year in the lives of these people \nthat I am sure they will never forget. It has not been a year that has \nreflected particularly well on the Judiciary Committee or this Senate.\n  We have an opportunity, on this anniversary, to begin to start anew. \nWe saw, just a few minutes ago, the two leaders have a little bump in \nthe road. When we have bumps in the road here in the Senate--we often \ndo--we always sort of step back and say: OK, for the good of the \nSenate, for the long-term health of the Senate, can't we put some of \nthese partisan one-upmanships aside and do what is right for the \nSenate? Because this place will be here, God willing, much longer than \nwe will be. What we do here does set precedent. And the precedent the \nSenate Judiciary Committee is setting right now is dangerous to this \ncountry, because now there will always be this precedent that we will \nbe able to look back to and say: See, they did it. The precedent has \nbeen set. When you set a precedent, particularly a precedent that is \ndamaging to the rights of Presidential nominees to be considered, you \nlower that bar, you harm the entire judicial system in the future.\n  We have a chance yet, before the end of this session, to fix this.\n  We have a chance to get a proper, a sufficient number of circuit \ncourt nominees approved by the Senate that comports with the historical \nprecedent. It is still possible to do that. It is also possible that we \nwon't do that. That will set a precedent here, a precedent that, \nunfortunately, once set will be revisited by somebody somewhere down \nthe road. I don't know which party it will be. It may be our party; it \nmay be your party. The point is, it is not good for this institution, \nand it is horrible for the country.\n  I understand the partisan advantage. I understand you don't like the \nphilosophy of some of these people the President nominated. I have \nvoted for judges whose philosophy I hated. But the President won the \nelection. He has the right to nominate good, decent people with whom \nyou disagree on philosophy. He has that right. If they were good, \ndecent people who were qualified and had the proper temperament, I \napproved them, whether I agreed with their philosophy or not.\n  That is the role of the Senate. What is going on here may \nfundamentally change the role of the Senate for the worse. You can't \nthink about the next election or the partisan advantage or even the set \nof issues we are dealing with today in America. Those sets of issues 40 \nyears from now will be different. The precedent you set now will have a \nhuge impact on those issues. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't open up a \nhole in the precedents of the Senate that somewhere down the road will \ndrive a truck over something you may care very deeply about. It is not \nthe right thing to do.\n  You still have a chance to change it. I pray that you do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I compliment the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor the remarks he has just made, especially in relationship to a judge \nthat means a lot to him, Brooks Smith, who has been nominated by the \nPresident to serve on one of our Nation's highest courts. There is no \nreason, as Senator Santorum has said, for this fine individual to be \nheld up. It may be that for purely partisan reasons, someone will try \nto find a pretext such as the business about the club. I have heard \nthat, too. But I can't believe at the end of the day anybody would \nactually use that, at least publicly, as a reason to oppose the \nnomination. There is nothing to it.\n  When people get so caught up in the politics of it, as the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania has said, they begin to do things that in cool, \ncollected thought maybe they would not ordinarily do. They get carried \naway and even refuse to consider a judge based upon a pretext such as \nthis. When that kind of precedent is set, it does begin to not only \ndemean this institution but degrade the court system and fundamentally \nalter the relationship between the Senate and the President and our \nresponsibility of advise and consent to the nominees.\n  The Senator has made a very good general point; unfortunately, a \npoint well taken with respect to a nominee pending before the \ncommittee, Judge Smith.\n  I want to make the clarifying point that it is not just the Judiciary \nCommittee involved here. The Republican members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, of which I am one, would very much like to move forward on \nJudge Smith and other nominees.\n  We were called by the President today to join him at the White House \nbecause today is an anniversary of sorts. There are three anniversaries \ntoday that mean something to me personally. It is my father's birthday; \nhe is 83 years old today. It is the Attorney General's birthday, John \nAshcroft, who is 60 years old today. And, unfortunately, the other \nreason it has meaning is, as the President reminded us, it has been \nexactly 1 year since he nominated some very fine individuals to serve \non the circuit courts of appeals--1 year and not a single hearing on \neight of these nominees, all very fine individuals.\n\n  There has been no hearing scheduled, no hearing held, let alone \nmoving the process forward so that they could be confirmed.\n  I don't know of any reason any of these judges or lawyers nominated \nto the circuit courts should be held up. As a matter of fact, they have \nall been rated by the American Bar Association as ``qualified'' or \n``well qualified'' to serve on the circuit court. That was, according \nto our Democratic colleagues, the so-called gold standard by which \nthese candidates would be judged. So if it is to apply in these cases, \nthen all of these individuals should be confirmed, and at a minimum, of \ncourse, the committee should begin to hold hearings on them.\n  Why aren't the hearings being held? It could be one of two different \nreasons. The first has to do with an attempt to change the standard by \nwhich we historically have judged judicial nominees.\n  This morning, the Senator from New York, who chairs a subcommittee of \nthe Judiciary Committee, held a hearing in which he was very clear \nabout his belief that ideology should play a role in the Senate's \nconfirmation of the President's nominees. He expressed a view that \nnominees of President Clinton were all mainstream or mostly mainstream; \nwhereas President Bush keeps on nominating ideological conservatives, \npeople who, in his view, are out of the mainstream.\n  The Senator from New York is certainly entitled to his views. He \nnoted, and I agreed, that he and I probably would disagree \nphilosophically on a lot of things. He probably would call himself a \nliberal Democrat. I would proudly call myself a conservative \nRepublican. We respect each other's rights to believe in what we \nbelieve and to pursue those positions. But I don't think either one of \nus should therefore suggest that we are the best ones to judge what a \nbalance on the court would be. We probably would both want to shade it \na little bit toward our particular point of view.\n  The Senator from New York says he believes it is our job as the \nSenate to\n\n[[Page S4130]]\n\nrestore balance to the courts. I pointed out that, of course, balance \nis all in the eye of the beholder; that probably the President of the \nUnited States, elected by all of the people of the country, was a \nbetter judge of the mood of the country, especially a President who, by \nthe way, has an approval rating of well over 70 percent.\n  When he ran for President, it was clear that if he won, he would be \nthe person nominating the judges. As a matter of fact, Vice President \nGore made a point during his campaign to warn voters that if they \nelected President Bush, then-Governor Bush, he would be making the \nnominees to the court. He was right about that. When President Bush was \ndeclared the winner, he had every right to make these nominations.\n  If the people are not well qualified, then the Senate should vote \nthem down. On occasion that has happened, but it is quite rare. As the \nSenator from Pennsylvania pointed out, the test has been, for most of \nus over the years, even if you don't like the person ideologically, if \nthat is the President's choice and the individual is otherwise well \nqualified, then you really ought to vote to confirm.\n  All of us have done that. I have swallowed hard and voted for people \nI didn't particularly care for and whose ideology I very definitely \ndidn't care for. I voted for them nonetheless because I couldn't find \nanything wrong with them. They graduated high from their law schools. \nThey had done a good job in a law practice or on some other bench. Even \nthough I figured they would probably be quite ideologically liberal--\nand by the way, some have turned out to be ideologically liberal--I \nfelt it was my obligation, since that was the President's choice, and \nthere was no question about qualification, that we should approve them. \nThat I did.\n  That has been the tradition in this body for a very long time. I \ndon't think it is appropriate for us to try to define what a proper \nbalance of ideology is and to turn down the President's nominee because \nof that.\n  I especially think it is wrong not to give them a hearing and find \nout. These eight nominees to the circuit court the President made \nexactly a year ago have never had an opportunity to come before the \ncommittee and answer any questions about their ideology.\n  There is a presumption that has not necessarily been backed up by \nreality or by facts.\n  I would think that, as the Senator from Pennsylvania said, if there \nis no reason to be afraid of these judges, then we ought to have a \nhearing. And if there is, I would think people would want to bring \nthose reasons out to demonstrate why they are not qualified to sit on \nthe bench. But, in fact, there has been no suggestion that there is a \nreason why any of these eight candidates are not qualified.\n  In fact, I don't think even most of them could be fairly \ncharacterized as somehow ideologically way out of the American \nmainstream. The other thing that might be offered as an excuse not to \nhold hearings is--and I have heard this often from my Democratic \ncolleagues--they believe that some of the Clinton nominees for courts \nwere not treated fairly because they were not given hearings. It is \ntrue there were a few that, for one reason or another, did not get a \nhearing. Of course, in the case of those nominated at the end of the \nlast year of the Presidency, there is good reason for that because \nthere is no time to do it. But there were still probably some who could \nhave had a hearing and did not.\n  A hearing was held this morning by the Senator from New York in which \nfour of those individuals were called to testify. And each one of them \nmade the point that they were disappointed--actually, one had gotten a \nhearing but had not been confirmed. They all made the point they were \ndisappointed and they didn't think it was fair. Two of them, \nparticularly, I thought, made a very good point that when you get right \ndown to it, it is very unfair for a nominee not to have a hearing. They \nbelieve that all nominees should have a hearing. That, of course, \napplies today as much as it applied to them. If it was wrong for them \nto be denied a hearing, it is just as wrong for President Bush's \nnominees to be denied a hearing.\n  The second reason that sometimes is offered up to me why President \nBush's nominees are not being given a hearing or moved forward through \nthe process for confirmation, it seems to me, is based upon a false \npremise; that is, in effect, saying two wrongs make a right. It is \nwrong not to give somebody a hearing. Some of President Clinton's \nnominees were not given a hearing, so we are not going to give \nPresident Bush's nominees a hearing. If it is wrong, it is wrong. If it \nis wrong, it should stop.\n  I heard one colleague say, but we need to go back and fix the wrong. \nTo my knowledge, there is only one President who has gone back and \nnominated people his predecessor of another party had nominated who \nwere not confirmed. President Bush has actually gone the extra step and \nrenominated two of the Clinton nominees who have been confirmed already \nby this body. To my knowledge, President Clinton didn't renominate any \nof the 40-some--I believe that is the correct number--nominees pending \nat the end of the Bush 41 administration. President Bush 43 has done \nthat.\n  So I think it is wrong to say we are not going to have a hearing on \nthese individuals because some other candidates didn't get a hearing \nand that was wrong. Again, two wrongs don't make a right.\n  Today, President Bush told us that he called upon the Senate, and \nspecifically the Senate Judiciary Committee, to move forward with these \nnominees. He told us he thought it was very unfair to the fine people \nhe had nominated that their lives, in effect, are in limbo at the \nmoment because they don't know whether they are going to get a hearing, \nwhether they are going to be confirmed. In the meantime, their law \npractices are suffering, if they are still in the practice of law. \nTheir reputations are hanging in the balance.\n\n  Let me tell you a little bit about a couple of them. Of these eight \nnominees who have languished before the committee and have not had a \nhearing, one is John Roberts, a nominee to the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals. He is one of the country's leading appellate lawyers. He has \nargued 36 cases before the Supreme Court. He served as Deputy Solicitor \nGeneral. He has a great track record. There is nothing wrong with this \nnominee. He is one of the smartest people and one of the most \nexperienced people we could put on the DC Circuit Court. Nobody denies \nthat. So why hasn't he had a hearing? Why?\n  You can cite all kinds of statistics about how many Clinton nominees \nwere approved and this and that. But when you get right down to it, \nthere is absolutely no reason this fine man hasn't had a hearing now in \na year.\n  Miguel Estrada has been nominated to the DC Circuit and he has a \ngreat story to tell. He would be the first Hispanic ever to serve on \nthe DC Circuit. He has argued 15 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. \nBy the way, this is a big deal for a lawyer to argue before the Supreme \nCourt. I have had three cases there in my law career, and it is a great \nhonor for a lawyer. When you can say you have argued 15 cases--and I \nargued 1--and when you can say you argued 36 cases, that is something \nvery few lawyers have ever had the opportunity to do. It shows that you \nare an extraordinary lawyer. So why isn't Miguel Estrada even getting a \nhearing? He would be the first Hispanic to serve on this court. He was \nan Assistant U.S. Solicitor General. He was a Supreme Court law clerk. \nHe has been a Federal prosecutor. No one can say he is not qualified.\n  In fact, the Bar Association unanimously recognized both of these \nindividuals are well qualified, with their highest rating.\n  Justice Pricilla Owen, a nominee to the Fifth Circuit, has served on \nthe Texas Supreme Court since 1994. Every newspaper in Texas endorsed \nher in her last run for reelection. So why isn't Justice Pricilla Owen \neven receiving a hearing? There is no reason she should not receive a \nhearing--or at least no fair reason.\n  I am told Michael McConnell is one of the most intelligent people \never to be nominated to a circuit court. He is nominated to the Tenth \nCircuit, and he is one of the country's leading constitutional scholars \nand lawyers. He has an incredible reputation for fairness, as has been \nillustrated by the support he has received from literally\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\nhundreds of Democrat and Republican law professors around the country. \nHe is clearly one of the outstanding jurists in the country. He hasn't \neven gotten a hearing. Why?\n  Jeffrey Sutton is another of the country's leading appellate lawyers. \nHe has been nominated to the Sixth Circuit. He graduated from Ohio \nState Law School and was first in his class. He has argued over 20 \ncases before the U.S. Supreme Court and State supreme courts, and he \nserved as solicitor of the State of Ohio.\n  Justice Deborah Cook, a nominee to the Sixth Circuit, has served as a \njustice on the Ohio Supreme Court since 1994, a State supreme court \njustice. She was the first woman partner in Akron's oldest law firm. \nThis is another extraordinarily qualified individual. There is no \nreason for her not to have a hearing. Why hasn't this nominee even had \na hearing?\n  Judge Dennis Shedd has been nominated to the Fourth Circuit. He was \nunanimously confirmed by the Senate as a Federal district judge in \n1990. He is strongly supported by both home State Senators--one a \nDemocrat and the other a Republican. In fact, he is past chief counsel \nto the Senate Judiciary Committee. He, too, has a great number of \nfriends on both sides of the aisle. He would be a great judge on the \ncircuit court. Why hasn't he even received a hearing? Is there anything \nwrong with him?\n\n  Judge Terrence Boyle, also nominated to the Fourth Circuit, was \nunanimously confirmed to be a Federal district judge in 1984. He has \nserved all of this time, and I haven't seen anybody come forward with \nanything that would suggest he is not qualified. As a matter of fact, \nthe State Democratic Party chairman supports Judge Boyle's nomination. \nHe says that he gives everyone a fair trial.\n  If the former chairman of the Democratic Party in the State can \nendorse a Republican President's nominee to the circuit court, that is \na pretty good thing. You would think partisan consideration could be \nlaid aside. Why hasn't this individual even received a hearing?\n  It is not too much to ask that, after 365 days, the first step in the \nconfirmation process be taken. A year ago, President Bush said: There \nare over 100 vacancies on the Federal courts causing backlogs, \nfrustration, and delay of justice.\n  Today, a year later, he is asking us to begin the process of clearing \nup this backlog. He has done his part. Chief Justice Rehnquist recently \nstated that the present judicial vacancy crisis is ``alarming,'' and on \nbehalf of the judiciary, he implored the Senate to grant prompt \nhearings and have up-or-down votes on these individuals.\n  I noted that the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator \nLeahy, in 1998, at a time when there were 50 vacancies, said that \nnumber of vacancies represented a ``judicial vacancy crisis.'' Those \nwere his words. Today, there are 89 vacancies. We are getting close to \ntwice as many. It is a 10-percent vacancy rate. The Judicial Conference \nof the United States classified 38 of these court vacancies as judicial \nemergencies.\n  The President has 18 individuals nominated to fill a seat designated \nas a judicial emergency. What that means is that litigants cannot get \nto court. There are delays of 6 and 8 years of people not being able to \nget to court or have their cases resolved--in the case of some criminal \ncases. This is unfair to litigants, and it has been said many times \nthat justice delayed is justice denied. There are many situations in \nwhich that is true, but that is what is happening as a result of not \nbeing able to fill these positions, especially with regard to those \ndenominated as judicial emergencies.\n\n  The 12 regional circuit courts of appeals are the last resort, other \nthan the Supreme Court. There are 30 vacancies, which is a 19-percent \nvacancy rate. Filings in the 12 regional courts of appeals reached an \nall-time high last year. They have increased 22 percent since 1992, and \nI could quote from former presidents of the American Bar Association \nand others who have expressed grave concern about the ability to do \njustice when these kinds of vacancies exist.\n  I will read one quotation from one letter:\n\n       I urge you to heed President Bush's call and not as \n     Republicans and Democrats, but as Americans. It's time for \n     the Senate to act for the good of our judicial system.\n\n  In the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, half of the court is vacant. \nOf the 16 authorized judges, 8 stand vacant today. At a time when there \nwere only four vacancies on that court, Chief Judge Merritt of that \ncourt wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee and said this:\n\n       The court is hurting badly and will not be able to keep up \n     with its workload. Our court should not be treated in this \n     fashion. The public's business should not be treated this \n     way. The litigants in the Federal courts should not be \n     treated this way. The situation in our court is rapidly \n     deteriorating due to the fact that 25 percent of our \n     judgeships are vacant.\n\n  Now it is 50 percent. The caseloads in Federal court can be expected \nto increase because of the war on terrorism and in my area because of \nthe extraordinary amount of illegal contraband and illegal immigration \ncoming across the border.\n  It is sad that the Senate cannot bring itself to even hold hearings \non people who have now been sitting for a year since their nomination, \nindividuals who by any measure are extraordinarily well qualified, are \namong the most qualified in the country. There is nothing wrong with \nthem, and yet no hearing.\n  As of this date, the Senate has confirmed only 9 of the President's \n30 circuit court nominees. By contrast, President Clinton had 42 \npercent of his circuit court nominees confirmed by this same date in \nhis term.\n  I know we can quote statistics, and that is not really the most \nimportant issue. I quote from the Washington Post editorial of November \n30 of last year:\n\n       The Judiciary Committee chairman, Democratic Senator \n     Patrick Leahy, has offered no reasonable justification for \n     stalling on these nominations.\n\n  The point is, anybody can cite statistics, and most of us are pretty \ngood lawyers and can argue the case, but at the end of the day, there \nis no reasonable justification for stalling on these nominations. There \nis no reasonable justification for stalling, unless--I think the Post \nmight have gone on to say--you are trying to get even because of some \nperceived slight. That is beneath the Senate of the United States of \nAmerica, and it should not be the motive of anyone, and I cannot \nbelieve it would be. This is no reason why these nominees should be \ndenied a hearing.\n  Lloyd Cutler, who was President's Clinton's White House counsel, and \nformer Congressman Mickey Edwards recently wrote an op-ed in the \nWashington Post. They said:\n\n       Delay in confirming judges means justice delayed for \n     individuals and businesses, and combined with the bitter \n     nature of some confirmation battles, it may deter many \n     qualified candidates from seeking Federal judgeships.\n\n  That is the unfortunate additional result of what is happening here. \nMore and more good candidates are going to say: Why should I put myself \nand my family through all of this? And that is going to be a real \nshame.\n  Historically, Presidents were able to get their nominees, especially \ntheir first nominees, confirmed. President Reagan, President Bush 1, \nand President Clinton all enjoyed a 100-percent confirmation rate on \ntheir first 11 circuit court nominees--100 percent. All were confirmed \nwithin a year of their nomination. Remember, these eight we are talking \nabout have not even had a hearing within a year.\n  The broader picture is no different. The history of the last three \nPresidents' first 100 nominations shows that, one, President Reagan got \n97 of his first 100 judicial nominations confirmed in an average of 36 \ndays; President George Herbert Walker Bush saw 95 of his first 100 \nconfirmed in an average of 78 days; and President Clinton saw 97 of his \nfirst 100 confirmed in an average of 93 days. But to date, this Senate \nhas confirmed only 52 of President Bush's first 100 nominees, and the \naverage number of days to confirm has exploded to 150.\n  It is not possible to say that nothing is happening, that nothing is \ndifferent, that this is no different than in previous administrations, \nthat President Bush's nominees are being treated the same as any \nothers. It is just not true. The statistics belie that.\n  Madam President, even if you do not want to talk about the \nstatistics, I just\n\n[[Page S4132]]\n\nask you to focus on what President Bush focused on today. He said: I \nnominated 11 good people a year ago today, and only 3 of them have even \nhad the courtesy of a hearing. Would you please go back to your \ncolleagues and implore them to treat these people fairly? He said: It \nis not for me; it is for the American people. He made that point a \ncouple times. And it is for justice and for the American people. I also \nthink that it is going to say something about the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise in morning business to discuss an amendment \nwhich Senator Craig from Idaho and I are going to offer when we resume \nconsideration of the trade bill. I wish to take a few minutes in \nmorning business now to talk about it.\n  It is an amendment that I believe will complement the intent of TPA. \nOthers may view it differently. It is one Senator Craig and I developed \nout of our shared experiences working with and representing members of \nour respective States, Idaho and Minnesota, who have lost jobs, farms, \nand farm income because of trade policies.\n  I first had the opportunity to work with the Senator from Idaho when \nMinnesota loggers and small business owners running sawmills were being \nharmed seriously--some put out of business, some losing their jobs--as \nthe result of imports of foreign lumber and wood products coming into \nthis country and to our State. I found that Senator Craig had been \nworking on these problems for years before I arrived.\n  I actually took his lead. He spearheaded a group of us working on the \nimpact of sugar coming into this country on sugar beet growers in \nMinnesota and Idaho. I know he is someone who has a deep and abiding \ncommitment to do what is right for the citizens of his State, as I hope \nI can demonstrate for the people of Minnesota.\n  Madam President, you probably had this experience in your State as \nwell. The trade policies of this country which have been in effect over \nthe last couple of decades from one Republican administration to a \nDemocratic administration and now to a Republican administration have \nrelatively consistently encouraged the expansion of trade, the \nexpansion of exports upon which a lot of jobs in Minnesota depend and \non which a lot of businesses in Minnesota, large and small, have \nsuccessfully and profitably expanded markets across this country and \nthe world--grain traders, commodity traders, those who provide that \ntransportation, those who finance the businesses engaged in all of \nthis. There are a lot of winners in Minnesota, a lot of beneficiaries \nthrough jobs, through expanding businesses, through rising stock \nportfolios, who say, hey, more trade is better for us, who frankly \ncannot even imagine why I am torn on this subject.\n\n  I find in the presentations and the discussions about trade \nauthority, there is very seldom a recognition, even an acknowledgment, \nof the thousands of men and women whose jobs, whose farms, whose \nbusinesses, have been lost. And lost is not even the right word; they \nhave really been taken away from them because of the impact of these \ntrade policies.\n  So recognizing that this legislation, the so-called trade promotion \nauthority, is a high priority for the administration, that was passed \nby the House of Representatives, that, as the Senator from Oklahoma \nsaid earlier, the tradition of the Senate has been to support free \ntrade in anticipation of the probability that final legislation will \npass the Senate if we get to that point, I think this amendment is a \ncrucial addition to standing beside and with those men and women in my \nState anyway, and I think elsewhere across the country, who are being \nharmed by these policies or who will be in the future.\n  This amendment says if an agreement comes back that has been \nnegotiated by trade representatives, acting at the behest of the \nPresident but not elected by the people of this country--comes back \nwith changes in the trade remedy laws, which change--in most cases \nweaken--these laws that have been passed by the Congress, signed into \nlaw by the President of the United States, for the purpose of \nprotecting those who will be harmed by these trade agreements, by \nillegal dumping of products--it has certainly been devastating to \nnortheastern Minnesota, to the steelworkers there and across this \ncountry--that before those laws and their provisions can be altered or \nweakened or negotiated away or used as bargaining chips to get some \nother purpose achieved, the Congress has the authority--it is not \nrequired but it has the option--to remove those sections of the bill \nand put the rest of the agreement through the fast track, so-called, \nthe procedures that will have been enacted into law, but to reserve the \nprerogative to review these changes, these measures, that are going to \naffect the kind of protection, the kind of safety net, the kind of \nassistance that Americans think they can depend on, cannot be taken \naway, cannot be altered, except by more careful consideration by the \nSenate and Congress.\n  The fact that we have 26 Members of the Senate who are cosponsors and \nare in support of this legislation, 13 Republicans, 13 Democrats, men \nand women from all different parts of the country with all different \nperspectives and philosophies, says to me they have had this same \nexperience in their own States with their own constituents, that they \ntoo have recognized that these trade policies have very mixed results \nin their States, and particularly those who are not the beneficiaries, \nwho are going to be the casualties of expanded trade, the increased \nimports which have been, I think, really tilting our trade policies out \nof balance in a way that is detrimental to this country.\n  Last year, the trade imbalance, the deficit in our trade, was $436 \nbillion. We owed other nations $436 billion more from their imports \nthan we received from our exports. In agriculture, well, there is still \na positive trade balance, but that positive balance has been reduced. \nWe have seen from NAFTA a flood of imports of food, of automobiles, of \nother manufactured goods, and our trade imbalance with Mexico has gone \nfrom being a slight positive in 1993 to a negative balance in the year \n2000. Our trade balance with Canada has gone from being slightly in the \nnegative to seriously in the negative in those 7 years.\n\n  Again, I have seen in Minnesota men and women, farmers, workers, \nbusiness owners, who have lost all of that, lost their hopes, lost \ntheir livelihoods, lost their homes, lost their pensions, lost their \nhealth care as a result of this. To me, it would be unconscionable to \nhand that over to an unelected representative of any President, any \nadministration--previous administration, this administration, a future \nadministration--and allow that situation to develop where that \nagreement would come back and we would be told, take it or leave it, up \nor down; either make that decision that is going to benefit people but \ndisregard those who are going to be most harmed.\n  I see the Senator from Nevada has returned, hopefully with some \nillumination for us. We have taken this opportunity to talk about the \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, the majority leader is on his \nway.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I will yield even more so when the majority leader \narrives.\n  I thank the Senator from Idaho for his work on this. I think he has \nheard more about it from other parties than I have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Madam President, I am pleased my colleague from Minnesota,\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\nSenator Dayton, would speak to an amendment he and I have coauthored \nthat has gained some concern in a variety of quarters as to the impact \nit might have on a trade promotion authority we might be able to pass \nout of the Senate. I think the Senator from Minnesota has spoken very \nclearly and articulately about the problems he and I and all States \nface--the frustration we have with blending domestic markets and \ninternational markets.\n  I certainly am a strong advocate of trade. I always have been. At the \nsame time, I want it to be balanced and I want it to be fair. When \nthere are disadvantages--and we have just seen one that this \nadministration has spoken to in an area that is of great concern to the \nSenator from Minnesota and myself, and that is in timber, where \nCanadians had a unique advantage and were dumping in our market, and we \nfinally spoke up, stepped up, put a duty on, and said back off, let us \nsee if we can find an agreement. It is only with the use of the tool of \ntrade remedy that we are now able to get the Canadians to blink and to \nthink about possibly coming to the table to craft a fair and equitable \nagreement. That is exactly what our amendment would do.\n  Some would suggest, at least by rhetoric, it is a very damaging \namendment to trade promotion authority. What I thought I would do is \nread a letter that 62 Members of the Senate signed and sent to the \nPresident on May 7 of last year, when in fact our trade representatives \nhave been in Doha, Qatar, negotiating new trade agreements and the rest \nof the world said: You have to put your remedies on the table, you have \nto negotiate them down or away or we are not going to deal with you.\n  What we are saying is bring it all to the table, talk about it. We \nbelieve that as the legislative branch of Government that crafts public \npolicy, we ought to have a right at some point to be able to speak to \nit, instead of taking it all or take none of it, which is, of course, \nwhat happens under TPA or fast-track authority.\n  Once a trade agreement is negotiated and if the executive branch of \ngovernment in some way has negotiated down or altered trade remedy \nauthority, and the package comes to the floor, then the pressure of the \nworld is upon the Senate. Take it all or take none of it. Those are the \nonly two options. Of course, the pressure is to take all of it because \nit is believed the advantages gained by these trade agreements are so \npowerful to the American economy--and in many instances they are--that \nwe cannot deny it. Ultimately they pass, even though the \nadministration, Democrat or Republican, may well have negotiated away \nsome of our authority and our ability under the law.\n  This is what we said to the President May 7:\n\n       We are writing to state our strong opposition to any \n     international trade agreement that would weaken U.S. trade \n     laws, key U.S. trade laws including antidumping law, \n     countervailing duty law. Section 201 and section 301 are \n     critical elements in U.S. trade policy. A wide range of \n     agricultural and industrial sectors have successfully \n     employed these statutes to address trade problems. \n     Unfortunately, experience suggests that many other industries \n     are likely to have occasion to rely upon them in future \n     years. Each of these laws is fully consistent with U.S. \n     obligations under the World Trade Organization and other \n     trade agreements. Moreover, these laws actually promote free \n     trade by countering practices that both distort trade and are \n     condemned by international trading rules. U.S. trade law \n     provides American workers and industries the guarantee that \n     if the United States pursues trade liberalization, it will \n     also protect them against unfair foreign trade practices and \n     allow time for them to address serious import surges. They \n     are part of a political bargain struck with Congress and the \n     American people under which the United States has pursued \n     market opening agreements in the past.\n\n  What does the Craig-Dayton/Dayton-Craig amendment do? It guarantees \nwe can speak to that if those kinds of relaxations or changes in the \nlaws come back to the Senate. And we can speak to it without dumping \nthe entire trade agreement.\n  I don't think we want to do that. Ours is to promote an ever-\nexpanding, freer trading world market. At the same time, we do not want \nto disadvantage our own economy, destroy our own producers' capability, \ndamage the workhorses of this country, all in pursuit of the idealism \nor the goal.\n  We went on to say:\n\n       Congress has made it clear its position on this matter. In \n     draft fast-track consideration considered in 1997, both the \n     House and Senate have included strong provisions directing \n     trade negotiators not to weaken U.S. trade laws. Congress has \n     restated this position in resolutions, letters, and through \n     other matters. Unfortunately, some of our trading partners, \n     many of which maintain serious unfair trade practices, \n     continue to seek to weaken these laws.\n\n  Why? They want access to the largest, richest consumer market in the \nworld. They don't want us to force them to be fair, for them to be \nbalanced, and for them to come in in a transparent negotiated \nenvironment. That is what we are asking. That is what this amendment \nrequires.\n  We went on to say:\n\n       This may simply be postponing by those who oppose further \n     market opening. But whatever the motive, the United States \n     should no longer use its trade laws as bargaining chips in \n     trade negotiations nor agree to any provision that weakens or \n     undermines U.S. trade laws.\n  Now, that is May 7, 2001; 62 Senators signed, Republican and \nDemocrat.\n  The amendment we bring to the floor, or hope we have the opportunity \nto bring to the floor, is supported equitably. We have 26 cosponsors, \n13 Democrats and 13 Republicans.\n  What do we do? We simply create a point of order that says if the \nadministration changes trade remedy laws, they, by the current \nproposal, must notice us that they have done so, and in so doing they \nhave to come back and fully defend it. If they can convince us, then we \nsupport it. If they cannot, then a point of order rests against it. \nWhy? Because we are the ones who craft public policy. We will not deny \nor walk away from our constitutional right to do so. At the same time, \nwe are fully willing to allow our negotiators to engage all of the rest \nof the trading countries of the world to bring any trade agreement with \nany proposed changes in it because ultimately it is our job in the \nSenate under our constitutional form of government to accept or deny \nthat by ratification or by voting it down.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DAYTON. There have been certain characterizations made about \nthose who are advocates for this amendment. I ask the Senator if he \nbelieves these characterizations apply to himself: That those who \nsupport the amendment are against trade of almost any kind, that we are \nagainst the administration, we want to be obstructionists to the \nadministration's trade policies, and that we are xenophobic, against \nthe rest of the world. Does the Senator consider himself as fitting in \nany of those categories? I don't consider myself to fit into those \ncategories.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I don't know how anyone serving the Senate, which is for \nan expanding economy, for greater revenues, for workers and for \nproducers--and of course we will tax a little of that--would be against \ntrade.\n  Clearly, the future of our economy is trading in a world market. I \nhave watched my State of Idaho grow from an agrarian economy of \nagriculture, timber and mining, to a very diverse economy today of \nelectronics, the high-tech industry, and food processing. Almost half \nof everything an Idaho worker produces has to sell on the world market \nto be profitable, to allow that person his or her job and to continue \nthe success of that company. That is also true in Minnesota. It is also \ntrue everywhere else in the country.\n  What the Senator is saying and what I am saying is, in the case of \nCanada and softwood lumber--and they have a distinct advantage and dump \nin our markets, putting our people out of work--we say, wait a minute, \nstop; balance this field out a little bit and create fair trade by that \nkind of balance. That is what our amendment allows--a balancing of the \nprocess. What is most important that our amendment allows us, as \npolicymakers, is a right to have a voice in that process. Not the take-\nit-or-leave-it strategy that doesn't work in the end.\n\n  I wanted to vote for NAFTA. I voted against NAFTA. Why? Extraneous \nenvironmental, extraneous labor agreements that should not have been \npart of a trade agreement. It had no choice. There was no flexibility. \nTake it or leave it.\n  Instead of working to create a balanced economic environment that \nwould have allowed freer but fair and\n\n[[Page S4134]]\n\nbalanced trade across the Mexican and Canadian border, we did not have \nthat opening. That is an opening we ought to have.\n  What I do not want to deny, and I think the Senator from Minnesota \nagrees, I don't want to deny our negotiators from going to the table \nand being able to negotiate any agreement. They ought to have the full \nfreedom and flexibility to put anything and everything on the table and \nto bring anything and everything back to us. In the end, under our \nconstitutional form of government, we are the ones who have to make the \ndecision. They are the ones who negotiate. That is the kind of balance \nthat I think is important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4134-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4134-S4135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STEEL TRADE POLICY\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I am very concerned about some actions \nthat were taken yesterday. Guess what. On May 8, the administration \nissued its statement of administration policy on the trade bill. I was \nlooking forward to that because I thought George Bush was a friend of \nthe American steel industry. I was absolutely shocked to read that \npolicy and find out the administration opposes the provision to provide \na safety net for American steel retirees. I was shocked because just a \nfew months ago, President Bush stood up for steel when he issued those \ntemporary steel tariffs, and I thought we could count on him now as we \nwere working our way through the Trade Adjustment Act.\n  I was taken aback to hear the opposition to the amendment that \nSenator Rockefeller and I have, that provides a very modest temporary \nbridge to help steel retirees keep their health benefits until we can \nwork out a larger compromise.\n  This statement is terrible. It abandons the steelworkers. It abandons \nsteel retirees. It is just plain wrong. We do need steel and we do need \nsteelworkers. They are suffering at the hands of unfair trade \ncompetition, and George Bush's own administration helped us document \nthat. That is what is so breathtaking.\n  On one hand we have done it, and then on the other hand we said even \nthough steel companies are in bankruptcy because of unfair trade \npractices, we will not help the steelworker retirees keep their health \nbenefits.\n  I am fighting for American steel, those steelworkers and those \nretired steelworkers who, after years of hard work, believed that by \nworking down in the mills they would have security for their families \nin retirement. Those widows who sent their husband off to the mills \nevery day, like Bethlehem Steel in my own hometown, with pride and love \nand a lunch bucket thought that they could count on their pension and \ntheir health care.\n  These are the true victims of years of unfair trade practices. Year \nafter year, we debate trade and people say: Well, I am for fair trade. \nI don't know when trade gets fair. I just never know when trade is \ngoing to get fair. I have been a Member of the U.S. Congress for 25 \nyears and I have never seen a trade deal that came out fair yet.\n  What are the consequences of that? People losing their pensions, \npeople losing their health care, and people losing their jobs--this is \nunfair trade. People have been injured by these practices and I want to \nhelp them.\n  I heard the stories of my steelworkers and the retirees. I have been \nto the rallies. I have been to the meetings. I have been down to the \nunion halls. I even held a hearing on this topic. I heard their stories \nabout their fear of losing their health care and their pensions.\n  I met, at my hearing, Gertrude Misterka. She is a woman my own age, \nfrom my own hometown of Baltimore, who is terrified she is going to \nlose her health care. Her husband Charlie died 5 years ago. He worked \nat Bethlehem Steel for 35 years. He was loved by his wife, a friend to \nhis fellow steelworkers. He is greatly missed.\n  The Misterkas thought that after 35 years of working at Bethlehem \nSteel, they would have a secure future. Charlie thought his wife would \nbe taken care of even after his death. He was a good, kind guy.\n  Let me tell you about her. She has diabetes, high blood pressure, and \nasthma. She pays $78 a month for her health care premium. Even with \nthis coverage she pays $100 monthly for her prescriptions.\n  But let me tell you, because of being a diabetic, because of having \ncomplications around diabetes, guess what her prescription drug bill is \nevery year: $6,716.16. You tell me what is going to happen to her if \nshe loses her health insurance.\n  Oh, yes, let's give somebody a tax credit or a voucher to go into the \nprivate market. You tell me how Gertrude, at age 65, with diabetes and \nall the complications, is going to go shopping. Medicare Choice has \nalready collapsed. HMOs are not of any value to her. Nobody will take \nher because of her preexisting condition.\n  Listen, we have to do something to help her and to help all others \nlike her. I promised that I would fight to help her keep her health \ncare. Families who worked hard for America and spent all those years at \nbackbreaking work should be able to count on us.\n  These costs will only go up as prescription drug costs continue to \nskyrocket.\n  I listened to Mrs. Misterka that day, and my heart went out to her \nand all the women like her. I promised her that I would fight to help \ncurrent and retired steelworkers and their families--families that need \na safety net so they don't lose their healthcare overnight if their \ncompanies go under; families who worked hard for America, some for \nnearly 50 years of back-breaking work in the hot mills and the cold \nmills; and families that now need our help.\n  America's steel industry is in crisis. American steel companies are \nfiling for bankruptcy protection--31 since 1997, including 17 in the \nlast year alone.\n  Steel mills are shutting down. In the last year, at least 40 mills \nand related facilities have been shut down or idled. The closed mills \nrepresent nearly one-fifth of America's steelmaking capacity.\n  Steelworkers are losing their jobs. Nearly 47,000 steelworkers have \nlost their jobs since 1998, including about 30,000 in the last year \nalone. We now have less than half as many steelworkers as we did in \n1980. Most of these jobs are gone for good.\n  The cause of this crisis is well-known. Unfair foreign competition \nhas brought American steel to its knees. Foreign steel companies are \nsubsidized by their governments, and they dump excess steel into \nAmerica's open market at fire sale prices.\n  This isn't rhetoric. This is fact.\n  Last year, the International Trade Commission unanimously found that \n``a substantial part of the industry is being injured by increased \nimports'' under section 201 of the Trade Act.\n  As Commerce Secretary Evans said last June:\n\n       For over 50 years, foreign governments have distorted the \n     market through subsidies of their steel industries.\n\n  The Russian Government keeps about 1,000 unprofitable steel plants \nopen through subsidies. South Korea has nearly doubled its production \ncapacity since 1990 without the domestic demand to support the \nincrease.\n  Millions of tons of foreign steel are sold in the United States every \nyear below the cost of production to keep these subsidized foreign \nmills in business.\n  America's steel industry is under siege and has been under siege for \ndecades. They've been fighting an uphill battle against competitors \nthat don't play by the rules.\n  The true cost of foreign steel sold at ``bargain'' prices is lost \nAmerican jobs, is broken promises to American workers, and threats to \nAmerican security.\n  Why is steel important?\n  Steel built America, the railroads and bridges that keep our country \nconnected, the cars and trucks and buses and trains that make our \nNation move, the buildings where we live and work and shop and worship, \nand the ships, tanks and weapons that we need during times of war. Yet \nsaving steel is not an exercise in nostalgia.\n  President Bush said:\n\n       Steel is an important jobs issue, it is also an important \n     national security issue.\n\n  I couldn't agree more.\n  The distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee and \nof its Defense subcommittee, Senator Stevens, recently made this point \neloquently here on the Senate floor:\n\n       During World War II, he said, `we produced steel for the \n     world. We produced the steel for\n\n[[Page S4135]]\n\n     the allies. We rebuilt Europe. We built the tanks in the \n     United States, and the planes and the ships that saved the \n     world.' Could we do it again?\n\n  That is a serious question.\n  Bethlehem Steel's Sparrows Point plant near Baltimore recently \nproduced the steel plate to repair the USS Cole. It is the only mill in \nAmerica that still produces the armor plate for Navy ships.\n  America must never become dependent on foreign suppliers--like Russia \nand China--for the steel we need to defend our nation and freedom \naround the world. But we are headed in that direction. Already, the \nUnited States is one of the few steel-producing countries that is a net \nimporter of steel.\n  America imported more than 30 million tons of steel last year.\n  President Bush took an important first step to help America's steel \nindustry by imposing broad temporary tariffs on imported steel.\n  I was disappointed that the tariffs are 30 percent or less--phased \nout over the 3 years they are in effect rather than 40 percent tariffs \nfor 4 years the steel industry and steelworkers sought. I was \ndisappointed that the tariffs don't cover slab steel. But I appreciate \nthe President's action under section 201.\n  Tariffs are an important step to give America's steel industry a \nchance to restructure and recover with some protection from the deluge \nof below-cost foreign steel, but they are not the only step needed to \nhelp American steel.\n  The tariffs help the industry. Now it is time to help the workers and \nretirees who will lose their healthcare if their companies go under.\n  The Daschle amendment provided a temporary 1-year extension of health \nbenefits to qualified steel retirees.\n  The health care extensions for steel retirees are similar to TAA \nhealth care benefits for workers who lose their jobs as a result of \ntrade agreements. Workers could have 2 years of health care benefits. \nRetirees would only have 1 year of benefits.\n  Just like the temporary tariffs give the companies breathing room to \nrecover, a temporary extension of benefits give workers and retirees \nbreathing room to find a long-term plan. It gives them time to plan--\ntime that the workers and retirees of LTV didn't have. They lost their \nbenefits overnight.\n  Supporting producers is in the national interest. The policy of our \nGovernment is to support producers when it is in the national interest. \nNational interest means national responsibility. It is important to \nsupport farmers to make sure we have the producers to be food-\nindependent.\n  I am happy to stand up for our farmers whether they are chicken \nproducers on the Eastern Shore or corn growers in the Midwest.\n  We spend about $19 billion a year on farmers--$656 billion over the \npast 10 years. This does not include $17 billion in emergency \nappropriations for our farmers, and it looks like these subsidies are \nincreasing.\n  Congress passed a $100 billion farm bill. The President said he will \nsign it. It calls for a $73 billion increase in farm subsidies over the \nnext 6 years.\n  This farm bill includes a $3 billion subsidy for peanuts, up to \n$30,000 per farmer for livestock subsidies, and a $3 billion subsidy \nfor cotton.\n  Since 1996, we have provided over $5 billion for cotton producers--\nthree-quarters of those funds went to just 18,000 farmers. I love \ncotton. It is the fabric of our lives. But cotton is not more important \nthan steel.\n  I have supported aid to farmers. So have most of the opponents of \nsteel. I would ask them why. Why do farmers get bail-out after bail-\nout, yet our steel workers can't get this modest help?\n  Farmers work hard, but no harder than steelworkers. Farmers provide \nvital commodities. So do steelworkers. Our Nation must never be \ndependent on foreign food, and it must never be dependent on foreign \nsteel.\n  It is not just farmers. Congress gave the airlines $15 billion after \nSeptember 11 because of a national emergency. That was the right thing \nto do. Now, we need to stand up for steel.\n  Make no mistake, this is a national emergency for steel. Standing up \nfor steel is in the national interest just like farmers, just like \nairlines.\n  I was moved by the stories of Mrs. Misterka and others at the hearing \na few weeks ago as was everyone in the hearing room. I feel very close \nto these workers and retirees. I grew up down the road from the Beth \nSteel mill in Baltimore. My dad had a grocery store that he opened \nextra early so the steelworkers on the morning shift could come in and \nbuy their lunch. The workers at Beth Steel weren't units of production, \nthey were our neighbors. They are our neighbors.\n  And what did we know about the Bethlehem Steel Plant? It was a union \njob with good wages and good benefits so our neighbors could go to \nwork, put in an honest day, and get fair pay back to raise their \nfamilies and pursue the American dream.\n  We were all proud of our workers at Bethlehem Steel. In World War II \nand Vietnam they rolled gun barrels, made steel for grenades, provided \nsteel for the shipyards that turned out Liberty ships very 3 weeks. \nToday, Beth Steel made the steel plates to repair the USS Cole after \nthe terrorist bombing damaged the ship.\n  Most of Beth Steel workers are Beth Steel workers for their entire \ncareers--30, 40, 50 years on the job, every day despite the aches and \npains, the bad back, the varicose veins that age steelworkers beyond \ntheir years. Their commitment to Beth Steel is a commitment to America \ndoing the work that needs to get done for fair pay and a secure future. \nThe futures that once looked secure are now at risk through no fault of \ntheir own. It is time we stand up for steelworkers and help them in \ntheir time of need just like they helped America every step of the way.\n  This is not the end of the story. I will continue to fight for \nAmerica's steel workers.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for \naccommodating both Senator Lott and me as we talk about the current \ncircumstances involving the pending legislation.\n  Let me also say how much I share her point of view. Maybe I am not \nable to demonstrate the same passion as Senator Mikulski has indicated, \nthe strength of feeling that she has about the issue involving her \nsteelworker retirees--but I certainly share her conviction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4135-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4135-S4136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we have been noting throughout the \nlast several hours, a number of our colleagues have been in discussion \nand negotiation involving the trade adjustment assistance part of the \npackage that is pending before us. I am very pleased to announce that \nan agreement has been reached. The agreement is one that involved the \nadministration, Republicans, and Democrats who have been involved in \nthis issue for some time now.\n  I might just briefly outline it. I will leave to the manager of the \nbill and the ranking member to discuss the matter in greater detail \ntomorrow morning.\n  As I understand it, they intend to lay down the amendment tomorrow. \nIt will be, then, the pending business.\n  I also encourage Senators to offer amendments tomorrow and Monday. \nSenator Lott and I have discussed the schedule. I am prepared to say as \na result of this agreement that there will be no votes tomorrow, but I \nencourage Senators to avail themselves of the opportunity they now \nhave, tonight or tomorrow or Monday, to offer amendments.\n  We will consider votes for those amendments on Monday night. We have \nalready announced there will be a vote on a judge at 6 o'clock on \nMonday. We can accommodate additional votes immediately following that \nvote, should amendments be offered and should we be in a position, \nthen, to dispose of them by Monday afternoon.\n  But the agreement has a number of components. The trade adjustment \nassistance for more workers--that will provide at least 65,500 new \nworkers with trade adjustment assistance, according to the reports that \nI have just been given, unprecedented health care coverage for harmed \nworkers, a 70-percent COBRA subsidy for tax credit for employers and \nother institutions, and benefits that match the 2-year training period. \nWorkers would receive income assistance for at least 18 months while \nthey were retraining for up to 2 years.\n\n[[Page S4136]]\n\nThen there also would be wage insurance for older workers as well.\n\n  There are a number of components. I will not speak at length about \nthe specifics of the package until the agreement is ready to be \npresented tomorrow morning. But I hope the final formulation of the \nlanguage to accommodate this agreement can be prepared so that the \namendment will be provided for all colleagues tomorrow, will be \noffered, and will be part of the pending business as we consider \namendments to this, and other amendments.\n  Senator Lott and I have agreed that there would be an understanding \nthat as this package is agreed to as it relates to those issues \ninvolving TAA, we would entertain it.\n  There is also an understanding that an amendment that would allow for \nconsideration of assistance for retired steelworkers for health \npurposes would be entertained. And we will have that debate, and an \namendment will be offered. A point of order, of course, will be made \nagainst my language. And we understand that. Once that point of order \nhas been made, this compromise package will be offered.\n  I am appreciative of the work that has gone into reaching this \nagreement. I am disappointed, obviously, that we couldn't do more. But \nI am also appreciative of the fact that we have to move on and that \nSenators who wish to offer other legislation are entitled to do so.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for the effort that has been made. I \nhope this will now accelerate our prospects for completing this bill \nand allowing us to address the deadline that exists for the Andean \nTrade Preference Act especially.\n  I yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just a couple of clarifications, and a \nstatement of what I believe our understanding is:\n  First of all, I believe--we talked about this earlier--there still \nneeds to be a point of order made against the package that was filed, \nand there would be enough votes to sustain that point of order.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in response to the Republican leader, it \nwould not be my desire to challenge the point of order.\n  Mr. LOTT. When the point of order is made, at that point we will move \nforward with the agreement we have in regard to TAA. Amendments would \nbe in order on the rest of the underlying package, TPA, trade promotion \nauthority, and the Andean Trade Preference Act. Is that the Senator's \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. We have had an opportunity to quickly review the components \nof this compromise agreement. It has been a bipartisan effort. The \nadministration has had input. I believe all parties are agreed to \nsupport it. There could still be amendments that would be offered, or \nentertained, as Senator Daschle said. But I believe the negotiators are \nprepared to defend the agreement and oppose amendments that would \nchange that.\n  I want to state very firmly that it would be my intent to do the same \nthing. If we don't do that, we begin to pick apart the agreement, and \nthen there is no agreement.\n  But I believe good work has been done. All parties have made some \nconcessions. I think, though, that it is going to have significant \nassistance for those who need this transition assistance, and this will \nset a process up that can get us a bill.\n  I hope Senator Daschle will join me in opposing amendments that could \nundermine the agreement which we have.\n  Further, I observe that I am glad we will be having votes on Monday. \nI think we are going to have to do serious work. I understand Senators \nhave amendments on both sides that will be offered. But we do need to \ntry to finish the bill next week. I think we are going to have to look \nat how we are guaranteed that is done while Senators have a chance to \nmake their case. That is a delicate balance, as is everything in the \nSenate. It always takes understanding and cooperation, and we are going \nto do that.\n  Senator Daschle and I both are going to have to provide leadership \nwith which our entire caucuses won't always agree. But that is how \nbusiness is done. I think we have done the right thing here. I intend \nto support this agreement and work on getting this very important \nlegislation completed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to make one clarification which \nSenator Lott and I have already made. I said this privately, but I want \nto say for the record that I will oppose an amendment to improve this \npackage or to detract from this package on trade adjustment assistance.\n  Obviously, we are open to consider amendments on other matters \nrelating to the bill. But on this particular package, the one \nadditional part of the agreement that I stated--and I want to reiterate \nagain--is there is an understanding that Senators would be free to \noffer amendments having to do with steelworkers. I intend to support \nthat amendment. I have indicated that to Senator Lott. But that is \noutside of this agreement. That was part of the understanding we had as \nthis negotiation was completed.\n  I wanted to make that clarification.\n  I will say for the record what I said privately to Senator Lott. That \namendment will be part of the overall debate on the bill, and I do \nintend to support it.\n  I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I think the majority leader stated or \nclarified what my questions were.\n  As I understand it, there is a compromise but the compromise does not \ninclude a bridge to help steel retirees. But part of the conversation \nwas that a steel retiree amendment would be in order. I believe we will \nhave the support and votes. Senator Rockefeller and I intend to offer \nan amendment at an appropriate time.\n  I also support the majority leader when he said he would not ask for \na rollcall vote on the point of order.\n  As of yesterday, I wanted a rollcall vote, to drag it out, and raise \nthe roof. But then it would be parliamentary tactics.\n  I think this topic is so serious that for the good of the Nation, and \nfor the way I feel about my steelworkers and those who have been hurt, \nI don't want to engage in a time-consuming and dilatory practice.\n  I will not ask for a rollcall vote now that we have an assurance that \nwe will be able to offer our amendment. I thank the leader for his \nadvocacy on that.\n  I wanted to be clear that I will not ask for a rollcall on the point \nof order, so that we can get to the compromise and get to the \namendments, and maybe get to really helping those people who have been \ninjured by trade.\n  I have other comments I want to make about steel. I think I will save \nthose for my statement later on about why they are in this crisis, why \nthis is a national security issue, and why it is an economic security \nissue.\n  I think we are going to have a framework for proceeding on an \namendment. Senator Rockefeller and I will be able to offer that, if not \ntomorrow, over the next coming days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I don't want to dice and slice there too \nclosely, but I want to clarify that the negotiators and I believe \nSenator Daschle and I are prepared to support the components of this \ncompromise agreement even though not all of it was in the TAA area. \nObviously, other amendments may be offered on trade promotion \nassistance, and we will have an opportunity to offer those. But we will \ndefend the components of the compromise.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, that is true. I said a moment ago that it \nis my intention to oppose amendments--with the clarification I made on \nthe steel issue--that would alter this agreement with all of its \ncomponents. I think Senator Lott and I are in agreement on that. That \nis the intention of leadership as amendments are offered.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, once again, the principal reason I have \nsought recognition has been to comment on my ``no'' vote on the farm \nbill, which was passed yesterday. Even though there are some parts of \nthe farm bill which I liked, I have, on balance, decided to vote ``No'' \nbecause of the excessive cost which favors big corporate farmers and \nprovides unreasonable subsidies to cotton, soybean, wheat, rice and \ncorn.\n  When I voted for the farm bill in the Senate, the cost was $73.5 \nbillion over current spending for farm programs. However, the \nconference report came in at $82.8 billion for a total of approximately \n$190 billion total over 10 years which is, simply stated, far too \nexpensive. The United States no longer enjoys a projected surplus of \n$5.6 trillion over the next 10 years. In fact, there is a deficit of \n$130 billion expected by the end of this fiscal year.\n  Projecting the costs of this farm bill, it may be necessary to invade \nthe Social Security trust fund, probably abandon plans for adequate \nprescription drugs for senior citizens and encroach on necessary \nappropriations for many priority items, including defense, education \nand health care. When I chaired the Appropriations Subcommittee for \nLabor, Health & Human Services and Education, and now in my capacity as \nranking member, I have seen the great need for funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health and other health programs as well as education and \nworker safety. Without enumerating many other programs, there are \nobviously high priorities which will be impacted by the costs of this \nFarm Bill.\n  I am especially concerned about payments to large corporate farmers. \nThe distinguished ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, Senator \nLugar, has stated that more than $100 billion will go to farm subsidy \npayments over the next 10 years, with two-thirds of payments going to \njust 10 percent of the largest farmers who grow primarily corn, \nsoybean, wheat, rice and cotton. This policy will likely encourage \nfurther market concentration.\n  This bill encourages over-production with the resultant consequence \nof yet lower prices leading to more subsidies. This Bill will further \nhave an adverse impact on international trade by providing expanded and \nunpredictable levels of support, which increase the likelihood that the \nUnited States might breech the farm subsidy limitations it agreed to in \nthe 1994 world trade agreements. Further, the bill's expanded supports \nhave caused our trading partners to question our sincerity on future \nreductions in farm spending.\n  There are some portions of the bill which I favor, such as the new \nnational dairy program, expanded Food Stamp Program, including \nproviding food stamps to legal immigrants, and the many positive \nenvironmental and conservation measures that are very effective in \nPennsylvania. I am pleased to see the new national dairy program, but \nit falls short of the proper legislation which is embodied in my bill, \nS. 1157, which would create permanent dairy compacts in the Northeast, \nas well as the South, Northwest and Inter-Mountain regions. While the \ndairy provisions will be of help, Congress is missing an opportunity to \ncreate a long-term dairy policy through the compacts which would have \nno cost to the taxpayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4137-5", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GUN TRAFFICKING IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have spoken previously about the problem \nof gun trafficking. In June of 2000, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms released ``Following the Gun: Enforcing Federal Laws Against \nFirearms Traffickers.'' This report examined 1,500 ATF gun trafficking \ninvestigations documenting that more than 84,000 guns were diverted to \nthe illegal market and were often later used by criminals to commit \nviolent crimes. In addition this report showed that investigations \ninvolving gun shows and corrupt gun dealers involved the highest \nnumbers of trafficked guns. However, some good news did come out of \nthis report. At the time of its publication, the report concluded that \nATF gun trafficking investigations led to the prosecutions of more than \n1,700 defendants. Of these cases, 812 defendants were sentenced in \nfederal court to a total of 7,420 years in prison, with an average \nsentence of nine years.\n  Gun trafficking has also been a problem in my home state of Michigan. \nAccording to Americans for Gun Safety's analysis of ATF Trace Data from \n1996--1999, over 40 percent of the guns traced to crimes committed in \nMichigan in 1998 and 1999 originated in other states, a much higher \nrate than the national average. The largest number of out of state \nsuppliers of guns to Michigan during the same period were from Ohio, \nKentucky, Georgia and Alabama.\n  The ATF's report and these statistics demonstrate that criminals are \nnot only gaining access to guns, but are able to smuggle them into the \nhands of other criminals who use them to commit violent crimes. This \nkind of activity can be stopped by vigorously enforcing our gun laws, \nproviding law enforcement with more tools to crack down on gun \ntrafficking, corrupt gun dealers and other armed criminals, and by \npassing sensible gun safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4137-6", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4137-S4140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FARM SECURITY AND RURAL INVESTMENT ACT OF 2002\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Farm \nSecurity and Rural Development Act of 2002. While previous farm bills \nhave provided very little for the State of Maine and the New England \nregion, I am pleased that the conference report before us, while by no \nmeans perfect, provides for a more equitable treatment for the farmers \nin Maine and the Northeast. I have been in touch with the farmers and \ngrowers in Maine throughout the development of the 2002 Farm bill, and \nthey, like I, believe the Northeast has been shortchanged in past Farm \nbills.\n  The State groups, such as the Maine Potato Board, the Maine Wild \nBlueberry Commission, the Maine Farm Bureau, the Maine Apple Growers, \nthe Northeast Dairy Coalition, the Directors of the State's Farm \nService Agency and Maine Rural Development, and the State \nConservationist at the National Resource Conservation Service, believe \nthat this conference report starts us down a path toward regional \nequity from which I would hope we will not stray in the future \ndevelopment of farm policies.\n  In addition, on May 6, Commissioner Robert Spear of the Maine \nDepartment of Agriculture wrote me similar thoughts, stating that, ``I \nbelieve it is\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\na good improvement over the so-called Freedom to Farm. The bill \nstrengthens the safety net for all farmers, it more equitably \ndistributes Federal farm dollars and it provides strong incentives to \nimprove stewardship''. I would like to submit Commissioner Spears' \nentire letter for the Record.\n  First and foremost, this past year, I made a pledge to the dairy \nfarmers of Maine that I was committed to see that the safety net they \nhad through the now expired Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact would \nnot be pulled out from under them. This has been my top priority for \nmaintaining a way of life in our rural communities, and I am pleased \nthat the Farm bill provides for a dairy program modeled on our Dairy \nCompact.\n  I have stated numerous times on this floor that I would have much \npreferred that the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact be reauthorized \nalong with the inclusion of those Northeast States that surround New \nEngland that want to join the compact to ensure that people in the \nregion can get fresh, low-priced fluid milk in their grocery stores. In \ncontrast to the provisions contained in the conference report, the \nbeauty of the Northeast Dairy Compact was that it required no Federal \nfunding.\n  Under the conference report, dairy farmers will get monthly payments \nover the next 3\\1/2\\ years when the price of fluid milk drops, not \nyearly as other commodity programs, but monthly checks that come only \nwhen prices are low, and at the very time the producers need a better \ncash flow to keep the farm and their dairy herds going, as the \nNortheast Dairy Compact provided.\n  I am very pleased that the dairy funding provided is retroactive to \nDecember 1, 2001, as it corresponds with the time when milk prices \nstarted to drop in New England and continue to remain low. The dairy \nfarmers in my State will be able to count on approximately $3.2 million \nin added income from last December through this coming July, when it is \npredicted that prices may start to climb. These payments may literally \nsave some of our small family farms as the Northeast Compact has done \nin past years, and I urge the USDA to get these retroactive payments \nout to the dairy farmers just as soon as possible.\n  In the future, when the price of fresh fluid milk drops below $16.94 \nper hundredweight, our dairy farmers will receive 45 percent of the \ndifference of that price and the current price of the fluid milk. This \nwill apply to the first 2.4 million pounds of production of fluid milk \nor for a dairy herd of around 135-140 cows, a small family farm that \nhas forged a way of life in New England for three and four generations.\n  Not only has the dairy safety net been an important provision for me, \nbut a substantial increase in funding for voluntary agriculture \nconservation programs has been a priority as well. Like the \nenvironmental groups I have worked with, such as Environmental Defense \nand the Environmental Working Group, I am disappointed that the \nconferees did not keep the Senate's higher funding numbers for funding \nto farmers to promote conservation in each of our States. But, I am \npleased that there is still an 80-percent increase overall for \nconservation funding in this conference report.\n  The funds going to Maine will at the very least be quadrupled, \nestimated to be close to $23 million by 2005. This is very important \nfunding for a State that is facing pressures from the environmental \nimpacts of growth and sprawl and pressures to preserve open spaces, and \nalso the need to conserve our water resources, in some cases to restore \nthe habitats of the now endangered Atlantic salmon in eight Downeast \nrivers, a few which flow through the heart of our Maine Wild Blueberry \nfields where water is important to both.\n  The conference report also provides $1.03 billion in mandatory \nfunding for rural development programs. Under the Rural Development \nCommunity Water Assistance Grant Program, for instance, Maine will \nreceive $3 million of the $30 million in mandatory funding through 2011 \nto address drought conditions by making rural areas and small \ncommunities eligible for grant funding where there is a significant \ndecline in quantity and quality of water.\n\n  This funding is particularly critical when considering that, like \nmany States on the East Coast, Maine has been experiencing an extended \nperiod of drought, so the funding that helps residents deal with \ndrought conditions is of great importance. There are, according to the \nMaine Emergency Management Agency, 1,700 wells that have now gone dry \nin the State. Total precipitation for 2001 was the driest in 108 years \nof precipitation monitoring in the State. Precipitation has actually \nbeen below average for 22 of the last 24 months, and while we have been \nhelped somewhat by recent snow and rain, NOAA's National Weather \nService climate forecasters see limited relief from the drought in the \nmonths to come.\n  Also, the Rural Water and Waste Facility Grants will provide Maine \nwith up to $90 million over 10 years of additional resources to assist \nsmall rural communities with their drinking water and wastewater needs. \nReauthorization of Rural Development Programs through 2011 will provide \nMaine with at least $1.5 million over 10 years for regional planning \nactivities and technical assistance to small businesses.\n  Grants to non-profit organizations will be provided to finance the \nconstruction, refurbishing, and servicing of individually-owned \nhousehold water well systems in rural areas for low or moderate income \nindividuals by providing resources to community based organizations to \nhelp families with severe drinking water problems.\n  There are provisions to train rural firefighters and emergency \npersonnel to assist small communities in Maine with homeland security \nissues, to support the rural business investment program, and $80 \nmillion for loan guarantees to provide local TV signals to rural areas.\n  In regard to the Rural Empowerment Zones, Rural Enterprise \nCommunities, and Champion Communities for Direct and Guaranteed Loans \nfor Essential Community facilities, the city of Lewiston, ME, will now \nbe eligible to take advantage of the benefits of Community Facility \nDirect and Guaranteed Loan Programs. Lewiston was one of only two \ncommunities nationwide specifically named in the Farm Bill Conference \nReport.\n  For agricultural research, the conference report expands the \nInitiative for Future Agriculture and Foods Systems, important to the \nUniversity of Maine as a real new source of research and development \nfunding. The University has competed successfully for these grants in \nthe past and currently has a $2 million IFAFS grant for looking at \nsmall integrated farm systems, along with being cooperators of several \nother IFAFS grants around the country.\n  For the promotion of Maine value-added agricultural products around \nthe world, the Market Access Program will be increased to $200 million \nannually by 2006, which is up from the current funding of $90 million. \nThe MAP has been invaluable in helping to advertise the quality of our \nMaine potatoes and wild blueberries, helping growers to market their \nproducts abroad. Another $20 million is provided to help growers of \nfruits and vegetables and other specialty crops combat trade barriers. \nIn addition, $200 million is provided to purchase agriculture products \nfor the School Lunch Program, and products listed as eligible for the \nprogram are potatoes, blueberries, and cranberries, all grown in the \nState.\n  Funding for 15 underserved States, of which Maine is one, is doubled, \nnow set at $20 million annually for fiscal years 2003-2007 for \nmarketing assistance, organic farming, pesticide reduction projects, \nand conservation assistance to help farmers sustain their working \nlands.\n  Somewhat overlooked in the conference report is a newly created title \nthat was included in the Senate-passed bill for energy efficiency and \nconservation, providing $450 million for research on bio-based fuels, a \nFederal biofuels purchasing program and efficiency measures that can \nmake renewable energy the cash crop for the 21st Century.\n  To help decrease the country's reliance on foreign oil imports, a \ncompetitive grant program will support development of biorefineries for \nconversion of biomass into fuels, chemicals and electricity. A \nbiodiesel fuel education program will be funded at $1 million a year. \nThe conference report will also establish a competitive grants program \nfor energy audits and renewable energy\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\ndevelopment assessments for farmers and rural small businesses.\n  In addition, $23 million a year from 2003 to 2007 is provided for a \nloan, loan-guarantee and grant program to help farmers, ranchers and \nrural small businesses purchase renewable energy systems and make \nenergy efficiency improvements. Also authorized is the continuation of \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation bioenergy program and includes animal \nbyproducts and fat, oils and greases as eligible commodities.\n  A competitive grant program is established to support development of \nbiorefineries for conversion of biomass into fuels, chemicals and \nelectricity. A biodiesel fuel education program would be funded at $1 \nmillion a year.\n  Of great interest to many small forest landowners in Maine is a \nprovision in the conference report's forestry title for $100 million in \nobligated funds for the Forest Lands Enhancement Program, which will \nprovide financial and technical assistance to small, private, non-\nindustrial forest landowners for a variety of good management \npractices.\n  The conference report also includes critical increases and updates to \nthe nutritional safety net for America's families. The food stamp \nprogram fulfills an important need for millions of people nationwide \nand, thanks to the $6.3 billion in new dollars over the next 10 years \nfor this program that is included in the conference report, countless \nadditional needy families in Maine will be served by this program.\n  I am certain that I am not alone when I hear complaints from my State \nabout the administrative difficulties and barriers inherent in Federal \nprograms, and the food stamp program is certainly one that has been in \nneed of simplification. The conference report allows States to simplify \nand reduce their reporting requirements, and allows States to use a \ncommon definition of what counts as income similar to other public \nassistance programs, and are two essential components for streamlining \nthe administrative burden associated with these benefits.\n  Through the last farm bill established in 1996, which is better known \nas the Freedom to Farm Act, Congress tried to establish a new system of \nprice and income supports for commodities that would lead to a shift \ntoward a more market-oriented agricultural policy by gradually reducing \nfinancial support. Unfortunately, we had no crystal ball to tell us \nthat export markets and farm prices would decline. This precipitous \nsituation had Congress enacting four different supplemental measures \nfrom 1998 through 2001 that provided an additional $23 billion in non-\ndisaster related farm income commodity assistance. We simply are not \nbeing fiscally responsible by continuing to do commodity farm bills on \nan ad hoc basis, and the conference report will hopefully prevent the \nneed for ad hoc non-disaster supplementals in the future.\n  For the 2002 farm bill, I strongly supported the amendment that \npassed in the Senate farm bill that capped farmers' payment limitations \non commodity crops at $275,000 over the House version that had payments \ncapped at $550,000, and I am not pleased that the limitation was raised \nin conference to $360,000 and the language was weakened on eligibility. \nI do not represent a State that raises an appreciable amount of \ncommodity crops, so I cannot speak to the funding importance for those \nin the heartland of the Nation and in the South, but I do know what is \nimportant for my State and everywhere I look in this Farm Bill \nConference Report in the non-commodity titles, I see funding provisions \nthat will bring opportunities to every corner of the State of Maine.\n  Specifically, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support from \nthe Maine Potato Board be printed in the Record, that expresses my \nfeelings well about how important the increased funding for \nconservation, rural development, and the Market Access Program are to \nMaine. Part of what Don Flannery, executive director said was `` . . \nthere are concerns that we all have with the bill but we also believe \nthere are many direct benefits to Maine potato growers and Maine \nagriculture.''\n  On balance, I would be remiss to the agricultural and conservation \ncommunities in Maine to dismiss this bill or to dismiss President \nBush's commitment to U.S. agriculture to sign the 2002 farm bill into \nlaw. I am casting a yes vote for the rural communities and for the \nfarmers of Maine who are the backbone of the State's economy.\n  There being no objection, the letters was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Maine Potato Board,\n\n                                    Presque Isle, ME, May 8, 2002.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: I would like to take the opportunity to \n     express our support for the Farm Security Act of 2002 ``Farm \n     Bill''. While we understand that there are issues that remain \n     contentious and it does not include some of the programs we \n     had hoped for, the Farms Savings Account to name one, we \n     encourage support of the bill and vote for passage.\n       As I stated, there are concerns that we all have with the \n     bill, but we also believe there are many direct benefits to \n     Maine potato growers and Maine agriculture. If we are to \n     develop new markets for potatoes and potatoes products, \n     export markets will need to be a major area of development. \n     The increased funding in the Market Access Program is a step \n     in the right direction and potentially will benefit the \n     potato industry in Maine. Another element of the bill that \n     will help develop export markets is the Technical Assistance \n     for Specialty Crops (TASC).\n       Conservation is an area that is of the greatest concern for \n     all of agriculture, and this bill will provide an increase in \n     funding to help producers in Maine continue to implement \n     sound conservation practices. The Water Conservation Program \n     will aid agriculture in dealing with an ever increasing \n     demand for water to produce quality crops.\n       The Rural Development Title includes funding under existing \n     programs that will be a benefit to the Maine potato industry \n     and Maine agriculture. To remain competitive in a world \n     market place, we must continue to develop products that meet \n     the consumer's demands. The Value-Added Agriculture Market \n     Development Program will do just that. It will allow Maine \n     producers access to funds to develop value-added agriculture \n     products to meet these demands.\n       Again, I hope you will support the bill; it will have a \n     positive impact on Maine agriculture. If you should have any \n     questions or if I can provide any additional information, \n     please contact me at 207-769-5061.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Donald E. Flannery,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                       Food & Rural Resources,\n\n                                         Augusta, ME, May 6, 2002.\n     Senator Olympia J. Snowe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Olympia: I want to thank you for the time and effort \n     you and your staff spend ensuring the Federal programs and \n     laws work for Maine farmers. This has been especially true \n     over the past year as Congress worked on the Farm Bill.\n       The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 has some \n     flaws, primarily the lack of payment caps and the bias toward \n     growers in the south. However the legislation provides many \n     benefits to Maine agriculture.\n       Whatever disappointment Maine dairy farmers may have over \n     losing the Compact has to be tempered by the provisions \n     establishing the National Dairy Program. Farmers receive a \n     monthly payment of 45 percent of the difference whenever the \n     Class 1 price falls below $16.94. It is retroactive to \n     December 2001. Our calculations show the retroactive clause \n     alone will provide our farmers payments totaling about $3 \n     million.\n       The bill spends $15 million annually on the Senior Farmers' \n     Market Nutrition Program. Implemented in Maine through our \n     Senior FarmShare it has proven wildly successful with both \n     farmers and seniors. This year, with funds from a combination \n     of sources, including U.S. Department of Agriculture, we are \n     providing nearly $1 million worth of locally grown fresh \n     fruit and vegetables to low-income elderly in Maine.\n       Another program with direct benefits to Maine is one I know \n     you have worked on in the past, financial assistance for \n     apple producers who have suffered from low market prices. The \n     bill provides $94 million for losses in the 2000 crop year.\n       The $17.1 billion in conservation funds contained in the \n     bill represents a dramatically increased commitment to the \n     environment.\n       Among the highlights for Maine are $985 million for the \n     Farmland Protection Program, a 20-fold increase. Maine \n     leverages state money with funds from this Federal pot \n     through the Land for Maine's Future Program to preserve open \n     space and keep families on working farms.\n       The bill sets aside $50 million, to continue conservation \n     and risk management programs authorized in the Agricultural \n     Risk Protection Act of 2000. These programs have already \n     provided money to farmers in Maine for irrigation projects \n     and organic certification. Maine is one of the 15 underserved \n     states eligible for these funds.\n       For Maine farmers raising specialty crops, almost all the \n     growers in the state, the bill has a couple of benefits. It \n     substantially increases funding for the Market Access \n     Program, which subsidizes efforts to increase non-branded \n     export promotion. The bill also continues the restrictions on \n     planting fruits and vegetables on program acres, a critical\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\n     restriction for our potato farmers.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this \nweek, with Senator Mary Landrieu, the Nuclear and Terrorism Threat \nReduction Act of 2002 NTTRA. The NTTRA addresses one of the most \nserious security challenges facing the United States today: the \npossibility that a portion of the Russian nuclear weapons arsenal and \nother weapons of mass destruction (WMD) will fall into the hands of \nterrorists or terrorist states.\n  Over a decade after the end of the cold war, Russian still possesses \nabout 95 percent of the world's nuclear weapons and materials outside \nof the United States. These weapons and materials are stored in over \n400 locations across Russia and many are not fully secure. To \nunderstand the need to help the Russians on this front, one fact bears \nnoting: Each year, the Russians spend approximately 2 percent of the \namount that we spend to operate and secure our nuclear weapons arsenal.\n  The members of this body know that addressing this challenge is not a \npartisan issue. It is an issue of deep concern to all Americans. Early \nlast year, a bipartisan task force led by former Sentate majority \nleader and current U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Howard Baker, and former \nWhite House Counsel Lloyd Cutler reached three primary conclusions: \nFirst, the most urgent unmet national security threat to the United \nStates today is the danger that weapons of mass destruction or weapons-\nusable material in Russia can be stolen and sold to terrorists or \nhostile nation States and used against American troops abroad or \ncitizens at home; second, current nonproliferation programs in the \nDepartment of Defense, Department of Energy, and related agencies have \nachieved impressive results thus far, but their limited mandate and \nfunding fall short of what is required to address adequately the \nthreat; and third, the President and the leaders of the 107th Congress \nface the urgent national security challenge of devising an enhanced \nresponse proportionate to the threat.\n  It bears repeating that these conclusions were reached months in \nadvance of the September 11 attacks. This legislation will address each \nof the Baker-Cutler Task Force conclusions.\n  The Bush administration has devoted considerable time and effort to \nincrease cooperation between the United States and Russia on these \nmatters, as exemplified by U.S.-Russia cooperation in the war against \nterrorism, the Bush-Putin summit in November 2001, and the May 2002 \nU.S.-Russia summit in Russia. Also, late last year, the administration \ncompleted a thorough review of U.S. efforts to help Russia secure its \nnuclear and other WMD arsenal. The review concluded that, ``most U.S. \nprograms to assist Russia in threat reduction and nonproliferation work \nwell, are focused on priority tasks, and are well managed.'' At the \ntime, the White House also noted: ``The President has made clear \nrepeatedly that his administration is committed to strong, \neffective cooperation with Russia and the other states of the Former \nSoviet Union to reduce weapons of mass destruction and prevent their \nproliferation.'' The President wisely realizes that only through \ngreater cooperation with Russia can we deal effectively with this \nproblem. The NTTRA supports the President's desire to strengthen U.S.-\nRussia cooperative efforts.\n\n  Senator Landrieu and I are carrying on the tradition of Senators like \nSam Nunn and Richard Lugar, who along with other of our colleagues were \nresponsible for the U.S. effort to help the Russians secure, account \nfor, and, where possible, dispose of their nuclear weapons and other \nWMD. The United States must make every effort to defeat global \nterrorism. One of the most important actions we can take is to deny \nterrorists the means to kill tens of thousands, if not hundreds of \nthousands, of people.\n  The NTTRA will address this serious national security challenge in \nthe following ways:\n  First, the NTTRA states that it is the policy of the United States to \nwork cooperatively with the Russian Federation in order to prevent the \ndiversion of weapons of mass destruction and material, including \nnuclear, biological and chemical weapons, as well as scientific and \ntechnical expertise necessary to design and build weapons of mass \ndestruction. As I noted earlier, the administration's recent review of \nU.S.-Russia programs concluded: ``most U.S. programs to assist Russia \nin threat reduction and nonproliferation work well, are focused on \npriority tasks, and are well managed.'' The NTTRA proposals complement \nthe increases and proposed organizational changes that the Bush \nadministration has proposed for these programs.\n  The NTTRA also calls for the President to deliver to Congress, no \nlater than 6 months after the enactment of the NTTRA, a series of \nrecommendations on how to enhance the implementation of U.S.-Russia \nnon-proliferation and threat reduction programs, including suggestions \non how to improve and streamline the contracting and procurement \npractices of these programs and a list of impediments to the efficient \nand effective implementation of these programs.\n  Second, this bill addresses the shortcomings in the Russian system in \naccounting for nuclear warheads and weapons-grade material: The NTTRA \nstates that it is the policy of the United States to establish with \nRussia comprehensive inventories and data exchanges of Russian and U.S. \nweapons-grade material and assembled warheads with particular attention \nto tactical, or ``non-strategic,'' warheads--one of the most likely \nweapons a terrorist organization or state would attempt to acquire--and \nweapons which have been removed from deployment. Only through such an \naccounting system will we be able to reliably say that Russian warheads \nand materials are sufficiently secure.\n  Third, the NTTRA calls for the establishment of a joint U.S.-Russia \nCommission on the Transition from Mutually Assured Destruction to \nMutually Assured Security. The U.S. side of the Commission would be \ncomposed of private citizens who are experts in the field of U.S.-\nRussia strategic stability. The NTTRA also calls upon the President \nto make every effort to encourage the Russian Government to establish a \ncomplementary Commission that would jointly meet and discuss how to \npreserve strategic stability during this time of rapid and positive \nchange in the U.S.-Russia relationship.\n\n  The United States and Russia have made great strides to reshape our \ncountries' relationship since the end of the cold war. I am encouraged \nby the work of President Bush and President Putin regarding the \nreduction of U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals and I have been pleased \nto see Russia's understanding and support of our war on terrorism. I \nhope that this bill will support our countries' working relationship by \nencouraging further movement towards arms reductions and helping build \ntrust and expand dialogue and cooperation between our nations. This \nrelationship is critical to protecting both Russia and the United \nStates from nuclear terrorism.\n  I call upon the members of this body to join Senator Landrieu and me \nas we work against nuclear terrorism by supporting the Nuclear and \nTerrorism Threat Reduction Act of 2002.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4140-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4140-S4141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in May 1996 \nin Lake Charles, LA. A gay man was robbed and beaten to death after \nbeing\n\n[[Page S4141]]\n\nabducted from a rest stop. The attackers, four men, said that they had \ngone to the rest area to ``roll a queer.''\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4141-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DEATH OF NORMAN JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one of the finest attorneys in the country, \nNorman Johnson, one of the great attorneys and leaders from my home \nstate of Utah, died last Saturday.\n  The loss of Norm is a personal loss to me. He has been one of my best \nfriends. Norm was not only a fine lawyer, a fine businessman, a fine \nhusband and father, a fine Christian, and a wonderful friend.\n  Norm was a partner in one of Utah's most prestigious law firms. He \nwas one of the most informed authorities in the field of securities law \nand nationally recognized both before and after appointment as one of \nthe five commissioners on the United States Security and Exchange \nCommission. As S.E.C. Commissioner, Norm held one of the most \nprestigious and high-level positions in the Federal Government. Norm \nserved well and was highly respected. I know. I watched his service and \nwas so proud of him.\n  Norm loved his wife Carol and his children, all of whom are beautiful \nand exemplary in their own lives. I'm sure they are very grieved at his \ndeath. He was so proud of them.\n  Norm was one of the most soft-spoken people I ever knew. He was kind, \ngenerous to a fault, and a friend to all.\n  We lived in the same neighborhood in Salt Lake City, when I was \nBishop of the Salt Lake Mt. Olympus 10th Ward. We became instant \nfriends and our friendship has endured over thirty years.\n  Norm courageously battled esophageal cancer for a lengthy time. I \nremember visiting him in the hospital many times. He beat one of the \nworst of all cancers and then went on to his exceptional government \nservice. I never heard him complain and he bore his difficulties with \ngrace and humor, but the suffering took its toll.\n  I loved Norm as a brother and have always and will always be a friend \nof his family.\n  His funeral is today and I deeply regret that, because of pressing \nSenate business and an important meeting with the President of the \nUnited States at the White House, I have not been able to attend. My \nbeloved wife, Elaine, will be in attendance. She left for Utah this \nmorning. As usual, Elaine will represent me well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4141-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLESHIP MASSACHUSETTS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to join the people of \nMassachusetts and Navy veterans across the country in celebrating the \n60th anniversary of the Battleship Massachusetts' commission. This \nhistoric ship, the heaviest craft ever launched from Quincy's Fore \nRiver Shipyard, served with distinction in theaters ranging from North \nAfrica to the Marshall Islands, and I join its crew in celebrating the \nanniversary of this storied vessel.\n  The Battleship Massachusetts entered combat on November 8, 1942 in \nOperation Torch on the shores of North Africa and saw its first action \non the shores off Casablanca, Morocco. In that first engagement, the \n16'' shells from the Massachusetts helped sink two destroyers, two \nmerchant ships, visit heavy damage to buildings along the coast, and \nrender a dry dock inoperable. One year later the ship came back to \nBoston for refitting before heading off to a new assignment in the \nPacific, where she would remain for the duration of the war. During its \nPacific service, the Massachusetts engaged the enemy in the New Guinea-\nSolomons in the southwest, raided Japanese bases in the west, and \nhelped invade the Marshall Islands.\n  As the war built to a bloody crescendo the Massachusetts proved \nitself repeatedly. Carrying its nickname of ``Big Mamie,'' the \nMassachusetts took center stage in the preliminary actions against \nOkinawa and Iwo Jima, shelling each island in preparation for the \ndecisive land combat that began the final chapters of the long \nstruggle. Together with the Third Fleet, the Massachusetts approached \nJapan in the summer of 1945. Its engagements at Kamaishi and Hamamatsu \nhelped cripple the country's infrastructure and expedite the war's \nconclusion.\n  After de-activation in 1946, the battleship remained in the Reserve \nFleet until being struck from the Navy record in 1962. Despite being \nordered to be sold for scrap, her wartime crew lobbied to save the ship \nas a memorial. Schoolchildren around Massachusetts rallied for the ship \nnamed for their state, and ``Big Mamie,'' was brought to Fall River in \n1965 as a result of these tireless civic efforts. It now serves as the \ncentral attraction in Fall River's thriving waterfront; standing as a \nreminder of its service and inspiring young people to find their own \nways to serve.\n  Through it all, the ship beared the name of our Commonwealth with a \npride that we match today, and I am honored to join the Navy, the \ncitizens of Fall River, and people across our State in celebrating the \n60th anniversary of the Massachusetts' receiving its \ncommission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4141-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4141-S4142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HONORING DR. GEORGE RUPP, PRESIDENT OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. George \nRupp, a man who has served higher education and the city of New York \nwell over his 9 years as President of Columbia University.\n  As a proud alumnus of Columbia University, I wanted to share with \nMembers of Congress some of the accomplishments of this fine leader, \nand to take this opportunity to salute Dr. Rupp. Columbia is one of the \nnation's most prestigious universities, and under Dr. Rupp's leadership \nit has only grown more so. In every area of the university's existence, \nfrom academic to administrative, fundraising and quality of life, Dr. \nRupp has made a major impact. The legacy he has created sets a new \nstandard in university administration.\n  When he joined the administration in 1993, Dr. Rupp promised to put \nundergraduate education at the center of the institution. He committed \nhis energies and the university's resources to doing precisely that, \nand Columbia College is in a much stronger position as a consequence of \nhis efforts. High school students are applying to Columbia in record \nnumbers and undergraduate admissions have more than doubled since 1993.\n  Dr. Rupp introduced fellowships to attract professors to teach its \ncelebrated core curriculum for undergraduates, anchored by contemporary \ncivilization and humanities literature. Columbia's graduate programs in \nlaw, business, medicine, journalism, and the liberal arts have grown \nmore competitive and are among the best in the world. Over the past \nnine years, four Columbia faculty members have been Nobel prize \nwinners.\n  Columbia has raised its profile in New York City and significantly \nimproved relations with the surrounding communities of Morningside \nHeights, Harlem, and Washington Heights. Dr. Rupp has striven to make \nColumbia a good neighbor and involves community leadership in major \nconstruction projects. He also established a housing assistance program \nto encourage Columbia staff to purchase homes in these neighborhoods, \nwhich are part of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone.\n  Under Dr. Rupp's leadership, the university has added an \narchitecturally distinguished student center, expanded student housing \nand built world-class research facilities. Columbia has also taken over \nthe management of the Biosphere 2 Center in Oracle, AZ to expand the \nscience of its Earth Institute. In addition, he has established the \nInternational Research Institute for Climate Prediction, a facility to \ndirect advances in climate sciences to the benefit of societies around \nthe world.\n  Dr. Rupp, an ordained Presbyterian minister and a religious scholar, \nbecame Dean of Harvard Divinity School\n\n[[Page S4142]]\n\nat age 37, and then president of Rice University and president of \nColumbia University. He is a man of many talents and interests.\n  For all these and many more reasons, I stand now to applaud his \nleadership at Columbia University, his dedication to this great \ninstitution, and to wish him great luck in the future. Columbia today \nembodies substantial forward momentum and is poised to achieve further \nadvances in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4142-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO RICHARD M. SCULLION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, I would like to honor the \nlife of a dedicated public servant, Richard M. Scullion. Dick passed \naway at the end of April following a brief illness.\n  Dick started out as a farmer near Highland, WI. He married his wife, \nMarian, in 1945, and worked to raise their family. In the 1950s, during \na typical Wisconsin blizzard, friends of Dick's nominated him to serve \non the Iowa County Board and in 1965, he became the chair of the board, \na seat he would hold until 2000. At that time, he was the longest \nserving County Chair in Wisconsin history. Dick simultaneously served \nas the Highland township chairman and as a member of the Memorial \nHospital of Iowa County Board.\n  In addition to his over 40 years of service to Iowa County, Dick \ndemonstrated a strong commitment to his home state. He was a member of \nthe Wisconsin State Soil and Water Conservation Board, Committee Land \nPreservation Board, Water Resources Committee, Wisconsin River Rail \nTransit Commission, Farmland Preservation Board, and was the chairman \nof the Southwest Regional Planning Commission.\n  His work made him an invaluable citizen of the State of Wisconsin; he \nwas recognized for his achievements in 1995, when the Iowa County \nCourthouse addition was named in his honor. Dick was also named the \nSoil Conservationist of the Year in 1976 and received the Wisconsin \nMaster Agriculturist Award in 1979. In 1983, the University of \nWisconsin College of Agriculture and Life Sciences awarded him an \nhonorary degree.\n  Dick Scullion was an important part of Iowa County, and the State of \nWisconsin, and will hold a special place in our State's history. He \nwill be dearly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4142-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF ALDRED AMES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

For \nover two decades Mr. Ames has made a positive impact in virtually every \none of Idaho's 201 incorporated communities, 44 counties, and 5 tribal \nnations. He has brought not only technical expertise and access to \nfinancial resources, but perhaps even more important a positive \nattitude that kept his constituents in economic distress from giving up \nhope.\n  Government employees are often accused of being process oriented \nrather than results oriented. Mr. Ames, with his single-minded focus on \nresults, is an excellent example of the kind of Federal employee of \nwhom we should all be proud.\n  As he is about to retire, I congratulate Mr. Ames on his outstanding \nrecord of accomplishment and wish him every success in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4142-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII MEN'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. INOUYE.

The Warrior Volleyball squad made history by \nwinning the first National Championship for any men's athletic program \nat the University of Hawaii.\n  I salute all of the athletes and coaches of the NCAA Championship \ntournament. I commend them for their sacrifice and determination; they \nshould all be proud of their achievements as student-athletes.\n  I also commend the people of Hawaii for their support of the \nUniversity's athletic programs. Indeed, they are the greatest \nvolleyball fans in the nation.\n  The success of the men's volleyball team is indicative of the depth \nof the community's support, and the caliber of students, faculty, and \nstaff at the University. As our nation's only public institution of \nhigher learning in the Pacific, the University of Hawaii has many \nunique strengths and comparative advantages. It offers premiere \nscience, math, business, art, social science, and, as it has now \ndemonstrated irrefutably, athletic programs. The people of Hawaii \nshould be proud of their University.\n  I applaud Head Coach Mike Wilton who, for the past decade, has worked \ntirelessly to successfully build and strengthen the men's volleyball \nprogram, and I commend the members of his coaching staff for their \ncommitment to preparing the athletes for success both on and off the \ncourt.\n  Finally, I extend my sincerest congratulations to the Warrior \nVolleyball players for capturing the national title.

Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me today \nin acknowledging the retirement of Inspector Frederich A Greenslate of \nWest Bloomfield, MI, who retired on April 27th of this year after \nserving in the Michigan State Police for 41 years. Mr. Greenslate is \none of the longest serving officers in departmental history and people \nwill be gathering on May 17th to celebrate his distinguished career.\n  I cannot overstate the debt we owe our men and women in uniform for \nputting their lives on the line as guardians of peace. Every day they \nprotect the people of our great Nation and keep our cities safe. \nFrederich Greenslate has been part of this great tradition of service, \ndedication and honor.\n  Mr. Greenslate joined the Michigan State Police in 1961 after \nreceiving an Associate's Degree in Criminal Justice from Macomb \nCommunity College. Originally posted as a Trooper at the Newaygo Post, \nhe moved up the ranks and concluded his career as an Assistant District \nCommander in the 2nd District Headquarters. Over this period, he \nreceived four Meritorious Citations for service above the call of duty \nas well as an Unit Citation. He also assisted with several events of \nnational and international significance including the visit of Pope \nJohn Paul II to Detroit, Super Bowl XVI, United States Cup Soccer, \nWorld Cup Soccer, The Detroit Grand Prix, and the National Governors' \nConference.\n  Despite the long hours and stressful atmosphere associated with being \na police officer, Mr. Greenslate has been devoted husband to his wife \nSusan and father of six children: Adam, Bethany, Douglas, Jason, \nJeffrey, and Melanie. In addition, his children have blessed him with \nthree grandchildren, Jack, Joe, and Connor. He is also a member of the \nSouth-East, Oakland County, Macomb County, Wayne County, and St. Clair \nCounty Police Chief's Associations.\n  Our Nation's public servants play a vital role in preserving the \npublic good. However, few public servants do more to ensure our \nNation's peace and stability than our police officers. I know my Senate \nColleagues will join me in thanking Mr. Greenslate for his \ndistinguished career as a Michigan State Trooper and wish him well in \nthe years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4142-5", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4142-S4143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE GIRL SCOUTS OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in recognition of the 90th \nAnniversary of\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\nthe Girl Scouts of America. The Girl Scout tradition began on March 12, \n1912, when founder Juliette Gordon Low assembled 18 girls in Savannah, \nGA for the first-ever Girl Scout meeting. Today, the organization \noffers girls of all races, ages, ethnicities, socioeconomic \nbackgrounds, and abilities the chance to thrive by building the real-\nlife skills they will need as adults.\n  I am especially honored to acknowledge the activities of the Girl \nScouts of Rhode Island, which currently serves over 13,700 girls in my \nhome State and several bordering towns of Massachusetts and \nConnecticut. The Girl Scouts of Rhode Island has created several \nenriching programs and activities over the years that truly help girls \ngrow strong. One such programs is Girls on the Go, which serves low-\nincome girls at free lunch sites throughout the State during the summer \nmonths, allowing them to participate in Girl Scout activities. Other \nexamples include the City Summer Camps program in both Providence and \nCentral Falls which provides 6 weeks of training and recreational \nactivities, and the Girls at the Center program which has provided \nnumerous scouts and adults with opportunities to explore science and \ntechnology.\n  I am truly proud of the achievements of the Rhode Island Girl Scouts \nand their mission to help young women achieve high ideals of character, \nconduct, patriotism and service. I wish them continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4143-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT TO RESTORE NONDISCRIMINATORY TRADE TREATMENT (NORMAL TRADE \n       RELATIONS TREATMENT) TO THE PRODUCTS OF AFGHANISTAN--PM 83\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on May 3, 2002, during the recess of the \nSenate, received the following message from the President of the United \nStates, together with an accompanying report; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Public Law 99-190, 99 Stat. 1319, which took effect on December 19, \n1985, authorized the President to deny normal trade relations (NTR) \ntariff treatment to the products of Afghanistan. On January 31, 1986, \nPresident Reagan issued a proclamation denying NTR treatment to \nAfghanistan.\n  I have determined that it is appropriate to restore NTR treatment to \nthe products of Afghanistan.

A bill to provide for global pathogen surveillance and \nresponse; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Senator Helms and I are proud to introduce \ntoday the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act of 2002. Senator Helms is \nrecovering from his heart surgery and is unable to be here today, but \nlet me note our joint efforts in recognizing the importance of disease \nsurveillance and preparing this bill for introduction. In recent years, \nwe have joined forces on a number of sensible foreign policy \ninitiatives and I am proud that we are doing so once again. I am also \nespecially pleased that Senators Kennedy and Frist, the chairman and \nranking member of the Public Health Subcommittee of the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, have also agreed to be \noriginal cosponsors of this bill.\n  This bill authorizes $150 million over the next 2 years to provide \nassistance to developing nations to improve global disease surveillance \nto help prevent and contain both biological weapons attacks and \nnaturally occurring infectious disease outbreaks around the world. As \nthe ranking member and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nrespectively, Senator Helms and I recognize all too well that \nbiological weapons are a global threat with no respect for borders. A \nterrorist group could launch a biological weapons attack in Mexico in \nthe expectation that the epidemic would quickly spread to the United \nStates. A rogue state might experiment with new disease strains in \nanother country, intending later to release them here. A biological \nweapons threat need not begin in the United States to reach our shores.\n  For that reason, our response to the biological weapons threat cannot \nbe limited to the United States alone. Global disease surveillance, a \nsystematic approach to tracking disease outbreaks as they occur and \nevolve around the world, is essential to any real international \nresponse.\n  This country is making enormous advances on the domestic front in \nbioterrorism defense. $3 billion has been appropriated for this purpose \nin FY 2002, including $1.1 billion to improve State and local public \nhealth infrastructure. Delaware's share will include $6.7 million from \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to improve the public \nhealth infrastructure and $548,000 to improve hospital readiness in my \nState.\n  The House and Senate are currently in conference to reconcile \ncompeting versions of a comprehensive bioterrorism bill drafted last \nfall following the anthrax attacks via the U.S. postal system. Those \nattacks, which killed five individuals and infected more than twenty \npeople, highlighted our domestic vulnerabilities to a biological \nweapons attack. We need to further strengthen our Nation's public \nhealth system, improve Federal public health laboratories, and fund the \nnecessary research and procurement for vaccines and treatments to \nrespond better to future bioterrorist attacks. As an original co-\nsponsor of the Senate bill, I know the final package taking shape in \nconference will achieve those goals and I look forward to its enactment \ninto law.\n  Nevertheless, any effective response to the challenge of biological \nweapons must also have an international component. Limiting our \nresponse to U.S. territory would be shortsighted and doomed to failure. \nA dangerous pathogen released on another continent can quickly spread \nto the United States in a matter of days, if not hours. This is the \ndark side of globalization. International trade, travel, and migration \npatterns offer unlimited opportunities for pathogens to spread across \nnational borders and to move from one continent to another. Moreover, \nan overseas epidemic could give us our first warning of a new disease \nstrain that was developed by a country or by terrorists for use as a \nbiological weapon, or that could be used by others for that purpose.\n  We should make no mistake: in today's world, all infectious disease \nepidemics, wherever they occur and whether they are deliberately \nengineered or are naturally occurring, are a potential threat to all \nnations, including the United States.\n  How does disease surveillance fit into all of this? A biological \nweapons attack succeeds partly through the element of surprise. As Dr. \nAlan P. Zelicoff of the Sandia National Laboratory testified before the \nForeign Relations Committee in March, early warning of a biological \nweapons attact can prevent illness and death in all but a small \nfraction of those infected. A cluster of flu-like symptoms in a city or \nregion may be dismissed by individual physicians as just the flu when \nin fact it may be anthrax, plague, or another biological weapon. Armed \nwith the knowledge, however, that a biological weapons attack has in \nfact occurred, doctors and nurses can examine their patients in a \ndifferent light and, in many cases, effectively treat infected \nindividuals.\n  Disease surveillance, a comprehensive reporting system to quickly \nidentify and communicate abnormal patterns of symptoms and illnesses, \ncan quickly alert doctors across a region that a suspicious disease \noutbreak has occurred. Epidemiological specialists can then investigate \nand combat the outbreak. And if it's a new disease or strain, we can \nbegin to develop treatments that much earlier.\n  A good surveillance system requires trained epidemiological \npersonnel, adequate laboratory tools for quick diagnosis, and \ncommunications equipment to circulate information. Even in the United \nStates today, many States and localities rely on old-fashioned pencil \nand paper methods of tracking disease patterns. Thankfully, we are \naddressing those domestic deficiencies through the bioterrorism bill in \nconference.\n  For example, in Delaware, we are developing the first, comprehensive, \nstate-wide electronic reporting system for infectious diseases. This \nsystem will be used as a prototype for other states, and will enable \nmuch earlier detection of infectious disease outbreaks, both natural \nand bioterrorist. I and my congressional colleagues in the delegation \nhave been working for over two years to get this project up and \nrunning, and we were successful in obtaining $2.6 million in funding \nfor this\n\n[[Page S4148]]\n\nproject over the past 2 years. I and my colleagues have requested $1.4 \nmillion for additional funding in FY 2003, and we are extremely \noptimistic that this funding will be forthcoming.\n\n  It is vitally important that we extend these initiatives into the \ninternational arena. However, as many developing countries are way \nbehind us in terms of public health resources, laboratories, personnel, \nand communications, these countries will need help just to get to the \nstarting point we have already reached in this country.\n  An effective disease surveillance system is beneficial even in the \nabsence of biological weapons attacks. Bubonic plague is bubonic \nplague, whether it is deliberately engineered or naturally occurring. \nJust as disease surveillance can help contain a biological weapons \nattack, it can also help contain a naturally occurring outbreak of \ninfectious disease. According to the World Health Organization, 30 new \ninfectious diseases have emerged over the past thirty years; between \n1996 and 2001 alone, more than 800 infectious disease outbreaks \noccurred around the world, on every continent. With better \nsurveillance, we can do a better job of mitigating the consequences of \nthese disease outbreaks.\n  In 2000, the World Health Organization established the first truly \nglobal disease surveillance system, the Global Alert and Response \nNetwork, to monitor and track infectious disease outbreaks in every \nregion of the world. The WHO has done an impressive job so far with \nthis initiative, working on a shoestring budget. But this global \nnetwork is only as good as its components, individual nations. \nUnfortunately, developing nations, those nations most likely to \nexperience rapid disease outbreaks, simply do not possess the trained \npersonnel, the laboratory equipment, or the public health \ninfrastructure to track evolving disease patterns and detect emerging \npathogens.\n  According to a report by the National Intelligence Council, \ndeveloping nations in Africa and Asia have established only rudimentary \nsystems, if any at all, for disease surveillance, response, and \nprevention. The World Health Organization reports that more than sixty \npercent of laboratory equipment in developing countries is either \noutdated or non-functioning.\n  This lack of preparedness can lead to tragic results. In August 1994 \nin Surat, a city in western India, a surge of complaints on flea \ninfestation and a growing rat population was followed by a cluster of \nreports on patients exhibiting the symptoms of pneumonic plague. \nHowever, authorities were unable to connect the dots until the plague \nhad spread to seven states across India, ultimately killing 56 people \nand costing the Indian economy $600 million. Had the Indian authorities \nemployed better surveillance tools, they may well have contained the \nepidemic, limited the loss of life, and surely avoided the panic that \nled to economically disastrous embargoes on trade and travel. An \noutbreak of pneumonic plague in India this February was detected more \nquickly and contained with only a few deaths, and no costly panic.\n  Developing nations are the weak links in any comprehensive global \ndisease surveillance network. Unless we take action to shore up their \ncapabilities to detect and contain disease outbreaks, we leave the \nentire world vulnerable to a deliberate biological weapons attack or a \nvirulent natural epidemic.\n  It is for these reasons that Senator Helms and I have worked together \nin recent months to craft the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act of 2002. \nThis bill will authorize $150 million in FY 2003 and FY 2004 to \nstrengthen the disease surveillance capabilities of developing nations. \nFirst, the bill seeks to ensure in developing nations a greater number \nof personnel trained in basic epidemiological techniques. It offers \nenhanced in-country training for medical and laboratory personnel and \nthe opportunity for select personnel to come to the United States to \nreceive training in our Centers for Disease Control laboratories and \nMaster of Public Health programs in American universities. Second, the \nbill provides assistance to developing nations to acquire basic \nlaboratory equipment, including items as mundane as microscopes, to \nfacilitate the quick diagnosis of pathogens. Third, the bill enables \ndeveloping nations to obtain communications equipment to quickly \ntransmit data on disease patterns and pathogen diagnoses, both inside a \nnation and to regional organizations and the WHO. Again, we're not \ntalking about fancy high-tech equipment, but basics like fax machines \nand Internet-equipped computers. Finally, the bill gives preference to \ncountries that agree to let experts from the United States or \ninternational organizations investigate any suspicious disease \noutbreaks.\n\n  If passed, the Global Pathogen Surveillance Act of 2002 will go a \nlong way in ensuring that developing nations acquire the basic disease \nsurveillance capabilities to link up effectively with the WHO's global \nnetwork. This bill offers an inexpensive and common sense solution to a \nproblem of global proportions, the dual threat of biological weapons \nand naturally occurring infectious diseases. The funding authorized is \nonly a tiny fraction of what we will spend domestically on bioterrorism \ndefenses, but this investment will pay enormous dividends in terms of \nour national security.\n  Let me close with an excerpt of testimony from the Foreign Relations \nCommittee hearing last September on bioterrorism. Dr. D.A. Henderson, \nthe man who spearheaded the successful international campaign to \neradicate smallpox in the 1970's, recently stepped down from a short-\nterm position as the director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness \nin the Department of Health and Human Services. In that position, he \nwas vested with the responsibility for helping organize the U.S. \ngovernment's response to future bioterrorist attacks. Dr. Henderson, \nwho at the time of the hearing was the head of the Johns Hopkins \nUniversity Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies, was very clear on \nthe value of global disease surveillance:\n\n       In cooperation with the WHO and other countries, we need to \n     strengthen greatly our intelligence gathering capability. A \n     focus on international surveillance and on scientist-to-\n     scientist communication will be necessary if we are to have \n     an early warning about the possible development and \n     production of biological weapons by rogue nations or groups.\n\n  Dr. Henderson is exactly right. We cannot leave the rest of the world \nto fend for itself in combating biological weapons and infectious \ndiseases if we are to ensure America's security.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Global Pathogen \nSurveillance Act of 2002 be printed in the the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2487\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Pathogen Surveillance \n     Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Bioterrorism poses a grave national security threat to \n     the United States. The insidious nature of the threat, the \n     likely delayed recognition in the event of an attack, and the \n     underpreparedness of the domestic public health \n     infrastructure may produce catastrophic consequences \n     following a biological weapons attack upon the United States.\n       (2) A contagious pathogen engineered as a biological weapon \n     and developed, tested, produced, or released in another \n     country can quickly spread to the United States. Given the \n     realities of international travel, trade, and migration \n     patterns, a dangerous pathogen released anywhere in the world \n     can spread to United States territory in a matter of days, \n     before any effective quarantine or isolation measures can be \n     implemented.\n       (3) To effectively combat bioterrorism and ensure that the \n     United States is fully prepared to prevent, diagnose, and \n     contain a biological weapons attack, measures to strengthen \n     the domestic public health infrastructure and improve \n     domestic surveillance and monitoring, while absolutely \n     essential, are not sufficient.\n       (4) The United States should enhance cooperation with the \n     World Health Organization, regional health organizations, and \n     individual countries to help detect and quickly contain \n     infectious disease outbreaks or bioterrorism agents before \n     they can spread.\n       (5) The World Health Organization (WHO) has done an \n     impressive job in monitoring infectious disease outbreaks \n     around the world, particularly with the establishment in \n     April 2000 of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response network.\n       (6) The capabilities of the World Health Organization are \n     inherently limited in that its\n\n[[Page S4149]]\n\n     disease surveillance and monitoring is only as good as the \n     data and information the World Health Organization receives \n     from member countries and are further limited by the narrow \n     range of diseases (plague, cholera, and yellow fever) upon \n     which its disease surveillance and monitoring is based, and \n     the consensus process used by the World Health Organization \n     to add new diseases to the list. Developing countries in \n     particular often cannot devote the necessary resources to \n     build and maintain public health infrastructures.\n       (7) In particular, developing countries could benefit \n     from--\n       (A) better trained public health professionals and \n     epidemiologists to recognize disease patterns;\n       (B) appropriate laboratory equipment for diagnosis of \n     pathogens;\n       (C) disease reporting that is based on symptoms and signs \n     (known as ``syndrome surveillance'') enabling the earliest \n     possible opportunity to conduct an effective response;\n       (D) a narrowing of the existing technology gap in syndrome \n     surveillance capabilities, based on reported symptoms, and \n     real-time information dissemination to public health \n     officials; and\n       (E) appropriate communications equipment and information \n     technology to efficiently transmit information and data \n     within national and regional health networks, including \n     inexpensive, Internet-based Geographic Information Systems \n     (GIS) for early recognition and diagnosis of diseases.\n       (8) An effective international capability to monitor and \n     quickly diagnose infectious disease outbreaks will offer \n     dividends not only in the event of biological weapons \n     development, testing, production, and attack, but also in the \n     more likely cases of naturally occurring infectious disease \n     outbreaks that could threaten the United States. Furthermore, \n     a robust surveillance system will serve to deter terrorist \n     use of biological weapons, as early detection will help \n     mitigate the intended effects of such malevolent uses.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To enhance the capability of the international \n     community, through the World Health Organization and \n     individual countries, to detect, identify, and contain \n     infectious disease outbreaks, whether the cause of those \n     outbreaks is intentional human action or natural in origin.\n       (2) To enhance the training of public health professionals \n     and epidemiologists from eligible developing countries in \n     advanced Internet-based syndrome surveillance systems, in \n     addition to traditional epidemiology methods, so that they \n     may better detect, diagnose, and contain infectious disease \n     outbreaks, especially those due to pathogens most likely to \n     be used in a biological weapons attack.\n       (3) To provide assistance to developing countries to \n     purchase appropriate public health laboratory equipment \n     necessary for infectious disease surveillance and diagnosis.\n       (4) To provide assistance to developing countries to \n     purchase appropriate communications equipment and information \n     technology, including appropriate computer equipment and \n     Internet connectivity mechanisms, to facilitate the exchange \n     of Geographic Information Systems-based syndrome surveillance \n     information and to effectively gather, analyze, and transmit \n     public health information for infectious disease surveillance \n     and diagnosis.\n       (5) To make available greater numbers of United States \n     Government public health professionals to international \n     health organizations, regional health networks, and United \n     States diplomatic missions where appropriate.\n       (6) To establish ``lab-to-lab'' cooperative relationships \n     between United States public health laboratories and \n     established foreign counterparts.\n       (7) To expand the training and outreach activities of \n     overseas United States laboratories, including Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention and Department of Defense \n     entities, to enhance the public health capabilities of \n     developing countries.\n       (8) To provide appropriate technical assistance to existing \n     regional health networks and, where appropriate, seed money \n     for new regional networks.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleagues Senators \nBiden, Helms, and Kennedy in introducing the Global Pathogen \nSurveillance Act of 2002. This bipartisan legislation will help ensure \nthat we are better prepared globally to deal with biological threats \nand attacks.\n  The Global Pathogen Surveillance Act of 2002 authorizes enhanced \nbilateral and multilateral activities to improve the capacity of the \nUnited States and our partners in the international community to detect \nand contain infectious diseases and biological weapons. The Global \nPathogen Surveillance Act will enhance the training, upgrade equipment \nand communications systems, and provide additional American expertise \nand assistance in international surveillance.\n  To better prepare our nation to meet the growing threat of \nbioterrorism, we must put in place and maintain a comprehensive \nframework including prevention, preparedness and consequence \nmanagement. To accomplish this goal, we not only need to strengthen our \nlocal public health infrastructure domestically, but to work with our \nfriends and neighbors in the global community to prevent, detect, and \nappropriately contain and respond to bioterrorist activities outside \nour borders. This is truly a global responsibility. Infectious \ndiseases, such as smallpox, do not respect borders. If we can prevent \ntheir spread in other countries around the world, we can better protect \nour citizens here at home.\n  I applaud Senators Helms and Biden for their leadership in this area. \nI look forward to working with them, and all of my colleagues to ensure \nthat we provide appropriate authorities and funding to improve our \ninternational efforts to detect and contain infectious diseases and \noffensive biological threats.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. \n        Breaux):\n  S. 2489.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nensure the quality of, and access to, skilled nursing facility services \nunder the Medicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to join my \ncolleague, Senator Torricelli, in introducing the Medicare Skilled \nNursing Beneficiary Protection Act of 2002, a bill that will bring \nbetter care to thousands of Oregon seniors.\n  Nursing homes across America are in trouble, and it's not just Wall \nStreet analysts who will tell you that. The people who rely on nursing \nhome services the most can share with you their concerns about the \nfuture of skilled nursing care. Impending cuts to Medicare benefits for \nskilled nursing facilities will jeopardize the health and safety of \nsome of our most vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities, and \nwe cannot in good conscience allow these cuts to occur. The Medicare \nSkilled Nursing Beneficiary Protection Act of 2002 will prevent cuts to \nMedicare funding for nursing homes and will ensure that Medicare pays \nfor the full cost of care rather than short-changing nursing \nfacilities.\n  This bill will be particularly important for Oregon. My State of \nOregon is home to an ever growing population of senior citizens, and we \nare predicted to be the 4th oldest State in the union by the year 2020. \nAs our citizens age, and I am among that aging group, it will be \nessential that we have the capacity to care for our most needy seniors. \nUnfortunately, instead of increasing capacity we are seeing skilled \nnursing facilities close all over the country. This could have \ndisastrous consequences for an already over-taxed health care system.\n  Without the Medicare Skilled Nursing Beneficiary Protection Act, \nOregon's nursing homes will lose $37.58 per patient per day, and it is \ndifficult to offer high quality services under those circumstances. We \nmust work together to pass this important legislation to protect our \nseniors, and to ensure that skilled nursing facilities will still be \nthere when the rest of us need them in only a few short years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 2491. A bill to authorize the President to award a gold medal on \nbehalf of Congress to the Choctaw and Comanche code talkers in \nrecognition of the contributions provided by those individuals to the \nUnited States; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill to honor \na group of men who bravely served this country. I am proud to recognize \nthe Choctaw and Comanche Code Talkers who joined the United States \nArmed Forces on foreign soil in the fight for freedom in two world \nwars.\n  During World War I, the Germans began tapping American lines, \ncreating the need to provide secure communications. Despite the fact \nthat American Indians were not citizens, 18 members of the Choctaw \nNation enlisted to become the first American Indian soldiers to use \ntheir native language to transmit messages between the Allied forces.\n  At least one Choctaw man was placed in each field company \nheadquarters. He would translate radio messages into the Choctaw \nlanguage and then write field orders to be carried by messengers \nbetween different companies on the battle line. Fortunately, because \nChoctaw was an unwritten language only understood by those who spoke \nit, the Germans were never able to break the code.\n  The 18 Choctaw Code Talkers who served in the 142nd Infantry Company \nof the 36th Division were: Albert Billy, Victor Brown, Mitchell Bobb, \nBen Carterby, George Davenport, Joe Davenport, James Edwards, Tobias \nFrazier, Ben Hampton, Noel Johnson, Otis Leader, Soloman Louis, Pete \nMaytubby, Jeff Nelson, Joseph Oklahombi, Robert Taylor, Walter Veach, \nand Calvin Wilson.\n  Similarly, the Comanche Code Talkers played an important role during \nWorld War II. Once again, the enemy began tapping American lines. In \norder to establish the secure transmission of messages, the United \nStates enlisted fourteen Comanche Code Talkers who served overseas in \nthe 4th Signal Company of the 4th Infantry Division. They were: Charles \nChibitty, Haddon Codynah, Robert Holder, Forrest Kassanavoid, \nWellington Mihecoby, Albert Nahquaddy, Jr., Clifford Ototivo, Simmons \nParker, Melvin Permansu, Elgin Red Elk, Roderick Red Elk, Larry \nSaupitty, Morris Tabbyetchy, and Willis Yackeshi.\n  The Army chose the Comanches because their language was thought to be \nthe least known to the Germans. Second Lieutenant Hugh Foster worked \nwith them to develop their own unique code for military words. He gave \nthe Indians a list of military words and then worked with them to \ndevelop a Comanche word or phrase for those words.\n  On June 6, 1944, just after landing in Normandy, a Comanche trained \nby Lt. Foster and serving as a driver and radio operator under \nBrigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr, sent one of the first \nmessages from Utah Beach. These communications efforts, by the \nComanches, helped the Allies win the war in Europe.\n  It is time Congress officially recognizes these men. My bill directs \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to award the Choctaw and Comanche Code \nTalkers a gold medal as a result of their great commitment and service \non behalf of the United States during World Wars I and II. I welcome my \ncolleagues to join me in saluting this group of heroes for contributing \nto the fight for freedom for our country and around the world.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND:\n  S. 2492. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to require that \nagencies, in promulgating rules, take into consideration the impact of \nsuch rules on the privacy of individuals, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Federal Agency Protection of Privacy Act, that will require Federal \nagencies to carefully consider the impact of proposed regulations on \nindividual privacy. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, we are being forced to fight a new kind of war; a war in \nwhich we have not only physical battlefields, but battlefields of \nprinciple.\n  Not only must we have troops on the ground protecting our physical \nwell-being, but we must also insure that we protect the American way of \nlife. Ours is a country based on individual rights--rights to pursue \nlife, liberty, and happiness, as Thomas Jefferson mentioned in the \nmanner in which each of us sees fit.\n  While we are obligated, as a Government, to protect the physical \nsafety of the American people, we also are obligated to remember our \nhistory, our struggles, and the principles for which our great Nation \nstands. While we enhance and strengthen our investigatory tools and \nphysical arsenal, we cannot allow the terrorists to prevail in \nundermining our civil liberties.\n\n  Therefore, today, I am introducing the Federal Agency Protection of \nPrivacy Act in the Senate as companion legislation to H.R. 4561, which \nwas introduced by Representative Bob Barr, a long-time champion of \ncivil liberties in the U.S. Congress. It will impose a mandate that \nwhen Federal agencies are required to publish a general notice of \nproposed rulemaking, they must publish an accompanying ``privacy impact \nstatement.'' This initial privacy\n\n[[Page S4154]]\n\nimpact statement, written in terms which all of us can understand, \nwould be subject to public notice and comment. After receiving \nand evaluating any comments, the agency would then be required to \ninclude a final privacy impact statement with the regulation.\n\n  These initial and final privacy impact statements would include: the \ntype of information to be collected and how it would be used; \nmechanisms through which individuals could correct inaccuracies in the \ncollected information; assurances that the information would not be \nused for a purpose other than initially specified; and a description of \nhow the information will be secured by the agency. For example, the \nFinancial Crime Enforcement Network of the Department of the Treasury \nhas proposed a rule implementing provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act of \n2001 which would encourage financial institutions and Federal law \nenforcement agencies to share information in order to identify and \ndeter money laundering and terrorist activity. While I fully support \nthe Patriot Act and recognize the benefits of such a rule, the \nsensitivity of such information necessitates that we insure that the \nagency consider the ramifications of such an invasion on an \nindividual's privacy. The American people must know specifically how \nthis financial information would be used and how it would be protected. \nThe purpose, importance, and timeliness of this legislation have \nbrought together a wide variety of supporting organizations, ranging \nfrom the American Civil Liberties Union to the National Rifle \nAssociation to Public Citizen.\n\n  While I have been and continue to be a strong supporter of the war on \nterrorism, I am also well aware that we face a multi-faceted enemy. My \nexperience has taught me that diverse threats necessitate diverse \nresponses. We have planned for our offensives on the ground and in the \nair, and we have begun to mount a stronger homeland defense. But our \nefforts will be incomplete and will indeed run the risk of undermining \nall else we may accomplish in the fight against terrorism if we neglect \nto mount a successful defense of the American way. I believe that this \nlegislation is necessary to protect the American people from attacks \nseen and unseen, and I encourage other Senators to join me in \nprotecting the liberties for which I know we all stand.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2492\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Agency Protection of \n     Privacy Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the immigration and Nationality Act to \nprovide a limited extension of the program under section 245(i) of that \nAct; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, yesterday, the House passed the border \nsecurity legislation, and I expect it will become law very soon. \nPassage of the border security bill was an important first step in \nmoving forward with comprehensive immigration reform, and it was one of \nthe Democratic Principles that Representative Gephardt and I introduced \nlast fall.\n  Unfortunately, another important provision was not included in the \nborder security legislation, the extension of section 245(i). It would \nallow families to stay together in this country while waiting to become \npermanent residents.\n  As I have said on many occasions, I am strongly committed to a \nmeaningful 245(i) extension. Regrettably, the House waited 6 months to \nact on 245(i) legislation that the Senate passed last September. This \ndelay meant that key provisions in the bill became unworkable. The \nHouse-passed version contained hard deadlines that would have required \napplicants to have established familial or employment relationships \nbefore August 2001. These deadlines would have imposed impractical \nhurdles for immigrant families to overcome.\n  Today, I am pleased to announce that I am introducing a new 245(i) \nextension bill that would remove these hard deadlines. My bill would \nmove the application deadline to April 30, 2003, and maintain current \nprohibitions against fraudulent marriages and national security \nprotections.\n  This bill mirrors the version that was introduced by Senators Hagel \nand Kennedy last spring, and it should receive strong bipartisan \nsupport. I know both the President and Senator Lott have repeatedly \nexpressed their desire to pass 245(i) legislation. It is my hope that \nthey will work with me to help get it passed very soon.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2493\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Uniting Families Act of \n     2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. LIMITED EXTENSION OF SECTION 245(I) PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Extension of Filing Deadline.--Section 245(i)(1)(B)(i) \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1255(i)(1)(B)(i)) is amended by striking ``on or before April \n     30, 2001'' and inserting ``on or before April 30, 2003''.\n       (b) Exclusion of Certain Inadmissible and Deportable \n     Aliens.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall not apply \n     to any alien who is--\n       (1) inadmissible under section 212(a)(3), or deportable \n     under section 237(a)(4), of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act (relating to security and related grounds); or\n       (2) deportable under section 237(a)(1)(G) of such Act \n     (relating to marriage fraud).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to applicants for adjustment of status who are \n     beneficaries of petitions for classification or applications \n     for labor certifications filed before, on, or after the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n\n\n[[Page S4156]]\n\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, since September 11, Congress has taken \nsignificant steps to strengthen the security of our borders and improve \nour immigration system. Last month, the Senate passed important \nlegislation to strengthen border security, improve our ability to \nscreen foreign nationals, and enhance our ability to deter potential \nterrorists. In addition, Senator Brownback and I recently introduced \nlegislation to restructure the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nso that the agency is better prepared to address security concerns.\n  As we work to respond to the security issues before us, we can't lose \nsight of the other immigration issues that are still a priority. I'm \npleased to join Senator Daschle in moving forward with one of those \nissues today by introducing the Uniting Families Act of 2002. This \nlegislation extends section 245(i), a vital provision of U.S. \nimmigration law which allows individuals who already legally qualify \nfor permanent residency to process their applications in the United \nStates, without returning to their homes countries.\n  Without 245(i), immigrants are forced to leave their families here in \nthe U.S. and risk separation from them for up to 10 years. Seventy-five \npercent of the people who have used 245(i) are the spouses and children \nof U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Extending this critical \nprovision will help keep families together and help businesses retain \ncritical workers. In addition, the INS will receive millions of dollars \nin additional revenues, at no cost to taxpayers.\n  Extending 245(i) does not provide any loopholes for potential \nterrorists. Instead, it will improve the monitoring of immigrants \nalready residing in this country. Individuals who qualify for permanent \nresidency and process their applications in the U.S. are subject to \nrigorous background checks and interviews. This process provides the \ngovernment a good opportunity to investigate individuals who are in \nthis country and determine whether they should be allowed to remain \nhere.\n  Section 245(i) does not provide amnesty to immigrants or any benefits \nto anyone suspected of marriage fraud. The provision provides no \nprotection from deportation if someone is here illegally and no right \nto surpass other immigrants waiting for visas.\n  The House passed legislation recently to extend section 245(i), but \nit was too restrictive to provide any meaningful assistance. The \nUniting Families Act will extend the filing deadline to April 30, 2003, \nand provide needed and well-deserved relief to members of our immigrant \ncommunities.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this needed extension.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 2494. A bill to revise the boundary of the Petrified Forest \nNational Park in the State of Arizona and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nauthorize expansion of the Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona.\n  The Petrified Forest National Park is a national treasure among the \nNation's parks, renowned for its large concentration of highly colored \npetrified wood, fossilized remains, and spectacular landscapes. \nHowever, it is much more than a colorful, scenic vista, for the \nPetrified Forest has been referred to as ``one of the world's greatest \nstorehouses of knowledge about life on earth when the Age of the \nDinosaurs was just beginning.''\n  For anyone who has ever visited this Park, one is quick to recognize \nthe wealth of scenic, scientific, and historical values of this Park. \nPreserved deposits of petrified wood and related fossils are among the \nmost valuable representations of Triassic-period terrestrial ecosystems \nin the world. These natural formations were deposited more than 220 \nmillion years ago. Scenic vistas, designated wilderness areas, and \nother historically significant sites of pictographs and Native American \nruins are added dimensions to the Park.\n  The Petrified Forest was originally designated as a National Monument \nby former President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906 to protect the important \nnatural and cultural resources of the Park, and later re-designated as \na National Park in 1962. While several boundary adjustments were made \nto the Park, a significant portion of unprotected resources remain in \noutlying areas adjacent to the Park.\n  A proposal to expand the Park's boundaries was recommended in the \nPark's General Management Plan in 1992, in response to concerns about \nthe long-term protection needs of globally significant resources and \nthe Park's viewshed in nearby areas. For example, one of the most \nconcentrated deposits of petrified wood is found within the Chinle \nencarpment, of which only thirty percent is included within the current \nPark boundaries.\n  Increasing reports of theft and vandalism around the Park have \nactivated the Park, local communities, and other interested entities to \nseek additional protections through a proposed boundary expansion. It \nhas been estimated that visitors to the Park steal about 12 tons of \npetrified wood every year. Other reports of destruction to \narchaeological sites and gravesites have also been documented. Based on \nthese continuing threats to resources intrinsic to the Park, the \nNational Parks Conservation Association listed the Petrified Forest \nNational Park on its list of Top Ten Most Endangered Parks in 2000.\n  Support for this proposed boundary expansion is extraordinary, from \nthe local community of Holbrook, scientific and research institutions, \nstate tourism agencies, and environmental groups, such as the National \nPark Conservation Association, NPCA. I ask unanimous consent that a \nresolution from the City of Holbrook and a letter of support from NPCA \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Resolution No. 00-15\n\n\n a resolution of the city of holbrook, arizona endorsing the expansion \n                   of petrified forest national park\n\n       Whereas, Petrified Forest National Park, first established \n     in 1906, is a priceless and irreplaceable part of America's \n     heritage; and\n       Whereas, Petrified Forest National Park contains a variety \n     of significant natural and cultural resources, including \n     portions of the Painted Desert and some of the most valuable \n     paleontological resources in the world; and\n       Whereas, Petrified Forest National Park has inspired and \n     educated millions of visitors from all over the world, and is \n     cherished as a national treasure to be protected for the \n     benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations; and\n       Whereas, the Chinle Formation which creates the \n     spectacularly beautiful landscapes of the Painted Desert, \n     Blue Mesas, and other park features, is probably the best \n     place in the world for studying the Triassic period of the \n     earth's history; and\n       Whereas, globally and nationally significant \n     paleontological, archaeological, and scenic resources \n     directly related to the resource values of Petrified Forest \n     National Park, including approximately 70 percent of the \n     Chinle Formation, are not included within the current \n     boundary; and\n       Whereas, the newly approved General Management Plan for the \n     park, prepared by the National Park Service with broad public \n     input, has identified about 97,000 acres of land that, if \n     included as part of the park, would lead to protection of the \n     remainder of this globally significant Chinle Formation, \n     along with highly significant archaeological resources, and \n     would protect the beautiful, expansive vistas seen from the \n     park; and\n       Whereas, land use patterns in the area of the park are \n     beginning to change, potentially threatening the protection \n     of the park and the broader setting in which it is placed; \n     and\n       Whereas, implementing the General Management Plan is \n     essential to carry out a vision for Petrified Forest National \n     Park that will better protect park resources, enhance \n     research opportunities, broaden and diversify visitor \n     experiences, improve visitor service, and help contribute to \n     the sustainability of the regional economy into the 21st \n     century; and\n       Whereas, an excellent opportunity now exists to include \n     adjacent areas of significant resources inside the park \n     boundary because other landowners in the region, including \n     the State of Arizona, and the Bureau of Land Management, and \n     other private landowners recognize the significance of the \n     resources on their lands and have expressed interest in \n     seeing them preserved in perpetuity for the benefit and \n     inspiration of this and future generations: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the City of Holbrook, Arizona, hereby \n     recommends and supports the inclusion within Petrified Forest \n     National Park of all lands identified in the park's General \n     Management Plan as desirable boundary additions, and supports \n     all continuing efforts to enact legislation to accomplish \n     this task and to complete the federal acquisition of this \n     land. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the City of Holbrook is \n     directed to immediately transmit this Resolution to the \n     Governor of the State of Arizona, Arizona's Congressional \n     delegation, and the Director of the National Park\n\n[[Page S4157]]\n\n     Service, together with a letter requesting prompt and ongoing \n     support for completing the park expansion.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    National Parks\n\n\n                                     Conservation Association,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2002.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The National Parks Conservation \n     Association (NPCA) commends you for your leadership and \n     vision in introducing the Petrified Forest National Park \n     Expansion Act of 2002. Ever since NPCA published a Park \n     Boundary Study for various national parks in 1988, we have \n     been advocating the need for this expansion. With private \n     landowners anxious to sell their land, we believe the time is \n     ripe for this expansion.\n       It is hard to imagine a better example of an outdoor \n     classroom than Petrified Forest National Park. This boundary \n     expansion will ensure long-term protection of globally \n     significant paleontological resources, potentially nationally \n     significant archaeological resources where there is \n     substantial evidence of early habitation, and the park's \n     viewshed. It will also alleviate the threat of encroaching \n     incompatible development and will greatly enhance the \n     National Park Service's capability to protect the resources \n     from vandalism and illegal pothunting.\n       Just as Theodore Roosevelt recognized the importance of \n     preserving this land when he proclaimed Petrified Forest a \n     national monument in 1906, your legislation would ensure that \n     future generations can learn even more from this amazing \n     landscape that capture's the world's best record of Triassic-\n     period terrestrial ecosystems and prehistoric human \n     occupation through an array of artifacts and ``trees turned \n     to stone.''\n       NPCA looks forward to working with you and your staff to \n     advance this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thomas C. Kiernan.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, editorials from Arizona State newspapers \nalso encourage a boundary expansion for the Park. I ask unanimous \nconsent that articles from the Arizona Republic and the Holbrook \nTribune News regarding the park expansion proposal be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Arizona Republic, May 3, 2002]\n\n  Expanding Petrified Forest Can Save Treasures--Pothunters, Looters \n                           Ravaging Park Area\n\n       Looters and pothunters are ravaging the land around \n     Petrified Forest National Park.\n       The property should be inside the park. A decade ago, the \n     Park Service decided Petrified Forest's boundaries should be \n     expanded to include the priceless paleontology, archaeology \n     and other resources in adjoining areas.\n       But the proposal has rarely gotten off the congressional \n     back burner.\n       Until now.\n       Arizona Republicans Rep. J.D. Hayworth and Sen. John McCain \n     are preparing bills to expand Petrified Forest. The plan is \n     to add 140,000 acres, more than doubling the 93,500-acre \n     park.\n       They can't move too fast.\n       The assets they're trying to protect are under heavy \n     assault.\n       A pothunter recently smashed through an 800-year-old \n     prehistoric Indian site while searching for booty. Someone \n     else unearthed a massive petrified tree, nearly 5 feet in \n     diameter, and prepared to hack it into marketable chunks.\n       Last year, we urged Congress to approve the park expansion. \n     Since then, looters have wrecked about 400 gravesites near \n     the park's eastern boundary.\n       Congress has been understandably preoccupied with other \n     issues. But a critical window of opportunity is about to \n     close.\n       Elections are coming up, and Arizona's new, larger \n     delegation could take time to come together on this issue. \n     Landowners around Petrified Forest are tired of waiting to \n     sell to the government and are beginning to subdivide their \n     land. The National Parks Conservation Association, and \n     Albuquerque-based non-profit group, is running out of \n     resources to push for the expansion.\n       And the destruction, of course, continues unabated.\n\n\n                          boundaries misjudged\n\n       When Petrified Forest was protected almost a century ago, \n     originally as a national monument, the goal was simple: Save \n     some pretty fossilized wood. And that's how the boundaries \n     were picked.\n       Now we realize that area in northeastern Arizona is a \n     treasure chest, with world-class paleontology, pueblo ruins, \n     striking petroglyphs and, of course, the marvelous trees that \n     turned to stone millions of years ago.\n       But without a park expansion, many of these treasures will \n     remain outside the protection of federal law. Among them:\n       The Chinle Escarpment, now only partially within the park, \n     has the world's best terrestrial fossils of plants and \n     animals from the late Triassic period, including early di- \n     nosaurs. The escarpment has yielded the earliest known \n     sample of amber.\n       Rainbow Forest Badlands are rich in fossils and include \n     grazing land for the national park's herd of pronghorn \n     antelope\n       Dead Wash Petroglyphs has panels of rock art and pueblo \n     sites of prehistoric people.\n       Canyon Butte, a dramatic landmark, includes pueblo ruins \n     with signs of warfare.\n       Expanding the park's boundaries appears unlikely to stir \n     controversy in Congress. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., previously \n     landed $2 million in federal funding for land purchases.\n       But we all know that the best ideas can get lost in the \n     blizzard of bills in Congress.\n       We applaud Hayworth and McCain for pressing forward with \n     the park expansion. While there's still something left to \n     save.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Holbrook (AZ) Tribune-News, Oct. 27, 2000]\n\n                       Park's Proposed Expansion\n\n       Now under study is a plan to expand the Petrified Forest \n     National Park's boundaries by about 97,000 acres to afford \n     protection to this priceless natural treasure. It deserves \n     our interest and support.\n       Thanks to the efforts of President Theodore Roosevelt and \n     others back in 1906, the park has been preserved for us to \n     enjoy nearly a century later. Now it is time to take the \n     necessary steps to protect the park for our posterity.\n       The land involved surrounds the existing park. Some of it \n     is publicly owned, and some is privately owned.\n       Presumably the public agencies owning property adjacent to \n     the park understand how important it is to enlarge the park \n     and offer protection to its resources. It is my understanding \n     that most, if not all, of the major private property owners \n     also support this expansion plan.\n       The problem is that as these privately owned parcels are \n     subdivided, it makes it more and more difficult to acquire \n     the property for the expansion. And each year, the issue will \n     become more difficult, with more owners to deal with.\n       The addition of this acreage to the Petrified Forest \n     National Park will help preserve these natural and cultural \n     heritage areas, and it is my hope that necessary steps will \n     be taken to accomplish this program.\n       We have been fortunate to have foresighted people in the \n     past who have maintained this wonderful place for us, and we \n     must be equally diligent now to see that our children and \n     grandchildren will have it to enjoy for years in the future.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The legislation I am introducing today is intended to \nserve as a placeholder bill for further development of a boundary \nexpansion proposal. Several key issues remain that require resolution, \nincluding the exact definition of the expanded boundary acreage, and \nthe disposition, and possible acquisition, of private, Federal, and \nState lands within the proposed expansion area.\n  It's encouraging to note that the four major landowners within the \nproposed boundary expansion area have expressed interest in the Park \nexpansion. Other public landowners, primarily the State of Arizona and \nthe Bureau of Land Management, have recognized the significance of the \npaleontological resources on its lands adjacent to the Park. The \nArizona State Trust Land Department closed nearby State trust lands to \nboth surface and subsurface applications. Additionally, the Bureau of \nLand Management has identified its land-holdings within the proposed \nexpansion area for disposal and possible transfer to the Park.\n  Other issues involving additional private landholders and State trust \nlands must still be resolved. In particular, the State of Arizona has \nspecific concerns which must be addressed as the legislation moves \nthrough the process, particularly with regard to compensation to the \nState for any acquisitions of State trust lands by the Secretary of \nInterior, in keeping with the requirements of State law.\n  I fully intend to address these issues in consultation with affected \nentities and resolve any additional questions within a reasonable time-\nframe. A historic opportunity exists to alleviate major threats to \nthese nationally significant resources and preserve them for our \nposterity.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to ensure swift consideration and enactment of this proposal. \nTime is of the essence to ensure the long-term protection of these rare \nand important resources for the enjoyment and educational value for \nfuture generations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2494\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Petrified Forest National \n     Park Expansion Act of 2002''.\n\n[[Page S4158]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at \n100 Federal Plaza in Central Islip, New York, as the ``Alfonse M. \nD'Amato United States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill in \nhonor of former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato on behalf of myself and 40 \nof my colleagues thus far. I am sure there will be more.\n  It recently came to my attention that the Federal courthouse in \nCentral Islip, Long Island, did not have a name so I thought to myself: \nWhat a shame. This beautiful new courthouse does not even have a name, \nand I concluded that it was time to rectify the oversight. Who better \nthan Alfonse D'Amato, a great Senator from New York, who had more than \na little bit to do with providing the people of the Empire State with \npublic buildings to conduct the business of government and justice. \nForty of my colleagues concur that we ought to name this U.S. \ncourthouse the ``Alfonse M. D'Amato United States Courthouse.'' I \nbelieve that is the right thing to do. I understand the U.S. \nRepresentatives from New York are moving similar legislation through \ntheir body.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2495\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.\n\n       The United States courthouse located at 100 Federal Plaza \n     in Central Islip, New York, shall be known and designated as \n     the ``Alfonse M. D'Amato United States Courthouse''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the United States \n     courthouse referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a \n     reference to the ``Alfonse M. D'Amato United States \n     Courthouse''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 2498. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require \nadequate disclosure of transactions which have a potential for tax \navoidance or evasion, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Garrison Keillor is quoted as saying, ``I \nbelieve in looking reality straight in the eye and denying it.'' That \napproach is perhaps what some would like us to do with respect to the \nincreasing problem of the use of abusive tax shelters to avoid or evade \ntaxes. But I do not agree.\n  The Tax Shelter Transparency Act that I introduce today doesn't deny \nreality, rather, it shines some transparency on reality so that we have \na better understanding of what is going on out there. Following Enron's \nbankruptcy, I think that all Americans have a greater appreciation for \nthe need for greater transparency in complex tax transactions.\n  The legislation is the product of over 2 years of review and public \ncomment. The Tax Shelter Transparency Act also incorporates tax shelter \nproposals released by the Department of the Treasury the day before the \nSenate Finance Committee's March 21, 2002 hearing on the subject.\n  As I stated at the hearing, ``the Finance Committee is committed to \nhelping combat these carefully engineered transactions. These \ntransactions have little or no economic substance, are designed to \nachieve unwarranted tax benefits rather than business profit, and place \nhonest corporate competitors at a disadvantage.''\n  The proliferation of tax shelters has been called ``the most \nsignificant compliance problem currently confronting our system of \nself-assessment.'' Less than 2 years ago, there was a more positive \noutlook regarding the Government's ability to curb the promotion and \nuse of abusive tax shelters. The Department of the Treasury and the IRS\n\n[[Page S4159]]\n\nissued regulations requiring disclosure of certain transactions and \nrequiring developers and promoters of tax-engineered transactions to \nmaintain customer lists. Also, the IRS had prevailed in several court \ncases against the use of transactions lacking in economic substance.\n  Unfortunately, the honesty and integrity of our tax system has \nsuffered significant blows over the past 2 years. Court decisions have \nshifted from decisions tough on tax avoidance and evasion to court \ndefeats for the IRS. Also, there appears to be a lack of compliance \nwith the disclosure legislation passed in 1997 and the subsequent \nregulations.\n  The corporate tax returns filed in 2001 are the first returns filed \nunder the new tax shelter disclosure requirements. The administration \nprovided the Finance Committee with the results of their analysis of \nthe disclosure data, including their analysis of what was not \ndisclosed.\n  Only 272 transactions were disclosed by 99 corporate taxpayers. There \nare approximately 100,000 corporate taxpayers under the Large and \nMidsize Business Division at the IRS yet only 99 of them made a \ndisclosure under the current regime. Based on the Finance Committee \nhearing, it is safe to say that the administration, as did Congress, \nthought the number of disclosures would be much greater.\n  Clearly, the past method of reactive, ad-hoc closing down of abusive \ntransactions does little to discourage the creation and exploitation of \nmany shelters.\n  These transactions may be good for a corporation's bottom line, but \nthey are bad for the economy. Here's why: abusive corporate tax \nshelters create a tax benefit without any corresponding economic \nbenefit. There's no new product. No technological innovation. Just a \ntax break.\n  As with the Senate Finance Committee draft legislation released last \nAugust, the Tax Shelter Transparency Act emphasizes disclosure. \nDisclosure is critical to the Government's ability to identify and \naddress abusive tax avoidance and evasion arrangements. Under the bill, \nif the taxpayer has entered into a questionable transaction and fails \nto disclose the transaction, then the taxpayer is subject to tough \npenalties for not disclosing and higher penalties if an understatement \nresults.\n  The legislation separates transactions into one of three types of \ntransactions for purposes of disclosure and penalties: Reportable \nListed Transactions, Reportable Avoidance Transactions, and a catch-all \ncategory for Other Transactions. The legislation also addresses the \nrole of each of the players involved in abusive tax shelters: including \nthe taxpayer who buys, the promoter who markets, and the tax advisor \nwho provides an opinion ``endorsing'' the tax-engineered arrangement. \nThe legislation focuses on each of these participants and contains \nproposals to discourage their participation in abusive tax \ntransactions.\n  Reportable Listed Transactions are transactions specifically \nidentified by the Department of the Treasury as ``tax avoidance \ntransactions.'' These are transactions specifically classified by \nTreasury as bad transactions, essentially the worst of the worst. \nFailure by the taxpayer to disclose the transaction results in a \nseparate strict liability, nonwaivable flat dollar penalty of $200,000 \nfor large taxpayers and $100,000 for small taxpayers.\n  Additionally, if the taxpayer is required to file with the Securities \nand Exchange Commission, the penalty must be reported to the SEC. If \nthe taxpayer discloses the questionable transaction, they are not \nsubject to the flat dollar penalty or the SEC reporting. The SEC \nreporting requirement is a critical element to improving the disclosure \nof transactions. The amount of tax penalty is relatively insignificant \nto the tax benefits generated by abusive tax shelter transactions. \nCorporations, however, have a strong incentive not to trigger a penalty \nthat must be reported to the SEC.\n  Failure to disclose a reportable listed transaction that results in a \ntax understatement will be subject to a higher, 30 percent, strict \nliability, nonwaivable accuracy-related penalty which must be reported \nto the SEC.\n  Reportable Avoidance Transactions are transactions that fall into one \nof the several objective criteria established by the Department of the \nTreasury which have a potential for tax avoidance or evasion. Based on \ncurrent regulations and the proposals put forward by the \nadministration, we anticipate these transactions would include but \nwould not be limited to: significant loss transactions; transactions \nwith brief asset holding periods; transactions marketed under \nconditions of confidentiality; transactions subject to indemnification \nagreements; and transactions with a certain amount of book-tax \ndifference.\n  Failure by the taxpayer to disclose the questionable reportable \navoidance transaction results in a separate strict liability, \nnonwaivable flat dollar penalty of $100,000 for large taxpayers and \n$50,000 for small taxpayers.\n  Reportable Avoidance Transactions are then subject to a filter to \ndetermine whether there is a significant purpose of tax avoidance. \nTransactions entered into with a significant purpose of tax avoidance \nare subject to harsher treatment in the form of higher penalties.\n  The legislation enhances the Government's ability to enjoin \npromoters. Most significantly, the legislation increases the penalty \nimposed on tax shelter promoters who refuse to maintain lists of their \ntax shelter investors. If a promoter fails to provide the IRS with a \nlist of investors in a reportable transaction within 20 days after \nreceipt of a written request by the IRS to provide such a list, the \npromoter would be subject to a penalty of $10,000 for each additional \nbusiness day that the requested information is not provided.\n  The legislation adds a provision authorizing the Treasury Department \nto censure tax advisors or impose monetary sanctions against tax \nadvisors and firms that participate in tax shelter activities and \npractice before the IRS.\n  I am pleased that this legislation is the product of working closely \nwith my good friend, and the ranking member of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Grassley. I appreciate Senator Grassley's cosponsorship of the \nTax Shelter Transparency Act and his commitment to work as a bipartisan \nfront to shine some light on these abusive tax shelter transactions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2498\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor legislation, \nthe ``Tax Shelter Transparency Act'' which will arrest the \nproliferation of tax shelters.\n  We have known for many years that abusive tax shelters, which are \nstructured to exploit unintended consequences of our complicated \nFederal income tax system, erode the Federal tax base and the public's \nconfidence in the tax system. Such transactions are patently unfair to \nthe vast majority of taxpayers who do their best to comply with the \nletter and spirit of the tax law. As a result, the Finance Committee \nhas worked exceedingly hard over the past several years to develop \nthree legislative discussion drafts for public review and comment. \nThoughtful and well-considered comments on these drafts have been \ngreatly appreciated by the staff and members of the Finance Committee. \nThe collaborative efforts of those involved in the discussion drafts \ncombined with the recent request for legislative assistance from the \nTreasury Department and IRS produced today's revised approach for \ndealing with abusive tax avoidance transactions.\n  Above all, the Tax Shelter Transparency Act encourages taxpayer \ndisclosure of potentially abusive tax avoidance transactions. It is \nsurprising and unfortunate that taxpayers, though required to disclose \ntax shelter transactions under present law, have refused to comply. The \nTreasury Department and IRS report that the 2001 tax filing season \nproduced a mere 272 tax shelter return disclosures from only 99 \ncorporate taxpayers, a fraction of transactions requiring such \ndisclosure. The Tax Shelter Transparency Act will curb non-compliance \nby providing clearer and more objective rules for the reporting of \npotential tax shelters and by providing strong penalties for anyone who \nrefuses to comply with the revised disclosure requirements.\n  The legislation has been carefully structured to reward those who are \nforthcoming with disclosure. I wholeheartedly agree with the remarks \noffered by the recent Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, that \n``if a taxpayer is comfortable entering into a transaction, a promoter \nis comfortable selling it, and an advisor is comfortable blessing it, \nthey all should be comfortable disclosing it to the IRS.'' Transparency \nis essential to an evaluation by the IRS and ultimately by the Congress \nof the United States as to whether the tax benefits generated by \ncomplex business transactions are appropriate interpretations of \nexisting tax law. To the extent such interpretations were unintended, \nthe bill allows Congress to amend or clarify existing tax law. To the \nextent such interpretations are appropriate, all taxpayers, from the \nlargest U.S. multinational conglomerate to the smallest local feedstore \nowner in Iowa, will benefit when transactions are publicly sanctioned \nin the form of an ``angel list'' of good transactions. This legislation \naccomplishes both of these objectives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2499. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nestablish labeling requirements regarding allergenic substances in \nfood, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleagues \nSenator Clinton and Congresswoman Nita Lowey in introducing legislation \nto improve the labeling of allergens in food.\n  American families deserve to feel confident about the safety of the \nfood on their tables. The Food Allergen Consumer Protection Act will \nallow the seven million Americans with food allergies to identify more \neasily a product's ingredients, avoid foods that may harm them, and \nstay healthy. We anticipate that this legislation will reduce the \nnumber, currently estimated to be 150 yearly, of Americans who die due \nto the ingestion of allergenic foods.\n  The Food Allergen Consumer Production Act will require that food \ningredient statements on food packages identify in common language when \nan ingredient, including a flavoring, coloring, or other additive, is \nitself, or is derived from, one of the eight main food allergens, or \nfrom grains containing gluten. This legislation will also make the \ningredient label on foods easier to read, and require it to include a \nworking telephone number, including one for telecommunication devices \nfor deaf persons.\n\n[[Page S4164]]\n\n  The Food Allergen Consumer Protection Act will require food \nmanufacturers to minimize cross-contamination with food allergens \nbetween foods produced in the same facility or on the same production \nline. It will require the use of ``may contain'' or other advisory \nlanguage in food labeling when steps to reduce such cross-contamination \nwill not eliminate it. This legislation also preserves the Food and \nDrug Administration's current authority to regulate the safety of \ncertain products that are bioengineered to contain proteins that cause \nallergic reactions.\n  The Food Allergen Consumer Protection Act will also require the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention to track deaths related to \nfood allergies, and it will direct the National Institutes of Health to \ndevelop a plan for research activities concerning food allergies.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this legislation that \nwill do so much to improve the lives of those with food allergies. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2499\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Food Allergen Consumer \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Approximately 7,000,000 Americans suffer from food \n     allergies. Every year roughly 30,000 people receive emergency \n     room treatment due to the ingestion of allergenic foods, and \n     an estimated 150 Americans die from anaphylactic shock caused \n     by a food allergy.\n       (2) Eight major foods--milk, egg, fish, Crustacea, tree \n     nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans--cause 90 percent of \n     allergic reactions. At present, there is no cure for food \n     allergies. A food allergic consumer depends on a product's \n     label to obtain accurate and reliable ingredient information \n     so as to avoid food allergens.\n       (3) Current Food and Drug Administration regulations exempt \n     spices, flavorings, and certain colorings and additives from \n     ingredient labeling requirements that would allow consumers \n     to avoid those to which they are allergic. Such unlabeled \n     food allergens may pose a serious health threat to those \n     susceptible to food allergies.\n       (4) A recent Food and Drug Administration study found that \n     25 percent of bakery products, ice creams, and candies that \n     were inspected failed to list peanuts and eggs, which can \n     cause potentially fatal allergic reactions. The mislabeling \n     of foods puts those with a food allergy at constant risk.\n       (5) In that study, the Food and Drug Administration found \n     that only slightly more than half of inspected manufacturers \n     checked their products to ensure that all ingredients were \n     accurately reflected on the labels. Furthermore, the number \n     of recalls because of unlabeled allergens rose to 121 in 2000 \n     from about 35 a decade earlier. In part, mislabeling occurs \n     because potentially fatal allergens are introduced into the \n     manufacturing process when production lines and cooking \n     utensils are shared or used to produce multiple products.\n       (6) Individuals who have food allergies may outgrow their \n     allergy if they strictly avoid consuming the allergen. \n     However, some scientists believe that because low levels of \n     allergens are unintentionally present in foods, those with an \n     allergy are unable to keep from being repeatedly exposed to \n     the very foods they are allergic to. Good manufacturing \n     practices can minimize the unintentional presence of food \n     allergens. In addition, when good manufacturing practices \n     cannot eliminate the potential for cross-contamination, an \n     advisory label on the product can provide additional consumer \n     protection.\n       (7) The Food and Drug Administration is the Nation's \n     principal consumer protection agency, charged with protecting \n     and promoting public health through premarket and postmarket \n     regulation of food. The agency must have both the necessary \n     authority to ensure that foods are properly labeled and \n     produced using good manufacturing practices and the ability \n     to penalize manufacturers who violate our food safety laws.\n       (8) Americans deserve to have confidence in the safety and \n     labeling of the food on their tables.\n\n     SEC. 3.

If OMB fails to complete its review of either the \n     proposed rule or the final rule in 10 working days, the \n     Secretary shall provide the rule to the Office of the Federal \n     Register, which shall publish the rule, and it shall have \n     full effect (subject to applicable effective dates specified \n     in this Act) without review by OMB. If the Secretary does not \n     complete the proposed or final rule so as to provide OMB with \n     10 working days to review the rule and have it published in \n     the Federal Register within the time frames for publication \n     of the rule specified in this section, the rule shall be \n     published without review by OMB.\n\n     SEC. 6.

A bill to establish requirements arising from the delay or \nrestriction on the shipment of special nuclear materials to the \nSavannah River Site, Aiken, South Carolina; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2501\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 109\n\n       Whereas on May 20, 2002, East Timor will become the first \n     new country of the millennium;\n       Whereas the perseverance and strength of the East Timorese \n     people in the face of daunting challenges has inspired the \n     people of the United States and around the world;\n       Whereas in 1974 Portugal acknowledged the right of its \n     colonies, including East Timor, to self-determination, \n     including independence;\n       Whereas East Timor has been under United Nations \n     administration since October, 1999, during which time \n     international peace-keeping forces, supplemented by forces of \n     the United States Group for East Timor (USGET), have worked \n     to stabilize East Timor and provide for its national \n     security;\n       Whereas the people of East Timor exercised their long-\n     sought right of self-determination on August 30, 1999, when \n     98.6 percent of the eligible population voted, and 78.5 \n     percent chose independence, in a United Nations-administered \n     popular consultation, despite systematic terror and \n     intimidation;\n\n[[Page S4166]]\n\n       Whereas a constitution for East Timor was adopted in March, \n     2002;\n       Whereas East Timor is emerging from more than 400 years of \n     colonization and occupation;\n       Whereas the East Timorese people again demonstrated their \n     strong commitment to democracy when 91.3 percent of eligible \n     voters peacefully participated in East Timor's first \n     democratic, multiparty election for a Constituent Assembly on \n     August 30, 2001, and when 86.3 percent of those eligible \n     participated in the first presidential election on April 14, \n     2002, electing Xanana Gusamo as their first President;\n       Whereas, as the people of East Timor move proudly toward \n     independence, many still struggle to recover from the scars \n     of the military occupation and 1999 anti-independence \n     violence that resulted in displacement which, according to \n     United Nations and other independent reports, exceed 500,000 \n     in number, and widespread death, rape and other mistreatment \n     of women, family separation, large refugee populations, and \n     the destruction of 70 percent of the country's \n     infrastructure;\n       Whereas efforts are ongoing by East Timorese officials and \n     others to seek justice for the crimes against humanity and \n     war crimes that have been perpetrated in recent years, \n     efforts that include the work of the Serious Crimes \n     Investigation Unit of the United Nations and the East \n     Timorese Commission for Reception, Truth, and Reconciliation \n     to document and assess responsibility;\n       Whereas Indonesian National Human Rights Commission and \n     United Nations Security Council recommendations to \n     investigate and prosecute senior Indonesian military and \n     civilian officials for their roles in promoting the 1999 \n     anti-independence violence in East Timor have not yet been \n     fully implemented;\n       Whereas, although the people of East Timor are working \n     toward a plan for vigorous economic growth and development, \n     the Government of East Timor will face a substantial \n     shortfall in its recurrent and development budgets over the \n     first 3 years of independence, and is seeking to fill the gap \n     entirely with grants from donor countries; and\n       Whereas a large percentage of the population of East Timor \n     lives below the poverty line, with inadequate access to \n     health care and education, the unemployment rate is estimated \n     at 80 percent, and the life expectancy is only 57 years: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That (a) Congress--\n       (1) congratulates and honors the courageous people of East \n     Timor and their leaders;\n       (2) welcomes East Timor into the community of nations as a \n     sovereign state and looks forward to working with East Timor \n     as an equal partner;\n       (3) supports United Nations and other multilateral efforts \n     to support reconstruction and development in East Timor, and \n     United Nations and other multilateral peacekeeping forces to \n     safeguard East Timor's security, including continuing the \n     periodic visits by United States military forces;\n       (4) remains committed to working toward a debt-free start \n     to East Timor and just, sustainable, and secure development \n     programs as well as adequate resources for the judicial \n     system for East Timor for the foreseeable future beyond \n     independence;\n       (5) expresses continued concern over deplorable \n     humanitarian conditions and an environment of intimidation \n     among the East Timorese refugees living in West Timor;\n       (6) strongly supports the prompt, safe, and voluntary \n     repatriation and reintegration of East Timorese refugees, in \n     particular those East Timorese still held in militia-\n     controlled refugee camps in West Timor, especially children \n     separated from their parents through coercion or force;\n       (7) expresses a commitment to maintaining appropriate \n     restrictions and prohibitions in law on military assistance, \n     training, relations, and technical support to the Indonesian \n     Armed Forces; and\n       (8) acknowledges that a United Nations International \n     Commission of Inquiry found in January 2000 that justice is \n     ``fundamental for the future social and political stability \n     of East Timor'', and remains deeply concerned about the lack \n     of justice in the region.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that the President should--\n       (1) immediately extend to East Timor the diplomatic \n     relations afforded to other sovereign nations, including the \n     establishment of an embassy in East Timor;\n       (2) maintain a robust level of United States assistance for \n     East Timor commensurate with the challenges this new nation \n     faces after independence;\n       (3) work to fund in a generous and responsible way East \n     Timor's financing gap in its recurrent and development \n     budgets, and coordinate with other donors to ensure the \n     budget gap is addressed;\n       (4) focus bilateral assistance on the areas of employment \n     creation, job training, rural reconstruction, micro-\n     enterprise, environmental protection, health care, education, \n     refugee resettlement, reconciliation and conflict resolution, \n     and strengthening the role of women in society;\n       (5) strongly urge the Government of Indonesia to step up \n     efforts to disarm and disband all militia, hold them \n     accountable to the rule of law, ensure stability along the \n     border, and promptly reunite East Timorese children separated \n     from their parents through coercion or force; and\n       (6) review thoroughly information from the East Timorese \n     Commission for Reception, Truth, and Reconciliation, and use \n     all diplomatic resources at the disposal of the President to \n     ensure that--\n       (A) those officials responsible for crimes against humanity \n     and war crimes against the East Timorese people are held \n     accountable; and\n       (B) the Government of Indonesia fully cooperates with the \n     East Timorese judicial system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/09/senate-section/article/S4166-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3398.

Mr. LOTT proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 3009, to \nextend the Andean Trade Preference Act, to grant additional trade \nbenefits under that Act, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word in the bill and add the \n     following:\n\n            DIVISION A--BIPARTISAN TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n                   TITLE I--TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n     SEC. 1101. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This division may be cited as the \n     ``Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The expansion of international trade is vital to the \n     national security of the United States. Trade is critical to \n     the economic growth and strength of the United States and to \n     its leadership in the world. Stable trading relationships \n     promote security and prosperity. Trade agreements today serve \n     the same purposes that security pacts played during the Cold \n     War, binding nations together through a series of mutual \n     rights and obligations. Leadership by the United States in \n     international trade fosters open markets, democracy, and \n     peace throughout the world.\n       (2) The national security of the United States depends on \n     its economic security, which in turn is founded upon a \n     vibrant and growing industrial base. Trade expansion has been \n     the engine of economic growth. Trade agreements maximize \n     opportunities for the critical sectors and building blocks of \n     the economy of the United States, such as information \n     technology, telecommunications and other leading \n     technologies, basic industries, capital equipment, medical \n     equipment, services, agriculture, environmental technology, \n     and intellectual property. Trade will create new \n     opportunities for the United States and preserve the \n     unparalleled strength of the United States in economic, \n     political, and military affairs. The United States, secured \n     by expanding trade and economic opportunities, will meet the \n     challenges of the twenty-first century.\n       (3) Support for continued trade expansion requires that \n     dispute settlement procedures under international trade \n     agreements not add to or diminish the rights and obligations \n     provided in such agreements. Nevertheless, in several cases, \n     dispute settlement panels and the WTO Appellate Body have \n     added to obligations and diminished rights of the United \n     States under WTO Agreements. In particular, dispute \n     settlement panels and the Appellate Body have--\n       (A) given insufficient deference to the expertise and fact-\n     finding of the Department of Commerce and the United States \n     International Trade Commission;\n       (B) imposed an obligation concerning the causal \n     relationship between increased imports into the United States \n     and serious injury to domestic industry necessary to support \n     a safeguard measure that is different from the obligation set \n     forth in the applicable WTO Agreements;\n       (C) imposed an obligation concerning the exclusion from \n     safeguards measures of products imported from countries party \n     to a free trade agreement that is different from the \n     obligation set forth in the applicable WTO Agreements;\n       (D) imposed obligations on the Department of Commerce with \n     respect to the use of facts\n\n[[Page S4167]]\n\n     available in antidumping investigations that are different \n     from the obligations set forth in the applicable WTO \n     Agreements; and\n       (E) accorded insufficient deference to the Department of \n     Commerce's methodology for adjusting countervailing duties \n     following the privatization of a subsidized foreign producer.\n\n     SEC. 1102. TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Overall Trade Negotiating Objectives.--The overall \n     trade negotiating objectives of the United States for \n     agreements subject to the provisions of section 1103 are--\n       (1) to obtain more open, equitable, and reciprocal market \n     access;\n       (2) to obtain the reduction or elimination of barriers and \n     distortions that are directly related to trade and that \n     decrease market opportunities for United States exports or \n     otherwise distort United States trade;\n       (3) to further strengthen the system of international \n     trading disciplines and procedures, including dispute \n     settlement;\n       (4) to foster economic growth, raise living standards, and \n     promote full employment in the United States and to enhance \n     the global economy;\n       (5) to ensure that trade and environmental policies are \n     mutually supportive and to seek to protect and preserve the \n     environment and enhance the international means of doing so, \n     while optimizing the use of the world's resources;\n       (6) to promote respect for worker rights and the rights of \n     children consistent with core labor standards of the \n     International Labor Organization (as defined in section \n     1113(2)) and an understanding of the relationship between \n     trade and worker rights;\n       (7) to seek provisions in trade agreements under which \n     parties to those agreements strive to ensure that they do not \n     weaken or reduce the protections afforded in domestic \n     environmental and labor laws as an encouragement for trade; \n     and\n       (8) to ensure that trade agreements afford small businesses \n     equal access to international markets, equitable trade \n     benefits, expanded export market opportunities, and provide \n     for the reduction or elimination of trade barriers that \n     disproportionately impact small business.\n       (b) Principal Trade Negotiating Objectives.--\n       (1) Trade barriers and distortions.--The principal \n     negotiating objectives of the United States regarding trade \n     barriers and other trade distortions are--\n       (A) to expand competitive market opportunities for United \n     States exports and to obtain fairer and more open conditions \n     of trade by reducing or eliminating tariff and nontariff \n     barriers and policies and practices of foreign governments \n     directly related to trade that decrease market opportunities \n     for United States exports or otherwise distort United States \n     trade;

COMMITTEE STAFF.\n\n       The grant of trade promotion authority under this division \n     is likely to increase the activities of the primary \n     committees of jurisdiction in the area of international \n     trade. In addition, the creation of the Congressional \n     Oversight Group under section 1107 will increase the \n     participation of a broader number of Members of Congress in \n     the formulation of United States trade policy and oversight \n     of the international trade agenda for the United States. The \n     primary committees of jurisdiction should have adequate staff \n     to accommodate these increases in activities.\n\n[[Page S4174]]\n\n     SEC. 1110.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Andean Trade Preference \n     Expansion Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the Andean Trade Preference Act was enacted in \n     1991, it has had a positive impact on United States trade \n     with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Two-way trade has \n     doubled, with the United States serving as the leading source \n     of imports and leading export market for each of the Andean \n     beneficiary countries. This has resulted in increased jobs \n     and expanded export opportunities in both the United \n     States and the Andean region.\n       (2) The Andean Trade Preference Act has been a key element \n     in the United States counternarcotics strategy in the Andean \n     region, promoting export diversification and broad-based \n     economic development that provides sustainable economic \n     alternatives to drug-crop production, strengthening the \n     legitimate economies of Andean countries and creating viable \n     alternatives to illicit trade in coca.\n       (3) Notwithstanding the success of the Andean Trade \n     Preference Act, the Andean region remains threatened by \n     political and economic instability and fragility, vulnerable \n     to the consequences of the drug war and fierce global \n     competition for its legitimate trade.\n       (4) The continuing instability in the Andean region poses a \n     threat to the security interests of the United States and the \n     world. This problem has been partially addressed through \n     foreign aid, such as Plan Colombia, enacted by Congress in \n     2000.
