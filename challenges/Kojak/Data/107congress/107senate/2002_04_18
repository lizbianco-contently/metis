Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the full 2 \nhours be given and the votes occur at 10 minutes to the hour rather \nthan 15 minutes on the hour.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I understand I have up to 15 minutes \nto speak at this time, is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. No time was specifically allotted \nto any particular Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. I am supposed to proceed on our \nside. As the majority whip knows, I have a hearing beginning shortly. \nThe Senator from Pennsylvania wanted to use 2 minutes of my time. Could \nwe let him proceed for 2 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. That would be fine if the three Republican Senators wish to \nspeak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I want to speak for a couple of \nminutes on this amendment on steel. We had an opportunity to do \nsomething to profoundly help the steel industry this year. The \nPresident has done the right thing. He did something tremendously \nimportant to help steel jobs by creating the tariff decision a few \nweeks ago. But the second piece of this puzzle was to do something \nabout the legacy cost, so the steel industry can consolidate and be \nmuch more efficient.\n  We had an opportunity in this bill, because we had a pot of money, to \nbe able to fund this program. I don't see any other pot of money out \nthere that is substantial enough to meet the needs of people who are \nbasically without health insurance now because of the failure of so \nmany companies in the steel industry. We had the money. All we needed \nwas the will. Fortunately, you had the steel companies saying let's do \nit and make this our chance because the money is here, the will is \nhere. The steelworkers passed. Many people here who are advocates for \nsteelworkers are taking a pass. The reason is because they cannot get a \ncommitment from the President to sign this exact piece of legislation.\n  I am going to vote for this legislation, but if that now is the \nstandard, I am going to adopt that standard. I will not vote for \nanother piece of steel legacy legislation on the floor of the Senate. I \nwill not advocate for another piece of steel legacy legislation until \nwe have a commitment from the President, before it leaves the Senate, \nthat he will sign it. Since that is the commitment that was necessary \nhere, that will now be the commitment to get my support and advocacy on \nthis side of the aisle for any future steel legacy bailout. You have \nmade your bed, and it is an uncomfortable one, and it is not going to \nbe a satisfying one for the people who could today be realizing health \ncare, could be realizing a restoration of the health care benefits that \nwere promised them. But some people decided to take a political pass. \nGo ahead and take your political pass, but the impact on all of these \nworkers is profound, and the impact on all of these retirees is \nprofound. It is a very sad day for the steelworkers and the retirees as \na result of the politics being played on this issue.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, this side has asked me to ask \nunanimous consent that the time consumed by the quorum call be equally \ndivided on the unanimous consent the Senator from Nevada just \nrequested.\n  Mr. REID. I hope we don't have a quorum call.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That quorum time be equally divided. That is what we \nare trying to clear up.\n  Mr. REID. I am sure it is OK. I'm not sure I understand.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, today we are debating an amendment \nthat, simply put, has a profound impact on our future. This legislation \nis American jobs and national security. And I will say, what could be \nmore compelling than these two very simple, but profound and obviously \nimportant considerations: American jobs and national security.\n  Our Nation, whether we like it or not, whether we should have done \nsomething about it sooner or not, moves on oil. We can wish for a \nfuture in which there are other options, but it is not here now. \nAbsolutely nothing changes the stark fact that now, and for the \nforeseeable future, we need expanded supplies of oil, and we are \ndangerously dependent on foreign sources.\n  Our economy grinds to a halt without oil. Our tremendous military \ncapabilities require oil. Today, for example, it takes 8 times more oil \nto meet the needs of each American soldier than during World War II.\n  Senator after Senator has noted that we are now importing almost 60 \npercent of our oil. We all know that the past crises occurred when we \nwere half as much dependent. Those crises occurred when other nations \nfollowed their own best interests. That will always be the case. Our \ninterests will not always drive the actions of our neighbors and \ncountries that call themselves our friends.\n  We know that oil is going to become an increasingly precious \nresource. Supplies are not infinite, but it is not a question of \nwhether we have enough oil for the foreseeable future; but will America \nbe able to be assured--or can we do things that will make us more \nassured that we will have what we need?\n  We know that oil is getting to be a more precious \nresource. Obviously, we have become vulnerable to disruptions. That \nvulnerability has never been larger. But I submit that it will get \nlarger in the future because we are not taking any action, in my \nopinion, that either short-term or long-term will change that \nsituation.\n\n  At this instant, we see tremendous instability in the Middle East. We \nhave been getting at least 1 million barrels of oil per day from Iraq. \nAnd instability doesn't stop in the Middle East. Whatever it is that is \ncausing instability in our world, has moved over into our hemisphere. \nObviously, Venezuela is another very major supplier of the United \nStates. It does not take a genius to look into the cloudiest of crystal \nballs and forecast that there are likely to be immense shortages of oil \nin the near future.\n  Some argue that ANWR oil will not be ready for 10 years, while \nexperts note that oil could be flowing in 1 to 2 years. Others will \nargue that even with the shorter time, ANWR cannot impact today's \ncrisis sufficiently. Sure, it cannot, but it will be better and it will \nenable us to withstand the next crisis\n\n[[Page S2873]]\n\nmuch, much better. In fact, it might postpone one crisis or another \ncrisis in the future. And there is no question that prices at the oil \npump are now being impacted by this situation that I have just \ndescribed with reference to our dependence on the Middle East and other \nworld conditions. Whether you're shopping at the neighborhood gas pump \nor reading the papers, the signs are all around us, oil is approaching \n$26 a barrel versus $18 earlier this year.\n  There are headlines such as ``Gas Prices Put Some Budgets Running on \nEmpty,'' and ``The Oil Market is Running Scared.'' Those kinds of signs \nare plastered in newspapers and magazines. Right here in Washington, \ngas prices have climbed 20 percent in the past month. Besides giving us \nmore control over our own gas prices, ANWR has other far-reaching \nimpacts. After all, we are just coming out of recession.\n  This is the time when good jobs are especially precious. ANWR oil, \nvalued at $300 billion or more, means thousands upon thousands of jobs \nfor Americans. It is estimated that the President's whole energy \npackage delivers about 700,000 jobs for Americans. Many of those jobs \nare represented by some of our strongest unions, and we have seen a \nnumber of them support the passage of the ANWR legislation.\n  It is obvious to me there will be many jobs in special areas of \noilfield exploration, and extensive logistic support will be needed at \nevery step of exploration and development.\n  In one sense, this is a huge jobs opportunity for Americans. These \nare highly paid jobs. They will go elsewhere. They will not stay in \nthis country. Salaries will be lost as we become more dependent, and \nwithout us having the advantage of the ANWR oil activities, the oil \nmoney will go elsewhere. We will pay more money to foreign countries \nrather than keep it for ourselves.\n  We would rush to the floor to vote for any project or program that we \ncould put into effect that would produce the kind of jobs that ANWR \nwill bring. There is no question it is the biggest job-producing \nactivity that anyone could plan during the next decade and perhaps \nthereafter.\n  If we import more oil, we are encouraging more pumping from places in \nthe world with less stringent environmental regulations. If we import \nmore, what sense does it make to ban our exploration and drilling under \nrigid environmental mandates and tell the rest of the world to use \nwhatever approaches they want, with whatever environmental damage, just \nto satisfy our needs and our thirst?\n  We cannot, by defeating ANWR, mandate the environmental conditions \nthat will exist across this world when the oil that would have been \nANWR oil is produced by other countries in other places.\n  ANWR critics need to remember that this amendment limits the total \nfootprint of all operations to 2,000 acres, a tiny piece of a gigantic \narea encompassing more than 20 million acres. That means 99.99 percent \nof ANWR is untouched by this development. If the same fraction of New \nMexico, my home State, was developed as is being proposed in ANWR, it \nwould consume an area roughly the size of the Albuquerque Sunport and \nKirkland Air Force Base.\n  That piece of geography in the southwest in New Mexico--the Sunport \nin Albuquerque plus Kirkland Air Force Base--is the entirety of \nproperty that would be used. It would leave no destruction or damage or \nin any way harm the 2,000 acres. That can be done.\n  For those who wonder whether we can drill that many wells and get \nthat much oil from such a small piece of geography, that is what the \nlaw says; that is the only activity the President would be allowed to \ndo if either of the pending amendments were to be adopted.\n  If the same fraction of New Mexico were developed as is being \nproposed in the ANWR drilling, it would consume the area I have just \ndescribed. There are some who do not believe that, but I repeat, we \nhave become such technological experts in drilling for oil that, \nindeed, 2,000 acres will suffice because we no longer drill straight \ndown, perpendicular. We drill horizontally so there will be many wells \nmany distances from this 2,000 acres, but it will not be visible on the \nsurface nor will it impact the surface.\n  We have spent a lot of resources--a lot of businesses invested money \nand we invested money in the research to permit that, to get us to this \npoint where we can stand in this Chamber and talk about horizontal \ndrilling and about a footprint of 2,000 acres that could drain the \nentirety of ANWR, the entirety of the 1.5 million acres or at least \nsufficient quantities to make it worthwhile.\n\n  If we import more, then we are only encouraging more pumping in \nplaces in the world with less stringent regulations, which I have just \ncommented on. If we want to move environmental degradation elsewhere--\nwhich will be minuscule in the United States, in Alaska, in ANWR--then \nshame on us and doubly shame on us if we, with the same set of events, \ndeny an opportunity to produce it under stringent requirements as we \nhave been referring to for ANWR.\n  It is likely that the ANWR supply would replace about 30 years of oil \nimports from Saudi Arabia and about 50 years of oil imports from Iraq. \nRight now, we pay Saddam Hussein about $4.5 billion a year for oil. Do \nwe really want to be dependent on this regime? Do we want it to grow \nrather than diminish? If we want his regime to grow, then reject the \ntwo pending amendments. If we want Saddam Hussein's influence to \nlessen, then we ought to vote in such a way as to permit American \nbusiness, American working men and women to proceed to produce on our \nbehalf.\n  To me, this is a very easy issue. We should drill in the United \nStates using our best environmentally friendly technology under our \nrigid environmental controls. We should drill where we can find our own \noil to satisfy our national needs and, at the same time, we should work \nto develop new technologies that lessen our dependence on oil and \npetroleum-based fuels. There can be no doubt, ANWR will not solve our \nproblem, but clearly it will help solve our problem, and with that, \nthere are so many pluses in terms of where the wealth will go, where \nthe money will be invested, which workers will get the jobs, which \nbusinesses will be part of the very complicated drilling techniques and \napparatus that will be on American soil drilling for oil for Americans, \ninstead of part of the international pool produced by some other \ncountry, the benefits of which are absolutely nil to the United States.\n  It is an easy issue because this is an American issue and a jobs \nissue with very little downside. Actually, this should not be an \nenvironmental issue. This should not be an issue that oil companies \nfavor. This should not be an issue that the labor unions favor. This is \nan American issue that we should have come to the floor shoulder to \nshoulder saying: Let's give it a try.\n  I submit that just as happened in the Prudhoe Bay activity--after \nlengthy debates and passing by the narrowest of margins, with all that \nwas going to happen environmentally in that area, from what I can tell \nand on what I have been briefed from people who live there, nothing of \nsignificant damage to the environment has occurred--I predict the very \nsame thing will occur if we proceed to drill on the 2,000 acres set \naside.\n  I regret, if it turns out this cannot be passed, that the argument \napparently will prevail that we should let the environment be degraded \nin other countries to produce commodities that we desperately need, but \nwe should not produce this product on our own land under far more \nstringent environmental controls. To me it makes no sense as an \nenvironmental issue.\n  To me, it is abandoning hundreds, and hundreds of thousands, of jobs \nand billions of dollars that are American. We are going to be sending \nthose off to others saying: You enjoy them because, after all, America \nis so powerful, so strong, we do not need any.\n  I believe this amounts to something very close to economic arrogance \non the part of those who promote it. It is kind of like walking out and \nsaying: America is so robust, we do not need to worry about hundreds of \nthousands of jobs and billions of dollars that could be ours instead of \nsome other country in the world. It would seem to this Senator that it \nis a very clear issue. I, for one, am sorry we have taken so much time, \nand I do hope when we finish with this issue that we will proceed.\n  I note my colleague from New Mexico has been in this Chamber for an \ninordinate amount of time trying to get this\n\n[[Page S2874]]\n\nbill done. I want to say to him, I am not one who wants further delay. \nWhen we get this finished, I am for getting on with it. I hope that \nhappens in a few days rather than weeks. The issue has been joined. \nBoth sides have had a good shot at it. Perhaps none of us have \nunderstood it correctly, but I think we have all tried.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senators on the Democratic side who have \nrequested time will be given this amount of time: Senator Bingaman, 10 \nminutes; Senator Boxer, 5 minutes; Senator Daschle, 10 minutes; Senator \nKerry, 10 minutes; Senator Lieberman, 5 minutes; Senator Reid, 5 \nminutes; Senator Rockefeller, 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues have advocated opening the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge to drill for oil. Those who favor \nexploiting the Arctic Refuge for whatever oil might be there often \nsuggest this Coastal Plain is desolate and unforgiving.\n  The Arctic Refuge is a very different landscape than most of the \nwildlife refuges in the lower 48 States. This unique Coastal Plain is \nworthy of protection, and that is an understatement.\n  I am from a place called Searchlight, NV, a small town in the heart \nof the Mojave Desert. The Mojave Desert is the driest and one of the \nmost unforgiving regions in North America. It is also one of the most \nbeautiful and awe-inspiring places on Earth. This desert, because of \nits extreme climate, is very slow to heal from impacts people make in \nit. The Mojave Desert is hot, it is dry, and it is fragile.\n  The Arctic Refuge, though so different from the desert, is actually \nsimilar to the Mojave in that it is another of North America's most \nunforgiving landscapes.\n  Like the Mojave Desert, the Arctic Refuge is a beautiful, \nirreplaceable and shared national treasure. The Arctic Refuge belongs \nto all Americans and all Americans should have a voice in determining \nits future. Those pushing to drill for oil in this American wilderness \nclaim drilling would not have a harmful impact, but we know that due to \nextreme climate the Arctic would be slow to heal from the wounds caused \nby oil and gas exploration and development.\n\n  The Arctic Refuge is cold, it is wet, it is fragile, and it is also \nunique and irreplaceable. The Arctic Refuge is not a wasteland. We must \nnot allow it to become one. I am fortunate to be able to return home to \nthe Mojave Desert and enjoy visits with my family. That is where my \nhome is.\n  Congress should guarantee, for the sake of our children and \ngrandchildren, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge also remains \npristine, unharmed and free from wasteful exploitation.\n  Behind the misguided drive to drill in the Arctic Refuge is a \nfundamental issue on which we should all agree: America is too \ndependent on oil. We must be honest with the American people about this \nsimple truth: America has 3 percent of the world's oil reserves; 90 \npercent of the oil reserves are elsewhere, but we use 25 percent of the \nworld's supply of oil. America will never again produce all of the oil \nit uses. As long as America depends on oil, we will have to depend on \nforeign oil. That is too bad. There is no question that reducing our \nuse of foreign oil is a critical goal for our Nation.\n  Improving fuel efficiency in cars would significantly reduce our \ndebilitating dependence on foreign oil. If all cars, trucks and pickups \nhad a corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE standard, at 27.5 miles \nper gallon, the country would save more oil in 3 years than could be \nrecovered economically from the entire Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \never.\n  It is easier to save a barrel of oil than to produce one. Reducing \nour demand for oil means eliminating the inefficiencies that plague our \nNation's energy use. Our energy policy must promote responsible \nproduction of oil and gas. This legislation will provide tax incentives \nto do just that, but that does not mean we should drill in the pristine \nArctic wilderness. Although drilling in the Arctic refuge might seem \nlike a solution to our energy challenges and could be profitable for \noil companies, America cannot afford to cut corners at the expense of \nthis refuge.\n  The refuge can only supply 6 months' worth of oil to meet America's \nenergy needs. This is not a solution. We must find a long-term solution \nbecause once the oil is extracted and used it is gone. We will soon \nfind ourselves facing the same dilemma, only this refuge would be \ndestroyed and/or damaged.\n  There are solutions. Substituting alternative energies, solar, wind \nand, of course, geothermal, as well as biofuels for fossil fuels or \nusing them as fuel additives can help offset some of our demand for \npetroleum and at the same time dramatically reduce pollution.\n  As fantastic as it sounds, with the use of hydrogen fuel cells, as \nthe Senator from Idaho spoke recently, oil will eventually be phased \nout as a primary transportation fuel. Yes, our Nation will some day \nabandon oil as its primary energy source in favor of natural gas and \nrenewable energy. The day is coming. I hope it is a day when we can all \nlook back and be proud that we made the right decision to protect the \nArctic Refuge for centuries to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I welcome a chance to speak for a few \nadditional minutes on this important issue. In my view, opening the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge is not good environmental policy for \nour country and also it distracts us from the effort we are making to \ncraft a comprehensive energy policy the country can support and with \nwhich we can move ahead.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the cloture motions. I have \nseveral reasons for that. One point that needs to be made very clearly \nis one that I think has sort of not been said but has been part of the \nbackground discussion, and that is that nothing that is proposed with \nregard to drilling for oil in the wildlife refuge would in any way \nreduce the price of gas for Americans.\n  The suggestion has been made, well, the price of gas is going up. \nTherefore, we have to rush out and drill in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. \nThe truth is, there is nothing in these proposals that is going to \naffect the price of gas to the American consumer. I think everyone sort \nof concedes that point when asked the question, but I wanted to make it \nvery explicit.\n  Also, there is nothing in this proposal to help us with our short-\nterm needs. The Energy Information Agency says that even if we were to \npass legislation this year to permit drilling in the Arctic Wildlife \nRefuge, there would be no production out of that area for at least 7 \nyears, perhaps for as long as 12 years.\n  We had a hearing in the Energy Committee where the representative \nfrom ExxonMobil said it would be at least 8 years, and more \nrealistically probably 10 years. So there is no solution to our short-\nterm needs in these proposals.\n  I would also make the point, which we have tried to make in several \nways, that there is really no solution to our long-term needs in this \nproposal to open the wildlife refuge either. I have a chart that we \nhave shown before, but I think it is a very instructive chart. It is \nbased on information from the Energy Information Agency, which is part \nof our Federal Government, part of the administration. We asked them \nfirst a pretty obvious question. We said, let us look long-term in the \nyear 2020. How dependent will we be on foreign oil if we do not open \nANWR to production?\n  They said, we will be 62 percent dependent. The exact figures they \ngave us show we are about 55 percent dependent this year on foreign \nsources of oil. In 2020, we will be 62 percent dependent if we do not \nopen ANWR.\n  Everybody said, great. Let us think about opening ANWR then. We said, \nhow dependent would we be if we did open ANWR to drilling? They said we \nwould be 60 percent dependent. That is the issue. It is a 2-percent \ndifference in the year 2020.\n\n  Then we asked the next question: Longer term, what about 2030? How \ndependent will we be in 2030 if we don't open ANWR to drilling? The \nanswer is, 75-percent dependent upon foreign sources of oil. This is \nassuming we don't change any of our other policies with regard to CAFE \nstandards, with regard to use of hydrogen power for fuel cells or \nanything else. They said 75 percent; we said, if we do open ANWR to \ndrilling, how dependent? And they\n\n[[Page S2875]]\n\nsay 75 percent. The truth is, their projections indicate that whether \nANWR is opened or is not opened for drilling and production, by the \nyear 2030 it is all gone and we are at 75-percent dependence upon \nforeign sources of oil. So there is nothing in these proposed \namendments we are going to be voting on that solves our long-term \nproblems.\n  The controversy, I do believe, has diverted our attention from other \nreal opportunities to enhance our domestic energy production. Let me \nrecount briefly what some of those are.\n  Senators from Alaska made the point very strongly, and I agree with \nthem, that a tremendous opportunity for our country as far as meeting \nour energy needs in the future is concerned is getting the gas that is \nproduced in the Arctic down to the lower 48 so we can use it. We have \n32 million cubic feet of natural gas that is immediately available, \nsubstantially more natural gas that is expected to be available if \nthere is a way to transport that--a pipeline--from the North Slope down \nto the lower 48. We have provisions in this bill that will facilitate \nthe construction of that pipeline.\n  We have worked with the Senators from Alaska to try to devise other \nprovisions, incentives, ways to reduce the risk, the financial risk \ninvolved, so that pipeline can be constructed. It is very much in our \nnational interest that be done. I very much hope as a result of the \nlegislation, we are able to do this.\n  Talking now again about oil rather than natural gas, there are \nsubstantial prospects for increased production of oil on the North \nSlope of Alaska in the National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska. There are 23 \nmillion acres of Federal land that have been set aside to secure our \npetroleum reserves. That is the orange area on this map. This is very \npromising. The previous administration leased a substantial area for \ndrilling. Those leases were certainly sought by the industry. There is \nanother lease sale being prepared for this June. There are additional \nlease sales planned in the future. They all have the very high interest \nof the oil and gas industry. I strongly support going ahead with that \ndevelopment. It is something we need to do to meet our needs. I hope we \ndo.\n  In addition, there is a substantial area of State and Native lands \nbetween the Arctic Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska, \nbetween the green area, which is the wildlife refuge area, and the \norange area, which is the National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska area. That \nis State and Native land. There is an aggressive State leasing program \ngoing forward there. That benefits, of course, everyone and increases \ndomestic production.\n  Even when we get away from the North Slope of Alaska and look at the \nGulf States, we have today 32 million acres offshore of Louisiana, \nTexas, and Mississippi, that have been leased for drilling and have not \nyet been drilled and developed. We need to figure out what we can do \nthrough policies and incentives to encourage the development of those \nresources. Clearly, there is a substantial benefit to our country \nthere.\n\n  The point I made repeatedly throughout the 5 or 6 weeks we have been \non this bill--I am losing track at this point--the point I have made \nrepeatedly is we need to begin looking to other sources of energy. We \nneed to be looking at other ways to meet our energy needs: Better \nenergy conservation, more attention to research and development, more \nattention to renewable energy sources. Clearly, that needs to be a \nmajor thrust of what we do.\n  There are provisions in one of the amendments we will vote on related \nto the steelworkers and to the steel industry. The Senator from \nPennsylvania was here a few minutes ago and spoke to that. Many Members \nin the Senate are sympathetic to the problems the steel industry has \nencountered, particularly the workers, the retirees from that industry, \nthe legacy issue relating to the steel industry. I am persuaded this is \nnot the right place to try to deal with that issue. We should not be \ntrying to deal with that issue as an add-on to a proposal related to \nthe opening of the Arctic Refuge.\n  I also don't believe we should be trying to deal with any of our \ncommitments or assistance to Israel as part of this effort to open the \nArctic Refuge for drilling. Those are separate issues. There is strong \nsupport in the Senate for dealing with both of those issues, but it is \nnot appropriate, in my view, to try to roll those into these \namendments.\n  This energy bill has got enough on it and enough issues to deal with \nwithout adding these provisions. Clearly, they complicate the issue \nsubstantially and do not hold out a real prospect for solving either of \nthose problems.\n  There is a lot of talk about jobs. I believe sincerely this energy \nbill overall, if we can pass it, if we can get it to the President for \nsignature, will create substantial jobs in this country. We will do \nthat in a variety of ways. We will create substantial jobs if we \nincentivize construction of the gas pipeline from the North Slope down \nto the lower 48. We will create substantial jobs if we are able to move \nahead with more use of renewable energy throughout our country. That \nwill create substantial jobs. There are all sorts of provisions in the \nbill that will create jobs. I believe it is far better in the job \ncreation arena than the bill passed by the House of Representatives \nlast summer.\n  I conclude by saying I hope Senators will vote against cloture on \nthese two amendments so we can move on to some other issues and \nconclude action on this very important energy bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty minutes remain to the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. REID. And Senator Daschle's time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-three minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I make a unanimous consent request. I suggested earlier \nwhat we would do in our time remaining: Senator Daschle, 10 minutes; \nSenator Rockefeller, 10 minutes; Senator Kerry, 10 minutes; Senator \nLieberman, 5 minutes; and Senator Boxer, 5 minutes; and I ask that be \nin the form of a unanimous consent request for how the time is \ndistributed on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my intention to try to follow a \nsimilar pattern on our side. I reserve 10 minutes at the end at my \ndiscretion as manager on this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield to Senator Stevens such time as he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am delighted the Senator from New \nMexico has indicated his support for the Alaska natural gas pipeline. I \nhope we can proceed during this Congress to carry out that commitment.\n  The gas we will transport is from State land, not Federal land. \nObviously, we are going to have to have some changes in Federal law to \npermit the construction of the largest project in the history of man. \nIt will take some incentives. I tried to provide some incentives to \nthat through the second-degree amendment. That is obviously not going \nto be adopted by the Senate.\n  I will speak for a moment about the defeatist attitude of the \nDemocratic Party. The Senator from New Mexico has said we have 75-\npercent dependence on foreign oil coming. Why? We closed all the coast \nlines in the United States to oil and gas exploration--except the gulf \nand a little bit in Alaska on State lands. Those are State lands where \noil and gas drilling and production take place. The Federal lands, \nbecause of the demands of the Sierra Club and other radical \nenvironmental organizations, are closed to oil and gas leasing, almost. \nThe administration is going to try to reopen some of them in the Rocky \nMountain area. We will see how the Democratic Party reacts to that. But \nas a matter of fact, the Clinton administration closed NPRA. The \nSenator from New Mexico talks about opening it. It is closed. We tried \nto open it several times.\n\n  I welcome the attitude that we are going to open up the reserve set \naside for Alaska in 1925 by President Coolidge to try to make up for \nthe Teapot Dome scandal. It has been closed since that time. We had one \nwell drilled during the war by the Navy. By the way, it was a pretty \ngood well. It was very shallow, but it was good.\n  The Sierra Club and all the radical organizations have brought about \nthe\n\n[[Page S2876]]\n\nclosure of offshore drilling, the closure of Federal lands drilling, \nthe closure of Alaska lands now. What more do they want? If we follow \nthis defeatist attitude that we are going to face 75-percent imports in \nthe future as far as our oil energy is concerned, it is going to \nhappen. It will not happen if we decide we are going to use our \ntechnology base to do what President Truman wanted to do, go offshore \nand research the seabed. Two-thirds of the world's surface is covered \nby water and there is very little production in that water around the \nUnited States. Half of the Continental Shelf--probably even more than \nthat--off the United States is off our State. Not one well has been \ndrilled out there. Why? The environmental organizations oppose it.\n  We will have 75-percent dependence on foreign oil if the Democratic \nParty has its way. It is part of the platform of the Democratic Party \nto oppose drilling on these lands. So it is a political issue, and it \nis high time we faced up to it.\n  We think we have a right to transport that gas. As a matter of fact, \nin the State of the Senator from New Mexico, the Indians in his State \ncan drill on their lands. They are producing gas on their lands. They \nare producing oil on their lands. What happens in our State? They \ncannot drill on privately owned Native land, Eskimo land that is within \nthe 1002 area in the Alaska Coastal Plain, the 1.5 million acres. There \nare 92,000 acres owned by those Eskimos, and they cannot drill. Why? \nBecause the administration at the time they got the lands, the Clinton \nadministration, demanded that they agree to a provision that they could \nnot drill until we were able to drill within the 1002 area itself.\n  Talk about discrimination. Not only is the State discriminated \nagainst but our Natives are discriminated against. We are going to have \nan amendment before we are through with this bill. That amendment will \nbe to allow the Alaskan Eskimos to drill on their own land, to stop \nthis discrimination against our people. It is bad enough to \ndiscriminate against the State, but to discriminate against Alaskan \nEskimos who own that land is just atrocious as far as I am concerned.\n  I welcome the support of the Senator from New Mexico, as I said, for \nthe Alaska natural gas pipeline. It is going to take some incentives. \nIf we want that gas down here--the equivalent, by the way, of a million \nbarrels of oil a day--if we want that gas down here before 2030, 2050--\nwhen they talk about the real demand for energy--if we want it, even \nthen, we are going to have to start now. If we started right now to \nbuild the Alaska natural gas pipeline it would be finished in 2011; 9 \nyears minimum. That is nonsense.\n  It is nonsense that we cannot drill on our lands. It is nonsense they \nwill not keep the commitment that two famous Democratic Senators made.\n  I have learned a lesson from this in the last 21 years and that is \nthis, something that every Senator should know: Do not depend on future \nCongresses, particularly future Senators, to keep commitments that were \nmade by a previous Congress and President. In 1980, the commitment was \nmade that this area would be subject to drilling, if it did not--if the \nenvironmental impact showed there was not going to be permanent harm to \nthe area as far as the fish and wildlife was concerned. We relied upon \nthat commitment in December of 1980 to go ahead with this whole idea of \nwithdrawing 104 million acres. We relied on a commitment made by an \nadministration and Congress, in law, that we would be able to do that.\n  In subsequent Congresses the House has carried it out, strangely \nenough. The Senate has not--except for twice when we sent it down to \nthe President and President Clinton vetoed it.\n  So if you want a continuum of what is causing the 75-percent \ndependence upon foreign oil that the majority says is inevitable, then \nfollow the Democratic Party. Follow them to dependence upon foreign \noil, the exporting of U.S. jobs, and the total dependence upon the \nphilosophies of foreign nations in order to keep our Nation going.\n  Just think of that. We are saying it is inevitable, in order to keep \nthis country going--this country, the greatest economic engine the \nworld has ever seen--we have to be totally dependent upon foreign oil; \n75 percent is total as far as I am concerned.\n  The Senator from New Mexico says this will not affect the price of \ngas. How would you like to make a bet? Do you want to make a little \nbet? I bet before the end of the year, the price of gas is up again 25 \ncents at least. As a matter of fact, as the trendline goes up on \ndependence on foreign oil, the price is going to go up. That happens \nevery time we have seen that line go up in terms of dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  If you do not believe that, go back and look at the price of gas \nbefore the embargo in the 1970s and then see that as that embargo was \nlifted, we increased our dependence on foreign oil. It was less than 35 \npercent in 1973, and it is now 57 percent, they say. If it is going up \nto 75 percent, just follow the trendline of the price of gasoline.\n  It may be so. As a matter of fact, it is so. If we pass our \namendment, it would not change the price of gas now, but it will change \nthe price of gas in 6 years. We will be more dependent upon foreign oil \nin 6 years if we do not open up the Arctic Plain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to the Senator such time as he wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Alaska. I \ncongratulate him. But I especially want to congratulate the junior \nSenator from Alaska for his leadership on this issue. I have been here \na long time--some would say too long--but I have seen few people who \nhave done a better job in trying to promote what I perceive to be the \npublic interest than Senator Murkowski.\n  Today, we are going to vote on cloture on ANWR. I think it is clear \nthat we do not have the votes, and there are many reasons for that. But \nno one can fault the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, because no one \nhas done more to put together a coalition, which now involves labor \nunions, involves people who are concerned about Israel and the Middle \nEast, and involves people who are concerned about the national security \nimplications of not producing energy here at home to turn the wheels of \nindustry and agriculture, energy that can be produced efficiently, and \nthat can be produced in an environmentally sound way.\n  Because we are not producing energy at home, we are becoming \ndependent on foreign oil, and the national defense and security \nimplications and the foreign policy implications are overwhelming.\n  I could understand opposition to opening up ANWR if a realistic case \ncould be made that it will not produce this energy or create 750,000 \njobs in the process. By the way, that is why organized labor is for \nopening ANWR, in my opinion--that and their legitimate concerns as \ncitizens about national security.\n  If the price we had to pay to produce this energy was the rape and \npillage of the land, and massive environmental destruction, and if we \nwill create something that looked like Azerbaijan in the wake of the \nefforts of the Soviets to exploit oil and gas there, then I think we \ncould have a legitimate debate on the floor of the Senate about this. \nUnder those circumstances, I think the case we are trying to make here \nwould be a lot harder. But the amazing thing is no one has proposed \nsuch a program. What is astounding to me is how extreme the \nenvironmental movement in America has gotten in relation to how modest \nthe proposal that we are getting ready to defeat is.\n  Let me remind people of these numbers.\n  There are 319.7 million acres in Alaska. Some people claim it is the \nlargest State in the Union. There could be a debate about that.\n  When you look at the ANWR area where there is the potential for oil \nand gas production, there are 20 million acres of land in that area. \nThat's just 20 million of 319.7 million.\n  In 1980, Congress decided to reduce the area open for production from \n20 million to 1.5 million acres. But the proposal of Senator Murkowski \nis so modest that it says let us reduce that even further, down to only \n2,000 acres.\n  So we have now come from 319.7 million acres to 20 million to 1.5 \nmillion to the point where we are talking about a relatively tiny \nfootprint for oil and gas exploration of 2,000 acres.\n  Now, what kind of technology will be employed? Well, we are talking \nabout\n\n[[Page S2877]]\n\nthe most expensive technology on the planet being used to assure that \neven in the 2,000 acres, we have a very modest environmental impact.\n  In addition to that, while we would allow the potential \nfor production in 2,000 acres out of 319.7 million acres under the most \nrestrictive covenant for oil and gas exploration in American history, \nstill, under the Murkowski amendment as offered, you couldn't engage in \nexploration even on the 2,000 acres unless the President of the United \nStates made a decision through a Presidential finding that the national \nsecurity interests of the United States dictated that such action be \ntaken.\n\n  The provision before us bans export of the oil assuring that every \nbit of it will be used in the United States.\n  It has other provisions related to Israel and its special \ncircumstance in terms of oil needs.\n  Finally, to compensate for 2,000 acres that will have minimal \ndisruption if a national security waiver permits production to occur, \nthe amendment before us reclassifies 1.5 million acres in Alaska as \nwilderness.\n  I think if you really thought this was some kind of rational debate \nabout the public interest, you would have to ask yourself: How in the \nworld could anybody be opposed to this amendment? When you are talking \nabout being responsible and moderate, how could you do more than this \namendment does? Yet this innocuous proposal has attracted enormous \nopposition. The opposition basically boils down to the fact that we \nhave gotten into a political situation where vested political interests \nare dictating the outcome of the debate. God bless them because some of \nthem make up the interests of America, and they have every right to be \nextreme because that is what having rights is about. A news article \nfrom the New York Times which somebody read to me this morning reports \nthat if we could stop global warming in exchange for drilling in ANWR, \nthe environmental groups in this country would be against it. How can \nthat be?\n  It can be because this has become a debate about symbolism, not \nenergy or the environment. This has become a debate about fundraising \nand the kind of extremism that creates political causes and that has \npolitical impact but that in no way reflects the public interest.\n  How can it not be in the public interest to take 2,000 acres in a \nState that has 319.7 million acres, and on the most environmentally \nresponsible basis, over the next 30 years, produce more oil than we are \nimporting from Saudi Arabia?\n  To offset any negative impact we might have on these 2,000 acres, we \nput 1.5 million additional acres into the wildlife refuge.\n  How in the world can such a proposal be controversial? Why don't we \nhave 100 votes in favor of it?\n  Is no one awake to the fact that we have problems in the Middle East, \nthat we have a growing dependence on oil, that there are profound \nnational security implications of producing as much oil as we will \nimport from Saudi Arabia in the next 30 years on 2,000 acres of land in \na State with 317 million acres?\n  I know I am not going to sway anyone's vote, but I want people to \nunderstand this has become a debate not about America's interest, but \nabout political symbols.\n  Opposition to this amendment cannot be supported on the basis of \nrationality. It cannot be based on any realistic weighing of the \nnational interest. It can only be based on blind loyalty to symbolism.\n  When you get into these extreme positions where you are putting \npolitical symbolism in front of America's interest, I don't think you \nare serving the public purpose.\n  I remind my colleagues that when Greeks went to ask advice from the \nOracle, they found this inscription above the gate at Delphi: \n``Moderation In All Things.''\n  I believe this is an issue where we need to step back and ask \nourselves: to whom do we owe allegiance? What are we trying to promote? \nWhose interest are we trying to advance?\n  I think when one special interest group becomes so demanding as to \njeopardize national security and the public interest to try to make a \npoint for them, when symbolism becomes more important than the security \nof America, then something is badly wrong.\n  I just wanted to make that point.\n  I am going to vote with Senator Murkowski. I see that he has come \nback to the Chamber.\n  I just want to say this: I have watched him debate. I have been \ninvolved in many of them. But I have not seen anybody do a better job \nthan Senator Murkowski has done on this issue. I have never seen a \nbetter political base built for an issue.\n  If we were having a rational debate in this body about a proposal \nwith a broad spectrum of political support--which it has from labor \nunions, to people concerned about peace in the Middle East, to national \nsecurity, to working people, and to people who want to be able to use \ntheir cars and trucks, and who want to turn the wheels of industry and \nagriculture with American-produced energy--this vote would be 100 to \nnothing. It is simply a measure of how extreme this issue has become \nthat Senator Murkowski is not going to prevail on this issue.\n\n  Finally, let me say we are going to have two votes to bring to an end \ndebate on this issue. I am going to vote in favor of the ending debate \non the Murkowski amendment. We deserve an up-or-down vote on this \namendment. I do not know if it will be this year or next year or \nsometime in the future, but I am confident that the public interest \nwill ultimately be served. Someday we will produce this energy. \nSomeday, when we have felt pain from not acting rationally, that \nrationality and the public interest will override the wishes of extreme \nspecial interests. The sooner we can do it the better. We ought to do \nit now. Even if we started preparing today, it would take years to get \nthe oil and gas in ANWR. I think is an indication that time is wasting, \nand that we need to get on with this.\n  We will also have a cloture vote this morning on the so-called steel \nlegacy issue. I intend to vote against cloture. I am adamantly opposed \nto that amendment. It is a bad idea whose time has not come. I would \nlike to remind my colleagues that the majority of the members of the \nSteel Manufacturers Association oppose the amendment because it rewards \ninefficient producers and those who granted benefits they could not pay \nfor at the expense of efficient producers.\n  Secondly, I think it is important to note that some of these steel \ncompanies are still in business and have roughly 200,000 retirees. If \nwe are going to come in and start paying benefits for operating \ncompanies that are irresponsible in promising benefits that they cannot \nafford, then we are going to encourage other companies act in a similar \nmanner.\n  I think it is very important we recognize that by doing this, we are \nadding to the problem in the steel industry by keeping excess capacity \nin business when everybody knows capacity should be reduced, not \nmaintained. I think spending $7 billion to bail out these steel \ncompanies is a misuse of taxpayer money.\n  Finally, all over the world today, socialist countries are trying to \nget out of the business of bailing out inefficient, feather-bedded \ncompanies. All over the world, in every socialist country on Earth, \npeople are trying to undo this stuff. Yet, here we are, in the United \nStates of America, trying to get into the business of subsidizing \ncompanies that overpromise and underdeliver.\n  It is a very bad idea. It richly deserves to be killed, and I am \nhopeful it will be.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the manager of this bill, Senator Bingaman, \nwill use up to 3 minutes, if necessary, at this time. I yield that to \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response to some of the comments that \nhave been made, I want to make two points, very simply.\n  First of all, the projections for the extent of our dependence on \nforeign oil in the future are not my projections. They are the \nprojections of the current administration, the Bush administration, the \nDepartment of Energy, the Energy Information Agency within the \nDepartment of Energy. They have said if we do not change policies in \nsome\n\n[[Page S2878]]\n\nother significant respects, we will be 75-percent dependent upon \nforeign sources of oil by the year 2030 if ANWR is opened, and we will \nbe 75-percent dependent on foreign sources of oil if ANWR is not \nopened. So that is the point I was trying to make.\n  The second issue I want to clarify--I believe Senator Stevens raised \nthe question or disputed that the National Petroleum Reserve, Alaska, \nhad been opened for drilling. My information, which I believe is \naccurate, is that the Bureau of Land Management held a sale, an oil and \ngas lease sale in May of 1999, during the Clinton administration. It \ngenerated a high level of industry interest. There were 3.9 million \nacres that were offered for lease at that time. In fact, 132 leases \nwere issued covering 867,000 acres. The bonus bids on that lease sale \nwere $104.6 million.\n  So there has been a significant lease sale in the National Petroleum \nReserve, Alaska.\n  I know there is another lease sale scheduled for June of this year, \nwhich I support, with which Secretary Norton is going forward. And I \nknow there are plans being made for even a more substantial lease sale \nin the next few years. So there certainly is the opportunity for oil \nand gas development in those areas.\n  I have a press release dated May of last year, 2001, saying Phillips \nAlaska, a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips Petroleum, and Anadarko \nPetroleum have announced the first discoveries in the National \nPetroleum Reserve, Alaska, since the area was reopened for exploration \nin 1999. So there has been real success for developing oil and gas in \nthat area.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time under \nmy control be changed to allow Senator Boxer 7 minutes, Senator \nRockefeller 9 minutes, and Senator Kerry 9 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senators Bingaman and Reid for \ntheir generosity in giving me this 7 minutes of time. I have been \ntrying to get some time on this matter for quite a while.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to get into a number of details today. \nWhat I really want to do is paint more of a broad-brush argument as to \nwhy it is so important to preserve this beautiful area.\n  Some 2 years ago, I sent my eyes and ears, my top environmental \nadviser on the Arctic, Sara Barth, who is in the Chamber today, to the \narea in my stead. I think it is fair to say that she came back a \nchanged person because of what she had seen because she really, truly \nwas stunned by the beauty of this area.\n  Many times in the debate, when people have been talking about this \narea, it has sounded as though this area is not really a beautiful \narea. So what I thought I would do today is put in the Record \ninformation that has been taken off the Web site of the Bush \nadministration's Interior Department. This was given to me by Chairman \nBingaman. I think it is a good way for me to lead off.\n  It is not Barbara Boxer's words or the Sierra Club's words or the \nwildlife people's words. It is the Bush administration's words. If you \ngo on their Web site, you get it. It says:\n\n       The Unique Conservation Values of Arctic Refuge.\n       The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the largest unit in \n     the National Wildlife Refuge System. The Refuge is America's \n     finest example of an intact, naturally functioning community \n     of arctic/subarctic ecosystems. Such a broad spectrum of \n     diverse habitats occurring within a single protected unit is \n     unparalleled in North America, and perhaps in the entire \n     circumpolar north.\n       When the Eisenhower Administration established the original \n     Arctic Range in 1960, Secretary of Interior Seaton described \n     it as--\n\n  And this is a quote from Eisenhower's Secretary of Interior--\n\n     one of the world's great wildlife areas. The great diversity \n     of vegetation and topography in this compact area, together \n     with its relatively undisturbed condition, led to its \n     selection as . . . one of our remaining wildlife and \n     wilderness frontiers.\n\n  I think nothing says it better than the words of our own former \nInterior Secretary under President Eisenhower. And this is from the Web \nsite of Interior Secretary Norton today.\n  I want to show a few beautiful photographs. I know the Senators from \nAlaska live in a magnificent place. Some of these photos are just \nunbelievable.\n  Here in this photo we see an area in the Coastal Plain, the 1002 area \nof the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It is a photograph by Pamela \nMiller. The incredible colors are stunning.\n  We will go to the next photo because we have so little time and so \nmany photos.\n  This is a beautiful picture of a songbird that you can find in the \nrefuge. It makes clear why these words are up on the Web site of our \nown Interior Department.\n  This is a magnificent photograph as well.\n  Here is a polar bear, which I know we have seen walking across a \npipeline, but here it is walking in its natural surroundings--very \nbeautiful. Here are the caribou. I think you have seen a lot of this \nbefore. Here are the musk oxen--quite beautiful.\n  I have another beautiful landscape to show of another view of this \nmagnificent area. We do have drilling in a national wildlife refuge \nthere in Alaska. Everyone says there is no damage done. Remember the \npictures I just showed. Now look at how it is all left with these \nfloating barrels. It is a pretty devastated site.\n  I think you need to come back to the question of what is a refuge. \nYou could look it up in the dictionary: a place to find comfort and \npeace and tranquility. Therefore, it seems to me it doesn't make any \nsense to disturb a refuge. When you do this, if you go this way and \ndrill there, we are going to disturb it.\n  Someone sent me a cartoon. I think it was a constituent. It never ran \nin the newspaper, but it basically says: The George Bush Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. It shows that cars are lapping up the oil on \nthe plain. And it says:\n\n       Where S.U.V.s are free to roam without fear of regulation.\n\n  That is somebody's sense of humor about what we are going to do to \nthe wildlife refuge. I hope we don't. I hope we hold the line.\n  It is very fair for people who don't agree with me on this to ask: \nWhat is your solution? I really want to talk about that.\n  We know when something isn't a solution. In my opinion, the amount of \noil there, from everything we know, is hardly going to make a dent. \nHere is a chart that shows that. We have a chart that shows the \nprojected consumption of U.S. citizens of oil. Right down here on this \nlittle black line is the amount of oil we will get, 3.2 billion barrels \nover 50 years.\n  I have another chart that tells the tale. You save 2.38 billion \nbarrels more oil from the Arctic if you have just better tires. With \njust better tires, you get more oil. And then if you close the SUV \nloophole, which is really not that hard to do--they are going to have \nhybrid SUVs coming up shortly--you save about 10 billion barrels. And \nif you just go up to 35 miles per gallon--Senator Kerry led us so well \non that issue; I think we made a huge mistake--we save 18 billion \nbarrels.\n  So look at this. Out of all these options, you get more oil if you \njust use better tires. Some of the people who want to drill seem to \noppose a lot of these other easy ways to govern.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The time of the Senator from \nCalifornia has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to sum up in 1 more minute, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will go to the Los Angeles Times editorial which I \nthought was right on point. They say:\n\n       Wilderness is or it is not. There is no mostly wilderness \n     with just a little bit of development.\n\n  It continues: No matter what Dick Cheney says, U.S. energy security \ndoes not depend on drilling for fuel in the Arctic refuge. The Alaskan \noil would not come on line for 10 years. It goes through that.\n  It says: The fastest way to gain more energy security is to use less \noil and\n\n[[Page S2879]]\n\nuse it more efficiently. It shows that better tires alone will give you \nmore oil than lies in the refuge.\n  Then it ends up:\n\n       The nation doesn't need a muscle-bound energy policy. It \n     needs a smart one--one that does not rely so heavily on \n     fossil fuels and fossil thinking.\n\n  The choice is clear. I respect my friends from the other side on this \ndebate, but I hope we will defeat the proposal to open the refuge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself 9 minutes.\n  Let me begin by paying respect to both Senators from Alaska. Though I \ndisagree with them and they know that, they waged an effort that \nrepresents their principles, their views, their beliefs and, most \nespecially, the beliefs of the people of Alaska, as they understand \ntheir responsibility.\n  I emphasize as strongly as I can, none of us in the U.S. Senate are \ncavalier or dismissive of Alaska's interests. There are many ways to \nserve those interests. I certainly am one Senator who is prepared \nalways to try to help with respect to economic development issues, \nother hardship issues that exist in a State that faces a different set \nof challenges from many of us in the Senate. I hope they understand \nthat, that this is a difference based on an equally fervently held set \nof beliefs and a different interpretation of the facts.\n  I think they are facts. There are some profound differences in that \nregard.\n  With respect to the amendment on steel, I believe Congress must act \nto deal with the plight of steelworkers, retired steelworkers and their \nfamilies. Steelworker retirees are being devastated by the loss of \nhealth care benefits. More than 125,000 steelworkers have lost those \nbenefits due to the liquidation of 17 American steel companies, and \nanother 500,000 steelworker retirees stand to lose their health care \nunless we act to protect them.\n  I am glad that some of our Republican friends have discovered this \nissue. I regret that they want to trade their concern for steelworkers \nwith the opening of the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. It would be \ndisappointing if down the road our Republican friends are only prepared \nto try to deal with steelworkers in the context of the Arctic wildlife \nrefuge and not in the context of their personal human plight. We will \nhave an opportunity in a short period of time to try to deal \nappropriately with the problem of steelworkers.\n  Yesterday Senator Wellstone made a very powerful statement in the \nSenate Chamber. There is nobody in the Senate who has fought harder or \nwill fight harder for steelworkers than Senator Wellstone, but he will \nwork in a bipartisan way, as he is now, to help us deal with this issue \nat the appropriate time.\n  One of the things with which I disagree with my colleagues, as they \nhave presented this issue, is that there has been this moving target of \nrationale for why we should be asked to drill in the Arctic wildlife \nrefuge. We have heard on the other hand that those of us who oppose it \nsomehow oppose job creation or we are in favor of high gasoline prices \nor we oppose energy independence or we support electricity brownouts, \nblackouts, that we oppose Israel, that we support Saddam Hussein. There \nhave been a series of insinuations in the course of this argument that \nreally don't do proper service to the merits of the argument or to the \ngood faith of most U.S. Senators.\n  It is interesting also that this moving target of support for this \nissue has found different rationale at different points of time. When \nCalifornia faced an electricity crisis last year in January, we heard \nSenators come to the floor and suggest that ANWR would help solve that \nproblem. We actually had those arguments made. But only 1 percent of \nall of the electricity of California comes from oil-based, oil-fired \nelectricity.\n  ANWR has nothing to do with it. The Middle East has nothing to do \nwith California's brownout problems or electricity problems. Then we \nheard when heating oils spiked and gas prices spiked, of course: ANWR \nis the answer. But the Arctic Wildlife Refuge drilling will not come \nonline for about 7 to 10 years. When it does come online, it doesn't \nproduce a sufficient amount of oil under anybody's scenario to have an \neffect on the world price or world supply. So that argument simply \ndoesn't stand scrutiny.\n  The Arctic Wildlife Refuge, at its best offering, will not affect the \nprice of oil globally, and it cannot affect America's supply. Then, \nwhen we were hit with a recession and layoffs, we were told: the Arctic \nWildlife Refuge is the solution. It is going to produce 700,000 jobs. \nBut now the very people who made that study and talked about those \nnumbers of jobs have repudiated that number and have acknowledged that \nthat number was based on a 12-year-old study that had oil at the price \nof $45 a barrel in the year 2000, and all of us know it has been at \nabout $25 or less, and that provides a different economic reality.\n  The truth is that one might be talking about somewhere in the \nvicinity of 50,000, 60,000, 100,000 jobs, which is the number of jobs \nproduced in the American economy in a 3-week period and anytime we are \ndoing what we were doing in the period of 1997 to the year 2000. So \nthis is really not even a jobs program. In fact, the very people who \nproduced the faulty study acknowledged that, until the year 2007, the \nArctic Wildlife Refuge doesn't provide any jobs at all--zero. That is \naccording to the American Petroleum Institute's funded study that is \nfaulty--maybe it was faulty to the wrong side, but they suggested there \nwould be zero jobs in that period of time. So it is certainly not an \nantidote to recession, to the current economic problems we face.\n  Promise after promise after promise about what it will do has been \npunctured by the truth. Here is a truth with which our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle can never adequately deal. The truth is, \neven with the best, most optimistic prognosis of what you might get out \nof the Arctic Wildlife Refuge--even with that, and all of the other oil \nwe possess in the United States of America, we have a problem: God only \ngave our country 3 percent of the world's oil reserves. The Middle \nEast, Saudi Arabia, the gulf states, all of the countries from which we \nimport, including Iran and Iraq, which have been the subject of much \nvilification, for good reason, have the largest share of the world's \noil reserves. Saudi Arabia alone has 46 percent, compared to our 3 \npercent.\n  Here is the other truth they don't want to deal with: Every year, the \nUnited States of America uses 25 percent of the world's reserves. Of \nthe available oil, 25 percent goes to America, even though we only have \n3 percent of the oil reserves. The simple equation, the truth that they \ndon't want to deal with, is that the United States of America has an \nultimate confrontation with its dependency on oil.\n  Oil is a finite resource. One day, it is going to be used up. One \nday, we are going to have to move to a different form of transportation \ndependency. The question to be asked of Americans is: If we have to do \nit one day, and with all these ills that are associated with the \ndependency today, why don't we make the choice today to begin to define \nthat dependency?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that I may yield myself 1 \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on every category with respect to \nindependence, this will not affect the independence of the United \nStates. We have to invent the new technologies that provide the new \nfuels for America. This will not affect the price for America. This \nwill not liberate us from our dependency in the Middle East. This will \nnot bring home one of America's young men or women who are in harm's \nway as a consequence of opening the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. What it \nwill do is destroy forever this precious resource, designated as a \npristine wilderness, that can never be returned to that state, which \nhas been cherished by Republican Presidents, Democratic Presidents, \nRepublican administrations, Democratic administrations, and by all \nAmericans for all of these years. Let's not vote today to give that up \nwhen there is a better set of choices for our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S2880]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 14 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 4 minutes to my friend from Wyoming.\n  I would like to put up a picture that shows a producing well from the \nDon Edwards Bay National Wildlife Refuge out of San Francisco, CA. It \nis a wildlife refuge, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alaska. I served \nwith him on the Energy Committee for some time when he was chairman. I \nserved closely with him in this idea of doing something to develop an \nenergy policy in this country. I want to speak very briefly about our \nneed for a balanced energy policy.\n  Obviously, we are on ANWR here, of course, which is part of that \ntotal policy. That has been and should be the emphasis. It is only part \nof the policy, but a very important part of it. I am amazed at the \nopponents who talk about how we face these problems in the future, and \nwe need to do something about it and refuse to move forward on one of \nthe things we can most reasonably do.\n  I come from a State where we have a good deal of production, where we \nhave a great deal of public lands. I can tell you that multiple use of \nthose lands is one of the things we really believe in and can do and \nhave proven can be done.\n  The lands I am talking about in Wyoming are really a little different \nfrom the ones in Alaska. I have visited there, and I can tell you that \nwe can use those in multiple use. We can continue to have the uses that \nare there. We can use it for energy.\n  It has been years since we have moved on an energy policy--years. It \nis time we do that, and it is time we do a balanced bill that has in it \none of the things that are most clearly needed, and that is domestic \nproduction. I am amazed that particularly my friends from New England, \nwho use most of the energy in this country and don't produce any, are \nvery concerned about the fact that we are trying to use multiple use \nideas in the rest of the country where we can help provide these kinds \nof resources. There is nothing more important. What is more important \nthan our energy?\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMAS. No. I think the Senator from Massachusetts has had ample \ntime to discuss this issue.\n  One of the things we need to do is take a real look at this, of \ncourse. ANWR was set aside for future exploration, no question about \nthat. ANWR, obviously, will reduce our dependence on foreign oil. We \nare nearly 60-percent dependent on foreign oil in an unstable world \nsuch as we have now. ANWR is the largest onshore prospect for oil and \ngas. That is clear. It is clearly there. ANWR would require the \ntoughest environmental standards ever imposed on energy production, and \nthat goes back to this idea of having multiple use, to be able to do it \nwith this 2,000-acre footprint and, at the same time, preserve that \nenvironment. We can do that. It creates jobs, of course, for the whole \ncountry and for Alaska, for the Native Americans who live there. It \ngives us a more affordable and reliable energy. That is the basis.\n  Many of us have been working on energy for a very long time. We need \nto have that reliable source. We are going to look for new ways, and we \nwill find new ways.\n  I remember going to a meeting in Casper years ago, and someone, I \nthink from Europe, said we would never run out of the fuel, and we \nwill. We don't know. We need oil, and we need domestic oil.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to take more time. We have had \nthousands of people come here--veterans, Jewish folks, labor unions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. THOMAS. They are very aware of what we need to do. I urge we do \nit, including drilling in ANWR.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I believe I have 5 minutes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, this debate about \nthe proposal to drill for oil in the Arctic Refuge has been simmering \nfor a long time, and it has finally been joined in this Chamber over \nthe last 2 days.\n  It has been a good, spirited debate. I have great respect for those \nwho are proponents of drilling, particularly my two colleagues and \nfriends from Alaska. I never question their sincerity. We have a good-\nfaith difference point of view.\n  Let me try, if I can, for a few moments to summarize what I believe \nare our arguments against drilling and then talk about where I hope we \ngo after we have voted on these cloture motions.\n  First, we are talking about 5 percent of the North Slope in Alaska. \nNinety-five percent is now open for oil exploration and development. A \nlot of it is happening now. A lot of it is planned. This 5 percent is \nthe heart of a thriving, beautiful ecosystem described by someone as \nthe American Serengeti.\n  The question is, Do we want to disrupt it, develop on it, some would \nsay destroy its natural state--I would say that--for the oil that we \ncould get out of it? And would that development for oil affect the \nhealth of that beautiful part of Alaska?\n  I contend and we have contended in this debate that the development \nof the refuge as proposed in the pending amendments would irreversibly \ndamage this natural treasure. The U.S. Geological Survey recently \nproduced a 78-page report encapsulating 12 years of research which, in \nmy opinion, concludes that very fact of irreversible damage to this \nnatural treasure.\n\n  For what? As we have said over and over, maybe oil coming out of \nthere in 10 years and how much, will it break our dependence on foreign \noil? By the Energy Department's own estimate, in 2020, if we allow \ndrilling for oil in the Arctic Refuge, our dependence on foreign oil \nwould drop from 62 percent to 60 percent, still painfully dependent. \nThe only way to break our dependence on foreign oil is to break our \ndependence on oil and develop new homegrown sources of energy and \nconserve.\n  Second, what effect would the drilling have on prices? We are all \nworried about gas prices going up now. The development of the refuge \nfor oil would do nothing to affect oil and gas prices. Drilling would \nhave no impact, even under the inflated estimates for petroleum \npotential that are cited by the proponents of the amendment because the \nprice of oil is determined on the world market no matter from where it \ncomes.\n  As we approach these votes, I am confident that the cloture motions \nwill not succeed. I thank my colleagues for listening to the debate and \nmoving in this direction which I think reflects the opinions of the \nAmerican people. The question is, What do we do then? I hope we will \nset aside this divisive amendment and join around the underlying bill \nwhich does offer progress, a balanced energy plan for America, \nincluding some development within our American sovereignty, our land, \nbut also has the kind of incentives we need for new technologies and \nconservation, which is the only way for this great Nation to remain \ngreat and not dependent on foreign sources of oil.\n  I say to my colleague from Wyoming that we in New England actually \nbelieve we do contribute to the energy supply. My guess is about 50 \npercent of the energy in the New England States comes from nuclear \npowerplants right in our region. I know in Connecticut, we have two \nplants functioning. Forty-five percent of our electricity comes from \nthose plants. More hopefully, New England has become a center for \ntechnology development using the brilliance of American ingenuity and \ninnovation and capitalism to create new sources of energy.\n  One of our great companies, United Technologies, is investing \nhundreds of millions of dollars in fuel cell technology--clean, \nefficient, and ours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Nearly 100 years ago, President \nTeddy Roosevelt, a great American, great\n\n[[Page S2881]]\n\nconservationist, great Republican--this really is not a partisan \nissue--said that the conservation of our natural resources and their \nproper use constitute the fundamental problem which underlies almost \nevery other problem of national life.\n  It is a century later, but there is still a lot of wisdom in T.R.'s \nstatement. I hope we will heed it, defeat these motions for cloture, \nand then move on to work together side by side for the kind of balanced \nprogressive energy program that is in the underlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nMurkowski amendment, which calls for oil drilling in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. My opposition is based, primarily, on the \ncritical importance of protecting this special part of the world. But \nmy objection is also based on my view that this proposal represents a \nfundamental endorsement of a skewed and misguided energy policy.\n  ANWR is a unique and pristine area. It is the only unbroken continuum \nof arctic and subarctic ecosystems on the planet. It is home to a wide \nvariety of plants and animals, including 135 bird species. It is the \ncentral area for the huge Porcupine caribou herd. It is home to polar \nbears, wolves, grizzly bears, muskoxen, and wolverines.\n  And there is no doubt that drilling there would despoil the area. It \nwould risk and potentially harm wildlife. And it would destroy ANWR's \nunique character as wilderness, regardless of whether that is an \napplicable legal term or not.\n  So there is a very serious downside to drilling.\n  So what is the upside? Why are we even thinking about despoiling a \nplace that so many Americans want us to protect? What's the risk-reward \nquotient?\n  We have heard several arguments here on the Senate floor. But they \njust don't hold up. Notwithstanding claims to the contrary, ANWR oil \nwon't create 735,000 jobs. It won't give an assurance of a reduction in \nthe price of oil, certainly not anytime soon. And it surely won't make \nus energy independent, lowering our import needs only marginally.\n  The fact is, there is just not all that much oil in ANWR. Based on \nestimates from the U.S. Geological Survey, it is likely to have little \nmore than 6 months' worth of capacity relative to 1 year of U.S. \ndemand. The oil wouldn't even begin to be available for at least 10 \nyears. And it wouldn't reach peak production for 20 years.\n  According to a recent Department of Energy study, even at its peak, \ntotal oil production from ANWR would be 800,000 barrels a day. That is \nonly about 0.7 percent of global production.\n  Who are we kidding here? Is it really worth risking such a treasured \nspace for the prospect of increasing global production by 0.7 percent \nin 20 years?\n  I, for one, don't think so.\n  Now, let me address the issue of jobs.\n  Yesterday, drilling proponents claimed that drilling in ANWR could \ncreate 735,000 jobs. That's a significant number. But it just doesn't \nhold up. The estimate comes from a study conducted for the American \nPetroleum Institute more than 10 years ago. And it's fundamentally \nflawed.\n  For example, the study assumed that peak ANWR production would be 3.5 \npercent of world supply. Yet, as I have discussed, the real level, \nbased on government estimates, is less than 1 percent.\n  The study also badly overestimated the world price of oil. It \nforecasted that the world price of oil would be $46.86 per barrel by \n2015, and that price was a driver of the jobs estimate. But when the \nauthors of the study issued a similar forecast recently, they forecast \na price of $25.12, a huge difference.\n  Because of these and other mistakes, the study relied on by ANWR \nproponents simply has no credibility. And nobody should be fooled by \nit.\n  I would point out, that if we want to create jobs, there are much \nbetter ways to do that while promoting energy independence. For \nexample, there is no reason why America can't lead in next-generation \nenergy technologies the way we have in information technology and \nbiotechnology. Renewables and fuel cells will be growth industries, and \nthe United States ought to get out front and then export those \ntechnologies to the world. That, to me, sounds like a better job \ncreation strategy then drilling in ANWR.\n  Another argument made by drilling proponents is that drilling in ANWR \nwould reduce the price of world oil. But the oil market is a global \nmarket. And it is dominated by players far larger than the United \nStates. We have only 3 percent of the world's oil reserves.\n  As I mentioned earlier, ANWR's peak production would amount to less \nthan 1 percent of world production. And it's just not realistic to \nclaim that this will have more than negligible impact on the world oil \nprice.\n  Why? Because it's a huge global market, one that currently has about \n7 million barrels a day of excess capacity in the system today.\n  So a modest decrease in supply, such as the recent disruptions in \nIraqi and Venezuelan supplies, can be made up by other producers.\n  And this process can just as easily work in reverse. Any increase in \nworld oil supply resulting from bringing ANWR on line could simply be \noffset by decreases in production elsewhere in the world.\n  Aggregate supply and demand conditions in the global market will set \nthe marginal price, and the prices will be determined by the cumulative \ndecisions of individual producers. The United States simply cannot \ncontrol the price of oil in the world market, because we don't control \nthe aggregate supply. And drilling in ANWR is not going to change that.\n  That leads me to the next topic I want to address, national security.\n  We're now importing about 57 percent of the oil we consume. According \nto the Department of Energy, if we don't drill in ANWR, we'll be \nimporting 62 percent of our oil by 2020.\n  If we do drill in ANWR, the Department of Energy estimates that \nimports would be reduced to 60 percent of U.S. consumption in 2020. \nThat's only a 2-percent decrease in import share resulting from peak \nANWR production.\n  How can anyone pretend that this will make a difference in our \nnational security? It just won't. That 2-percent differential, when it \nfinally comes, simply won't matter.\n  As I said earlier, the oil market is a world market. No nation or \ncompany has a monopoly on supply. So the relatively small amount, in a \nglobal context, that ANWR could produce could easily be offset by \ndecreased production elsewhere.\n  So we are going to be just as vulnerable to price shocks in 2020 if \nwe drill in ANWR as if we don't.\n  Rather than pretending that ANWR is the answer to our energy security \nneeds, we ought to take steps that can have a real impact. And the most \neffective step we can take is to reduce consumption. Unfortunately, we \nhave already voted down a CAFE increase, and I think that was a big \nmistake. But if we are serious about reducing our dependence on foreign \noil, we simply have to deal with demand.\n  Another thing we should do is diversify our sources of oil. And to a \nlarge extent, we have already done that. Only 13 percent of the oil we \nconsume comes from the Middle East. The rest is produced here, and in \nplaces like Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Norway.\n  These particular producers are our closest allies. Are we really \nsupposed to believe that importing oil from these countries is a threat \nto our national security?\n  Having said that, I recognize that the Middle East does contain the \nlion's share of the world's oil reserves. And political turmoil there \nhas clear implications for the world oil market, as does instability in \nLatin America. But getting a relative trickle of oil from Alaska 10-20 \nyears from now won't make the problems in the Middle East magically \ndisappear, or change the supply of oil enough to impact the price of \noil. Instead, we need to engage now and work consistently to bring a \nlasting peace to the region. Until instability is eliminated, our \nnational security will always be at risk from turmoil in the Middle \nEast. That is an issue that is much larger than oil.\n\n  Finally, I wanted to take a moment to briefly discuss energy policy \nmore broadly. As many have said, we need an energy policy that is \nbalanced. But that balance needs to be weighted toward the future, not \nthe past.\n\n[[Page S2882]]\n\n  That means that our first priority should be to create incentives and \nstandards that encourage the development of next-generation energy \ntechnologies. I am talking about technologies like wind, solar, and \nfuel cells.\n  Second, we should set tougher energy efficiently standards for \nappliances, buildings, and vehicles so that we can grow our economy \nwhile we use less energy.\n  And third, we should increase our domestic supplies of fossil fuels \nin an environmentally responsible way so we can continue to power our \neconomy as we transition to new technologies and energy sources.\n  In my view, ANWR doesn't fit anywhere in this framework, certainly \nnot as the centerpiece. And it just doesn't make sense as a matter of \nmacroenergy policy.\n  I think the American people believe that we should leave ANWR alone. \nThat is certainly the sentiment in New Jersey. I have received letters \nfrom more than 9,000 New Jerseyans urging me to oppose drilling in \nANWR, that's more than I received on any other topic in my 16 months as \na Senator.\n  The people who wrote to me about ANWR aren't ``radical \nenvironmentalists,'' as some drilling proponents have suggested. \nThey're ordinary Americans who believe that ANWR is one of those \nspecial places that should be preserved in its natural state. And they \nare convinced, like I am, that drilling might well cause unacceptable \nenvironmental damage.\n  In conclusion, we know that drilling in ANWR will harm the Arctic \nwilderness. And the economic and national security benefits just aren't \nthere. So I will vote against cloture, and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe that a comprehensive energy plan \nis absolutely critical security and economic well-being of this nation. \nA national energy policy needs to balance our growing demand for energy \nwith conservation and supply. I believe that this balance should \ninclude the use of sustainable, renewable energy sources along with \ncontinued responsible development of traditional fuels including \nlimited, environmentally-sensitive exploration in a small fraction of \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR. Energy exploration in ANWR \nhas become a very contentious and highly polarized issue. I would like \nto take this opportunity and talk frankly about energy exploration in \nthis area and dispel some of the many myths associated with this issue.\n  An overwhelming majority of the Arctic Refuge is protected from \nenergy development. In fact, 92 percent of the refuge is not eligible \nfor development at all. However, more than 20 years ago, Congress set \naside 8 percent of ANWR--1.5 million acres of the Refuge--for possible \nenergy exploration. In 1980, under the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act, Congress expanded ANWR to 19 million acres, and \ndesignated 8 million acres as wilderness area. Under this act, the \ndesignated wilderness area cannot be considered for development.\n  However, the current debate regarding drilling in ANWR surrounds the \n1.5 million acres--outlined in Section 1002 of the act--that was set \naside by Congress for further study into the development of mineral \nresources. Under Section 1002, Congress called upon the Department of \nInterior to conduct a study on the biological resources and oil and gas \npotential of the 1.5 million acre coastal plain. This study, commonly \ncalled the 1002 Report or the Final Legislative Environmental Impact \nStudy, was released in 1987 and recommended full leasing of the coastal \nplain. The Section 1002 area has always been a potential site for \nmineral recovery, and is not, as has been expressed by some, part of a \nwilderness designation.\n  It is true that Section 1002 makes up at most 8 percent of the total \nrefuge or 1.5 million acres. However, this number is misleading. In \nreality, the entire 1.5 million acres would not be developed. Current \nestimates place the total acreage of development at far less than a \nmillion acres. In fact, HR. 4, the House-passed energy bill, and the \ncurrent Senate amendment contain provisions to limit development to \n2,000 acres or 0.01 percent of the refuge. Our opponents say that the \n``2000 acres'' grossly underestimates the infrastructure required to \nsupport energy development, that it merely describes the exact imprint \nof the core facilities, and does not include the area encompassed by \nthose facilities, nor any of the supporting infrastructure. However, \nthe nature of the facilities covered by the House bill and the exact \nshape of the 2000 acres was not specified. I believe that the amendment \noffered by Senator Murkowski better clarifies the scope of development \nfor these 2000 acres.\n  The use of new technologies will further limit the foot print of \ndevelopment. Thanks to our nation's ingenuity and technological \nadvances, the footprints of energy development infrastructure are \ndrastically reduced. Production of oil is safer and cleaner than ever \nbefore. Smaller gravel pads, advances in horizontal drilling, the re-\ninjection of drilling wastes, and ice roads, all decrease the \n``footprint'' of development. Furthermore, several new technologies \nhave increased the success rate of exploratory wells from about 10 \npercent to as much as 50 percent. Such technologies include: 3-D \nseismic imaging, 4-D time lapse imaging, ground-penetrating radar, and \nenhanced computer processing. The greater percentage of successful \nwells, the fewer number of pads and the lower the exploration costs. \nOur experiences at Prudhoe Bay are testament to our technological \nsuccesses. If Prudhoe Bay were built today, the footprint would only be \n1,526 acres, 64 percent smaller than it is today.\n  But no matter how minimal the intrusion, opponents argue that any \ndevelopment will permanently degrade the sense of pristine wilderness \nfound in the refuge. While most of the refuge has little sign of human \nencroachment, the coastal plain is home to the Inupiat tribe and their \nvillage of Kaktovik. Additionally, the nearby Distant Early Warning \nline (DEWline) for missile detection, the remnants of former or \nuncompleted DEWline installations, a garbage dump, and a runway are \nscattered in or near the 1002 area.\n  Typically, development of mineral resources is often extremely \ncontroversial in neighboring state and local communities. That is not \ntrue in this case. A majority of Alaskans, 75 percent, the entire \nAlaskan delegation, and the closest Native American tribe support \nenergy development in ANWR. These constituencies all see ANWR as a tool \nfor supporting a modern economy to meet such basic human needs as \nhealth care and education.\n  More specifically, the Inupiat tribe supports development. This tribe \nlives on 92,000 acres of privately held land within ANWR, and inhabits \nthe only village within the 1002 area. According to Tara Sweeney, an \nInupiat, ``We believe that responsible development of this area is our \nfundamental human right to self-determination.'' She goes on to say, \n``When oil was discovered in our region in the late 1960s we were \nfearful of development. . . . Over thirty years later we have changed \nour opinion. Development has not adversely impacted our ancient \ntraditions or our food supply. The caribou population . . . has \nthrived.''\n  Opponents argue that the Gwich'in tribe is strongly opposed to \ndrilling in ANWR. The Gwich'in Tribe depends upon the Porcupine Caribou \nfor food and reveres its calving area and rituals. According to some, \ndeveloping ANWR is effectively raping and pillaging the land of one of \nthe last great traditional tribes. However, the often quoted Gwich'in \nTribe in fact lives over 100 miles away, on the other side of the \nmountains. The Gwich'in are not and never have been--indigenous to the \nNorth Slope. On the other hand, the Inupiat, who live within the 1002 \narea, support development and feel strongly that it will improve their \nway of life. It is my firm belief that the people of Alaska, the people \nwho live closest to the refuge, should be allowed to determine their \nfuture and the future of ANWR. These people see that development of \nANWR will lead to both a healthy economy and a healthy environment.\n\n  Opponents also raise concern about animals, such as the polar bears \nand the Porcupine Caribou, which reside in and around the 1002 area. \nSome believe that drilling would endanger both populations. For polar \nbears, the concerns have focused on how modern winter technology will \naffect winter dens and if pregnant polar bears denning on the coastal \nplain would be affected. Despite these concerns, the record is clear. \nOver the past 20 years, the population\n\n[[Page S2883]]\n\nof polar bears has remained exceedingly healthy. In fact, over ninety \npercent of Alaska's 2,000 polar bears den in the offshore pack ice and \nwould not be affected by onshore development along the Arctic coastal \nplain.\n  Ill-founded concerns regarding the welfare of caribou have been \nraised during the discovery of oil at Prudhoe Bay. Yet, following the \ndevelopment of Prudhoe, the herd seemed to adapt, and even prosper. In \n1969, when oil was first discovered in the region, the Central Arctic \ncaribou herd was estimated at 3,000 animals. Today, the same herd has \ngrown to almost 20,000 animals. The herd is healthy and continues to \ncalve and nurse their young alongside the oil field operations. \nOpponents suggest the following: that the Porcupine Caribou cannot be \ncompared to the Central Arctic herd; that the narrower coastal plain \noff the 1002 area results in a smaller calving area than Prudhoe; that \nthe pictures of caribou on drilling pads and near pipelines are \nmisleading; that the encroachment of development facilities will force \nthe animals into the more dangerous foothills; and furthermore, that \nPorcupine Caribou is sacred to the Gwich'in tribe.\n  While a few of these concerns may be valid, empirical evidence \nsuggests that the Porcupine Caribou population is robust, nearly \n130,000 stronger, compared to the present Central Arctic Herd, only \n20,000. Therefore, I am confident that development of a few thousand \nacres of the coastal plain will not harm the far stronger 130,000 \nmember Arctic Porcupine Caribou herd which inhabits the Arctic Refuge. \nThis is not to say that impacts on animals--even in the slightest and \nmost unexpected form--are not possible. Should such impacts become \napparent, the federal government may establish special protections for \nimpacted animals, such as wilderness designation, delayed exploration, \nor a special regulatory regime.\n  On a larger scale, development of ANWR could reduce America's \ndependence on foreign oil. Currently, the United States imports 57 \npercent of our oil supply. By 2020, experts project that this country \ncould be importing up to 65 percent of our oil supply. This reliance on \nforeign oil jeopardizes our national security and makes our economy \nsusceptible to the frequent and recurring crises that occur around the \nworld. As we have experienced over the last few weeks, we can not \nafford to rely on rogue nations like Iraq for oil, a resource vital to \nthe economy and security of our country. Dependence on foreign sources \nof oil holds Americans hostage, by exposing the United States to every \ncrisis within every nation we depend on for oil. For instance, over the \nlast few weeks, we have witnessed turmoil within Venezuela that \nresulted in reduction of Venezuelan oil being shipped to the United \nStates. Prior to this crisis, Venezuela was the third largest supplier \nof oil to the U.S. If this crisis continues, Americans could suffer \nprice increases at the gas pump, the grocery store, and in their \nheating bills this winter.\n  However, if this country is allowed to move forward with development \nin the 1002 area, and we are again faced with oil embargoes, war, or \nfurther terrorist attacks, it will be possible to mitigate those \nhardships, by increasing our reliance on domestic production from \nAlaska's North Slope.\n  The fields in ANWR are the best bet for significant oil finds in the \nUnited States. Assuming 9.4 billion barrels are economically \nrecoverable at a world market price of $24 per barrel, development of \nANWR's oil fields would be roughly 1.4 million barrels per day. By \n2015, projected U.S. oil imports will be 15.25 million barrels per day \nand petroleum use is estimated at 24.26 million barrels per day. This \nwould mean that peak production in the 1002 area could reduce U.S. \nimports by a significant 9 percent by 2015.\n  As our technologies advance, more and more of the oil present in the \n1002 area will become technically recoverable. Should the prices of oil \nsignificantly increase over time, more oil from ANWR will become \neconomically recoverable. The amount of economically recoverable oil \nestimated in the 1002 area is comparable to the giant field at Prudhoe \nBay, now estimated to have held 11-13 billion barrels.\n  Opponents insist that drilling in ANWR will not alleviate our \ndependence on foreign oil. They assume that ANWR's oil will be sold to \nthe highest bidder and therefore can just as easily be sold abroad as \nsold domestically. The amendment currently being debated in the Senate \nwould limit the exportation of oil from ANWR to Israel alone. In \naddition, H.R. 4 contains a provision which prohibits the exportation \nof oil under a lease in the 1002 area, as a condition of the lease.\n  Development of ANWR's resources could bring jobs to every state in \nthe union. Further development of the North Slope is expected to create \nbetween 60,000 and 735,000 new jobs, depending on the amount of oil \nfound, the price of oil, and the unemployment rate at the time of \ndevelopment. For this reason, the International Brotherhood of \nTeamsters and several other labor unions have spoken out publicly in \nsupport of ANWR development. According to James P. Hoffa, Teamsters \ngeneral president, ``Working families are about to be caught between a \nrecession and a deepening energy crisis. By tapping into petroleum \nresources in Alaska, we can create jobs and stabilize our economy by \nlessening our dependence on foreign oil.''\n  Revenues from any recovered resource will be split between the \nFederal Government and the State of Alaska. According to the Alaska \nStatehood Act and the Mineral Leasing Act, Alaska should be treated \nlike any other State where revenues are split 90/10, in favor of the \nState. However, Congress could, as they have in HR. 4, establish a \ndifferent arrangement, where the revenue sharing formula is 50/50. \nFederal revenues would be enhanced by billions of dollars from bonus \nbids, lease rentals, royalties and taxes. Estimates in 1995 on bonus \nbids alone were $2.6 billion. The Inupiat tribe sees development as a \ngood move for their economy too, since they are only allowed to develop \ntheir subsurface mineral resources, if the Federal Government develops \nthe 1002 area.\n  Opponents argue that a six month supply of oil hardly seems worth \ndestroying America's Serengeti. However, the ``6-month'' argument is \nmisleading. This figure assumes that all U.S. consumption will be met \nby ANWR, that we will not produce any oil domestically, and that we \nwill not import any oil whatsoever. This is actually an impossible \nscenario. All of the oil in the 1002 area can not be removed within a \n6-month time frame. Furthermore, it would be impossible to move that \nmuch oil via the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline during such a short time frame. \nA much more realistic scenario is to say that there is enough oil in \nthe 1002 area to curtail all imports from Iraq over the lifetime of the \n1002 oilfields.\n  Drilling in ANWR will not alleviate an immediate energy crisis or \nsolve any of our immediate needs. Depending on the time it takes to \nnavigate through the permitting process, full scale production in the \n1002 area is likely to take 7-12 years. However, development in the \n1002 area will help to mitigate future problems stemming from a \nreliance on foreign oil and a shortage of domestic energy sources.\n  We need a comprehensive energy policy which, while developing \nconventional resources, also includes energy conservation and research \ninto renewable power generation. There are many very promising \nrenewable energy sources currently being researched and developed. \nHowever, it will likely take at least a decade to bring renewable \ntechnologies into the market place. I feel it is important that as we \npursue new and innovative technologies, we continue to develop our \nconventional fuels to guarantee a vibrant economy, jobs, and our \nnational security.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to \namendment No. 3132 to the energy bill allowing for the opening of the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration and development. My \ndecision to oppose this amendment was not made lightly. It was made \nafter much thought and deliberation and after carefully reviewing all \nof the information available.\n  I think it is important to put today's debate in context with the \n1980 decision by Congress to set aside the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. In 1980, just before the election of Ronald Reagan, this \ncountry was in the middle of economic disaster, the Carter ``malaise.'' \nOur Nation was just exiting a terrible energy crisis; we were suffering \nfrom stagflation; the Middle East was in crisis with Americans being \nheld hostage\n\n[[Page S2884]]\n\nin Iran; and gas prices, adjusted for 2002 dollars, were well over $2 \nper gallon. Yet it was in that atmosphere that the United States Senate \nestablished, by a 78-14 vote, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and \nprohibited drilling in the refuge. That strong bipartisan decision was \nsupported by the overwhelming majority of both Republicans and \nDemocrats, conservative and liberal, including many of both parties who \nare still in the Senate today. I believe that was the right decision \nthen, and I believe the Senate should maintain its support for \nprotecting this wildlife refuge.\n  My support for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is nothing new. In \nfact, in 1990, I was a cosponsor of legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives to designate the wildlife refuge as wilderness in order \nto ensure protection from oil and gas exploration. I believed then, as \nI do now, this area represents one of our last complete and unspoiled \narctic ecosystems in the world. It is a very special place deserving \nprotection. While I have been a supporter for exploration of many areas \nof this country, in fact some areas that arctic drilling proponents \nhave opposed, I believe it is a different case to drill and develop in \na designated wildlife refuge that was set aside because of its \nwilderness qualities by Congress.\n  I would like to quickly address the provisions in the amendment that \nlimit the exploration and development infrastructure to 2,000 acres. I \nthink that there are misconceptions about what these provisions \nactually do. This provision reads, ``the maximum amount of surface \nacreage covered by production and support facilities, including \nairstrips and any areas covered by gravel berms or piers for support of \npipelines, does not exceed 2,000 acres on the Coastal Plain.'' \nSupporters of this amendment believe that this provision will limit \nproduction to just 2,000 acres of the coastal plain, an area about the \nsize of a large airport.\n  What needs to be kept in mind, is that the oil reserves in ANWR are \nnot found in a concentrated area. They are spread out over the coastal \nplain in various pockets that differ in size. Production activities \nwill not be limited to just one section of the coastal plain. Oil rigs, \npipelines and other facilities will be spread throughout the area, \nresulting in a spider-web effect of infrastructure than could cover \nmuch of the coastal plain. This is especially true since pipelines are \nnot included in the amendment, just the support beams. To put this all \nin perspective, the infrastructure associated with existing oil \ndevelopment on the North Slope has a ``footprint,'' as defined in this \namendment, of 12,000-acres, but in reality covers an area of more than \n640,000 acres, or 1,000 square miles. It is safe to assume that in this \namendment the so-called 2,000 acre limitation in ANWR would likely \nimpact an area over 50 times that size.\n  This Nation must have a comprehensive energy strategy that ensures a \nreliable, environmentally friendly, safe and economic supply of energy. \nI applaud President Bush for his commitment and I am proud to be a \nstrong supporter of nearly all of his plan. I have been a long advocate \nof incentives for next generation vehicles and alternative fuels. These \nare vehicles that will not only provide clean transportation, but will \ndramatically reduce our oil dependency. I have also introduced \nlegislation providing incentives for the construction of energy \nefficient buildings. However, I do not believe that allowing oil \ndevelopment in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the right answer.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Arctic \nnational Wildlife Refuge or ANWR. As my good friend and colleague from \nAlaska Senator Stevens has outlined, oil and gas exploration in ANWR is \nnot a new issue. In fact, it is an issue that was contemplated when \nCongress expanded the boundaries of the Arctic national Wildlife Refuge \nin 1980, by requiring the Department of Interior to prepare a detailed \nstudy on the Coastal Plain area and recommend how it should be managed.\n  The Department of Interior's study recommended that the entire area \nbe made available for oil and gas leasing, describing it as ``the most \noutstanding petroleum exploration target in the onshore United \nStates.'' Despite this recommendation, no action has been taken an ANWR \nthe intervening years except for the 1996 Budget Reauthorization Act \nauthorizing the opening of ANWR which was retold by President Clinton.\n  I understand that there is a push and pull between those who believe \nwe should strive to achieve energy independence by drilling in ANWR and \nthose who feel that we should protect the environment and preserve \nANWR. But, I believe that we can do both. We have come a long way since \nthe very first oil fields were drilled. Today we have the ability, the \ntechnology and the know-how to drill in ANWR and protect and preserve \nthe environment.\n  What is more, we are not proposing to drill in the entire Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge as one might assume when they listen to our \ndebate. In fact, this amendment will only allow for drilling on 2,000 \nacres of the total 19 million acres that encompasses the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n  The events of September 11th have made it glaringly obvious that the \ntime has come for the United States Congress to step up to the plate \nand take an active interest and an active role in securing our nation's \nenergy future. We can no longer sit on the side lines and assume that \nwind energy, solar panels, and battery packs are going to advance our \nNation's energy interest. No matter how many tax credits we force on \nalternative fuels or how much money we devote to research into these \ntechnologies, the fact remains that our country is increasingly \ndependent on foreign sources of oil.\n  The reality of the situation is that our Nation is more reliant on \nforeign sources of oil today than it was during World War II. This \ndespite CAFE standards and other investments in alternative fuel \nvehicles. The Energy Information Administration estimates that in the \nnext 20 years America's demand for oil is projected to increase by 33 \npercent. Yet as consumption increases, U.S. production continues to \ndecrease. I think that is a frightening fact and I believe that we must \naddress it by increasing domestic production. If this means that we \nneed to drill in ANWR, then we must drill in ANWR.\n  Today, foreign imports supply 60 percent of our Nation's consumption. \nThis dependence makes us vulnerable. It is not in our national interest \nto continue to be beholden to volatile foreign countries for our energy \nneeds.\n  This country needs a rational energy policy. And we need a national \nenergy policy that includes new sources of production so that we have \naccess to our own energy supplies. Without our own energy supplies, \nthis country will continue its increasing dependence on volatile \nforeign sources that could be terminated at any moment.\n  We cannot continue to put more and more power in the hands of foreign \nsuppliers, foreign countries. ANWR has the potential to produce over \none million barrels of oil a day. One million barrels a day is enough \nto replace the volume that we currently import from Saudi Arabia or \nIraq for more than 25 years.\n  Energy independence should be our long-term goal. But reducing our \nreliance on foreign energy sources should be our short-term goal. This \ncountry needs a balanced national energy policy that encompasses these \ngoals. We need an energy policy that protects the environment, \nincreases the efficient and effective use of renewables, encourages \ndiversification of generating capacity AND most importantly, increases \nour domestic production. ANWR presents the United States with enormous \npotential for increasing domestic production. I think that we would be \nfools to pass up such an important opportunity for our Nation.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join with me in supporting this \namendment to allow oil and gas exploration in ANWR.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in my 22 years in the Senate, there has \nnot been a more heavily lobbied issue than ANWR and there has not been \na tougher vote. It is especially difficult because of my commitment to \nprotecting the environment for future generations, including my own \ngrandchildren, as evidenced by my strong environmental voting record.\n  After extensive deliberation, I have decided to vote for cloture, to \ncut off debate, for a composite of reasons: 1. The United States needs \nto become independent of OPEC oil; 2. this modified legislation greatly \nreduces the environmental impact; 3. Federal funds\n\n[[Page S2885]]\n\nfrom ANWR would cover legacy retiree health costs for steel workers to \nallow for re-structuring to save the American steel industry and tens \nof thousands of jobs, including thousands for Pennsylvanians.\n  Many steps must be taken to free the U.S. from dependence on OPEC \noil. To rely on the Saudis, let alone Iraq and Iran, is to court \ndisaster. Our reliance on Arab oil has broad-ranging implications on \nour policy in the Mid-East including our support for Israel.\n  In this bill, I have voted for a significant increase in renewables \nto generate more energy from wind, the sun, biomass, hydropower and \ngeothermal sources. I have supported expanded tax credits for clean \ncoal and conservation measures including increasing mileage \nrequirements for motor vehicles.\n  While I would prefer not to open ANWR to drilling if we could become \nindependent of OPEC oil without it, I have visited ANWR and believe \nthat significant steps have been taken to reduce the incursion, such as \na reduced footprint through multi-directional drilling, ice roads and \nwinter season drilling.\n  This legislation also allows for the use of funds from ANWR to cover \nso-called legacy costs for retired steel workers which would enable re-\nstructuring of the domestic industry which is vital for national \nsecurity. More than thirty steel companies have filed for bankruptcy in \nthe past few years and tens of thousands of steel workers have lost \ntheir jobs. The recently imposed tariffs on imported steel gives the \nindustry a three-year period for re-structuring with consolidation of \nmany potentially failing companies into a company which could compete \nwith foreign steel producers. That consolidation could not take place \nif the acquiring company has to assume the legacy costs. Federal funds \nderived from ANWR would be used to cover such legacy costs and permit \nconsolidation.\n  Another consideration in my vote to invoke cloture is my view that \nthe Senate should not require 60 votes for passage, a super majority, \nunless there is a great principle at issue, such as civil rights or \ncivil liberties. Regrettably, a practice has evolved in the Senate to \nrequire cloture or 60 votes to pass legislation which is contrary to \nthe fundamental principle, that in a democracy, decisions should be \nmade by a majority.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I express my opposition to drilling \nin the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I oppose drilling in the Arctic \nRefuge because it is both poor energy policy and poor environmental \npolicy.\n  A sound energy policy is critical to our Nation's security. The \nUnited States is currently 56 percent dependent on foreign oil. By \n2020, this number could rise to 70 percent. At that time, over 64 \npercent of the world's oil exports will come from Persian Gulf nations, \na prospect that causes me great concern.\n  In light of our increasing dependence on a profoundly undependable \nsource of oil, we must ask ourselves what course do we now chart for \nour Nation's energy policy? Should we rush to deplete our last major \nreserve of oil, or should we increase conservation and develop \nalternative technologies that will allow our children to enjoy a better \nquality of life?\n  President Teddy Roosevelt once said: ``I recognize the right and duty \nof this generation to develop and use our natural resources, but I do \nnot recognize the right to waste them, or to rob by wasteful use, the \ngenerations that come after us.''\n  Americans have a right to develop our energy resources, but not to \nwaste them. We could do far more to reduce our reliance on foreign oil \nby increasing the efficiency of our automobiles than by drilling in the \nArctic. Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge today would be \nakin to wasting resources that should rightfully be there for future \ngenerations. We must embrace an ethic of stewardship of our most \ntreasured national resources.\n  Instead of rushing to deplete what is likely the last major oil \nreserve in the United States, we should instead promote energy \nefficiency and develop alternative technologies. Doing so will not only \nmake more of an immediate difference than drilling in the Arctic, but \nit will also ensure that we leave our children with ample energy \nsupplies and a broader array of energy options.\n  We can achieve greater and more immediate energy security by \nincreasing our energy efficiency. According to testimony heard before \nthe Senate Government Affairs Committee, the United States could cut \nour dangerous reliance on foreign oil by more than 50 percent by \nincreasing energy efficiency by 2.2 percent per year. This would do far \nmore to reduce our reliance on foreign oil than would drilling in ANWR, \nand the benefits could start almost immediately, not in 10 years. I \nnote that the United States has a tremendous record of increasing \nenergy efficiency when we put our minds to it: following the 1979 OPEC \nenergy shock, the United States increased its energy efficiency by 3.2 \npercent per year for several years. With today's improvements in \ntechnology, 2.2 percent is attainable.\n  I am disappointed that the Senate last month failed to adopt higher \nautomobile fuel economy standards. The Senate had the chance to save \nmore than twice as much oil as is in the Arctic Refuge by simply \nincreasing fuel economy standards. That proposal, which I cosponsored, \nwould have saved consumers billions of dollars in annual gasoline bills \nwhile doing more to reduce our reliance on foreign oil than any other \nsingle measure.\n  It was Republican President Dwight Eisenhower who first set aside the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge. In his parting words from the Oval \nOffice, President Eisenhower told the Nation: ``As we peer into \nsociety's future, . . . [we] must avoid the impulse to live only for \ntoday, plundering for our own ease and convenience, the precious \nresources of tomorrow.'' Although the Arctic Refuge may seem to some to \nbe the easiest and most convenient source of oil available, drilling in \nthe Arctic Refuge will not solve our energy problems. I urge my \ncolleagues to increase our energy efficiency, develop alternative \nenergy sources, and preserve our precious Arctic resources so that our \nchildren will have the freedom to make their own choice concerning this \nvast wilderness reserve.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to speak about today's vote \nto end debate on the two pending amendments to authorize oil and gas \ndevelopment in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  In past years, I have voted in support of exploring development \noptions in ANWR as part of budget reconciliation measures. I believed \nthat was the right vote. I was not an expert on the issue and I \nbelieved that further deliberation was warranted.\n  Unfortunately, the information presented to us consistently reveals \nwidely varying predictions of actual oil potential and economic \nbenefits, as well as various scenarios of possible impacts on wildlife \nand the environment. Even government studies are not conclusive and \nraise more questions than they answer. The various interpretations have \nalready been debated by each side, and I need not rehash them now.\n  However, several factors are clear to me.\n  Oil and gas could be recovered from ANWR many years from now, but not \nwithout considerable costs to taxpayers.\n  Most scientific analyses conclude that both the land and wildlife \nwould adversely be impacted by development.\n  The two Alaska Native communities most impacted by this debate are \nsplit in their positions on this issue.\n  Even if ANWR were authorized for development, we would still rely on \nimported oil supplies and require other sources of energy development \nand generation.\n  I, too, am concerned about our Nation's dependence on foreign oil \nsupplies. Unless we act in some comprehensive manner on several fronts, \nincluding conservation measures and greater use of nuclear and other \nforms of alternative energy generation, our current dependence on \nforeign oil could increase from 56 percent to 70 percent in less than \n20 years.\n  With respect to taking truly effective action to reduce our oil \ndependence, regrettably the Senate rejected a more effective measure to \nmodestly increase fuel efficiency standards, a proposal that would \nsubstantially decrease our Nation's dependence on foreign oil and also \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. Had we adopted an increase of fuel \nefficiency standards to 36 mpg average by 2013, we could have \npotentially saved 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2020\n\n[[Page S2886]]\n\nwhich is about equal to present imports from the Persian Gulf. This \nprudent conservation measure would also save twice as much, if not \nmore, oil than what is in ANWR.\n  Opening the refuge could only meet about 2 to 5 percent of the \nNation's oil needs, at best. Even some oil company executives have \nexpressed doubts about drilling in ANWR, as stated by one: ``Big oil \ncompanies go where there are substantial fields and where they can \nproduce oil economically . . . does ANWR have that? Who knows?''\n  Let me also say that the answer to threats posed by the regime of \nSaddam Hussein is not to drill in ANWR but to end his regime sooner \nrather than later. Drilling in ANWR will not remove the clear and \npresent danger posed by Hussein and will not stop in any way whatsoever \nhis weapons of mass destruction program or for that matter his \n``inspiring and financing a culture of political murder and suicide \nbombing,'' as Defense Secretary Rumsfeld so aptly described his lawless \nand murderous behavior.\n  I also wish to comment briefly about the second-degree amendment \noffered to the underlying ANWR amendment to divert a majority of \nrevenues derived from oil and gas development to retirement and other \nbenefits for the steel industry.\n  I am not against our steel workers. They helped build our Nation and \nare among the hardest working people in America. But to underwrite \ntheir retirement in a transparent effort to attract more votes is very \nbad policy. What do we say to all the other workers who are also \nsuffering during economic hard times? Are we going to say, ``sorry, but \ngiving royalties to folks in your industry won't get us the votes we \nneed to pass our bill''?\n  Miners, teachers, construction laborers, and many other hard-working \nAmericans have seen their jobs, benefits, and pensions endangered by \nthe recent hard economic times. Yet, they would not benefit from this \nproposal. Nor would our veterans, who undoubtably could use more help \npaying for their medical bills. These last-minute tactics are not a \ncredit to this deliberative body and only serve to increase the \npublic's skepticism of government.\n  America will need oil for the foreseeable future. What gives this \ngeneration the right to deplete this vital resource when we have the \nopportunity to preserve it for the benefit of future generations? At \nthe end of our day, we still have prudent alternatives to ANWR to meet \nour energy demands and we should aggressively pursue them. A more acute \nenergy need than our own in the future may require development, where \nassurances of improved technology may better protect the environment. \nWith other viable energy options available to us today, to approve ANWR \ndrilling would be a dereliction of our duty to posterity.\n  Teddy Roosevelt, the champion of conservation, once said: \n``Conservation means development as much as it does protection. I \nrecognize the right and duty of this generation to develop and use the \nnatural resources of our land; but I do not recognize the right to \nwaste them, or rob, by wasteful use, the generations that come after \nus.''\n  I have thought long and hard about this debate and the vote that I \nwill cast. I still hope we can achieve a more balanced national energy \nstrategy, but I am not convinced that a key component of that policy \nshould be to drill in ANWR. I will vote against the motions to invoke \ncloture on these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls 10 minutes. \nThe Senator from New Mexico has 14\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am informed Senator Daschle wishes to \nspeak and is going to be coming to the floor in a few minutes to do \nthat. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, is time running off the side of the \nmajority at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is running off the time of the majority.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We are playing games here, Mr. President, so I ask \nunanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes at this time, \nand I would appreciate the Chair reminding me when half my time is up. \nMy understanding is that is in 5 minutes.\n  I want to show a chart. We had the Senator from California talk a \nlittle bit about refuges. This happens to be a producing well in a \nrefuge in California. It is near San Francisco. The point is, there are \nrefuges in many States, as additional charts will show.\n  Be that as it may, I am not going to belabor that point because there \nare a few other issues on which we need to reflect.\n  Today we are seeing headlines: ``Summer Gasoline Prices Again Headed \nHigher.''\n  We also see information coming at us from the Mideast relative to the \ncrisis, and Saddam Hussein advises that oil is going to be used as a \nweapon.\n  Oil as a weapon. We remember the last time we saw a weapon in this \ncountry, it was an aircraft being used as a weapon--two aircraft, three \naircraft. There was the Pentagon, there was the New York Twin Towers, \nand there was the terrible crash in Pennsylvania.\n  This is as a consequence, to some degree, of our continued reliance \non imported oil. We have heard a lot on the other side relative to ANWR \nand what it would contribute. Let me identify for the record--and this \nis from the Energy Institute--crude oil imports relative to the annual \nreport for the year 2002. Opening ANWR would reduce oil dependence from \n66 percent in 2020 to 62 percent by 2024; 58 percent by 2020 in a high \ncase. So we have a low case, a mean, and a high.\n  The significance is what it does relative to domestic production. \nAssuming the USGS mean case for oil in ANWR, there would be an increase \nof domestic production by 13.9 percent; assuming a higher case for \noil--and this is USGS figures--25 percent of total domestic production, \nan increase--well, the increase is clearly substantial.\n  I think what a lot of people have forgotten in this debate is what we \nare debating. This second degree amendment, of course, provides funding \nfor the rejuvenation of the American steel industry, with the proceeds \nfrom ANWR. But for a moment, let us reflect on the fact that passing \nthe underlying amendment does not automatically open ANWR. In this \namendment, we have given the President the authority to open ANWR. The \nPresident has to certify to Congress that the exploration, development, \nand production of the oil and gas resources in the ANWR Coastal Plain \nare in the U.S. national, economic, and security interests. I think we \nshould trust our President to make that decision. Clearly, at a time \nwhen the Mideast is in an inferno and we are 58 percent dependent, we \nshould trust our President to make this decision.\n  Further, there is a 2,000-acre limitation on surface disturbance. \nThat is in the House bill. There is an export ban, with the exception \nof exports to Israel. Under the Israeli oil supply agreement, we are \nextending it through the year 2014. There are 1.5 million acres of \nwilderness in ANWR, in exchange for opening approximately the 1.5 \nmillion acres of the Coastal Plain. We believe that is a responsible \nexchange.\n  We talk about a process. This is what I find totally unacceptable. \nOne might say we were defeated before we even started on this project. \nWhy? Well, because the majority leader basically pulled away from the \ncommittee of jurisdiction the process of developing out of that \ncommittee an orderly transition and development of a bill that could be \nbrought to the floor and voted on by 50 votes.\n  We had 50 votes. We were victorious, and the Democratic leader knew \nit, but\n\n[[Page S2887]]\n\nhe pulled the bill from the Energy Committee and put us in a position \nof having to come up with 60 votes, and that is where we are today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I guess one could say when we had control of the \nSenate the last time, 55 to 45 in 1995, we passed ANWR. President \nClinton vetoed it. Now it is a different story in the Senate. We have \n50/49/1. That is the reality associated with this issue.\n  The final point I want to make relative to the majority leader and \nhis handling of this bill is one that I think bears consideration by \nall Members of this body. He said, even if we get 60 votes, we are not \ngoing to get ANWR because he will pull the energy bill.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Rockefeller was scheduled to speak. \nOf his time, which is 10 minutes, we yield 3 minutes to the manager of \nthe bill, Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will summarize some points we have \nmade several times before. I think this debate has been useful in that \nall the arguments have been heard extensively. I do think it is an \nimportant issue.\n  I commend the Senators from Alaska for their efforts to move ahead. I \ndo not favor going ahead with opening ANWR to drilling, and I think \nthis is a debate which has continued, frankly, for decades in this \nSenate and in this country.\n  My own view is the long-term energy needs of our country can be best \nmet with a balanced, comprehensive bill, which we are trying hard to \nenact and perfect in the Senate, that encourages domestic production in \nways that are not environmentally objectionable to a substantial \nportion of our population. I mentioned those.\n  There are substantial opportunities for us to increase production on \nthe North Slope of Alaska. There are substantial opportunities for us \nto increase production in the Rocky Mountain region, and I know that is \ngoing to be objectionable to some people, but we have a lot of \nproduction in my State. I think there are opportunities for additional \nproduction. There is a lot of opportunity for increased production in \nthe gulf that we can benefit from substantially.\n  In addition to that domestic production, though, we need to have a \nheavy emphasis on increased efficiency. There is no reason we cannot \nuse the new technology that has been developed to reduce dependence on \nforeign sources of oil. I regret some of the earlier votes we have had \non this bill in that regard. I will not revisit that right now, but I \nwill say there are opportunities for us to pursue an enlightened policy \nthat positions us better in the future with regard to our energy needs. \nMeeting those needs and opening ANWR to drilling is not a necessary \npart of that.\n\n  I do not support it as an environmental policy, and I do not support \nit as part of this energy bill. We will have a good opportunity to \nexpress views on that in these upcoming two votes, and Members know \nexactly what the issues are. There is no mystery about that.\n  With regard to the first of the votes we are going to cast, it is \ncomplicated by the fact that we have had loaded in there provisions \nrelating to the steel industry and the legacy issues related to the \nsteel industry. I have said before, and I reiterate, this is not the \nright place to deal with those issues. I support trying to find a \nsolution to those problems, but this is not the right place to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. How much time is remaining now on the majority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes is available to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  Mr. REID. That time is yielded to the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nRockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I want to read one paragraph of a \nletter from the United Steelworkers of America which was given to me \nlast night. It says:\n\n       The United Steelworkers of America support you--\n\n  That happens to be me----\n\n     now and will continue to support you as you go forward to \n     explore every avenue for the passage of this vital \n     legislation [the legacy costs for health care].\n       In the last 2 weeks, despite every effort, the White House \n     and the Republican leadership in the House and Senate refused \n     to grant the ironclad assurances necessary to go forward with \n     legacy costs legislation as part of the energy bill. In fact, \n     the inaction of the White House and the Republican leadership \n     shows a total lack of concern for the 600,000 steelworkers \n     who have or are about to lose their retiree health care.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remainder of this letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               United Steelworkers of America,\n\n                                   Pittsburgh, PA, April 17, 2002.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Rockefeller: I want to thank you for your \n     continuing efforts to obtain a retiree health care program \n     that will address the needs of hundreds of thousands of \n     Steelworker retirees. The United Steelworkers of America \n     support you now and will continue to support you as you go \n     forward to explore every avenue for the passage of this vital \n     legislation.\n       In the last two weeks, despite every effort, the White \n     House and the Republican leadership in the House and Senate \n     refused to grant the ironclad assurances necessary to go \n     forward with legacy costs legislation as part of the Energy \n     bill. In fact, the inaction of the White House and the \n     Republican leadership shows a total lack of concern for the \n     600,000 steelworkers who have, or are about to lose, their \n     retiree health care.\n       Without your consent or the support of the United \n     Steelworkers of America, the Republican leadership has \n     attached the legacy costs legislation to an amendment that \n     would open Alaska to new oil exploration and production. The \n     United Steelworkers of America oppose this action. The issue \n     of ANWR stands alone. This is not the way to obtain legacy \n     costs relief.\n       What the Steelworkers do support is the legacy costs \n     legislation that you will introduce today, co-sponsored by \n     Senator Specter of Pennsylvania.\n       In the coming weeks, we will work with you and other \n     Senators on both sides of the aisle in order to build a \n     broad-based grassroots campaign to ensure the speedy \n     enactment of legacy costs relief. We urge the Republican \n     leadership not to call for a vote on the Stevens' Amendment. \n     Our members, and in particular our 600,000 retirees, their \n     dependents and surviving spouses, deserve serious \n     consideration of this problem, not political exploitation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Leo W. Gerard,\n                                          International President.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have consistently, over the years, \nvoted against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge area. I \nwill oppose both the Murkowski and the Stevens amendments. As a refuge, \nANWR is protected land, intended to ensure the national diversity of \nwildlife, to ensure quality in water and conservation, and to provide \nsubsistence living for Native Americans who have lived in that region \nfor many generations.\n  The Coastal Plain within the refuge is targeted by some, as we well \nknow, for oil exploration while only 8 percent of this refuge, the \nplain, is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including polar bears, \ncaribou, and 100 species of birds.\n  ANWR is likely to produce, at best, 2 percent of America's oil demand \nin a given year if the oil, in fact, is there. Extracting it, if it is \nthere, will be extremely costly. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, ANWR would not under any circumstances start \nproducing oil for at least 7 years, or perhaps as many as 12 years.\n  The limited amount of oil and the problems extracting it make it \nclear we should not risk opening the refuge, which is the last 5 \npercent of Alaska's vast North Slope that remains protected. There are \nother, better ways to promote domestic oil production and other more \neffective ways to deal with our country's energy needs.\n  In addition to opening ANWR to oil exploration, Senator Stevens--who \nin my work with him acted in total honor and integrity, which is part \nand parcel of his nature--adds a provision that appears to provide \nhealth care benefits to retired steelworkers and also coal miners. They \nrelate to ANWR. He links the two. If that were a real possibility, it \nwould be very hard to resist for somebody like me, who has been \nfighting for\n\n[[Page S2888]]\n\nsteelworkers who have been going downhill.\n  However, no matter how genuine the Senator from Alaska is--and he \nis--he has been unable to secure any kind of support for either \nhimself, myself, or anybody else from the White House that it would \nsupport it through the conference committee. Remember, the House has \npassed this bill. ANWR is in it; there is no steel. Therefore, no \nmatter what we do, it has to go to conference. The whole problem is \nthey would then drop legacy costs for steel and coal miners and keep \nANWR, and that would be easy, unless, of course, the White House \ncommitted and the House committed not to do so. Senator Stevens asked \nfor that kind of commitment and was given no such commitment \nwhatsoever. That leaves an empty promise.\n  It basically says: Vote for me on what I want and when your turn \ncomes, I will consider what you want. In addition, the White House said \nthey would not even consider sending a letter of any sort until they \nhad 60 votes on ANWR. That is the same thing as saying: Give us 60 \nvotes; we will write you some kind of a letter, and steel will get \ndropped in conference.\n  No. No. I represent West Virginia, as well as the United States of \nAmerica and steelworkers and other people everywhere. I am not a part \nof anything of that sort. I will not and cannot support the effort of \nthe Senator from Alaska to add steel retiree legacy costs to the ANWR \namendment, although I am very sympathetic with what his predicament is. \nIt is the same predicament I face. I have great respect for the \nSenator. His amendment offers nothing to steelworkers across this \nNation, through no fault of his own.\n  The American steel industry and retired steelworkers were struggling \nin the face of an unprecedented steel crisis. They deserve help from \ntheir Government and need help. The steel industry is not a casual \nindustry. It is no less strong in its meaning to America than the oil \nindustry, but nobody seems to care about the steel industry. Not that \nmany States produce steel, and half the Senators from those States do \nnot care. It is a discouraging situation.\n  The steelworkers deserve straight talk about what the administration \nis prepared to do to help them, not political gain. There are nearly \n100,000 steelworkers without health care benefits today. Most are \nformer LTV workers who lost their benefits less than 8 months ago. Some \nare workers of American steel companies that went bankrupt waiting for \nthe President to act on section 201, which was the matter of tariffs \nfor unfair trade practices. There are hundreds of thousands of \nsteelworkers whose health benefits are in imminent jeopardy without \nsome help. There is an urgent need for legislation to restore the \nhealth benefits and to protect the steelworker health benefits that are \nat risk.\n\n  I want my colleagues to know for months and months I have tried in \nevery way I possibly could to try to get the White House to have some \nsense of empathy for this situation. They did the tariffs. All that did \nwas buy time. It did nothing for the steel industry. You have to have \nlegacy followed by consolidation. Without consolidation, there is no \nsteel industry. Without legacy there is no consolidation. It has to be \ntariffs, legacy, consolidation. They said no to legacy.\n  Don Evans, Secretary of Commerce, was on one of the Sunday shows. He \nsaid: That is up to the Congress to pass.\n  Well, there is a Republican House, a one-vote organizing majority in \nthe Senate, and a Republican White House. What do you think that says? \nWe are not interested.\n  It is, unfortunately, the steel industry that is not a priority for \nthis administration. I am disappointed but not surprised. I am \ndisappointed. I am bitter about it. I will be back about it. I will be \nback on this because I represent steelworkers.\n  There has never been a single solitary indication that this \nadministration would support the concept of legacy relief. The \nPresident's refusal to make a commitment to retired steelworkers at \nthis point sends a very chilling message to every steelworker, every \nsteel company in the United States of America that this White House \nsimply does not care about the long-term well-being of the steel \nindustry. I don't know how I can reach any other conclusion. I tried to \nwork with them, but there could be no other conclusion.\n  For our own industrial manufacturing base, of which steelworkers are \n14 percent in West Virginia, for our national security interests, we \nall have a vested interest in doing something about steel. I conclude \nby saying, again, please do not be fooled by the linking of drilling \nand legacy costs. This amendment is misleading. There will be \nlegislation introduced in this body that will represent a meaningful \nway to protect steel retiree benefits, but this is not the vehicle. \nDrilling in and of itself is wrong.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against both the Stevens amendment and \nthe Murkowski amendment.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask how much time remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls 4 minutes and \nthe other side controls 8 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time remains on the side of \nthe majority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has no time remaining.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, obviously, I have the availability of \nleader time, but in the interest of moving these votes along, it is \nimportant we try to stay as close to schedule as we can.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have now been debating how best to \nreshape our Nation's energy policy for 24 days.\n  Time and again, we have heard our Republican colleagues say that \nopening Alaska's arctic wilderness is the cornerstone of their energy \npolicy.\n  Time and again, we have said, if that is the case, then offer an \namendment to that effect.\n  Time and again, they declined.\n  I am mystified as to why it has taken us so long to get to this \npoint, but now that we are here, I want to talk about the substance of \nthis amendment, because I support policies that will encourage domestic \nproduction of oil and gas.\n  I also believe that we need a comprehensive and balanced energy \npolicy that will help to meet our Nation's critical energy needs.\n  But, given the fact that drilling in the Arctic Refuge won't increase \nour energy independence, but will have an adverse impact on the \nwildlife refuge--I believe that it does not belong as part of our \nNation's energy policy.\n  America's appetite for energy continues to grow each year. Over the \nnext 10 years, the United States is expected to consume roughly 1.5 \ntrillion gallons of gasoline. At the same time, the United States holds \nonly 3 percent of the known world oil reserves.\n  Even if we drilled in everybody's back yard, we could never meet our \nown demand with our own supply.\n  That is not to say that we shouldn't drill for oil and gas in the \nUnited States--to the contrary, we can and we should.\n  But we cannot simply drill our way out of this problem, and we should \nnot be drilling in environmentally sensitive areas.\n  Supporters of drilling in the Arctic Refuge have used every possible \nopportunity to justify their position.\n  When we were experiencing rising oil prices, supporters said it would \nmake oil available quickly and drive prices down in the process.\n  But even if Congress were to authorize drilling in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge today, we would not see significant quantities \nof oil produced from the refuge for 8 years at the earliest.\n  When our economy began to slow, supporters began billing it as an \neconomic stimulus measure, saying it will create 750,000 jobs.\n  Yet that number comes from an outdated and biased study commissioned \nby the American Petroleum Institute. Recent, more credible estimates by \nthe Congressional Research Service, the Joint Economic Committee and \nothers suggest that less than one-tenth that number would actually be \ncreated.\n  And now, as we see volatility in a number of oil-producing nations, \nthose same supporters are saying that drilling in ANWR is vital to \nincreasing our energy independence.\n  But estimates of the amount of oil that might potentially be \navailable if\n\n[[Page S2889]]\n\nwe drilled in the Arctic Refuge average around 3.2 billion barrels.\n  Let me give you an important point of comparison: if we all put \nreplacement tires on our cars that were as good as the ones that came \nwith the cars when they were new, the resulting increase in efficiency \nwould save 5.4 billion gallons of oil--70 percent more than the total \namount of oil in the Arctic Refuge.\n  Perhaps the most cynical attempt to justify drilling in the arctic \nrefuge was the most recent. It was an attempt to link drilling in ANWR \nto an issue that many of my colleagues care about--the issue of health \nand retirement benefits for laid-off steelworkers.\n  All I can say is that I hope those who proposed this addition to the \nANWR amendment remember their newfound commitment to steelworkers when \nit comes time for us to debate trade adjustment assistance.\n  The bottom line is this: anytime you see a policy so desperately in \nsearch of a justification, you can count on one of two things--either \nit's not that good a policy, or it doesn't have much support.\n  Drilling in ANWR falls into both categories.\n  And here's why: right now, more than 95 percent of the Alaskan North \nSlope is already open to oil and gas drilling.\n  I find it ironic that by focusing this debate on ANWR, we are missing \nthe other opportunities to produce oil and gas in Alaska that we should \nbe encouraging.\n  The first amendment that we passed to this bill authorizes the \nconstruction of a pipeline to bring natural gas from Alaska to the \nlower 48 States.\n  There are 35 trillion cubic feet of known natural gas reserves on the \nNorth Slope of Alaska.\n  There is more we can do to encourage sensible production. We should \nexplore ways to pump the heavy crude oil that remains in the ground in \nnorthern Alaska.\n  And we should explore for oil and gas in the National Petroleum \nReserve in Alaska--the area where the 3 largest onshore oil reserves in \nthe last 10 years were found.\n  Faced with so little evidence that drilling in the Arctic Refuge \nwould do anything significant to help our economic situation or \nincrease our energy independence, some are now arguing that at the very \nleast it can be done without harming the environment, or without \nexploiting too much land.\n  But those arguments are flawed as well.\n  For 12 years--over the course of a Democratic and a Republican \nadministration--the U.S. Geological Survey studied the impact that \ndrilling in the Arctic Refuge would have on the local wildlife.\n  In March they came out with their final report--and it couldn't have \nbeen more straightforward: the wildlife in the region will be seriously \nhurt by oil development.\n  Now, some Republicans are saying that they will limit the operation \nto a 2,000 acre ``footprint,'' and the environmental damage will be \nminimal.\n  Well, ``footprint'' is a misleading term.\n  In reality, oil production on the coastal plain area would require \ncentral production facilities, drilling pads, roads, airstrips, \npipelines, water and gravel sources, base camps, construction camps, \nstorage pads, powerlines, powerplants, and possibly a coastal marine \nfacility.\n  When you add those logistical necessities to the fact that those \n2,000 acres doesn't include an additional 93,000 acres of Native \nAmerican land--you begin to see how that 2,000 acre footprint could \neasily trample a substantial amount of the coastal plain.\n  Finally, we need to recognize that this debate is about more than \njust drilling in the Arctic Refuge.\n  It is about whether we are willing to recognize that decreasing our \ndependence on foreign oil means decreasing our dependence on oil, \nperiod.\n  It is about whether we choose to pursue an energy future based upon \nthe old philosophy of dig, drill, and burn--or whether we embrace \ninnovative approaches to our energy future.\n  We need to expand production of renewable fuels, such as ethanol and \nbiodiesel, develop cars and trucks that do not run on gasoline, but on \nfuel cells or other energy technologies that we can produce here in the \nUnited States, and, in the meantime, build more innovative and \nefficient automobiles.\n  Let me give you just one example of what the innovative new approach \ncould achieve:\n  If we had fully implemented the vehicle fuel-efficiency provisions \nthat were originally in this bill--something that could have been done \nwithout affecting safety or performance--we would have saved American \ndrivers billions of dollars--and saved our Nation the same amount of \noil we are currently importing from the Persian Gulf.\n  Bold steps like that are the path to energy independence--not \nbackward steps like this.\n  Most Americans will never have the opportunity to visit the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge and see the beauty and wonder of land that has \nbeen largely untouched by humans since the dawn of time.\n  It is a tribute to the best of America that Americans still want to \nprotect that ecologically rich expanse.\n  It is a tribute to the best of America that so many people today want \nto give future generations the opportunity to see that land as it once \nwas, and always should be.\n  So I urge my colleagues to use these votes to show that we have the \ncreativity to meet our energy needs, and the character to resist \nviolating the few natural sanctuaries that we have set aside to protect \nin the process.\n  Let's defeat these amendments. I urge all my colleagues to vote \nagainst cloture.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield myself the remaining time.\n  I want my colleagues to note there is not one single thing in here \nthat increases domestic oil production in this energy bill. I find that \nunconscionable at a time when energy prices are increasing. We face \ncontinued crisis in the Middle East, and the intention of Saddam \nHussein is, in his words, ``use oil as a weapon.'' We have seen that.\n  I am very pleased to stand with Senator Stevens and recognize the \nsupport on this issue, from seafarers, teamsters, ironworkers, \nlaborers, operating engineers, plumbers, pipefitters and many other \nunions in America that recognize this legislation as good for the \nAmerican worker. A vote on the second degree which Senator Rockefeller \njust talked about is a vote for America's steel industry.\n  He didn't talk about rejuvenating the industry. This is money that \ncould come from opening ANWR, some $12 billion. It is unconscionable \nthat they are not giving serious consideration to this because we are \ntalking about passing a law; the conference is something else. Finally, \na vote for this amendment is a vote for the Native people of my State \nof Alaska. They were promised they would have access to their lands. \nThe underlying amendment would give them that.\n\n  We talk about truth today. I am going to close with one reference \nfrom the New York Times.\n\n       A Democrat from the northeast who considers himself a \n     strong environmentalist also said he once tried quietly to \n     see if he could broker a deal in which Democrats would back \n     limited exploration in the wildlife reserve and Republicans \n     would support much tougher fuel efficiency standards for cars \n     and trucks.\n       The Democrat said he quickly gave up when it became \n     apparent that the environmental organizations would not budge \n     in their opposition to new drilling.\n       ``If you told the environmentalists we would end global \n     warming once and for all in return for ANWR,'' he said, \n     ``they'd still say no.''\n\n  The truth is, what is going on here is simply the word ``greed.'' The \nso-called environmentalists are not interested in science; they are not \ninterested in the health of this planet; they are not interested in the \nwelfare of the people of my State; they are interested in only one \nthing--fundraising and keeping their high-paid jobs.\n  They know that we can explore Alaska safely; and that the wildlife \nwill not be hurt. But they know that if we win ANWR, and we will, their \nchief fundraising tool goes away. That's what this entire debate is \nabout--it is about raising money and keeping jobs for people who call \nthemselves environmentalists.\n  That is the bottom line. We could pull this bill but the people of \nAlaska are entitled to a vote and Members are entitled to stand and be \nheard. They are going to be held accountable, and that is the way it \nshould be.\n  I urge my colleagues to do what is right, what is right for America, \nnot\n\n[[Page S2890]]\n\nwhat is right for America's environmental community that has lobbied \nthis issue hell-bent for election.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I think we have about 10 amendments that \nare in the stack of regular order, but I think it is at the top.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I send a second-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], for himself and Mr. \n     Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 3144 to amendment No. \n     2999.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To make permanent the repeal of the death tax)\n\n       Strike all beginning on page 2, line 1, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . PERMANENT REPEAL OF DEATH TAXES.\n\n       Section 901 of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \n     Reconciliation Act of 2001 is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``this Act'' and all that follows through \n     ``2010.'' in subsection (a) and inserting ``this Act (other \n     than Title V) shall not apply to taxable, plan, or limitation \n     years beginning after December 31, 2010.'', and\n       (2) by striking ``, estates, gifts, and transfers'' in \n     subsection (b).\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I called for the regular order, which \nbrought up the Kerry-McCain amendment as the pending business. I have \nsent a second-degree amendment to the desk sponsored by myself and the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl. It is an amendment that makes the repeal \nof the death tax permanent.\n  I say to my colleagues this is a revenue bill. This may very well be \nthe only revenue bill we have for the remainder of this Congress. \nPerhaps there may be others, but as of today there is no guarantee that \nthere will be.\n\n[[Page S2891]]\n\n  The House is voting today to make the tax cut permanent. Senator Kyl \nand I thought the Senate should have an opportunity to have a vote on \nthat issue, and we decided if we were going to try to focus on one part \nof the tax cut, this would be the relevant part to focus on. We now \nhave a revenue measure before us, and therefore we believe this is an \nopportunity for us to fix something that is very broken.\n  I will not belabor the point because our colleagues are very familiar \nwith it, but basically because of a quirk in the Budget Act, we made \nthe tax cut temporary, and it expires in 10 years. We could have made \nit permanent had we had 60 votes, but we only had 58 votes. So we had \nto use a procedure called reconciliation.\n  Under that procedure, the tax cut expires when the reconciliation \nexpires, which is in 10 years. This produces the extraordinary anomaly \nthat every year for the next 10 years, the death tax--that is the tax \nthat is imposed on small businesses, family farms, and the wealth that \npeople build up over their lifetime by working, sacrificing, and \nsaving--will be reduced. Before we passed the tax cut, when these \npeople died, their children often have to sell the business or the \nfamily farm to give the Government up to 55 cents out of every dollar \nthey have accumulated in their lifetime.\n  We decided to repeal the death tax in our tax cut, and we decided to \nphase it out over a 10-year period. Yet because of this anomaly in the \nbudget law, if you die 9 years from now, your family does not have to \nsell your farm or business, and your children get to keep every penny \nof wealth you have accumulated on which you paid taxes once before. It \nwill belong to them. But if you die in the 10th year after the passage \nof the tax cut, the death tax returns, and they will have to sell the \nbusiness, sell the farm, or sell your assets, and give the Government \nup to 55 cents out of every dollar you have earned in your lifetime.\n  Senator Kyl and I believe that is outrageous tax policy. We think it \nis very unfair, and this is a tax measure that is in the Senate on the \nvery day the House is moving to rectify this problem by making the tax \ncut permanent.\n  Therefore, I have sent this amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Kyl and myself. I hope my colleagues will look very closely at \nit. I cannot imagine we would want to let stand a provision of law \nwhereby we repeal the death tax with great fanfare, we trumpet the fact \nthat we had done away with this evil and unfair tax, and yet 10 years \nfrom now it all comes back in its full force, its full vengeance, and \nits full negative impact on every business and every farm in America. \nThe amendment which is now pending is Senator Kyl's amendment, which I \nhave cosponsored, and I ask others who want to cosponsor it to do so. \nThe amendment would make the repeal of the death tax permanent. I thank \nmy colleagues for their indulgence. I ask them to look at this \namendment.\n  I think someone could always say, this is an energy bill. Well, this \nbill is many different things. It has literally hundreds of different \nprovisions that are more or less related--and many are less related--to \nenergy. I do not know anything that has more to do with energy than \ngiving people an incentive to work and save, with the knowledge that \nwhen they build up a farm or a business the Government is not going to \ntake it away from their children. That unleashes the most powerful \nenergy source in the universe, and that is the energy that is in the \nsoul of men and women who want to better themselves and their family.\n\n  In my mind, this is the clearest energy provision in this bill if we \nadopt it, and I commend it to my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from \nTexas and would reiterate that this is really a propitious time for us \nto deal with this issue, for the following reasons: The House of \nRepresentatives, as we speak, is taking action to pass a bill that \nwould make permanent all of the tax reform we enacted less than a year \nago. That includes the death tax repeal.\n  Second, we all recall what we did 4 days ago, on April 15, and I know \nat that time there were a lot of calls by friends on both sides of the \naisle in both bodies talking about how the tax burden was too great for \nmost Americans and we wished we could do something about it. We now \nhave an opportunity to do something about it, as Senator Gramm said.\n  Third, in his Saturday radio message--and I know there are still a \nlot of Americans who listen to the President's radio message on \nSaturday morning; I know I do--he explicitly called for us to do what \nSenator Gramm and I are suggesting.\n  I read briefly from the remarks of President Bush in his radio \naddress on Saturday morning:\n\n       One thing that is pretty interesting to note is that some \n     of these tax reforms are going to expire at the end of ten \n     years, or in 2011. It is a quirk in the law. I think that \n     doesn't make much sense. It is going to be hard to plan your \n     future. If you think all of a sudden these things get kicked \n     in full time and then go away, they need to make these tax \n     cuts permanent. For the good of the working people of \n     America, for the good of families, for the good of small \n     businesses, for the good of farmers and ranchers, we need to \n     make the tax relief plan permanent in the Tax Code.\n\n  President Bush was saying the reform the Congress passed, and he \nsigned about 10 months ago, is going to expire now in 9 years, and if \nwe really meant it when we passed those reforms, we should make those \nreforms permanent, especially the death tax. The reason I say \n``especially the death tax'' is because people have to plan to deal \nwith the death tax. They have to think ahead. If they don't know what \nthe Tax Code is going to be when, say, the head of the household dies, \nthey don't know what to do to plan for it.\n  The tax relief we voted on gradually reduces the death tax burden \nuntil the 10th year when it goes away altogether. When the sunset \nexpires, the entire Tax Code, the way it was before, comes back into \nplay, and people are then paying the death tax at a rate of up to 55 \npercent, with an exemption of only $675,000.\n  How do they plan? Are they going to die in the year 2009, 2010, or \n2011? It makes a big difference in which year they die. The irony is \nthat one of the major reasons for eliminating the death tax was that \nthey wouldn't have to spend the enormous amounts of money they spend \neach year--to plan, to buy the insurance, do the estate planning, and \nall that goes with planning--to preserve as much of their estate as \npossible.\n  We have found, and I have quoted the statistics in the past, \nAmericans spend about the same amount of money each year on lawyers and \ninsurance companies planning their estates as other Americans do in \nactually paying the estate tax, just about the same amount of money. It \nturns out to be a double tax, except each year, every single year, \nAmericans spend $20 to $30 billion on estate planning.\n  The President is saying: Since you can't plan because you don't know \nwhat the law is going to be, we have to figure out what that is, and \nmake it permanent so that everybody knows what the rules are and what \nthey need to plan against.\n  Obviously, we believe what the rules should be is what the Congress \ndecides and what the President signed into law, which is that the death \ntax should be repealed, as it is in the year 2010. That is what \neverybody was gearing toward. That was the whole idea, get to final \nrepeal. That is what we voted for. We want to give our colleagues the \nopportunity to make that repeal permanent so people can plan for the \nfuture, so they will know what the rules of the road and the Tax Code \nare at the time of death.\n  We could probably have picked some other way to bring this to our \ncolleagues, but the distinguished Presiding Officer will recall the \nonly way we have had an opportunity so far to bring this question \nbefore our colleagues is through a sense of the Senate. The \ndistinguished Presiding Officer and many others were supportive of that \nsense of the Senate, saying we need to get on about the business of \ndoing this. We all agreed--not all, but most Members agreed--with that. \nThere are very limited opportunities to do that in the Senate. We have \nto have a bill that has revenue factors involved. This bill before the \nSenate now has a feature from the Finance Committee that deals with \nrevenue and therefore it is one of the few opportunities--maybe the \nonly opportunity,\n\n[[Page S2892]]\n\nquite possibly the only opportunity--we will have all year long to \nbring this issue to the floor when it is germane to the legislation \npending.\n\n  There is some talk that on down the road we may or may not have a \npension bill. If we did, and it got to the floor, the issue would be \ngermane to that, as well, but that is very uncertain. Therefore, \nSenator Gramm and I believed the best way to bring this issue before \nthe body in a way we could express ourselves on this once and for all \nwas through the only vehicle that existed, which is the vehicle of the \nFinance Committee work on the energy bill. That is why we do it at this \ntime.\n  As I said before, there is a secondary reason, and that is because \nmost Americans are focused this week on having paid their taxes, and at \nleast for those who are listening to what the President had to say, we \nare well aware of the fact that the President wants to make the tax \ncuts permanent. He especially mentioned the death tax.\n  Now, it is one thing to do this because the House of Representatives \nis doing it this week and the President has called for it, the other \nreason to do it obviously is it is the right thing to do. I will spend \na few minutes talking about that.\n  We knew when we debated a few weeks ago, when we had the sense of the \nSenate before the Senate, which was, of course, adopted, that one of \nthe things on people's minds at that time was stimulating the economy, \ngetting the economy going, and making sure the economic growth we were \nbeginning to see signs of--it is almost like the flowers of spring \ncoming up out of the soil; we can see economic recovery coming. But \nthere is a question whether we can sustain that with oil prices that \nare now probably going to increase substantially. That could knock out \nthe economic recovery.\n  For our families back home thinking about what they can afford this \nyear and whether it will be a good year economically and whether they \nwill save their job, we need to do everything we can to let them know \nwe will work as hard as we can to make sure the economic recovery is \nsustained, they keep their job, we keep oil prices as low as possible, \nand all the rest.\n  We found during the previous debate that pumping money back into the \neconomy, which occurs as a result of the capital formation from repeal \nof the death tax, is one of the surest ways of creating jobs and \nmaintaining this economic expansion. There were several experts who \nmade that point in one way or another. There are studies that make the \npoint.\n  One study talked about a $40 billion stimulus to the economy from the \nrepeal of the death tax. Let me refer to some of these in order.\n  What Alan Greenspan said on this issue is instructive. He was asked a \nquestion during a hearing at the House of Representatives: What's your \nthought on what we ought to be doing here with regard to permanency--\nmeaning making the tax cuts permanent? Chairman Greenspan's reply \nstresses the need for certainty in the Tax Code, which is what I was \ntalking about. It is the key.\n  He said:\n\n       Whatever you do, Congresswoman, I think it has to be clear \n     where the longer term tax structure in this area is. You \n     cannot do estate planning, as you point out, unless you have \n     a judgment as to what these numbers are. And wherever the \n     Congress comes out, I think it is far more important that it \n     come out clearly and unequivocally and not have an issue \n     pending as to an issue which would create a degree of \n     uncertainty which could make estate planning very difficult \n     to implement.\n\n  Those are almost the exact words I used before. I had forgotten \nChairman Greenspan expressed it in exactly this way. However, that is \nthe point. When there is certainty, people know how to plan, they know \nhow to invest. As a result, the capital formation that our economic \nrecovery requires is available for investment.\n  What Mr. Greenspan is saying is, this is an area where this is most \nimportant, where planning is most critical, the area of the estate tax. \nWe have to have clarity. We have to have, as Mr. Greenspan said, the \ncode ``come out clearly and unequivocally,'' with a degree of certainty \nso that estate planning is not difficult to implement.\n  Mr. Greenspan testified in another forum in response to a question \nfrom one of our colleagues in the Senate. He very clearly rejected the \nnotion that making the tax cut permanent would complicate efforts to \nmeet the Federal Government's long-term financial obligations to Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  I read:\n\n       I don't know of any economist who does long-term \n     forecasting and presumes that the tax cuts will fall off a \n     cliff at the end of the period in which they are statutorily \n     in place. I don't think it is an economic issue because I \n     don't know anyone who seriously believes the world works \n     the way legislation stipulates.\n\n  That is the end of the quote by Chairman Greenspan.\n  He is absolutely right. Nobody would imagine that at the end of 10 \nyears all the work toward eliminating the estate tax simply disappears \nand we go back to the way it was in the year 2000. Who would think \nthat? My friends back home, with whom I talked, to whom I kind of came \nhome and bragged about repealing the estate tax, were very surprised \nwhen I said: You understand when I said repeal it, what it meant was it \nwas phased down to the 10th year and then on the 11th year it comes \nback again. They said: How could it be?\n  I had to explain to them the arcane--I should not say arcane--the \nrule under which the Senate operated to get this adopted was the \nreconciliation procedure. That has a 10-year limit to it. That means \nwhatever you do can only have an effect of 10 years. That means if you \nreform taxes and repeal a section, at the end of 10 years, the 11th \nyear it goes right back the way it was before.\n  That is not the way we should have to do it. Unfortunately, it was \nthe only way to get the matter before the Senate at the time it was \nbrought forward, and it was the only way to get the number of votes \nnecessary to effect all the reforms we wanted to adopt. So there we are \nwith a procedure that Alan Greenspan says nobody would understand--but \nit is the reality, so at the end of 10 years we are faced with this \nabsurd situation that the repeal that we effected disappears and we are \nright back where we started.\n  Mr. Greenspan is saying that is unacceptable. We are saying that is \nunacceptable. The President is saying it is unacceptable. The House of \nRepresentatives today is going to invoke saying it is unacceptable. We \nhave now an opportunity in this body to make sure that unacceptable \nresult does not continue, that we have an opportunity to finally, once \nand for all, repeal the death tax so people can get about their \nplanning, get about their business, and we do not have this immoral tax \nhanging around our heads.\n  Both the President and I have spoken about this, and the Senator from \nTexas has made the point as well, that not only is this a bad tax in \nterms of what it does to capital formation and economics, but it is an \nunfair tax. I know some of my colleagues on the other side have made \nthe point that we have to find a way that rich people can pay a tax on \nthe unrealized gain. In other words, if an asset is purchased, there \nare a lot of folks who want to make sure a tax is paid when that asset \nis finally disposed.\n  In the real world we call it a capital gains tax. We say when you buy \nsomething, buy it at $100 and sell it at $500 and you do not do any \nimproving on it, then you have a gain of $400 and the capital gains tax \nrate is going to apply against that $400 gain when you decide to sell \nthe asset.\n  So you stop and think, I have this piece of property that is worth \n$500. I know if I sell it I am going to have to pay a capital gains tax \nbecause I did not pay that much for it at the beginning; it has really \nappreciated in value. Do I want to do that? And you make a judgment in \nyour mind to either sell it or not sell it. You know what the tax \nliability will be. You make an economic decision.\n  With the death tax, it is totally different. There are two or three \nother examples in our Tax Code. You didn't decide to die or you didn't \ndecide for your father to die. It happens. It is an unfortunate \ncircumstance, but it is not or should not be a taxable circumstance. \nThe Tax Code should tax behavior. It should tax action. It should tax \ndecision.\n\n  In other words, when Americans decide to do a certain thing that we \nhave said is taxable, we do it knowing what the tax consequences are. \nThe Tax Code should not penalize you for dying.\n\n[[Page S2893]]\n\nIt should not tax you for the act of having died or, to be more \nprecise, it should not tax your heirs because you died. You didn't \nintend it; they didn't intend it. But people say you should still pay a \ntax or your heirs should pay a tax on the unrealized gain from the \nassets.\n  So what we did in constructing this estate tax repeal was to say: You \nare right. That unrealized gain will be taxed. To be fair, we are not \ngoing to let anybody off the hook. No asset is going to be untaxed--\neven though, by the way, in most cases this is the second tax. The \nfirst tax was the income tax that was paid and then this will be the \nsecond tax on the investment income, in effect. But in any event, in \norder to make sure nobody would go untaxed with the unrealized gains, \nin effect we have not just repealed the estate tax, we have substituted \nfor the estate tax a capital gains tax on those assets, saying that if \nand when the heirs ever decide to sell that property, then and only \nthen will they pay the tax. It will not be the estate tax of 55 \npercent; it will be a capital gains tax on the gains at the appropriate \ncapital gains rate, whatever that applicable rate may be at that time.\n  We did one other thing. Today under the Tax Code the minute you die \nyour property has a new value attributed to it. It is not the value at \nthe time you purchased it but the value now at the time you die, so the \nvalue is much higher. If you were to sell that--let me use an example. \nLet's say a billionaire in our country today dies and his widow \ninherits all the assets. The very next day that widow decides to sell \nthose assets. How much capital gains tax does the widow pay? The answer \nis none. The reason is that the value of the estate is now the value at \nthe day of death. Technically, if she sold it immediately it would be \nnone. There might be a little appreciation of a few hours. But the \npoint is, if she sold it the next day there would be no capital gains \ntax due because the value would be increased to the value at the time \nof the death rather than at the time acquired.\n  What we say is it is going to be a capital gains tax based on the \nappreciation of the original value of the property. If it had been \nacquired 10 years earlier and had a value of $100 and the value at the \ntime of death is $500, A, when the property is sold, it is sold by the \nlawyers, it is going to have a gain of $400, but again the tax rate is \nthe estate tax rate, which is in some cases less than half of the \nestate tax rate and, B, the tax is only due if the heirs make an \naffirmative decision to sell the property knowing what the tax \nconsequences will be.\n  That is fair. I certainly do not attribute this to any of my \ncolleagues, but there are those on the outside who like to demagog this \nissue. They like to say this is just a rich man's tax and we are going \nto let all the rich people in the world off because we are going to \nrepeal the tax that applies to them. They are not telling you the \ntruth. The truth is, a tax will be due on those estates, but it will be \na tax due at the time the assets are sold.\n  It is the same rule in the Tax Code that applies to other situations \nin which, by fate, in effect, something happened to you and then you \ngot income as a result and you should not have to pay income tax on \nthat immediately. It is the same thing that applies when something is \nstolen from you and you are recompensed for the theft. It is the same \nthing that applies when you have property condemned and the State pays \nyou money.\n  It wasn't your choice to have the property condemned so you should \nnot have to pay tax on the money at that time.\n  As a result, there are few provisions of the Tax Code that recognize, \nwhere there is involuntary behavior that resulted in gain, or income, \nthat people ought to have the ability to defer the tax on that until \nthey want to sell the asset and at that point in time the capital gains \ntax is the appropriate tax.\n  I hope my colleagues appreciate when we talk about the repeal of the \ndeath tax here, what we voted for and what was signed into law is not a \nprovision that says those assets are never taxed. It is a provision \nthat says they are taxed when the assets are sold by the heirs at the \ncapital gains tax rate.\n  I want my colleagues to understand this because I think when we \nexplain to our constituents back home how we voted on this, whether we \nvoted to make this tax cut permanent or not, we also need to appreciate \nthat we can demonstrate what we have done is eminently fair; that \npeople shouldn't have to pay a tax at the involuntary time of death. \nThat is a most unfair thing to do at the worst time in a family's life, \nthat they should have to pay a tax on the unrealized gains. But they \nshould do that as we do in the other parts of the Tax Code when an \neconomic decision is made based upon, among other things, the tax \nconsequences that pertain.\n\n  When we have an opportunity to vote on this amendment, I hope my \ncolleagues will consider the economic improvement that would result; \nthe fact that we will be following what the President and House of \nRepresentatives have in effect asked the Senate to do; that we will be \nkeeping faith with our constituents whom we told we repealed the tax \nand who now would want to know that we did in fact do it permanently; \nand that it wasn't just a charade for a 1-year period of time in the \nyear 2001 and then go back to the way it was before.\n  If my colleagues can appreciate those points, I hope they will join \nus when we have an opportunity to make this permanent, and join Senator \nGramm and me in accomplishing that result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, Members on this side of the aisle have \nconcerns about the structure of the estate tax. In fact, we voted to \nchange it significantly. I think the estate size threshold could be \neven higher. We don't want small businesses to be hurt by people who, \nupon death, have to lose a family business or lose jobs in communities.\n  There is a lot we need to talk about. But I think this is not the \nmoment given what we are discussing. It is perhaps better that we save \nit for a different point in time.\n  My amendment, No. 2999, is the pending business. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 2999 is the pending question.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2999, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I withdraw that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the Senator from Texas. He \nhas indicated that during the course of the debate on this matter he is \ngoing to offer his amendment at a subsequent time. I certainly \nappreciate that.\n  It is my understanding that the pending business is amendment No. \n3008. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the regular order.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I call for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3145 to Amendment No. 3008\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3145 to amendment No. 3008.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require that Federal agencies use ethanol-blended gasoline \n  and biodiesel-blended diesel fuel in areas in which ethanol-blended \n       gasoline and biodiesel-blended diesel fuel are available)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be added, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 8____. FEDERAL AGENCY ETHANOL-BLENDED GASOLINE AND \n                   BIODIESEL PURCHASING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       Title III of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended by \n     striking section 306 (42 U.S.C. 13215) and inserting the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 306. FEDERAL AGENCY ETHANOL-BLENDED GASOLINE AND \n                   BIODIESEL PURCHASING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       ``(a) Ethanol-Blended Gasoline.--The head of each Federal \n     agency shall ensure that, in areas in which ethanol-blended \n     gasoline is available at a competitive price, the Federal \n     agency purchases ethanol-blended gasoline containing at least \n     10 percent ethanol (or the highest available percentage of \n     ethanol), rather than nonethanol-blended gasoline, for use in \n     vehicles used by the agency.\n       ``(b) Biodiesel.--\n\n[[Page S2894]]\n\n       ``(1) Definition of biodiesel.--In this subsection, the \n     term `biodiesel' has the meaning given the term in section \n     312(f).\n       ``(2) Requirement.--The head of each Federal agency shall \n     ensure that the Federal agency purchases, for use in fueling \n     fleet vehicles used by the Federal agency at the location at \n     which fleet vehicles of the Federal agency are centrally \n     fueled, in areas in which biodiesel-blended diesel fuel is \n     available at a competitive price--\n       ``(A) as of the date that is 5 years after the date of \n     enactment of this paragraph, biodiesel-blended diesel fuel \n     that contains at least 2 percent biodiesel, rather than \n     nonbiodiesel-blended diesel fuel; and\n       ``(B) as of the date that is 10 years after the date of \n     enactment of this paragraph, biodiesel-blended diesel fuel \n     that contains at least 20 percent biodiesel, rather than \n     nonbiodiesel-blended diesel fuel.\n       ``(c) Exemption for Military Vehicles.--This section does \n     not apply to fuel used in vehicles used for military purposes \n     that the Secretary of Defense certifies to the Secretary must \n     be exempt for national security reasons.''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for edification of the Senators, what the \ntwo leaders have suggested we do is early this afternoon move to border \nsecurity. There is a unanimous consent that has been prepared. It is \nbeing circulated now. We should be able to enter into that agreement \nhopefully very soon.\n  In the meantime, I think the Senate would be well advised to continue \nworking on the bill that is now before us--the energy bill. There are a \nnumber of amendments that have been cleared.\n  In a moment, the Senator from New York will be here to speak on \nethanol. There are a number of amendments dealing with that subject in \nthis legislation. Until the Senator from New York returns, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order and call up \namendment No. 3030.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will allow me to make a suggestion?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Please.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator should call up his amendment, that it be the \npending business.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3030, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3030.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I withdraw this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I plan, along with several of my colleagues, to \ndiscuss this amendment. We are going to offer it again for a vote at a \ntime that is agreeable to everybody. The only reason I withdrew it is I \ndidn't want there to be a motion to table it where we wouldn't have a \nfull debate on this very important amendment.\n  This is, of course, the amendment that would remove the ethanol \nmandate from the energy bill, not removing either of the other parts. \nIt keeps the clean air standards, and it keeps the ban on the MTBE, but \nit does not require that ethanol be used as an oxygenate. It does not \neven require an oxygenate as long as the MTBE standard is met.\n\n  Before I begin, I want to say how much I respect and admire our \nmajority leader, Tom Daschle. He is just a leader par excellence. He is \na principled, compassionate, and extraordinary public servant, and a \ntrue friend to the people of my State. I consider it a privilege to \nserve under him and to be his friend.\n  For that reason, believe me, I do not enjoy opposing a provision in a \nbill about which I know Senator Daschle cares very deeply. I thought \nlong and hard about whether to oppose the amendment and came to the \nconclusion that I had no choice, that I was compelled to do so because \nI sincerely believe this provision will hurt consumers dramatically in \nmy State of New York and throughout the country.\n  So I do rise to my feet in this Chamber to speak on amendment No. \n3030, reluctantly, with some sadness, but nonetheless, bolstered in the \nbelief that it is the right thing to do and that I would be derelict in \nmy responsibilities as a Senator to the people of my State and to our \ncountry if I did not offer my amendment. I had hoped that someone else \nwould have, but they did not, so here I am.\n  I have been in Congress for 22 years. Every so often there is an \namendment that people vote for that becomes part of the law that isn't \npaid too much attention to, and then, a year or two later, it turns out \nto be a big disaster. Our constituents turn to us and ask: How, the \nheck did you do that? How could you have done this? How could you have \ncreated something that has caused so much hardship without even \nthinking about it, without debating it, without opposing it?\n  I remember the catastrophic illness amendment 10, 12 years ago. I \nknow some of my colleagues disagree about the analogy, but I think it \nis an apt one. We passed that amendment in the House, when I was in \nthat body, with, I believe, minimal debate. I may be mistaken, but I \nthink it was even on a two-thirds vote on the consent calendar. \nEveryone thought they were doing a good thing.\n  When the bill bit--when people realized how much they had to pay for \na service that they would have liked to have had, but it was not \nessential to them, when people realized they all paid for it, even \nthough many of them did not need it because they had other coverage--\nthere was a public outcry, and there was almost a rush to the floor by \nHouse Members to get up and say why they really did not vote for what \nhad happened, why they did not mean to do what had been done.\n  That happens every so often around here. It does not happen often. We \nare generally pretty careful, and the slowness of the legislative \nprocess stops it.\n  I say to my colleagues: Beware. If there were ever an amendment \nquietly put in a bill that should have a ``tread cautiously'' label on \nit, that should have perhaps a skull and crossbones on it, this is it. \nThis is not an innocuous amendment. This is not an amendment that \nsimply helps some farmers and does no harm to the rest of us. It is a \ndeep and profound change in terms of how we use our motor fuel. It will \nrequire dramatic changes in investments throughout the land. It will \ncreate consequences that none of us are sure of because we are jumping \ninto this pool of ethanol, if you will, without having put our toe in \nfirst. I fear the consequences.\n  So today I rise with my fellow Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, \nour colleagues from California, and now a small but growing band of \nMembers throughout the Senate, to oppose the unprecedented new ethanol \ngas tax which was quietly inserted into the Senate energy bill a few \nweeks ago without any debate.\n  My amendment may be adopted, but I do not fool myself. It may not. \nThere is a huge group--some of whom I have often allied with, some of \nwhom I usually oppose--arrayed against it. But I am convinced we will \nbe the better for this debate, whatever our view is, because of the \nbreathtaking change that the ethanol mandate imposes throughout the \nland.\n  The antioxygenate provisions in the bill accomplish two goals that \nare not disputed by my amendment. One is banning the use of MTBE. We \nhave found that MTBE has resulted in ground water pollution all over \nthe country. In my home State, on Long Island, where drinking water \ncomes from one big single aquifer, MTBE that is spilled on the ground \nis slowly seeping into the soil, and it actually permanently pollutes \nthat precious aquifer which close to 3 million people depend upon for \ntheir drinking and bathing and their washing.\n  My State, along with many others, has banned MTBE and many more \nStates are planning to do it. This bill does that. We are not changing \nthat.\n  The second is the scrapping of the oxygenate mandate that led so many \nStates to make such heavy use of MTBE in the first place. The proposal \nin the bill provides an antibacksliding provision that says if you \ndon't use MTBE, you can't backslide on clean air. Some believe those \nprovisions could be stronger, but we are not opposing either of those \ntwo parts: the ban on MTBE or the antibacksliding\n\n[[Page S2895]]\n\nprovisions, the provisions that require the air to stay as clean as we \nrequire it now. It is not those provisions we are opposing.\n  Beyond those two provisions, this new provision added to the energy \nbill--again, without any debate--adds an astonishing new anticonsumer, \nantifree market requirement that every refiner in the country, \nregardless of where they are located, regardless of whether their State \nmandates it or not, regardless of whether the State chooses a different \npath to get to clean air, regardless of whether the refiners in that \nState say that ethanol doesn't work or works very expensively, it \nrequires them to use an ever-increasing volume of ethanol.\n  Here is the kicker--there are a lot of kickers in this provision, the \nethanol provision that was quietly added to the bill. If your State or \nyour region does not want to use ethanol, you still have to pay for \nethanol. You have to buy what is called ethanol credits. It costs you \nthe same as if you bought the ethanol yourself. When have we done that \nbefore? When have we said, even if you choose not to use a product, an \nexpensive product, a product that affects just about everyone, anyone \nwho owns a car, any company that drives trucks, when have we ever said \nin such a dramatic way that you are forced to use something? It is \nastounding. It would be similar to saying to people who needed heating \nin their homes, you have to use oil rather than gas, and if you choose \nto use gas for whatever reason, you still have to pay for the oil.\n  That is what we are doing here, no less, except we are doing it with \ngasoline, and it sounds sort of complicated, ethanol sounds chemical, \nand all that. The effect is very simple.\n  This is a gas tax. In 1993, many of us debated whether there ought to \nbe a gas tax. Some say the whole Congress changed on the basis of that \ndebate; that in 1994, the House and Senate switched parties in part \nbecause of that debate. This is, for most States, a larger gas tax than \nthe one that was proposed. And, to boot, it doesn't even go to a useful \npurpose. The gas tax at least built new highways to help the driver, \nand there was a theory about it. This makes you buy ethanol--hardly a \nreturn to motorists the way the gas tax was to be.\n  It will affect every employee driving to work. It will affect every \nmom driving the kids to school. It will affect every Teamster driving a \ntruck. It will affect every company that uses automobiles and cars and \ntrucks. I don't think there are many that don't. Every gasoline user in \nthis country will pay.\n  The mandate is so steep that sure as we are sitting here, it is not \njust the added cost of the ethanol--which will be great enough; I will \ntalk about that in a minute--but it is going to cause price spikes. \nCurrently, refiners across the Nation use 1.7 billion gallons of \nethanol. That is the total amount. Starting in 2004, 2 years away, they \nwould be required to use 2.3 billion gallons of ethanol. Almost \nimmediately, we are requiring a large amount of ethanol. You know what \nhappens when you place a huge demand on a product and you don't have \nthe supply? Simple economics: The price goes through the roof.\n\n  I am opposed to this substantively. But I say to my colleagues who \nare running in 2004: Beware. Let's say the proponents of the bill are \nwrong. Let's say I am right and all of a sudden next summer, the summer \nof 2004, gasoline goes up 30, 40, 50 cents a gallon, which is very \npossible. What are you going to say?\n  I want to help the corn farmers, too. I vote for everything that \ncomes up to help the middle western and southern farmers. But this is \nnot the way to do it. We can do it a lot more efficiently and with a \nlot less harm to the driver.\n  You don't need a degree in economics to know that if ethanol \nproducers can't meet the demand, there are going to be price spikes, \nbig price spikes. That is just the beginning. It is going to get worse. \nWe ratchet up the number from 2.3 billion in 2004, up to 5 billion \ngallons of ethanol in 2012. Then we increase it by a percentage \nequivalent to the proportion of ethanol in the entire U.S. gas supply \nafter 2012 in perpetuity. We are locking people into one method of \ncleaning the gasoline and the air forever. That means from 2012 on, the \nNation's ethanol producers will have a guaranteed annual market of over \n5 billion gallons, which every consumer in this country will pay for at \nthe pump.\n  Here is how much you are all going to pay. This is a conservative \nestimate. They use Department of Energy numbers, but it is called Hart/\nIRI Fuels Information Services. They are a well-established group. They \nare not part of the petroleum industry or anybody else. The estimates \nare conservative because that is without price spikes and that is \nassuming the best of circumstances, that everything works smoothly.\n  Here is how much each of your States will pay. The minimum is 4 \ncents, 4 cents a gallon every time you go to the pump. But I am going \nto read all the States where it is greater than 4 cents a gallon, how \nmuch you would pay.\n  In Arizona, you would pay 7.6 cents a gallon; in California, you \nwould pay an extra 9.6 cents a gallon; in Connecticut--I see my \ncolleague from Connecticut here in the Chamber--it is estimated you \nwould pay an extra 9.7 cents a gallon; District of Columbia, 9.7 cents \na gallon; Illinois, 7.3 cents a gallon; Indiana, 4.9 cents a gallon; \nKentucky, 5.4 cents a gallon; Louisiana, 4.2 cents a gallon; Maryland, \n9.1 cents a gallon--that is a lot of money--Massachusetts even more, \n9.7 cents a gallon; Missouri, 5.6 cents a gallon; New Hampshire, 8.4 \ncents a gallon; New Jersey, 9.1 cents a gallon; New York, 7.1 cents a \ngallon; Pennsylvania, 5.5 cents a gallon; Rhode Island, 9.7 cents a \ngallon; Texas 5.7 cents a gallon; Virginia, 7.2 cents a gallon; \nWisconsin--I see my friend from Wisconsin here; we have worked on \nagricultural issues together--5.5 cents a gallon.\n  Every one of those States pays more than the 4 cents.\n  If you hear the name of your State now, your drivers will pay, under \nthe best of circumstances by these estimates, an extra 4 cents a \ngallon: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, \nIdaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, \nNebraska, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, \nOklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, \nVermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\n  The annual aggregate impact is $8.3 billion. That is a lot of money. \nEven in the Middle West, where there is a lot of ethanol production, \nwhere it would be less onerous than in other places, the cost of \ngasoline goes up 4 or 5 cents a gallon. That is a lot of money.\n  I know there are some supporters here. We have had many good \narguments privately and on the floor and some are going to say these \nnumbers are inaccurate. They include the cost of banning MTBE. The cost \nof forcing the entire country to use 5 billion gallons of ethanol will \nbe a mere pittance.\n  Remember this, my friends: Ethanol is very hard to transport. It \ncannot be carried through our existing pipeline infrastructure because \nit is so volatile. It has to be put on a truck, a barge, and sent down \nthe Mississippi to New Orleans, usually, and then sent by boat around \nthe country, and then loaded back onto a truck and taken to a local \nrefinery and put into the gasoline. You can see why it is so expensive.\n  Then some people say they will build ethanol plants closer to the big \nusers, particularly on the coast and in the South, where this has the \ngreatest effect. There is not enough corn and ethanol production down \nthere. Who is going to pay for the cost of all those new ethanol \nplants? It will be the drivers of all of our States. Because of its \nvolatility, because you cannot create a pipeline and pipe it through to \nthe refinery and add it in, because you have to transport it in this \nparticular way, you can see that ethanol is not the cheapest way to do \nwhat we want to do in terms of cleaning our air.\n  With all due respect, I think the cost estimates I am citing are \nbased on more realistic assumptions than those that went into my \nopponents' number. We tried to be as careful and conservative as we \ncould. To forecast how much a 10-year, 5-billion-gallon ethanol mandate \nis going to cost consumers across the country, you have to look at \ninterplay of a host of complex factors: growth in auto travel, gasoline \nprices, corn prices, ethanol price, and how many new ethanol plants are \nexpected to come online. That is all inextricably linked to how high \nthe price of ethanol is going to go. If the price is\n\n[[Page S2896]]\n\nhigh and manufacturing ethanol becomes profitable, yes, the private \nsector will build the plants. If it is not, they will not. Yet in the \nnumbers I have seen circulated by the proponents of this issue, they \nuse contradictory figures. They say ethanol prices will be unusually \nlow for the next 10 years. At the same time, the private sector is \ngoing to build plants all over the country.\n  You cannot have it both ways. If the price is low, you are not going \nto build new plants. If the price is high, then you will. I am willing \nto concede that modeling this unprecedented, inefficient, untested, \njerry-built contraption, a nationwide mandate on every refiner in the \nUnited States to pay for billions and billions of gallons of ethanol \nwhether they use it or not is difficult.\n  I know my staff has been working with Senator Daschle's staff and a \nnumber of technical experts to see if we can reach agreement on the \nnumbers. If we can do so, that would be great.\n  In truth, whether it costs a penny a gallon or a dollar a gallon--my \nguess is, from the estimates I read, the State-by-State numbers I read \nare low, because those are under the best of market conditions--why are \nwe mandating it? There is no public policy reason for the use of \nethanol other than the political might of the ethanol lobby.\n  I say to colleagues from the farm States, the fact that we are \ngetting rid of MTBE and keeping the air standards high is going to \nincrease demand for ethanol. I think you are going to do better than \nyou have ever done before. Without casting aspersions on colleagues and \nindividuals, the proposal is kind of greedy. Yes, ethanol is going to \nbe needed more. But a mandate to the ethanol world? You are going to do \nwell under this. Once MTBE is gone, your main competitor is gone.\n\n  For States such as mine, where the refiners believe they can find a \nbetter method that is cheaper, why would you require us to use ethanol? \nThat is the fundamental weakness.\n  I was having a good discussion with my friend from Iowa, who does a \ngreat job defending farmers and farm States. He has even tried to help \nus in an unprecedented way in the Northeast. He says: What will replace \nethanol if you don't mandate?\n  The first and best argument is to let the market come up with \nsomething. If you mandate it, there is going to be no alternative; you \nare stuck with it. If it is the best in the market, it will prevail in \nthe marketplace.\n  There are alternatives. Refiners have told me--those away from the \nMiddle West--that they will use a combination of aromatics and \nalkaloids. Alkaloids are about as clean as ethanol. Aromatics are kind \nof dirty. Aromatics break down so you cannot use all of them. But a \nform called Alkaloids are clean. Alkaloids could be used, plain and \nsimple. I don't know if they work better than ethanol or not. But I \nwill tell you, the people in my State say they will. Why mandate that?\n  So the bottom line is, there is no sound public policy reason for \nmandating the use of ethanol. We live in a free market economy. We \nhardly mandate anything, especially when there is a choice.\n  Well, the new ethanol gas tax will contribute to market volatility \nand price spikes, especially since the industry is concentrated in the \nMidwest. It is going to increase costs in general. That is the second \nissue. But you are going to create price spikes all over the place. \nWhen you increase the amount that is needed, you know when there is one \nbig boy, one producer, they are going to go to town.\n  Archer Daniels Midland, alone, controls 41 percent of the market--a \nmonopoly. Certainly, somebody is asserting huge market control. When \nthey have to build more refineries, who is going to have the best \naccess to capital and technology? They are. My guess is their market \nshare will actually increase. Who knows, 41 percent is a lot.\n  Well, let me tell you, the mandates frighten people even in the \nMiddle West. I want to make a point. Two States in the heartland of \nAmerica--two of the biggest corn-producing States in the country \nconsidered mandating ethanol--Iowa and Nebraska. Both of them rejected \nit. If the people of Iowa, through their legislature, and the people of \nNebraska withdrew the legislation--it was not a referendum--and \nrejected this, why now are we in the Senate imposing it on Iowa, \nNebraska, and everybody else who is in a far worse position?\n  Let me read what some of the newspapers in those areas said:\n\n       An ethanol mandate would deny Iowans a choice of fuels and \n     short circuit the process of ethanol establishing its own \n     worth in the marketplace. . . . The justification is to \n     marginally boost the price of corn. Cleaner air is offered as \n     a reason, too, but that's an afterthought. If that were the \n     goal, other measures would be far more effective. . . .\n  That is the Des Moines Sunday Register, 9-19-1999, headlined ``Let \nEthanol Prove Itself.''\n  The Quad City Times from Davenport, IA, in an editorial entitled \n``Ethanol Only Proposal Doesn't Help Consumers'':\n\n       With research and continued refinements, it might someday \n     become an economically viable alternative to gasoline--but \n     until that day, it is ludicrous to argue that Iowa's gas \n     stations be required to sell only ethanol. . . . Ethanol \n     might be worth some level of support, but it will never be so \n     valuable as to justify scrapping our free enterprise system.\n\n  That is not the New York Times. That is not the Los Angeles Times in \nCalifornia. That is the Quad City Times at the border of Iowa and \nIllinois.\n  Nebraska, as I mentioned, considered an ethanol mandate and rejected \nit. Here is what the Grand Island Independent said about a year ago in \nan editorial:\n       ``Ethanol Use Shouldn't Be a Forced Buy.'' Americans don't \n     like to be forced to do anything and Nebraskans are no \n     different. Yet the Legislature is considering forcing all gas \n     stations throughout the state--\n\n  This was a State mandate--\n\n     to start selling ethanol blends. . . .That just doesn't seem \n     fair. Our country and our business system is based on supply \n     and demand. Consumers determine the products they want and \n     businesses meeting those needs succeed. While many in \n     Nebraska may want ethanol-based fuels, many Americans \n     traveling our highways don't.\n\n  Finally, the Omaha World Herald, in the year 2000, editorialized:\n\n       Now the Nebraska Legislature is considering eliminating the \n     competition altogether. Support is building for a proposed \n     state law to require most general purpose automotive fuel \n     sold in the state to contain ethanol. . . .As a general \n     principle, government should not take sides in such matters \n     unless a strong case can be made that intervention serves a \n     major public purpose. In this instance, the arguments for \n     eliminating competition haven't been persuasive.\n\n  Even editorials, as well as voters, in the heartland of America, \nwhere there is much more corn and ethanol is far more likely to \nsucceed, argue against a mandate, which is what we are about to impose.\n  My opponents also argue that this ethanol gas tax is needed to help \nfamily farms, and I take those arguments very seriously. I know that \nmany of my colleagues from the Middle West want to help their family \nfarmers who are struggling. I want to help those farmers, too, and I \nhave stood by my Senate colleagues from Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, the \nDakotas, Montana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and I have voted for billions \nand billions of dollars in agricultural subsidies to help the farmers \nin the West and South. That is a decision I think I can make in good \nconscience. Commodity subsidies, by the way, do very little for New \nYork.\n  Since I have been in the Senate, I have supported the Midwestern \nfarmers. I know how important they are to the economy of those States. \nI know how important they are as a breeding ground for American values. \nI say to my colleagues, I think a majority in this Senate Chamber--a \nbig majority--are willing to help some more. But find a way that works. \nDo not do it by imposing a gas tax on all of our drivers.\n  I speak for my State of New York. Our economy is hurting after 9-11. \nWe do not need this which particularly affects the east and west coasts \nworse than other places.\n  Guess what. In addition, what pains me is this has not trickled down. \nDo you think corn growers of the Middle West are going to make most of \nthe money? I have heard our farm State folks complain over and over \nthat it is the middleman who gets most of the farm dollar. It is the \npeople in the middle who make the money and a few bits trickle down to \nthe family farmer. Yet that is just what we are doing here.\n\n[[Page S2897]]\n\n  We are giving Archer Daniels Midland, Williams Energy Company, \nMinnesota corn processors, and giant corporations the real control in \nthe market. They are the ones who will make most of the money. When the \nprice spikes the way electricity spiked in California, do you think \nthat money will trickle down to your farmers? Forget it. Maybe if they \nown stock in Archer Daniels Midland they will do well, but they will \nget very little bang for the buck. If the past is any indication, for \nevery nickel that our drivers pay throughout the country, the farmer \nwill receive certainly less than a penny.\n\n  This policy does not even do its best to help the farmers. Take this \n$5 billion mandate and put it into some kind of direct subsidy that \ngoes to small family farmers, main-line it directly to them, and you \nwill get my support. That will not make the drivers in my State pay.\n  I say to my colleagues from the Middle West, figure out better ways \nwe can help our farmers and I will support you, but not this one.\n  Let me read to you from the CRS report on ethanol. It is on energy \nsecurity. They say:\n\n       Another frequent argument for the use of ethanol as a motor \n     fuel is that it reduces U.S. reliance on oil imports, making \n     the U.S. less vulnerable to a fuel embargo of the sort that \n     occurred in the 1970s, which was the event that initially \n     stimulated development of the ethanol industry. According to \n     the Argonne National Laboratory, with current technology, the \n     use of E-10 leads to a 3-percent reduction in fossil fuel \n     energy per vehicle mile, while use of E-95 could lead to a \n     44-percent reduction in fossil energy use. However, our \n     studies contradict the Argonne studies suggesting the amount \n     of money needed to produce energy is roughly equal to the \n     amount of energy obtained from its combustion--\n\n  So you have to create as much energy to use it as you would save in \nusing it.\n  Continuing the quote:\n\n     which could lead to little or no reductions in fossil energy \n     use. Thus, if the energy used in ethanol production is \n     petroleum-based--\n\n  Which it is likely to be--\n\n     ethanol would do nothing to contribute to energy security.\n\n  That is CRS, not somebody with an ax to grind.\n  Remember, in terms of conserving energy, ethanol is basically a wash.\n  The final argument my opponents will make, I believe--I think this is \nsomewhat cynical, but it will be made, I guess; that has never been a \nbar to any of us on the floor of the Senate--is that if New York and \nCalifornia and other States want to clean up their water by banning \nMTBE and maintain clean air, they should have to pay the price of an \nethanol gas tax, and that it is political naivete to think otherwise.\n  My State has already banned the use of MTBE, and so have 12 other \nStates, including: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, \nIllinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, South \nDakota, and Washington.\n  A number of other States are also in the process of taking action, as \nwell, because MTBE pollutes the groundwater. But everyone in those \nStates who banned MTBE is going to be in an impossible dilemma. Their \ncitizens are demanding they ban MTBE, but with the oxygenate \nrequirement in place, they cannot successfully do so.\n  Last year, President Bush's administration denied California's \npetition to waive the oxygenate requirement, despite the State's \nability to comply with air quality standards without it. They deny the \nwaivers, even though you can get there a better way. This denial forced \nthe State to defer its critical ban on MTBE and suffer groundwater \ncontamination.\n  New York State is considering requesting a waiver. Although I call on \nPresident Bush and Administrator Whitman to look favorably on New \nYork's waiver request, my guess is if and when New York applies, we \nwill be met with the same denial as that of the Governor of the State \nof California. States such as New York, California, States on the \ncoasts, many States in the South, even States that are large urban \nStates in the Middle West, such as Illinois, are between a rock and a \nhard place.\n  Our citizens' health and the environment are being held hostage to \nthe desire of the ethanol lobby to make ever larger profits.\n  Let us meet the same clean air standards we now have in the way we \nthink is best. Let us use reformulated gasoline. Let us use these \noutlets which are as clean as ethanol and cheaper if one is not near \ncorn. If ethanol is better, the marketplace will prevail.\n  What makes me doubt all the virtues of ethanol, when my colleagues \npropose it, is that they mandate. If it is going to be so cheap and so \nclean and so good, let the market prevail. As I said before, the \nethanol producers and corn growers are going to be in a better \nposition, even with my amendment, than otherwise because MTBEs are \nbanned. The clean air standard stays, and in many cases ethanol will be \nthe best way to go.\n  It is an outrage that Congress is telling Americans across the \ncountry that we refuse to clean up their air and water unless they pay \noff ADM. That is unconscionable. There is no public policy reason on \nEarth not to allow States to ban MTBEs and remove the oxygenate \nrequirement and keep clean air standards in place without requiring \nthem to buy ethanol.\n  Ironically, the ethanol mandate, because ethanol is exempt, reduces \nthe highway trust fund in State after State. It is going to reduce it \nin California by $900 million, in New York by $493 million, in \nPennsylvania by $446 million, in Massachusetts by $183 million. It can \nbe looked up to see how much less highway money each Senator's State \nwill get as a result of this mandate. In New York, we need that money. \nWe have a great need for transportation dollars, especially with the \ndamage done to our subway system on 9-11.\n  Other States such as Virginia that suffered an attack and had to \nstruggle to accommodate transportation needs of its fast growing \nsuburbs need it as well.\n  So for consumers throughout the country, this is a one-two punch. \nFirst, one pays more at the pump to meet arbitrary goals that boost the \nsales of ethanol but are not necessary to achieve clean air. Second--\nand this is another zinger in this bill; it is loaded with boobytraps \nconsumers will face restrictions from suing manufacturers, and oil \ncompanies will have less incentive to ensure that the additives they \nmanufacture and use are safe.\n  There is a provision that says not only can States such as \nCalifornia, New York, and so many others--not only do they have to use \nethanol, but we are banning MTBEs and we are prohibiting anyone from \nsuing companies that may have polluted their water. My goodness, how \nmuch can they pile on us?\n  This is no longer an academic discussion. Three oil companies have \nbeen found liable in California--I am sure my colleague from \nCalifornia, the senior Senator, knows about this--of knowingly \npolluting the ground water around Lake Tahoe with MTBEs. My colleague \nfrom California, our junior Senator, Mrs. Boxer, will have a lot more \nto say about that case and what these provisions that exempt the \nrefineries and oil companies from being sued mean. But the case \ndemonstrates something truly disturbing.\n  The petroleum industry opposed ethanol mandates for years, but now, \nfacing a raft of MTBE lawsuits, including the first defeat in \nCalifornia, they have signed off on this deal in return for a really \ndisgraceful liability provision.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would be happy to yield to my friend from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I understand the context of the Senator's \nargument, what he is saying is that New York does not need an oxygen \nrequirement, that New York can use reformulated gasoline and can meet \nthe clean air standards by this reformulated gasoline, and California \nas well does not need an oxygen requirement; we can meet clean air \nstandards without an oxygenate requirement and, where we do not meet \nclean air standards--summer months in Southern California--can use \nethanol and we do not need an around-the-year requirement.\n  So if I understand the Senator correctly, his position then is exempt \nNew York, exempt California, from the strictures of this bill, and \nexempt us from an oxygenate requirement. Is that the position of the \nSenator?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Well, my position is we should not have this mandate \nanywhere, but obviously if we were offered\n\n[[Page S2898]]\n\nan exemption for New York, and for California, the vehemence against \nthis opposition would disappear. We are defending the vital interests \nof our States. I would simply argue with my friend from California, \nthis is not just a New York and California problem; this is a problem \nin many States.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I realize that. I find myself in agreement with the \nSenator. What I have wanted all along is for California--because we do \nnot have an infrastructure in place in the state and we know there is \ngoing to be a price spike--to have the EPA sign off on a waiver.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Right. I apologize.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. So I want to identify myself with where the Senator \nis going. If these two States were to receive a waiver from the \noxygenate requirement, we would certainly be satisfied.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I misinterpreted what my friend from California was \nsaying, for which I apologize. California applied for a waiver from the \noxygenate standard and was rejected by the current administration. No \ngood reason was given. I think, again, this was a sop to the ethanol \nlobby.\n  New York would like to apply. If we knew these waivers would be \ngranted, if we knew that consideration would be made on the merits, we \nwould not be debating today. But if someone tells us, well, you can get \nthe standard waived, forget it; they are not waiving it. The \nadministration is not waiving it. If we were to get a letter from \nPresident Bush saying he will waive States that can find a better way, \nwe are in; but we are not. As I had mentioned earlier, we are between a \nrock and a hard place.\n  In conclusion, I ask my colleagues to support the amendment sponsored \nby myself and the senior Senator from California, the Senator from New \nYork, Mrs. Clinton, the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, and some \nothers, to strike the ethanol mandate. If we believe Congress has an \nobligation to protect the health of our citizens and environment, if we \nbelieve that maintaining clean air standards is important but also \nbelieve there are different ways to get there, do not support forcing \nAmerican consumers to pay for ethanol.\n  If my colleagues believe Congress has the obligation to protect \nconsumers and keep our market economy running as efficiently as \npossible, then I would ask them not to mandate ethanol and impose a gas \ntax.\n  I say to my colleagues who support this amendment, the heart of which \nis in the Middle West, find us a better way. We do not want to hurt \ntheir farmers. In fact, we want to help them, as our record has shown, \nbut not at undoing the entire fuel economy of much of the country.\n  I say to my colleagues that as they listen to this debate, I think it \nis very hard not to be persuaded that we have a good argument. I urge \nthem to listen to the debate. I urge them to look at the substance. I \nurge them to look at the politics. I urge them to defeat the ethanol \ngas tax, the mandated ethanol gas tax, by supporting our amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Wisconsin yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. KOHL. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. So Senators understand what we are trying to do this \nafternoon, we are going to ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nWisconsin proceed for up to 5 minutes as if in morning business. \nFollowing that, the Senator from New Mexico, the manager of this bill, \nhas a significant number of amendments that have been cleared, almost \n20 amendments that have been cleared. He will have cleared those.\n  Senator Murkowski has been called away for a funeral this afternoon. \nHe will be back in about an hour.\n  Senator Dayton wishes to speak on the ethanol provision, following \nthe statement of the Senator from Wisconsin and the work done by the \nmanager of the bill.\n  Then Senator Feinstein and Senator McConnell have some business they \nwant to do. That will also be in morning business, as I understand it.\n  As I say, when Senator Murkowski returns, the two leaders, Senator \nDaschle and Senator Lott, agree it would be appropriate for him to \noffer an amendment dealing with Iraqi sanctions. We hope after he gets \nback to complete the debate on that within a relatively short period of \ntime, perhaps an hour or less. Then we would go this evening to border \nsecurity. Senator Kennedy and others have been working on that matter, \nand we would be in a position in the near future to offer a unanimous \nconsent request. That should take us into the evening time with several \nvotes during the next several hours.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Wisconsin be recognized for \nup to 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object, so that I can advise \nSenator McConnell, my understanding of the unanimous consent agreement \nis Senator Kohl, Senator Dayton, and then Senator McConnell and I will \nhave a chance to introduce legislation in morning business.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from California, the only unanimous \nconsent request I requested was Senator Kohl. I was relaying what I \nhope will happen. As soon as Senator Bingaman finishes his business, \nSenator Dayton will speak for 15 or 20 minutes, at the most, and then \nthere will be time for you and Senator McConnell to take up your matter \nfor up to a half hour.\n  That is not in the form of a unanimous consent agreement, but I think \neveryone should recognize that is the courteous thing to do, to allow \npeople to proceed in that manner.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to allowing the \nSenator from Wisconsin to speak?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kohl are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n    Amendments Nos. 3015, As Modified; 3024, As Modified; 3078, As \n                      Modified; and 3141, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration en bloc of the following amendments: \nAmendment No. 3015, relating to a National Academy of Sciences study on \ncertain spent nuclear fuel shipments; amendment No. 3024, relating to \nnuclear powerplant licensing and regulation; amendment No. 3078, \nrelating to a review of Federal procurement initiatives, and that those \namendments be modified with changes at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3141\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I believe it is in our national interest \nto improve the efficiency of our vehicles, for example, through new \nvehicles and vehicle fuel technologies, so that we can reduce our oil \ndependence and better protect the environment.\n  Several months ago, I test drove a fuel cell vehicle. A fuel cell \nvehicle produces electricity from the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen. \nThe only by-product is water. Fuel-cell vehicles are similar to \nbattery-powered electric cars in that the fuel cell produces \nelectricity that powers motors at the wheels.\n  But while a battery must be recharged after all of the fuel inside it \nhas reacted, a fuel cell is a ``refillable battery,'' in the sense that \nrecharging the vehicle only requires refilling the fuel tank. The \nhydrogen fuel required to power it can be stored directly on the \nvehicle in tanks or extracted from a secondary fuel, like methanol or \nethanol, that carries oxygen. So, a fuel cell car can get double or \ntriple the mileage of cars on the road today.\n  This new technology would decrease emissions, help reduce global \nclimate change, and protect our national security by reducing the \namount of oil we would need to import from unstable regions.\n  All we need to do is look at the political conditions in Venezuela \nand the situation in the Middle East, coupled with Saddam Hussein's \nsanctions against exporting oil to the United States, to realize the \nprecariousness of our dependence on these imports. At this point, we \nstill have other countries that can meet the global oil market \nrequirements and we are not in a crisis, but this could change at any \nmoment.\n  Our transportation sector consumes the largest amount of energy in \nour society. Passenger vehicles account for 40 percent of the oil \nproducts the Nation consumes each year, or nearly 8 million barrels of \noil each day. And, in 2001, the United States imported 53 percent of \nthe Nation's oil and this is expected to increase to 60 percent or more \nby 2020, according to the Energy Information Administration. So we can \nand must change our oil consumption habits. We can do this by \nimplementing new technologies that will increase fuel efficiency and \nhelp create jobs.\n  A Ford Motor Company representative has stated ``the technology . . . \nhas the potential to significantly improve the fuel economy of \n[vehicles], which could reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions and save consumers money at the pump.''\n  That is why I am introducing an amendment directing the Energy \nDepartment to develop a program that would create measurable goals and \ntimetables with the aim of putting 100,000 hydrogen-fueled fuel cell \nvehicles on the road by 2010 and 2.5 million by 2020, along with the \nneeded hydrogen infrastructure. DOE would have to report annually on \nits progress toward achieving these goals.\n  The amendment is designed to have DOE work with the auto \nmanufacturers to ensure that these goals are met. With this amendment, \nwe are sending a strong message that our goal is to accelerate and \nenhance the development of fuel cell vehicle technologies with concrete \ntargets and timetables.\n  Most major automakers are racing to produce prototype fuel cell \nvehicles. DaimlerChrysler has plans to have fuel-cell cars in \nproduction by 2004.\n  California's clean air act requirements also will ensure that many \nfuel cell vehicles are on the road in the near future. Specifically, by \nnext year, 2003, 2 percent of California's vehicles have to be zero-\nemission vehicles and around 10 percent of its vehicles must be zero-\nemission vehicles by 2018. This means that California could have nearly \n40,000 or 50,000 fuel cell cars on the road by the end of the next \ndecade. Federal fleet purchase requirements also would help realize the \ntargets established in my amendment.\n  I am pleased that my amendment is supported by United Technologies, \nthe Alliance to Save Energy, and Senators Cantwell, Bayh, and Reid.\n  I know there are a number of other Members that also share my \nenthusiasm for hydrogen-fueled fuel cell vehicles, and I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to move this important and promising \ntechnology off the shelves and onto our streets.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3024\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise today to propose an amendment \nto the energy bill that will promote the safe and efficient supply of \nnuclear energy while maintaining strong environmental protections. My \namendment, the Nuclear Safety and Promotion Act, supports the growth of \nnuclear energy, provides regulatory reform to the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, and addresses the personnel crisis at the NRC.\n  According to the Department of Energy, we are going to have to \nincrease the amount of energy we produce by 30 percent by 2015 in order \nto meet our demand. Nuclear power must be a significant part of meeting \nthis demand.\n  My amendment addresses an unintended consequence of the Energy Policy \nAct of 1992 that will help nuclear energy grow in our country. This act \ncreated a combined construction and operating license of 40 years. \nHowever, it inadvertently caused the clock on the 40-year period to \nbegin ticking when the license is issued, not when the facility \nactually begins operating. Since this could result in a difference of \nseveral years, this amendment fixes the quirk in the law by making the \nclock on a license start when a facility begins operating.\n  In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 1954 requires the NRC to \nperform antitrust reviews when considering initial licensing. However, \nthese reviews are currently also performed by the Department of Justice \nand the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. This duplication is \nunnecessary and inefficient. My amendment establishes antitrust review \nauthority firmly in the hands of the Justice Department, who has the \nexperience and background to best perform these reviews.\n  Under this new provision, the NRC would have no authority to either \nreview the application or impose conditions regarding antitrust matters \non any new or renewed license for commercial reactors. The NRC simply \nwould be required to notify the Attorney General when the NRC proposes \nto issue a license for a reactor, and if the Attorney General requests, \nthe NRC would provide general information about the facility and the \napplicants. Thus, the Attorney General would make a determination as to \nwhether the proposed license for the reactor would create or maintain a \nsituation inconsistent with antitrust laws.\n  The licensing process and the antitrust review are two different \nmatters and should be treated as such. The NRC would continue with its \nlicensing action while the Justice Department makes its determination. \nIn fact, this determination would not affect the NRC's licensing action \nin any way. If it is determined that the license would create or \nmaintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws, then the \nAttorney General could take action, but these actions would and should \nbe independent of NRC's licensing process.\n  While removing this inefficient duplicative burden on the NRC, my \namendment also ensures that NRC maintains authority of a facility \nregardless of its status. In most cases, where a nuclear power reactor \nlicensee sells ownership of a reactor to a new licensee, the \nresponsibility for funding decommissioning is the new owner's, and \ndecommissioning funds that have been set aside in a trust fund are \ntransferred to the new licensee as part of the transfer.\n  However, in license transfers involving the Indian Point 3 and \nFitzpatrick reactors, the former licensee has retained the trust funds. \nAlthough the NRC, in approving the transfer of the reactors, imposed \nconditions aimed at ensuring that the former licensee may only use the \ndecomissioning funds for that purpose, I, as well as the NRC, am \nconcerned about this situation not being clearly provided for in law. \nMy amendment would provide the explicit statutory authority to ensure \nthat decomissioning funds are used for that purpose and that \ndecomissioning is done in accordance with NRC regulatory requirements. \nFurthermore, the NRC would be able to retain a decomissioning fund over \nsellers of nuclear facilities even though the seller may no longer be a \nNRC licensee.\n\n[[Page S2901]]\n\n  Additionally, a provision of this amendment would prevent any funds \nor other assets held by a licensee or former licensee of the NRC to be \nused to satisfy the claim of any creditor until the decontamination and \ndecomissioning of the nuclear power reactor is completed. Both of these \nprovisions ensure that decomissioning funds are used for \ndecomissioning.\n  One of the biggest problems in our country and government is the \nhuman capital crisis, and the NRC is no different. The NRC currently \nhas six times as many employees older than 60 as it does under age 30, \nmeaning that a potential wave of retirements could leave the agency \nwithout the expertise it needs. Adding to this problem is the fact that \nformer employees cannot consult for the NRC without jeopardizing their \npensions. These are people with critical skills that cannot provide \ntheir expertise without being penalized.\n  Fortunately, the Office of Personnel Management has provided the NRC \nwith a limited-scope, temporary pension offset waiver to rehire former \nemployees. My amendment would eliminate this pension offset to help \npreserve the knowledge base by allowing individuals with critical \nskills to be hired as consultants in future years. Under this \namendment, individuals like the former Deputy Director of the Office of \nNuclear Regulatory Research, who has 44 years of experience in the \nnuclear industry and is currently consulting with the NRC due to the \ntemporary waiver, would be paid for their consulting services to the \nNRC while still receiving their federal pensions.\n  The NRC is also facing extreme shortages of individuals with critical \nsafety skills. The numbers of education and training programs in the \ntwo basic disciplines, nuclear engineering and health physics, are \ndeclining. From 1996 to 2001, university programs in nuclear \nengineering have declined 26 percent, from 50 to 37, and healthy \nphysics programs have declined 12 percent, from 49 to 43. Within the \ngeneral disciplines, the NRC is experiencing shortages of people with a \nvariety of critical skills, including: nuclear process engineering, \nthermal hydraulics, geology, structural engineering, and \ntransportation. The shortages in these fields are a result of NRC's \naging workforce and nuclear industry requirements. Over the next \ndecade, the demand for nuclear engineers is projected to be twice the \nsupply, and for health physicists, one and one half times the supply.\n  To help train and recruit the next generation of nuclear regulatory \nspecialists, this amendment authorizes the NRC to fund academic \nfellowships to address shortages of individuals with critical safety \nskills. Instead of the funding coming from user fees, $1 million would \nbe authorized per year for 2002-2005. The ability to fund training \nprograms in specialized areas at universities would enable the NRC to \nimplement more timely and effective strategies to close future skill \ngaps identified through the agency's planning processes.\n  Our Nation needs to be responsible to future generations. We must \nallow nuclear energy to grow today to meet future needs. We also must \nrealize that our resources are scarce and we should not waste them on \nduplicative and costly regulatory burdens that place us into further \ndebt. We also must plan for the future by ensuring that nuclear plants \nare cared for properly when they are closed, that we fully utilize the \npeople who have spent years in this industry, and that have future \ngenerations with the necessary critical skills.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 3148 Through 3156, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, last week I joined with Senator Kerry in \noffering an amendment dealing with small business energy efficiency. \nThat particular amendment dealt with the Energy Star Program, which is \nan important program in helping small businesses become more energy \nefficient. The amendment I offer today, which was developed with the \nhelp of Senators Kerry, Ensign, Cantwell, Lieberman, and Carnahan, \ncomplements that language.\n  First I would like to take a moment to thank Senators Bingaman and \nMurkowski and their staffs for helping us to address this issue given \nrelatively short notice. Despite the fact that they have been very busy \nwith many other aspects of this bill, they took the time to help us \nwork out some language that everyone could accept. I would also like to \necho Senator Kerry's remarks last week thanking Byron Kennard at the \nCenter for Small Business and the Environment and Carol Werner at the \nEnvironmental and Energy Study Institute for their role in bringing \nthis important issue to the forefront.\n  Simply put, this amendment addresses the need for Federal agencies to \nhelp small businesses become more energy efficient. I just want to take \na minute to explain why I believe this language is necessary. Small \nbusinesses are often the hardest hit by energy unreliability and big \nprice hikes. Many operate on slim profit margins, so the threat of big \nincreases in electric bills can force small businesses to lay off \nworkers or even to close their doors.\n  Restaurants, for example, are highly energy intensive and they tend \nto use energy inefficiently. As my colleagues know, restaurants were \nsome of the hardest-hit businesses following the slump in tourism after \nthe September 11 attacks. Restaurants are also unique because they also \noperate on narrow margins of profit, so money saved on energy bills can \neasily equal a big boost in revenue. According to EPA, saving 20 \npercent on energy operating costs--something that's easily achievable--\ncan increase a restaurant's profit as much as one-third.\n  Small firms, however, often lack access to capital and the know-how \nto purchase and install new energy efficient products, and to fund the \nresearch and development stage of such innovations. As Senator Kerry \nexpressed in his remarks yesterday, Federal agencies, the Small \nBusiness Administration in particular, have the resources, contacts and \npersonnel necessary to give a real helping hand to small businesses in \nthese situations.\n  The SBA, for instance, deals with thousands of small businesses \nacross the country on a regular basis, serving as a clearinghouse for \ninformation, a counselor, and a guarantor of loans for these \nbusinesses. It would be quite simple for the SBA to expand its role to \nprovide assistance in the area of energy efficiency. The Environmental \nProtection Agency, the Department of Energy, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, and the Department of Agriculture also have roles to \nplay in these efforts.\n  Let me share a success story from a small business in my own State of \nLouisiana. There is a law firm in Baton Rouge, Jerry F. Pepper, APLC. \nThe firm recently remodeled its offices to make them more energy \nefficient. Thermostats, air filters, and lights were all replaced with \nnewer, more efficient models.\n  The firm believes that, in addition to a savings of $6,100 annually--\nlet me repeat that amount, $6,100 per year--the upgrades will improve \nemployee morale and productivity, reduce indoor pollution, and improve \nsafety. Additionally, the upgrade for this firm--for one law firm in \nBaton Rouge--is estimated to reduce over 100,000 pounds of carbon \ndioxide annually.\n  I want my colleagues to imagine for a moment that every small \nbusiness in America upgraded its energy efficiency with similar \nresults. The savings in energy, pollution, and money would be \nincredible. But these businesses cannot do it on their own. Their \nprofit margins are too tight; their resources are too limited. But \nFederal agencies like the SBA have the resources and know-how to assist \nthese businesses in these efforts.\n  That is why I am proud to join other members of the Small Business \nCommittee to offer this important language to help our Nation's small \nbusinesses become more energy efficient.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Landrieu, in introducing an amendment regarding the need to \nassist more small businesses become energy efficient.\n  This legislation reinforces a small business amendment that Senator \nLandrieu and I put forth last week regarding the Energy Star Program. \nIt was successfully adopted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2002, \nand I thank Senators Bingaman and Murkowski for that.\n  There is an obvious missing player in our efforts to increase the \nnumber of small businesses that are using or developing products and \nprocesses that save energy, and it is the Small Business \nAdministration. This amendment directs the Administration to develop \nand coordinate a government-wide program that educates small firms \nabout the cost-benefits and business advantages of energy efficiency.\n  I was astounded to learn last year, during a hearing I held on the \nbusiness of environmental technologies, that SBA is not actively \nworking with DoE and the EPA to advertise their joint program for \npromoting energy efficiency of small business. This is particularly \nhard to understand given that there is so much work to be done. There \nare an estimated 25 million small businesses in this country, and they \naccount for more than half of all the commercial energy used in North \nAmerica. However, according to Paul Stolpman, who testified on behalf \nof the EPA, only 3,000 small businesses have partnered with EPA in \ncommitting to improve their energy performance.\n  I am not criticizing the EPA or the Department of Energy; they have a \ngood initiative, and I support their efforts. I am simply pointing out \nthat there are millions of small businesses left to reach, millions of \nopportunities to reduce energy consumption in this country. It is basic \ncommon sense that SBA could help significantly in that effort. After \nall the financial hardships small businesses suffered over the last \ncouple of years because of price spikes and unreliability, energy isn't \neven a prominent issue on SBA's website.\n  To illustrate the power of education and the need to coordinate \noutreach efforts through the SBA, I would like to share a story about \none of the small businesses in my home State of Massachusetts that \nbenefitted greatly from making energy modifications. Carl Faulkner is \nthe owner of the Williams Inn in Williamstown. Years ago, he was \napproached by his energy company to receive a free energy audit and \nrebates to off-set the cost of upgrading his lighting systems. It \nseemed like a good idea, so he went ahead and took them up on their \noffer. After all was said and done, between the rebates and his new \nenergy savings, he recovered his expenses in just 1 month. But that is \nnot the end of the story. The results of those simple changes were so \npositive that he was inspired to learn even more about energy savings \nand to investigate where else his business was losing money on \nunnecessary energy usage. Since then he has put on special roofing, \nreplaced air conditioner units, put insulation around pipes, and \ninstalled meters to determine when and where his business uses the most \nenergy. With this information, Mr. Faulkner can bring down usage, \nsaving even more energy and money.\n  These simple changes have yielded vast results. In January and \nFebruary, he saved more than $10,000. Mr. Faulkner now considers energy \nefficiency a never-ending process. He says if it weren't for outreach, \nhe never would have made these important changes to\n\n[[Page S2904]]\n\nhis business. He changed his business from one that was consuming \nenergy at an unmonitored level to one that has an energy management \nsystem that allows him to identify other savings.\n  In addition to increasing energy efficiency of small businesses in \norder to reduce consumption, to reduce pollution, and to reduce \nreliance on foreign oil, there is a need for Federal agencies to \nincrease their work with small business to research and develop new \ntechnologies and processes that are more energy efficient. In 1999, the \nSBA investigated the role of small business in technological innovation \nand found that when a market demands progress, change, and evolution, \nsmall firms play a key role. Just looking back to 1997, there were more \nthan 33,000 small firms operating in the environmental industry, with \ncombined revenues of $52 billion. That is billion. In Massachusetts \nalone, environmental technology businesses employ more than 30,000. No \nmatter how you cut it, revenues, jobs, pollution reduction, energy \nsupply, national security, there is a very good reason to encourage the \ninnovation of efficient technology. And the Federal Government needs to \nmake a serious effort to use small businesses to do that research and \ndevelopment as much as possible. At the very least, I would like to see \na focus on these topics through the small business research and \ndevelopment projects through the Small Business Innovation Research and \nSmall Business Technology Transfer initiatives. We have got the finest \nresearch universities in the world and certainly the most dynamic small \nbusiness sector. I want a coordinated and heightened effort to use \nthese resources for national energy policy.\n  As I said yesterday when we were debating the proposal to drill in \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we cannot drill our way out of our \nenergy problem. We must innovate our way out of our energy problem. Not \njust innovation in more fuel efficient cars, but also appliances. If \nthe Bush administration would fully implement efficiency standards for \nappliances that were issued in 1997 and last year, the Department of \nEnergy estimates the total savings to business and consumers to be $27 \nbillion by 2030. Why? Simply because of less energy use and generally \nless demand when using more efficient appliances. We can go further \nwith more innovation. And we need to use Federal agencies to increase \nthe interplay between small businesses, innovation, and the Nation's \nenvironmental and energy goals.\n  I thank Senator Landrieu for offering this amendment. And again I \nthank Senators Bingaman and Murkowski, and their staffs, for their help \nin passing this small business amendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3153\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues \nSenators Bingaman and Murkowski for their support of and efforts to \npass my amendment to improve energy efficiency in public housing, which \ncleared the Senate Floor earlier today. I would also like to thank my \ncolleagues on the Banking Committee, Chairman Sarbanes and Ranking \nMember Gramm for their assistance in passing this amendment.\n  My amendment will help reduce our Nation's energy consumption and \nreduce long-term energy costs in public housing. The amendment \naccomplishes this by giving the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, HUD, and the public housing authorities, PHAs, it oversees \nthe tools they need to increase energy efficiency in public housing \ndevelopments.\n  HUD and public housing authorities oversee approximately 1.3 million \nunits of residential low-income public housing across the country. The \nFederal Government spends approximately $1.4 billion each year just to \ncool, heat, light, and supply water to these units. Utility costs make \nup anywhere from 25 to 40 percent of a typical housing authority's \noperating budget.\n  Despite the large amount of Federal dollars spent on energy usage in \npublic housing, there are virtually no resources to help public housing \nauthorities manage their utility expenditures. Furthermore, there are \nfew incentives for them to utilize energy efficient technologies.\n  My amendment addresses these issues, first, by establishing an Office \nof Energy Management at HUD. This office will coordinate energy \nmanagement activities throughout the public housing system so that \nenergy management is less fragmented and technical expertise is made \navailable to all public housing authorities.\n  The amendment will also improve financial incentives available to \npublic housing authorities to implement energy saving strategies, such \nas window replacements, heating system retrofits, and other efficiency \nand renewable measures. The amendment also encourages public housing \nauthorities to purchase Energy Star appliances and equipment when \nreplacing outdated building systems and equipment.\n  Finally, my amendment requires that all new public housing \nconstruction meet current energy codes where cost effective. Most \nStates have not adopted the most recent codes and, in some cases, do \nnot require adherence to any code. Meeting these updated codes will \nsave public housing authorities as much as 15 percent in annual energy \ncosts.\n  The bottom line is that this legislation would expand the resources \navailable to provide low-income housing without increasing Federal \nspending. HUD has conservatively estimated that improved energy \nmanagement processes throughout all of its public housing programs \ncould save about $200 million annually. These savings could be used to \nbuild more affordable housing and improve the quality of life of public \nhousing residents. Improving energy efficiency in public housing units \nwill also decrease utility costs for low-income residents, who often \npay a portion of their utility expenses.\n  At a time of skyrocketing utility costs and decreased public housing \nfunds, my amendment offers commonsense solutions that will reduce \npublic housing's reliance on fossil fuels and free up resources to \nimprove housing for low-income families.\n\n\n                Amendments Nos. 3028 And 3070, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Finally, I ask unanimous consent amendment No. 3028 and \namendment No. 3070 be withdrawn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, like most of my colleagues, I have lived \nthrough a number of the energy crises which have afflicted our country. \nI was living and working on the East Coast during the first oil crisis \nin 1973 and 1974. People lined up at gas stations, starting at 3 or 4 \nin the morning to purchase a few gallons before the day's scarce \nsupplies ran out.\n  In January 1977, during one of the coldest winters ever recorded in \nMinnesota, I serve as the Energy Policy Adviser to our State's \nGovernor, when he declared Minnesota's first official energy emergency.\n  From 1983 to 1987, I served as commissioner of the Minnesota \nDepartment of Energy and Economic Development, where I was constantly \nmonitoring the State's energy supplies. I will never forget one \nChristmas Eve, which I spent trying to locate a refinery that would \nreopen and provide desperately needed home heating oil to people in \nnorthern Minnesota who had run out of their own supplies.\n  From these experiences, I have become a hard-headed realist and a \npragmatist about energy policy. I am well aware of the fragility of our \ncountry's energy supplies, pipelines, transmission lines, and \nrefineries, where even a small disruption can trigger major \ndislocations which quickly create a crisis. In a cold-weather State \nlike Minnesota, the consequences of a disruption in energy supplies can \nbe very serious and even fatal.\n  I have viewed ``renewable'' or ``alternative'' forms of energy with \nhope but also reservations. While sometimes viable on a small scale, \nmost of them are not capable of supplying the large-scale energy needs \nof our vast and complex society and our economy. That is why the \npercentage of U.S. energy consumption from renewable sources has \nremained essentially the same for the last 40 years. In 1960, renewable \nprovided 6.6 percent; and in the year 2000, renewable energy provided \n6.9 percent of our country's total energy consumption. Why, despite \ntheir promise, despite the encouragement and the financial assistance \nthey have received, has the usage of renewable energy sources\n\n[[Page S2905]]\n\nin this country not increased in 40 years?\n  It is because none of them can compete in price, supply, or public \nacceptance with the traditional energy sources of oil, natural gas, \ncoal, and nuclear energy. As long as sufficient supplies of these fuels \nremain reliably available at current, stable prices, they will be \npreferred over the alternatives. They cost less per BTU; they can be \nsupplied in the quantities necessary for our large and diverse economy; \nand their production, transportation, and distribution systems are all \nwell established.\n  Thus, our Nation's de facto energy policy has been for many years and \ncontinues to be to maintain the status quo. Despite all the warnings \nand dire predictions, despite the occasional, but so far short-lived \ncrises, the status quo has been the right short-term policy during the \nlast 30 years. However, the question before us now is: Will these \nprimary fuels continue to be as less expensive, as available, and as \nreliable during the next 10 years, 20 years, or 30 years? If there is \nsufficient doubt, are we willing to design and implement a transition \nwilling to design and implement a transition over the next 10 or 20 \nyears to include a viable alternative? That is what a national energy \npolicy should do.\n\n  From my personal and professional experience, I know that the so-\ncalled ``bio-fuels'' or ``renewable fuels,'' such as ethanol, soy-\ndiesel, and other fuels derived from agricultural commodities could be \nused in this country today to replace 10 percent, 20 percent, or soon \n50 percent or more of the gasoline used on our Nation's roads and \nhighways.\n  Presently, the United States consumers 25 percent of the world's \nentire oil production. About 44 percent of it is produced domestically, \nand 56 percent is imported from other countries.\n  Although the United States is currently the second largest producer \nof oil, our domestic production, either with or without ANWR, will not \nbe able to supply even half the amount we consume. Since most of our \nremaining oil supplies are more costly to extract, it will be less \nexpensive for us to buy more of our oil from other countries. That \nequation means we will continue to become more dependent upon imported \noil. The only way to reduce significantly the amount of foreign oil we \nneed is to reduce the amount of oil we consume.\n  Seventy percent of the oil we produce or import is used in our \ntransportation and most of that goes into our cars, SUVs, trucks, and \nother motor vehicles. In fact, about 1 of every 7 barrels of oil \nproduced in the entire world goes into an American gas tank. So, if we \nare ever going to reduce the amount of oil we consume, motor fuel \nconsumption is the place to start.\n  Unfortunately, as I said earlier, we are going in the other \ndirection. As a Nation, we are using more gasoline, not less. More \npeople are driving more vehicles greater distances than even before. \nAnd more of their vehicles are less fuel efficient. In fact, last year \nthe total fleet fuel efficiency in this country dropped below that in \n1980.\n  What are we doing about it? Nothing. Government-mandated fuel \nefficiency standards have not changed since 1985, and an amendment to \nincrease them in this bill was defeated by a two-thirds majority. Then \nlight trucks were removed entirely from future mileage standards \nreview. Light trucks and SUVs, are the fastest growing segments of the \nU.S. market, and they are among the least fuel efficient vehicles.\n  Some people advocate a significant increase in Federal or State \ngasoline taxes, to reduce fuel consumption to encourage the purchase of \nmore fuel-efficient vehicles, and to increase the amount of money going \ninto the Highway Trust Fund. How many Members of Congress who voted for \na 10 cent per gallon, of 20 or 30 cent per gallon tax increase, would \nsurvive their next election?\n  So, barring a severe jolt to the world market, barring a large and \nlasting jump in gasoline prices, everything points toward increased \ngasoline consumption, which means increased oil consumption above the \n25 percent of all the world's oil supply production that we now \nconsume.\n\n  Everything points in that direction except for ethanol and other \nbiofuels. Ethanol is now made mostly from corn, although other \ncommodities such as sugar beets, sugar cane, wheat, and even wood chips \nhave been converted into ethanol. Ethanol has been around for many \nyears. Many Minnesota farmers have distilled some of their grains, \ndrank the best of it, and refined the rest into ethanol, which they put \nin their trucks, tractors, and even cars. With a few adjustments to the \ncarburetors, they worked just fine. Until recently, however, ethanol \ncould not be used in most conventional American engines, because it \nburned too cleanly and acted as a solvent which dislodged the grime \nattached to the walls of engines.\n  Finally, the combustion process in modern engines improved so that \nethanol could be blended with gasoline. That is how it has been used, \nand that is how it is viewed in the debates this week and last week--as \nan additive to gasoline.\n  In fact, ethanol's potential goes far beyond that. It is not just an \nadditive to gasoline; it is an alternative to gasoline. An alternative \nwhich today could be substituted for 20 percent of all the gasoline \nconsumed in the United States, and with the near-term potential to \nsubstitute for over 50 percent of the oil-based gasoline used in this \ncountry. Imagine reducing the motor consumption of gasoline in this \ncountry by more than half, with no change in the types of cars, SUV's, \nand light trucks on the road. It would require only slight engine \nmodifications which have been made to 2 million vehicles already sold \nin the United States.\n  How do I know this? I know it because 5 years ago, the Minnesota \nLegislature passed a law which mandated that every gallon of gasoline \nsold in our state be comprised of at least 10 percent ethanol. It was \nvery controversial then, and opponents used the same scare tactics we \nhave witnessed in this debate: Prices would increase; supplies would be \ninadequate and unreliable; engines would be damaged; lives would be \ndisrupted. Today, in Minnesota, it is a total non-issue. Most people \nhave forgotten it is even in every gallon of gas they buy. Last week, \nthe price of a gallon of regular, unleaded gasoline in Minnesota was 20 \ncents less than in California, a penny more than in New York, two cents \nless than in Wisconsin, and almost a nickel less than in Illinois.\n  We have heard of a study, referred to here, which is misunderstood \nand has been presented as predicting that this legislation would cause \na 4-cent to 9-cent increase in the cost of a gallon of gasoline. That \nstudy by the Energy Information Administration, isolating the effect of \nethanol, the ethanol mandate in the legislation, actually found the \nprice of a gallon of gasoline would go up by less than 1 cent.\n  But let us set aside the study and conflicting opinions about what \nthat study says because that is projecting into the future. I am \ntalking about current reality. What I am talking about is the price of \n10 percent blended ethanol in today's gasoline in Minnesota compared to \nother parts of the country. Again, that is just 10 percent ethanol \nblended with 90 percent gasoline.\n  I lease a Chrysler Town & Country, which has the ``flexible fuel'' \nmodification to the regular engine, and it travels throughout most of \nMinnesota on E85 fuel. E85 is a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 \npercent gasoline. It has now been driven over 20,000 miles, in all \nkinds of weather, through all four seasons, and we have had no trouble \nwith it whatsoever.\n  The price of a gallon of E85 in Minnesota last week was $1.24, 21 \ncents less than a gallon of regular unleaded in Minnesota--forty-two \ncents less than a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline in California; 20 \ncents less than in New York; and 26 cents less than in Illinois.\n  That price differential is not as good as it seems. First, a gallon \nof ethanol contains fewer BTUs than a gallon of gasoline. Second, \nethanol benefits from a federal subsidy. As I said earlier, no \nalternative fuel is less expensive per equivalent BTU as our \ntraditional energy supplies. But ethanol is already close. And at \nhigher levels of production, the price will go down. As car and truck \nmanufacturers better adapt their engine to ethanol, fuel efficiency \nwill improve. And, trust me, we have plenty of corn, beets, and sugar \ncane, and other agricultural commodities suitable for ethanol \nconversion all across this country.\n  However, for ethanol production and consumption to increase enough to\n\n[[Page S2906]]\n\ncause a significant reduction in the amount of gasoline consumed in \nthis country, it needs what Minnesota provided--a mandate; a mandate \nsuch as this bill contains; a gradual, graduated, achievable increase \nover a decade. With that mandate, ethanol providers and would-be \nproviders will know there is a reliable and growing market nationwide \nfor ethanol.\n  Opponents have made much of the fact that one company--Archer Daniels \nMidland--produces 41 percent of this country's ethanol. What they don't \ntell you is that 25 years ago ADM produced almost 100 percent of this \ncountry's ethanol. ADM's market share has gone down every year for the \nlast 25 years, and it will continue to go down as more companies, and \nfarm Coops, make it possible and profitable to produce ethanol. For \nunlike gasoline, ethanol's raw products are available all over this \ncountry. They can be grown in most parts of this country. Where there \nare large markets, like California or New York, refineries will locate \nthere. Just as California, as it population grew, declined to depend on \nmilk and cheese from Minnesota and Wisconsin, and developed its own \ninstate industry which supplies, actually oversupplies, its State's \nentire need.\n\n  If ethanol must be transported by truck, or tanker, or rail from one \npart of this country to another, it is far shorter and thus less \nexpensive than importing oil, gasoline, and MTBE from all over the \nworld. Seventy-five percent of California MTBE currently arrives by \nbarge, the majority of it from Saudi Arabia. That is why the price per \ngallon increases which have been used on this floor defy common sense. \nAnd they are wrong.\n  The alternative to doing nothing with ethanol is doing nothing at \nall--nothing except increasing our national consumption of gasoline and \noil. If world prices remain the same as today, and if world and \ndomestic supplies can reliably satisfy our nation's ever-growing \ndemand, then that ``continue the status quo'' strategy will continue to \nbe less expensive than a transition to 10 percent or 20 percent or 50 \npercent ethanol.\n  But those who live by the sword, die by the sword. Those who want to \nbet this Nation's entire transportation sector on the status quo \ncontinuing indefinitely are taking a big gamble. Anyone who believes \nthe United States can continue to get 25 percent of the world's entire \noil production at today's prices are making a hugely optimistic \nassumption.\n  Yes. There will likely be an incremental cost to a transition to \nethanol nationwide. There is always a short-term cost to \ndiversification. A business that has one produce line incurs a cost to \ndeveloping a second or a third product. As long as the first product \ncontinues to sell, overall profits will be slightly down. But when that \nproduct falters, and the others come on line, the company will prosper \nand grow, rather than decline.\n  Someone who owns only one stock incurs a short-term cost \ndiversification. But someone who is betting their entire future on that \none stock is a foolish person to do so. For the United States to bet \nour country's entire energy future on uninterrupted consumption of our \never more traditional energy sources is to make a very unwise bet.\n  We can afford the small incremental costs of transition if they lead \nto really substantial alternatives. That is what ethanol and biodiesel \nwould do--replace 20 percent of today's diesel fuel over this entire \ncountry.\n  I am a Senator from a corn- and soybean-producing State. Is ethanol \nproduction an economic boon to many Minnesota farmers? Yes; it is. I \nhope it will continue to raise market prices for these agricultural \ncommodities, which will reduce the need for and the amount of taxpayer \nsubsidies. However, I would not stand on the floor of the Senate today \nand advocate ethanol as an alternative fuel for the entire country if I \ndid not believe--if I were not certain--that it would be good for the \nentire country.\n  It will take the decade which this bill uses to increase ethanol \nproduction to an amount where it can be used as a consistent 10 percent \nblend nationwide. That is what Minnesota uses today. That would be 10 \npercent less oil-based gasoline. And that is twice as much oil \nalternative as ANWR would produce at that point in time.\n  It will take another decade to increase ethanol production to replace \nup to 50 percent of our current gasoline consumption. We should hope we \nhave that long as a nation before a significant increase in the price \nof gasoline or a lack of supply causes a serious disruption in our \neconomy and in our lives. If, however, at that point in time we are \nusing 50 percent less gasoline, we will have a real alternative fuel at \na lower cost and a more reliable supply based right here in the United \nStates.\n  If we don't undertake this transition, then we will have nothing--\nnothing that we can do. That is what the amendment that strips this \nbill of any fuel alternative will leave this country in the future--\nnothing, no alternative. That is a very bleak future.\n  Thank you.

Mr. President, I congratulate the Senate for \nthe tremendous vote we had today on basically dispensing with the \nattempt to amend the bill of the Senator from New Mexico to drill in \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The vote ended up being a lot \nstronger than a lot of people expected. For us just to talk about the \nsensitive environment and the drilling is certainly a very important \ncomponent of the question. But the question is so much more \ncomprehensive. It is a question of when is America going to be energy \nreliant, and are we going to ween ourselves from our dependence on \nforeign oil, and how are we going to produce that energy?\n  As the chairman of the Energy Committee has reminded us many times, \nthe biggest part of our energy consumption is in the transportation \nsector. And if we don't ever address the enormous consumption of energy \nin the cars that we drive, then we will remain dependent on all that \nforeign oil. There is an easy way to do that, and that is to use this \nbeneficence of American ingenuity called technology and apply it to the \nproblem and increase the miles per gallon in our automobiles and SUVs \nand light trucks, which we can do so well.\n\n  Already we have hybrid vehicles that, because of a computer, go back \nand forth between an electric generation and gasoline generation, and \nyou cannot tell the difference as the driver and the passenger, with \nall the creature comforts that we enjoy in our automobiles.\n  So I congratulate the Senate and I congratulate the chairman of the \nEnergy Committee--who now graciously has offered to take the Chair so \nthat I might make these few remarks--for an extraordinary effort. I \nhope that now he is able to proceed with the energy bill and finally \nget it passed out of this body.\n  I also want to take a moment to state, with a sober and heavy heart, \nwhat we are facing in the Middle East. From the standpoint of the \nUnited States, it is very clear what is in our interest, and that is \npeace in the Middle East, a cessation of firing, a creation of an \nenvironment where the parties can come together.\n  A week and a half ago I was in Damascus, Syria, and met with the new \nyoung President who took over after his father died, President Assad. \nWe said: President Assad, now is the time for leaders outside of the \nPalestinians and the Israelis to emerge in the area and to realize that \nit is in your interest that there be peace in the Middle East.\n  We thanked him for his help and his intelligence network with regard \nto\n\n[[Page S2907]]\n\nour efforts in going after the al-Qaida terrorists.\n  We said: President Assad, you have to go after the groups, such as \nHezbollah, that you are offering facilities to, which are also \nfostering terrorism.\n  Of course, he rejected that. His point of view was that they were \nfreedom fighters. There is a lot of politics in it.\n  It will take leaders such as Assad and the leader of Lebanon, with \nwhom I met yesterday, the Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafiq Hariri, to \nemerge as leaders in the Arab world and say: We have to change the old \nways; we have to do it differently, and violence and killing is not in \nour interest.\n  Those Arab leaders are going to have to say vigorously to their \ncolleagues that it is in their interest that they create an environment \nwhere they can solve this violent situation in the Middle East and \nbring the Palestinians and Israelis together. As the Good Book says, \n``Come let us reason together.''\n  I am very grateful that the Senator took the Chair so I could come to \nmy desk and make these remarks.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise to speak out on a subject \nthat is both timely and extremely important to the American people. A \nfew hours ago, the House of Representatives, showing an unimaginable \nindifference to the retirement security of American families, and \nfurther undermining the integrity of the Social Security trust fund, \nmade permanent the tax cuts that were enacted last year.\n  The bill they passed really frames a stark choice for the American \npeople: Do we take payroll tax revenues that working people, working \nAmericans, thought were being dedicated to the Social Security trust \nfund and use them instead to pay for this huge new tax cut, a tax cut \nthat really goes to the wealthiest of Americans or should we be using \nSocial Security revenues, payroll taxes, for their intended use, \nsecuring the Social Security trust fund for this and future \ngenerations?\n  It is a pretty fundamental choice. It is pretty starkly laid out by \nthe nature of the tax cut that was endorsed by the House Republicans \ntoday. It is a choice that will impact all Americans.\n  I believe if Americans were asked, they might come up with a \ndifferent answer. I think they would choose security, Social Security, \nnot tax breaks that would take the security out of Social Security.\n  I want to give one perspective. The tax cut that was implemented \ntoday in the House is about $400 billion more in the next decade, and \n60 percent of that upcoming tax cut goes to those with incomes over \n$500,000. That is hard to believe. Of the additional $400 billion, 60 \npercent is going to people with incomes over $500,000. I have a hard \ntime understanding why we are taking payroll taxes and the Social \nSecurity trust fund to fund that kind of tax cut.\n\n  The effort to make that tax cut permanent is not only misallocating \nresources, but in my view it is draining the resources that are badly \nneeded to protect Social Security in the years ahead for those millions \nof baby boomers who will be retiring in the coming decades. It is \nreally quite substantial.\n  Right now, Social Security has about 46 million folks retired. In \nanother 20 years, that will be 72 million. So it is a big change in the \npopulation. That is what the demographic bubble is all about. How are \nwe going to pay for it if we are going to implement tax cuts that are \ngoing to take as much as $4 trillion away from the ability of the \nAmerican public to have revenues to pay for Social Security in the \nyears ahead in the second 10 years? It is hard for me to understand.\n  More importantly, I want to consider two numbers. The 75-year cost of \nthe tax cut is $8.7 trillion. That is a lot of money. It will take \nawhile to count that far. By contrast, the shortfall in the funding to \nmaintain the currently guaranteed benefits for Social Security \nbeneficiaries, of all generations over the next 75 years, is only $3.7 \ntrillion. So we have more than two times coverage by the tax cut that \nwas implemented. If it were to be followed in the way the House did it, \nwe would be giving up those revenues to cover the needs of Social \nSecurity. I do not get it. We have the resources, if we have the will, \nto make sure that Social Security is there for each and every \ngeneration.\n  So that is part of the trouble. Unfortunately, these drains on Social \nSecurity revenues that are caused by this tax cut are step 1 in the \nadministration's plan to undermine the security of Social Security. \nStep 2 is to privatize that program; that is, taking $1 trillion out of \nthe trust fund--it is actually a little more than $1 trillion, but for \nround numbers, and it is a big number--in the next decade so we can \nprovide funding for these private accounts. That is going to lead to a \ndramatic cut in benefits which are absolutely necessary.\n  If one has any doubt about it, they just have to look at the report \nreleased by the President's Commission on Social Security. They talk \nabout it themselves. That, when it gets translated into individual \nlives, as we move to the next chart, will reduce benefits for a 30-\nyear-old about 20 percent when they retire in about 2032.\n  For those who are a little younger than that, it will be almost 45 \npercent by 2075, a cut in Social Security benefits, 20 percent for 30-\nyear-olds, 25 percent for people who are starting in the workplace, and \nabout 45 percent for younger Americans.\n  If one thinks Social Security benefits are lavish, I think we all \nhave another review to go through. That 25- to 45-percent cut, that \ngoes against benefits that average about $10,000 a year for most Social \nSecurity beneficiaries. For most seniors, Social Security is their only \nsource of income, about two-thirds of them. I do not know what happens \nin Florida, but in my State of New Jersey $10,000 is not a princely \nsum. It is not going to allow our seniors to have a tremendously flush \nlifestyle.\n  To the President's commission, that $10,000 looks like too much \nbecause they are instituting a program that, in fact, will undermine \nthe ability to maintain those guaranteed benefits at that level. I \nthink that is hard to believe as well. That is step 2.\n\n  They do not want us to have the ability to maintain those guaranteed \nbenefits. What they want to do is have that tax cut that I talked about \nbefore.\n  So I have to say that both for myself and for my colleagues, most of \nus on this side of the aisle, we have a different view about protecting \nSocial Security. We think protecting the security of working American \nfamilies must be our top priority. We are going to fight long and hard \nand steady to make sure Social Security is not undermined--not today, \nas was done through the passage of this tax bill in the House, not \ntomorrow, or in the years ahead, not ever.\n  Today's choice that was put in front of us is whether Social Security \nis really about the security of all Americans in their retirement \nyears. I do not think we should be taking the term ``security'' out of \nSocial Security. We ought to stand firm with it.

Mr. President, perhaps no issue related to the energy \ndebate in the Senate has suffered more as a result of misinformation \nthan the renewable fuels standard agreement. This historic agreement \nwas arrived at after years of careful and considerate negotiation from \nall sectors of interest; environmentalists, fanners, oil industry \nrepresentatives, and politicians included.\n  Simply stated, it directs the gradual increased production and \nintegration of ethanol and other biofuels--renewable fuel sources--into \nthe U.S. fuel supply. The increase in available alternative fuels such \nas ethanol and biodiesel are sure to result in a cleaner environment, \nan ease on supply, and a reduction on the U.S. dependence on foreign \noil--a national security imperative.\n  Opponents of the renewable fuels standard have raised the specter of \nan increase in gas prices as a result of increased ethanol production. \nSome claim that motorists could pay as much as 4 to 9 cents extra per \ngallon. However, in parts of the Nation where ethanol constitutes a \nsignificant share of the market, over the past 10 years, there has been \nessentially no difference in price between ethanol and nonethanol \ngasoline.\n  According to a consulting firm working for the Oxygenated Fuels \nAssociation, whose members produce and market MTBE, 70 percent of which \nis imported--the defeat of the RFS will keep the MTBE market alive--it \nis 4 to 9.75 cents per gallon. According to the Department of Energy's \nEnergy Information Administration it is 5 to less than 1 cent per \ngallon. The marketplace reality is: 20 years' experience in Nebraska--\n$.01 less than ethanol-free gasoline at the pump; 10 years' experience \nin Minnesota--$.08 less than gasoline at the wholesale level; 1.5 \nyears' experience in California--no essential difference to the public; \nand 10 years' experience nationwide--no essential difference to the \npublic.\n  The question is which numbers do you believe. Furthermore, the \navailability of ethanol blends has been shown to drive down the price \nof all gasoline as a result of market forces.\n  Another false argument against ethanol's we've heard is that \nproducing ethanol consumes nearly as much nonrenewable oil as the \nethanol replaces. The latest U.S. Department of Agriculture report \ndemonstrates that ethanol production has a positive energy balance of \n1:1.34 and only 17 percent of that energy comes from fossil oil. The \nbulk of the energy used in fertilizing the crops and to power ethanol \nproduction plants comes from natural gas or coal. Additionally, with \nfarmers using more ethanol and biodiesel in their vehicles, and the \nadvance of biorefineries using cellulosic biomass including \nagricultural and forestry crops and residues, as well as other biomass \nand animal waste with disposal problems, the use of fossil fuels to \nproduce biofuels could approach zero.\n  Where opponents really miss the point is in their failure to \nrecognize the threat posed to America's national, energy, and economic \nsecurity by our dangerous dependence on oil imports. In 1999, America \nwas importing over 55 percent of its oil and petroleum products. Just 2 \nyears later, our dependency increased to over 59 percent--and part of \nthose supplies are in jeopardy because of the unpredictability of \nSaddam Hussien and political instability in other oil-producing \nnations.\n  Failure to provide an adequate market for ethanol is a major factor \nin preventing the emergence of biofuels made from cellulosic biomass. \nThe renewable fuels standard is critical to advance biorefinery \ntechnology that will produce urgently needed refined, domestic, \nrenewable, and clean burning biofuels. The biorefineries, very small \ncompared to oil refineries, will be well disbursed throughout the \ncountry and much less prone to terrorists' attacks.\n  Opponents wail about a monopoly in the ethanol industry and that only \na small group of producers will benefit from the renewable fuels \nstandard. This is inaccurate on two fronts.\n  Essentially all the ethanol and biodiesel plants under construction \nand in planning phases are smaller plants owned by cooperatives and \ncommunity enterprises. More importantly, the RFS will provide the \nimpetus to launch the construction of biorefineries across the Nation.\n  Some perceive the RFS as a targeted massive Federal Government \nsubsidy to benefit only farm belt States. In fact, the renewable fuels \nstandard will encourage technology advancements that could be located \nand employed in any region of the United States, not just the ``corn \nstates.'' It will enhance the Nation's economy, surely in agriculture-\nbased economies, but also through support industries, new jobs, \nresearch and development, and opening new markets for agriculture \nproducts.\n  This may displays existing ethanol plants, plants under construction \nand ethanol, biodiesel, and other biofuels plants under consideration. \nAs you can see, with the renewable fuels standard, biorefineries will \nsoon be operating in most State of the Nation.\n  There is no question that the renewable fuels standard will reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil. It will slow the deterioration of the \nenvironment through the reduction of fossil fuel emission and spills, \nenhance national, energy and economic security, create a new industrial \nbase with tens of thousands of new, high quality jobs, and strengthen \nhomeland security by providing hundreds, perhaps thousands, of \ncommunity-oriented biorefineries producing biofuels, biochemicals, and \nbioelectricity.\n  There are those who believe that ethanol's current tax incentives are \nsufficient, and obviate the need for the renewable fuels standard \ncalling for an expanding market for biofuels. For the past 10 years the \nprice of ethanol was generally below the price of 87 octane at both the \nwholesale and the retail levels. At current capacity, there is a \nsurplus of ethanol driving wholesale price of ethanol well below the \nwholesale price of gasoline.\n  On April 11 of this year, the wholesale price of gasoline in New York \nwas 84 cents while the national average cost of wholesale ethanol was \n55 cents. If ethanol was available in New York City gasoline today, the \nprice to the consumer should be considerably less than ethanol-free \ngasoline. I say should because the ethanol industry is always at the \npricing mercy of the gasoline marketers. Routinely, the octane value of \nthe ethanol accrues to the gasoline industry not to the ethanol \nproducers. Again, historically, the availability of ethanol in the \nmarketplace drives down the cost of all gasoline because of market \nforces.\n  According to the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of \nAmerica,\n\n       The federal benefits afforded ethanol-blended fuels have \n     been an important, pro-competitive influence on the nation's \n     gasoline markets. By enhancing the ability of independent \n     marketers to price compete with their integrated oil company \n     competitors, this program has increased independent \n     marketers' economic viability and reduced consumers' costs of \n     gasoline.\n  Then there is the issue of the overall cost of the ethanol industry. \nOpponents claim that the cost of the program exceeds the benefits. This \nis refuted by a recent study: the Economic Analysis of Legislation for \na Renewable Fuels Requirement for Highway Motor Fuels, conducted by AUS \nConsultants.\n  It will displace 1.6 billion barrels of oil over the next decade; \nreduce our trade deficit by $34.1 billion; increase new investment in \nrural communities by more than $5.3 billion; boost the demand for feed \ngrains and soybeans by more than 1.5 billion bushels over the next \ndecade; create more than 214,000 new jobs throughout the U.S. economy; \nand expand household income by an additional $51.7 billion over the \nnext decade.\n  The RFS in this bill represents a continuation of sound public policy \nsupporting the biofuels industry that has brought benefits to the \nNation over the past quarter a century.\n  Two States are showing us the way--Minnesota and Nebraska. We can \nalso look to the major advances being made in Europe and Brazil.\n\n[[Page S2909]]\n\n  I am unabashedly proud of what my home State has accomplished. The \nformation of the National Governors' Ethanol Coalition was one of the \nimportant steps. Nebraska and several other Midwestern States created \nthis coalition that now consists of 26 States and one U.S. territory, \nas well as Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and Sweden. Since its formation in \n1991, the Governors' Ethanol Coalition has worked to expand national \nand international markets for biofuels. American firms are working with \nIndia, Thailand, Colombia, and other countries to help them establish \nbiofuels industries.\n  Within the State of Nebraska, during the period from 1991-2001, seven \nethanol plants were constructed and several of these facilities were \nexpanded more than once during the decade. Specific benefits of the \nethanol program in Nebraska include:\n  $1.15 billion in new capital investment in ethanol processing plants.\n  1,005 permanent jobs at the ethanol facilities and 5,115 induced jobs \ndirectly related to plant construction, operation, and maintenance. \nAverage salaries at the ethanol processing facilities range from \n$38,000-$56,000 depending on geographic location. The permanent jobs \ngenerate an annual payroll of $44 million.\n  More than 210 million bushels of corn and grain sorghum is processed \nat the plants annually. Economists at Purdue University and the USDA \nestimate that the price of corn increases from 9.9 cents-10 cents per \nbushel for every 100 million bushels of new demand. Local price basis \nincreases in Nebraska range from 5-15 cents.\n  The trend of marketing wet distillers grains for cattle feeding \ngenerates at least $41 million in increased economic activity annually \naccording to a 1999 report by the University of Nebraska. Of the $41 \nmillion increase, 85 percent accrues to cattle feeders in the form of \nreduced costs and increased gains, and 15 percent accrues to the \nplants.\n  Local tax bases are more diversified in areas where plants are \nlocated. Several smaller communities have experienced increases in \nhousing construction and new business start-ups associated with \nservices related to plant operations.\n  Jobs among the skilled trades have increased. Pipe fitters, \nsteamfitters, steel workers, and construction engineering trades are \ninvolved in plant construction.\n  Value is added to grain processed at ethanol plants. Today, a $2.00 \nbushel of corn is processed into products worth at least $5.00. \nGasoline purchased from refineries outside Nebraska is displaced by \nethanol produced in the State, thereby retaining energy dollars in the \nlocal economy.\n  These economic benefits have increased each year during the past \ndecade due to plant expansion, employment increases, and additional \ncapital investment.\n  If each State followed the Minnesota and Nebraska models, which are \ndifferent in several respects, and produced 10 percent of its own \ndomestic, renewable fuels, America will have turned the corner and that \nnoose of oil-import dependency and climate change will begin to loosen.\n  I know there is doubt among my colleagues from States without farm \ncrops about the ability to provide the needed starch, sugar, or oil \nseed crops to produce biofuels and other biorefinery products. There \nare more than adequate supplies of cellulosic biomass in each State to \nmeet the 10 percent goal: agricultural and forestry crops and residues; \nrights-of-way, parks, yard and garden trimmings; and the clean portion \nof the biomass fraction of our municipal waste.\n  A major resource commitment is needed in this country to ensure that, \n10 years from now, we have established the commercial technology base \nto produce many billions of gallons per year of renewable fuels, in \ndispersed and decentralized installations around the nation. The \nfeedstocks must be diversified with the end uses ranging from gasoline \nto diesel to aviation fuels. We also need to quantify the ``externality \ncosts'' of our current imported oil dependence, in order to ensure we \nare not paying those costs 10 years form now.\n  Over the past few days, we have learned that we cannot drill our way \nout of our dangerous oil dependency. We have decided to support a \nrenewable energy portfolio standard that will increase our use of \nrenewable resources like solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, and biomass to \nproduce electricity.\n  We sue very little oil to produce electricity. We use oil to power \nour transportation sector. That is where we are most vulnerable.\n  The renewable fuels standard is absolutely necessary in order to \nexpand the biofuels industry into the use of cellulosic biomass, which \nis in great abundance throughout the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to \nmy colleagues today about an incredibly important issue, and that is \nthe question of the rising costs of health care, particularly as it \nrelates to the cost of prescription drugs. I think the headline in this \nweek's Washington Post column by David Broder said it all: Our health \ncare system is in a ``death cycle.''\n  The greatest country in the world, the most extensive health care \nsystem in the world, most sophisticated system, and we have a respected \ncolumnist saying it is in a death cycle. I suggest one of the major \nreasons for this is the uncontrollable cost of prescription drugs in \nthis country.\n  There is something wrong when we are involved as taxpayers, as \nAmericans, in funding research for prescription drugs--which I \nsupport--providing tax credits for research and development for the \ncompanies to be able to do incredibly important, lifesaving research. \nYet we in the United States of America pay the highest prices of anyone \nin the world. That is not an exaggeration--higher than anyone in the \nworld.\n  If you are uninsured--and particularly for our seniors who may use 18 \ndifferent medications in a year; that is the average--if you are \nuninsured, if you are someone walking in and paying retail, you pay the \nmost of anyone anywhere in the United States and the world.\n  This is extremely troubling. We are not talking about buying \nsomething that is optional; we are talking about lifesaving \nmedications. Whether I am talking to my hospital administrators or the \nBig Three auto companies or small businesses or senior citizens or a \nfamily with a disabled child or anyone who is involved in purchasing \nprescription drugs, I hear the same thing over and over: We have a \nsystem that is broken. It is broken. We have to fix it.\n\n  I am here today asking my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nto join with us in that sense of urgency about fixing this problem.\n  Whenever we talk about costs, we hear from the companies that in \norder to lower costs we will lose valuable research. None of us wants \nto lose research. We support that. We support funding research. We will \ndo that again this year. But the facts do not show us that we have to \nsuffer and lose research in order to lower costs.\n  We know that among the largest companies, on average, they spend \ntwice as much on advertising and promotion as they do on research. We \nalso know in an average year there will be about 88,000 people working \nto promote and to advertise prescription drugs and on average 48,000 \npeople involved in research. There are 88,000 people involved in \npromoting and advertising, 48,000 involved in research.\n  I think every American knows, just by turning on the television set, \nthat\n\n[[Page S2910]]\n\nwe have seen an explosion in advertising. Unfortunately, what has \nhappened is we have seen that explosion in advertising causing an \nexplosion in our costs of 18 percent to 20 percent a year.\n  Something is wrong when there are almost twice as many people \ninvolved in promoting a drug and advertising a drug as there are people \nresearching new medications. There is also something wrong when we can \ngo across the bridge or through the tunnel to Canada--Mr. President, \nthat is 5 minutes in Michigan. We can go across the bridge and we can \ncut our costs in half for American-made, FDA-approved medications.\n  I have twice taken a group of seniors across the border, going \nthrough the Canadian medical society, and then going into the Canadian \npharmacies. We have seen dramatic results. I will just share a couple.\n  In Michigan, Zocor, a drug to reduce cholesterol, costs $109.73 for \n50 5-milligram tablets. In Canada, the exact same prescription costs \n$46.17--$109.73 and $46.17. Since we as taxpayers in the United States \nhave helped to subsidize the research--which I support doing--I also \nwant to see us get a price break for the tax dollars that are helping \nto do this.\n  I also know that tamoxifen, a breast-cancer-treating drug, is \navailable for about $136 in Michigan. When we went to Canada, with \nbreast cancer patients, they got it for $15. There is something wrong \nwith the laws that say our people cannot freely go back and forth--our \nhospitals, our businesses--and get those lower costs.\n  There is something wrong with a system where small businesses are \nseeing 25, 30, 35 percent or more increases in their health care \npremiums. I have had small business people come to me saying they will \nhave to drop their insurance because they cannot afford the premium \nincreases. The majority of that is the cost of prescription drugs.\n  We have a lot of work to do. There is something wrong in a country as \nblessed and as wealthy as the United States when there are seniors who \ngot up this morning, sat at the kitchen table, and said: Do I eat today \nor do I take my medicine? Do I pay the electric bill or do I take my \nmedicine?\n  We can do better than that. We have an obligation to do better than \nthat. I believe one piece of that is Medicare coverage and updating our \nMedicare system to cover prescription drugs. But I believe it is also \nmuch more than that. I believe it is making generics available once the \npatent has run its course and finding ways to make sure those laws are \nenforced and not undermined. It is making sure that research is done, \nand we reward and help fund that, and invest in that more than we are \ninvesting in advertising. It is making sure our business community can \nafford premiums, that we have competition across the border, making \nsure we are able to provide prescriptions at the lowest possible cost \nwhile still allowing important research to happen and our \npharmaceutical industry to thrive.\n\n  I believe we can do all of that if we have a focus on the right \nvalues and priorities when it comes to this debate.\n  I simply say it is now time for a sense of urgency. If a child in our \nfamily is sick or if we have a parent who needs lifesaving medication \nand can't afford it, if we have someone in our family who needs an \noperation, we feel a sense of urgency. We feel a sense of urgency if \nsomeone needs nursing home care or if someone needs some other kind of \nhealth care.\n  We need that same kind of sense of urgency when it comes to public \npolicy on health care.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join with us in \nthe coming weeks to lower the fastest growing part of that health care \ndollar; that is, the cost of prescription drugs and lifesaving \nmedication.\n  We can do better than we are doing for our seniors and our families. \nWe can do better than we are doing for the business community. We can \ndo better than we are doing for everybody in our country if we are \nwilling to get to work. I hope we are going to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/18/senate-section/article/S2910-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, last year, Democrats and Republicans \njoined together with President Bush to enact a monumental and far-\nreaching education bill.\n  This new law, the Leave No Child Behind Act, will bring new resources \nand meaningful reform to our Nation's schools.\n  It establishes new academic standards for students, increases teacher \ntraining, and demands new levels of accountability, while increasing \nflexibility with Federal funds at the State and local level.\n  I am hopeful that this law will help close the achievement gaps that \nseparate many poor and minority students from their peers.\n  Indeed, I am optimistic that it will improve education for all \nstudents.\n  But Congress has, as Harry Truman once said, some ``unfinished \nbusiness' when it comes to our schools.\n  We have left out a critical component when it comes to ensuring that \nour schools and our teachers and, most importantly, our students will \nsucceed.\n  Today, one in five schools fails to meet building or safety codes or \nneeds extensive repairs, renovations, and maintenance.\n  Across the country, run-down, overcrowded, dilapidated schools \njeopardize the health and safety of our students.\n  Across the country, deteriorating schools inhibit the ability of our \nchildren to learn.\n  And yet, with the exception of the Impact Aid program, which I \nstrongly support, the new education reform law did not include funds \nfor school renovation and repair.\n  Nor were any funds for renovation and repair made available through \nthe appropriations process.\n  The administration's most recent budget even eliminates the Emergency \nSchool Repair Program.\n  And yet, data from the National Center for Education Statistics tells \nus that nearly $127 billion in renovations and repairs are needed to \nupgrade existing schools to good physical condition.\n  Furthermore, this figure does not include the funding needed for \nconstruction to accommodate increasing enrollments in districts across \nthe country.\n  We have these pressing needs at a time when resources are scarce. Our \nStates and local governments are still feeling the effects of the \nrecession.\n  And for too many years, Congress has failed to provide States and \nlocalities the funding it promised long ago to share the cost of \nspecial education.\n  The Federal Government cannot ask States and localities to shoulder \nthe burden of school renovation and repair costs alone.\n  If the Federal Government stands on the sidelines, it will be at the \nexpense of our children.\n  But neither should Washington attempt to single-handedly solve this \nproblem. Congress should not be in the business of giving direct grants \nto communities to build schools.\n  I strongly believe that education is a national priority but a local \nresponsibility.\n  The legislation being introduced today, the ``Investing for \nTomorrow's\n\n[[Page S2911]]\n\nSchools Act,'' answers this call for partnership.\n  Our bill provides initial funding for the creation of State and \nregional infrastructure banks. These banks will make loans to districts \nfor school construction or modernization needs.\n  This mechanism helps to alleviate the financial burden for States and \nlocalities but provides sufficient flexibility to meet local needs.\n  The structure of the bill ensures that states and localities have the \nrequisite flexibility to tailor programs to meet their unique needs.\n  The bill requires a 25 percent State match, which ensures the \ncommitment of State government to the program while allowing States to \nleverage their dollars four-to-one.\n  It is a voluntary program--only for those states who choose to \nparticipate.\n  To those who have argued that the Federal Government should have no \nrole in school facilities, and likewise to those who call for overly \nintrusive Federal programs, this bill offers a common-sense compromise.\n  I remember visiting a school in Nixa, MO, where every fourth-grader \nin the district attends class in trailers behind the school.\n  I have subsequently learned from teachers and administrators in other \ndistricts that the kids in trailers often have the best deal because \nconditions in the actual school buildings are often far worse than they \nare in the trailers.\n  Every State in this country has districts in need, in both urban and \nrural and suburban communities. The needs span the social economic \nstrata of our Nation.\n  Disadvantaged and minority students are most likely to attend school \nin decrepit and obsolete buildings.\n  I would imagine that we have all seen schools that are either \nfreezing cold or unbearably hot, that have poor lighting or inadequate \nbathroom facilities.\n  But students in more affluent suburbs--where there is often explosive \ngrowth in the community--also suffer from overcrowding.\n  Most parents would agree that they would like their children to \nattend schools where the student to teacher ratio is low, where class \nsize is small.\n  Yet, without enough space, small class size is an impossibility.\n  And despite these conditions, we are asking our children for more \nthan ever before.\n  A fellow Missourian, Mark Twain, once told the following story:\n\n       When I was a boy on the Mississippi River there was a \n     proposition in a township there to discontinue public schools \n     because they were too expensive. An old farmer spoke up and \n     said, ``If they stopped building the schools they would not \n     save anything, because every time a school was closed a jail \n     had to be built.''\n\n  I have great faith in America's children. The time to invest in them \nis now. The investments we make in them will be returned to us many \ntimes over.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/18/senate-section/article/S2911-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for the interest of Senators, I have been \nin consultation with the distinguished Republican leader throughout the \nday. We are momentarily going to propound a unanimous consent request \nwhich would do several things.\n  First of all, it would accommodate Senator Murkowski and his desire \nto bring up an amendment on the energy bill relating to Iraq.\n  We would then move to complete our work on the border security bill. \nThere would be a number of amendments offered by Senator Byrd. Once \nthose amendments have been disposed of, it would be our intention to \nthen go to final passage. Then, prior to the end of the day, we would \nalso take up a judicial nomination that has been on the calendar.\n  We would, throughout this period, have further discussions about our \nschedule for the remainder of the week--tomorrow--and early next week, \nas we attempt to bring some final closure to the energy bill.\n  So that is the current schedule. It is my expectation we will get \nthis request which would allow us to complete our work on border \nsecurity today. Senators should be forewarned there will be additional \nvotes, probably several additional votes, yet today on the border \nsecurity bill, I assume on the Murkowski amendment, as well as on the \njudicial nomination.\n  So that is the current plan.

SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) This Title can be cited as the `Iraq Petroleum Import \n     Restriction Act of 2001.'\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the government of the Republic of Iraq:\n       (A) has failed to comply with the terms of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 686 regarding unconditional Iraqi \n     acceptance of the destruction, removal, or rendering \n     harmless, under international supervision, of all nuclear, \n     chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents and \n     all related subsystems and components and all research,\n\n[[Page S2912]]\n\n     development, support and manufacturing facilities, as well as \n     all ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 \n     kilometers and related major parts, and repair and production \n     facilities and has failed to allow United Nations inspectors \n     access to sites used for the production or storage of weapons \n     of mass destruction.\n       (B) routinely contravenes the terms and conditions of UNSC \n     Resolution 661, authorizing the export of petroleum products \n     from Iraq in exchange for food, medicine and other \n     humanitarian products by conducting a routine and extensive \n     program to sell such products outside of the channels \n     established by UNSC Resolution 661 in exchange for military \n     equipment and materials to be used in pursuit of its program \n     to develop weapons of mass destruction in order to threaten \n     the United States and its allies in the Persian Gulf and \n     surrounding regions.\n       (C) has failed to adequately draw down upon the amounts \n     received in the Escrow Account established by UNSC Resolution \n     661 to purchase food, medicine and other humanitarian \n     products required by its citizens, resulting in massive \n     humanitarian suffering by the Iraqi people.\n       (D) conducts a periodic and systematic campaign to harass \n     and obstruct the enforcement of the United States and United \n     Kingdom-enforced ``No-Fly Zones'' in effect in the Republic \n     of Iraq.\n       (E) routinely manipulates the petroleum export production \n     volumes permitted under UNSC Resolution 661 in order to \n     create uncertainty in global energy markets, and therefore \n     threatens the economic security of the United States.\n       (F) pays bounties to the families of suicide bombers in \n     order to encourage the murder of Israeli civilians.\n       (2) Further imports of petroleum products from the Republic \n     of Iraq are inconsistent with the national security and \n     foreign policy interests of the United States and should \n     be eliminated until such time as they are not so \n     inconsistent.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON IRAQI-ORIGIN PETROLEUM IMPORTS.\n\n       The direct or indirect import from Iraq of Iraqi-origin \n     petroleum and petroleum products is prohibited, \n     notwithstanding an authorization by the Committee established \n     by UNSC Resolution 661 or its designee, or any other order to \n     the contrary.\n\n     SEC. 3. TERMINATION/PRESIDENTIAL CERTIFICATION.\n\n       This Title will remain in effect until such time as the \n     President, after consultation with the relevant committees in \n     Congress, certifies to the Congress that:\n       (a) (1) Iraq is in substantial compliance with the terms of\n       (A) UNSC Resolution 687 and\n       (B) UNSC Resolution 986 prohibiting smuggling of oil in \n     circumvention of the ``Oil-for-Food'' program; and\n       (2) ceases the practice of compensating the families of \n     suicide bombers in order to encourage the murder of Israeli \n     citizens; or that\n       (b) resuming the importation of Iraqi-origin petroleum and \n     petroleum products would not be inconsistent with the \n     national security and foreign policy interests of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 4. HUMANITARIAN INTERESTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the President should \n     make all appropriate efforts to ensure that the humanitarian \n     needs of the Iraqi people are not negatively affected by this \n     Act, and should encourage through public, private, domestic \n     and international means the direct or indirect sale, donation \n     or other transfer to appropriate non-governmental health and \n     humanitarian organizations and individuals within Iraq of \n     food, medicine and other humanitarian products.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       (A) ``661 committee.'' The term 661 Committee means the \n     Security Council Committee established by UNSC Resolution \n     661, and persons acting for or on behalf of the Committee \n     under its specific delegation of authority for the relevant \n     matter or category of activity, including the overseers \n     appointed by the UN Secretary-General to examine and approve \n     agreements for purchases of petroleum and petroleum products \n     from the Government of Iraq pursuant to UNSC Resolution 986.\n       (b) ``UNSC Resolution 661.'' The term UNSC Resolution 661 \n     means United Nations Security Council Resolution No. 661, \n     adopted August 6, 1990, prohibiting certain transactions with \n     respect to Iraq and Kuwait.\n       (c) ``UNSC Resolution 687.'' The term UNSC Resolution 986 \n     means United Nations Security Council Resolution 687, adopted \n     April 3, 1991.\n       (d) ``UNSC Resolution 986.'' The term UNSC Resolution 986 \n     means United Nations Security Council Resolution 986, adopted \n     April 14, 1995.\n\n     SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The prohibition on importation of Iraqi origin petroleum \n     and petroleum products shall be effective 30 days after \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, earlier this month Saddam Hussein \nindicated that he was terminating oil production for 30 days. That \nwould terminate oil from Iraq to the United States.\n  I have a chart in the Chamber that shows currently the oil that we \nare receiving from Iraq. This chart shows the historic trend of crude \noil imports from Iraq to the United States. In January, it was about \n294,000 barrels. In June, it went up to 973,000 barrels.\n  One of the extraordinary things occurred in September. In September, \nit was at a high of almost 1.2 million barrels. Lest we forget, during \nSeptember we had a terrorist attack in New York, in Washington, DC, and \nthe downing of the aircraft in Pennsylvania.\n  What does this have to do with Iraq? Well, we have known for some \ntime that Saddam Hussein has been fostering and supporting terrorist \nactivities. And to give you some idea, let me show you this little \nreplica of an acknowledged statement from his Government relative to \nproviding funding to the Palestinian suicide bombers. There is a check \nfor $25,000. Previous to this, he was providing payments of up to \n$10,000. With an incentive of $25,000, God only knows to what extent \nterrorist activities will continue.\n  Yet as we look at the United States and the trends we have seen in \noil imports, as the Mideast crisis worsens, we see the price of oil \nrise.\n  We also have another chart. We have seen this oil come into the \nUnited States. People probably don't really know from where their oil \ncomes. Probably most of them don't care. It comes in to identified \nareas of New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, \nArkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, California, and Washington.\n  The irony here is obvious, if we go back to 1992 and look at the \ndesolation associated with the burning of the oilfields in Kuwait. \nRecognize that we are now importing or have been importing about 1 \nmillion barrels of oil a day from Iraq. Then with the notice by the \nGovernment of Iraq that they are going to terminate production, clearly \none has to wonder if it is in the principal interest of the United \nStates to rely on this source.\n  Earlier in the day, we voted on the issue of ANWR. It was a cloture \nmotion. We did not obtain 60 votes. So far on the energy bill, it is \nfair to say that the only increase in domestic production identified \nwas associated with ANWR. Perhaps it is ironic that Saddam Hussein \nshould terminate production. But I think it is appropriate, from a \nprinciple point of view, that the United States, by formal action, end \nour imports from Iraq until a couple of things happen.\n  One is that the United Nations certifies that Iraq has complied with \nthe Security Council resolution No. 687 and has dismantled their \nprograms to develop and construct weapons of mass destruction; and that \nIraq cease to smuggle oil in contravention of Security Council \nresolution No. 986; and finally, Iraq no longer pays bounties to the \nfamilies of suicide bombers wreaking havoc in Israel.\n  I recognize the Iraqi oil program is intended to be used for the \nbenefit of the Iraqi people. But that is not the case. My amendment \nalso seeks to ensure that the President use every means available to \nsupport humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people, notwithstanding the ban \non oil imports.\n  Most Members consider themselves internationalists. I believe firmly \nin the importance of engagement with other countries, particularly \neconomic engagement. I am a strong believer in free trade and have \nworked with many of my colleagues to reform economic sanctions and \npolicies. However, it is time to draw the line on economic engagement \nwhen national security is compromised.\n  Our increasing dependence on unstable overseas sources of oil is \ncompromising our national security. We have seen Saddam Hussein last \nweek urge fellow Arab OPEC members to use oil as a weapon. We have seen \nwhat an aircraft can do as a weapon. Saddam Hussein did that by \nimposing this 30-day embargo of oil exports to the United States until \nthe United States forced Israel to cave in to the demands of the \nPalestinian extremists.\n  In 1973, the Arab League used oil as a weapon during a time of \nsimilar crisis in the Mideast. At that time, the United States was 37-\npercent dependent on imported oil. Still the Arab oil embargo \ndemonstrates how powerful a weapon oil can be. And the United States \nwas brought to its knees. Several of us remember during that time of \nthe Yom Kippur War, there were gas lines around the block. The public \nwas\n\n[[Page S2913]]\n\nblaming everybody for the inconvenience, including Government.\n\n  During that particular timeframe, however, the TransAlaska Pipeline \nwas completed. Oil began to flow. And within a few years, 25 percent of \nour domestic oil production came from Prudhoe Bay. As a consequence, \nimports dropped dramatically. But that was then and this is now. Times \nchange. On the other hand, how much they stay the same.\n  Nearly 30 years after the Arab oil embargo, we are faced with a \nsimilar threat that we faced in 1973, but there is a difference. The \ndifference is now we are 58-percent dependent on imported oil. Back in \n1973, we were 37 percent. The stakes are higher. The national security \nimplications are more evident. One wonders what we have learned. From \nthe vote earlier today, I wonder that, too.\n  Before us is the reality that Saddam Hussein has called on his Arab \nneighbors to use oil as a weapon and begin a 30-day moratorium on \nexports. The United States was importing over 1 million barrels of oil \nfrom Iraq.\n  As we look at the situation in the Mideast today, our Secretary of \nState, having made every effort to bring the parties together, \nunderstanding withdrawal, whatever it took, and the appearance at least \nthat Egypt has refused to meet with our Secretary of State, Mubarak, \nwhat that means, I guess one could look between the pages of history \nand come up with some kind of an evaluation. Things certainly are \nbetter but they might get worse.\n  Reality dictates if you filled up your tank, chances are at least a \nhalf a gallon of the gasoline in your tank originally came from Iraq. \nThink about that. This is the same guy who pays bounties on suicide \nbombers of $25,000, who fires at our sons and daughters flying missions \nin the no-fly zones in Iraq, who has used chemical weapons on his own \npeople, who has boasted that he has the weapons to scorch half of \nIsrael.\n  But when you innocently filled up your tank, you paid Saddam Hussein \nperhaps a nickel of every dollar you spent at the pump that day. You \ncontributed to some extent to the suicide bombings. You bought shells \ntargeted at American forces. You paid for chemical and biological \nweapons being developed in Iraq which are targeted at Israel and those \nIraqis who would challenge Saddam Hussein.\n  Haven't we learned our lesson before? I was looking around the house \nthe other night. I ran across a Life magazine from March 1991. In a \nprofile of the gulf war, they wrote of Saddam:\n\n       When he finally fought his way to power in 1979, after an \n     apprenticeship of a few years as a torturer, his first order \n     was the execution of some 20 of his highest-ranking \n     government officials, including one of his best friends. He \n     likes to say ``He who is closest to me is farthest from when \n     he does wrong.'' He grew up in dirt to live in splendor. . . \n     . He is cheerless. And he currently possesses Kuwait.\n\n  This article can be used as a reminder of the costly mistakes of not \ndealing with him. It is more or less a play-by-play review of the gulf \nwar that we are in now but new names and a new era from 2002 could just \nas easily be inserted into the article. These lessons must not be lost. \nWe recognize he is our enemy. The world must isolate him, cut him off \nand coax his regime to an early death.\n\n  But we haven't learned our lesson, have we? He is still there because \nwe are still buying his oil. Sure, these purchases are masked in the \nOil for Food Program, but is it really working? He is still there.\n  I know the Oil for Food Program isn't supposed to work this way. \nSaddam is supposed to use the money from Oil for Food to feed the Iraqi \npeople and buy medicine. But we know he cheats on the program, buying \nall kinds of questionable materials, and that he smuggles billions of \ndollars of oil out of Iraq, which directly funds his armies, his \nweapons programs, and his palaces.\n  I had an opportunity to be in Baghdad several years ago with a number \nof Senators. We met with Saddam Hussein. This was just before the gulf \nwar. Regarding the circumstances of that meeting, I won't go into any \ndetail, but they are very interesting. He invited us to lunch and never \nbrought lunch. What we got out of the meeting was the recognition that \nthis was a force to be dealt with.\n  No matter how you look at it, Mr. President, our purchase of Iraqi \noil is absolutely contrary to our national security interests. It is \nindefensible and must end.\n  My amendment would do just that; it would end new imports of Iraqi \noil until Iraq is proven a responsible member of the international \ncommunity and complies with the relevant Security Council resolutions.\n  I began the statement by affirming my support for economic \nengagement. I believe deeply in the principle of free trade. I do not, \nhowever, believe in economic disarmament. When, as is the case with \noil, a commodity is not only important to our own economic health but \nalso important to our military's ability to defend the Nation, self-\nsufficiency is a crucial matter. No country or group of countries \nshould have the ability to ground our aircraft, shut down our tanks, or \nkeep our ships from leaving port. Yet allowing ourselves to become \ndependent on imports of this nature threatens to do just that.\n  In the case of Saddam Hussein, we are dependent for some 5 percent of \nour imports from a sworn and defiant enemy. There he is on that chart. \nBut our reliance on other foreign sources of oil is not risk-free. We \nhave a very uneasy relationship with our friends in the gulf. September \n11 clearly demonstrated that our enemies in such staunch allies as \nSaudi Arabia may outnumber our friends.\n  We already have some form of economic sanction on every single member \nof OPEC--a reflection of the uneasy relationship that we have with \nthese nations. So this is risky business relying on countries such as \nthese for our national security.\n  Some Members have long recognized the folly of importing oil from our \nenemies--some more than others. But on July 25, we extended sanctions \non importing oil from Iran and Libya. We have not imported any oil from \nthose countries for some time because the sanctions were in existence. \nWe didn't initiate sanctions against Iraq. Well, it is time we did.\n  Does relying on Iraq make more sense than relying on Iran and Libya? \nI don't think so. I know that many of my colleagues advocate production \nin less risky parts of the globe, including here in the United States. \nThe trouble is, we have to drill for oil where we are likely to find \nit. The fact is, the ground under which most of the oil is buried is \ncontrolled by unstable, unfriendly, or at-risk governments.\n\n  Look at Colombia and the oilfields being developed in the pristine \nrain forests down there. We get some 350,000 barrels a day from \nColombia.\n  The 408-mile-long Cano Limo pipeline is at the heart of the Colombian \noil trade, and it frequently is attacked by FARC rebels. They have \ndeclared the pipeline to be a ``military target.'' They are \nanticapitalist, anti-United States, anti-Colombian Government rebels.\n  The trouble is, the half of the country these rebels control has the \nCano Limo pipeline running through it--a convenient target to cripple \nthe economy, get America's attention, and rally their troops for their \ncause. Countless attacks have cost some 24 barrels in lost crude \nproduction last year and untold environmental damage to the rain forest \necosystem.\n  Last year, rebels bombed the Cano Limo 170 times, putting it out of \ncommission for 266 days, costing Colombia roughly $500 million in lost \nrevenue.\n  Our administration wants to spend $98 million to train a brigade of \n2,000 Colombian soldiers to protect the pipeline. Now, last week, \nanother rebel faction called American oil companies running the \npipeline ``military targets.''\n  I wonder if we are truly unfazed about the close connection between \noil, money, and national security. Are we willing to turn our heads on \nthe Mideast crisis to finance the schemes of Saddam Hussein? Are we \nwilling to allow our policy choices in the Middle East to be dictated \nby our thirst for imported oil from this particular source? Are we \nwilling to let our oil be used as a weapon against us?\n  We should not allow our national security to be compromised. I know \nsome today have dismissed ANWR as a solution. But the relevance here is \nprinciple. Our military cannot conduct a campaign associated with \ndependence on such unreliable sources.\n  I sympathize with the desire to eliminate the use of fossil fuels. I \nbelieve we\n\n[[Page S2914]]\n\nwill get there with continued research and new technologies. I \nunderstand the urge to deny the importance of oil in the national \nsecurity equation. But all of my colleagues will eventually have to \nlook in the mirror after this debate and ask themselves, again, to what \nextent we are willing to sacrifice our national security in order to \nappeal to the fantasies associated with the desires of Saddam Hussein.\n  One of the things I think is testimony to the severity of how we deal \nwith Iraq is the responsibility of the President and Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, his Cabinet, and others, as we have observed the reality that he \nis developing weapons of mass destruction. He has a delivery system \ncapable of sending a missile to Israel. But he has been working on a \nnuclear capability. When is the world going to deal with that? Had we \nknown what was about to occur relative to the tragic events associated \nwith September 11, we would have taken action against Osama bin Laden. \nHad we only known.\n  In the case of Saddam Hussein, the exposure is there. The question \nis, When and how? Buying oil and increasing our dependence on that \ncountry is certainly not the answer because we are funding whatever \nmischief Saddam Hussein is up to. So that is the purpose of this \namendment, Mr. President.\n  I urge my colleagues to think a little bit about the principle \ninvolved and join me in support of the amendment. Again, the irony is \nthat he has cut us off for 30 days. The ramifications of that, the \nfuture will tell. Will the OPEC nations increase production and make up \nfor the shortfall? They have indicated they might. Will the price of \noil likely go up because of the shortage of supply? It is already going \nup.\n  Clearly, by an action taken by the Senate to formally terminate \nimports from that country, we will send him a message, but will \nsomebody else simply take our place and buy Saddam Hussein's oil?\n  In any event, I think it is appropriate, from a principle point of \nview, for the United States to terminate its relationship with Iraq, as \nthe amendment proposes, until such time as he commits to abide by the \nU.N. agreement, which requires that we have inspectors in Iraq to \nensure that he is not a threat to the world; further, that he commits \nto halt any further funding of suicide bombers associated with the \nterrible activities occurring in Israel and Palestine.\n  I have no further comments. Seeing no other Senator seeking the \nfloor, I yield back the remaining time on this side, and defer to \nSenator Bingaman.\n  I believe the yeas and nays have been ordered, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, they have.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me make a few comments with regard \nto the amendment, and I do not know that I will be in opposition, but I \nhave some concerns I wish to express--and perhaps ask a few questions--\nI have the amendment in front of me--my understanding of what the \namendment is that first of all, it does not in any way prohibit Iraq \nfrom exporting oil. I think that is clear. Iraq has made a decision \njust recently to suspend its exports of oil for 30 days. So that is in \nplace, as I understand it. But this amendment does not prohibit Iraq \nfrom exporting oil or does not commit us to any action which would in \nany way prohibit Iraq from exporting oil.\n  Second, it does not prohibit us from importing oil from other \nsources. What it basically says is, we can continue to import whatever \nthe percentage is--50 percent, 56 percent--of our oil needs from the \nworld market. We just cannot import from this source.\n  Also, it does not really by its language impose a legal prohibition \nagainst importing from Iraq. What it says is, as I read it and this is \non page 3 of the amendment. It says:\n\n       This Act prohibits imports until such time as the \n     President, after consultation with the relevant committees in \n     Congress, certifies to the Congress that resuming the \n     importation of Iraqi-origin petroleum and petroleum products \n     would not be inconsistent with the national security and \n     foreign policy interests of the United States.\n\n  Basically, it takes the decision, which has been our national policy, \nthat we would import legally exported Iraqi oil, just as we would \nimport other oil. It says that in order for us to continue with that \nactivity, the President has to give us a certification that it is not \ninconsistent with our national security or foreign policy interests to \ndo so.\n  Obviously, our relations with Iraq are a very serious foreign policy \nissue for our country at this time, and I am persuaded that most \nMembers of the Senate would be very anxious to work in cooperation with \nthe administration and with the President in formulating our policy \ntoward Iraq.\n  I do not know where the administration stands on this amendment. I do \nnot know if there has been any request for their views on it. I would \nbe anxious to hear from the sponsor of the amendment if he has had a \nreaction from the administration. We have made some informal inquiries, \nand we have been unable to get a response from the administration.\n  I, frankly, think the responsible course would be for us to give the \nadministration a chance to tell us its views. If the President wants \nthis legislation enacted, then obviously that would carry great weight \nwith many Senators. If the President believes this puts him in an \nawkward position, in that it requires him to issue a certificate to \npermit continued imports of Iraqi oil, then I think we should know. \nObviously, there are many Members of this body who do not want to put \nthe President in an awkward position relative to our relations with \nIraq.\n  I also have concerns about how an amendment such as this could be \ninterpreted in world oil markets. We are very concerned that the price \nof gasoline has been going up in recent weeks, and we heard a lot about \nthat during the ANWR debate that just concluded. Of course, that is a \nreflection, to some extent at least, of the rising price of oil on \nworld markets. The price is up around $26 a barrel today, which is \nsubstantially higher than it was a few months ago. People are concerned \nabout that.\n\n  However, the information I have is that one reason why we import oil \nfrom Iraq is that we are able to do so at a discount. Why is Iraq \nforced to sell its oil at a discount in the world market? Because it is \nconsidered by the market to be a somewhat unreliable source for oil, so \nthey are not able to get the premium price that some other producers \nare able to get. U.S. refiners benefit from that, and U.S. consumers \nbenefit from the fact that we are buying that oil at a discount.\n  I have an article that I will ask be printed in the Congressional \nRecord after my statement, from the April 15 edition of the Dallas \nMorning News. The title of it is: ``In Oil, Profit Often Beats \nPolitics.'' I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the \nRecord after my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the key part of this is some comment on \nthe amendment my colleague, Senator Murkowski, is now offering. It \nsays:\n\n       Mr. Murkowski wants to ban Iraqi oil imports. We have done \n     this before. Libyan oil was banned. Iranian oil was banned. \n     But oil is a commodity, and import bans make little \n     difference in the global market. Unless all importers join \n     the boycott, the oil will find a buyer.\n\n  The main point is pretty clear: If Iraq is going to decide at the end \nof this 30 days to commence exports again, it will find a buyer for \nthat oil. It will likely continue to sell at a discount in the world \nmarket. If we prohibit the importation of that oil into the United \nStates, that is not going to hurt Saddam Hussein. That is not going to \nhurt Iraq. Iraq will find a buyer for that oil. We will be buying the \noil we need from another source, but we will be buying on the world \nmarket just as we are today.\n  As I say, I think there is less here than meets the eye as far as \nactually trying to impact or strike a blow against Saddam Hussein. I do \nnot see that this amendment does that. I think, if anything, it puts \nour President in the awkward position of having to send a certificate \nto the Congress saying that, in his view, we should go ahead and \ncontinue to import Iraqi oil.\n  Maybe that is what the President would like. Maybe that is what the \nSecretary of State would like. Maybe that is what the Secretary of \nEnergy would like. I have not heard that from\n\n[[Page S2915]]\n\nany of them, and I think the appropriate course would be for us to \nsolicit their opinion on an important amendment such as this before we \nadopt it.\n  My initial reaction to this kind of amendment, and I am sure the \ninitial reaction of most Senators, is: Fine, this is an anti-Saddam \nHussein vote. How do you go wrong, how do you lose support in your home \nState by voting against Saddam Hussein? I would venture to say nobody \ndoes.\n  However, this is a sensitive area of foreign policy and I do not know \nwhether the Foreign Relations Committee has considered anything like \nthis. It might be something they would be interested in looking at. I \ndo not know if Senator Biden, who is chairman of that committee, has \nhad a chance to look at this and formulate a position on it.\n  I do not know that many Senators would want to vote against an \namendment of this type, but if it is going to be pushed to a vote, I \nhope before the vote occurs--and I know it is expected to occur very \nsoon under the unanimous consent agreement--I hope we can get some \ncommunication from the White House as to whether or not they support \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Dallas Morning News, Apr. 15, 2002]\n\n                  In Oil, Profit Often Beats Politics\n\n       Washington.--Gasoline prices climbed 31 cents a gallon in \n     the last eight weeks. Israelis and Palestinians are at war \n     again. Saddam Hussein says Iraq will halt oil production for \n     30 days to protest. None of this is encouraging, but neither \n     is it a description of an oil crisis. When one spigot closes, \n     another opens. There's 7 million barrels a day of spare \n     production capacity available to make up for Iraq's 1.7 \n     million barrels a day of exports. The 11 members of the \n     Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries hold 90 \n     percent of that spare capacity. OPEC has tried since the 1973 \n     Arab oil embargo to convince the world that it is an economic \n     club rather than a political weapon. Saudi Arabia, with 3 \n     million barrels a day of spare capacity, is expected to cover \n     any Iraqi-induced shortage, as it has before.\n       Gasoline prices have risen rapidly in recent weeks but \n     remain about 10 cents a gallon below last year's levels. \n     Dallas experienced its highest price for unleaded regular on \n     May 12, when the average was $1.66 a gallon. Oil is the most \n     political commodity. It was largely Saudi Arabia's political \n     will to produce more that sent oil prices down after Sept. \n     11, and Saudi curbs on oil that sent them back up again. The \n     oil workers in Venezuela and Nigeria flexed their political \n     muscles last week in showdowns with their governments that \n     coincided with the agonies of the Middle East.\n       Nigeria's unrest centered on unpaid oil workers, and \n     quieted quickly.\n       Venezuelan oil deliveries were disrupted, and the strikers \n     persuaded the military to join them in an abortive coup \n     Friday against Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Mr. Chavez \n     returned to office Sunday, 48 hours after being ousted.\n       Iraq and Venezuela supply a major portion of oil refined in \n     the United States. Venezuela sends half its 2.4 million \n     barrels a day of exports to the United States, both as \n     gasoline and crude oil. More than half of Iraq's exports also \n     land in the United States. Given the enmity between our \n     countries, that seems crazy. But economics beats politics \n     with Iraqi oil, whose price discounts seem irresistible to \n     U.S. refiners.\n       Republican Sens. Frank Murkowski of Alaska and Larry Craig \n     of Idaho are incensed by Iraq's presence in the market. They \n     say that every time a U.S. motorist fills up, he or she is \n     putting money in the pockets of suicide terrorists. (Iraq has \n     offered $25,000 to their families.)\n       Mr. Murkowski wants to ban Iraqi oil imports. We have done \n     this before. Libyan oil was banned. Iranian oil was banned. \n     But oil is a commodity, and import bans make little \n     difference in the global market. Unless all the importers \n     join the boycott, the oil will find a buyer.\n       The same logic applies to export bans. Iraq can quit \n     producing, and Saudi Arabia covers the deficit. Iraq and \n     Venezuela can stumble together, and if the Saudis don't cover \n     it all, prices will rise around the world and tempt other \n     nations to increase their production.\n       OPEC, in fact, can ill afford to see its oil production \n     used as a political weapon. The U.S. Energy Information \n     Administration expects OPEC production to be down 1.9 million \n     barrels a day this year as the cartel tries to defend a price \n     band. This lures others, particularly the Russians, to fill \n     the gap. Non-OPEC production is expected to increase this \n     year by 1.1 million barrels a day. Because profit has more \n     pull than political kinship, rival producers will rush to \n     capitalize upon a slowdown in Iraqi and Venezuelan oil \n     exports. That logic founders if something happens to disrupt \n     Saudi oil production. No one can take Saudi Arabia's place in \n     the market. Today's regime in Saudi Arabia shows no sign of \n     repeating the 1973 oil embargo. Tomorrow's regime? Who knows?\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment of the Senator from \nAlaska. I do not disagree with most of the findings in his amendment. \nSaddam Hussein is clearly in violation of his obligations under United \nNations Security Council resolutions. He has repeatedly demonstrated \nhis callous disregard for the plight of the Iraqi people. Humanitarian \naid under the oil for food program has been diverted, languished in \nwarehouses, or simply not purchased at all. As much of the Iraqi \npopulation goes without adequate health care and nutrition, Saddam \nlavishes luxury goods on his cronies and builds palaces.\n  While the Senator may be correct in his diagnosis of the illness, it \nis not clear to me that his amendment is the cure.\n  I have just spoken to a senior official at the State Department, who \nbelieves this amendment is a serious mistake. I believe that this \namendment puts the President in a very difficult position at a \ndifficult time.\n  I have concluded that we need a regime change in Iraq. In my view, \nthat effort will require us to lay the groundwork by making a solid \ncase and building as broad a coalition as possible. I am concerned that \nthis amendment may make the President's task more difficult. At the \nvery least, we should provide him the opportunity to make his views \nknown on this amendment.\n  While the potential impact of this amendment is great, it has not \nbeen scrutinized sufficiently. The Foreign Relations Committee has \ncertainly discussed the issue of Iraq policy, but we have not examined \nthis specific proposal. I also understand that the Energy Committee has \nheld no hearings on this proposal.\n  As I stated at the outset, I do not see how this amendment will \naddress the legitimate issues that the Senator cites. The proceeds for \nthe legal purchase of Iraqi oil made by American companies are \ndeposited in an escrow account controlled by the United Nations. Money \nin that account is then released for purchases of civilian goods. \nBefore any money is spent, the sanctions committee, on which the United \nStates sits, must approve every contract. In other words, we have a \nveto on how the money gets spent.\n  To be sure, the oil for food program has flaws. Saddam gets illegal \nrevenues by selling oil outside the program and by collecting illegal \nsurcharges from shady middlemen. It is these revenues that are used by \nSaddam to prop up his regime, pursue weapons of mass destruction, and \npay the families of Palestinian suicide bombers. The Senator's \namendment does not address the problem of illegal surcharges or \nsmuggling.\n  I am also concerned that by effectively pulling the United States out \nof the oil for food program, we may be sending the signal that we are \nnot interested in the welfare of the Iraqi people. I know that is not \nthe Senator's intention, but it may be an unintended effect of his \namendment. This could have an impact on the ability to pull together an \neffective coalition to confront Saddam.\n  This is just one example of the potential unintended impact of this \namendment. I think it is important that we understand all of the \nramifications of this proposal before proceeding.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, recognizing I have yielded back my \ntime, I wonder if the majority would allow me to respond for a few \nminutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have no objection. Following that, I \nexpect to yield back most of my time. I gather we are ready for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my friend, Senator Bingaman.\n  It is the intention of the prohibition on Iraqi-origin petroleum \nimports to terminate the imports, and they could then be addressed by \nthe President and the President, after consultation with relative \ncommittees of Congress, can certify to the Congress that Iraq is \nsubstantially in compliance with the U.N.S.C. Resolution 687 and \nResolution 986.\n  Resolution 986 prohibits smuggling of oil in circumvention of the Oil \nfor Food Program, and 687 mandates inspections by U.N. inspectors. So \nthe intent is clear. It is to terminate oil exports in the United \nStates.\n  The Senator from New Mexico suggested we contemplate and be somewhat \nsensitive to the attitude of the\n\n[[Page S2916]]\n\nWhite House. I think during our extended debate on ANWR we had an \nextended discussion about the attitude of the White House that did not \nprevail in this body.\n  I think what is germane, however, is the attitude of the White House \nwith regard to the sanctions on Iran and Libya. They are quite clear, \nand I think there is a notable similarity. Those sanctions were \ninitiated in retaliation to terrorist activities associated with Libya. \nWhat was it? The downing of Pan American flight 103 over Scotland. That \nis why we took that action. It was most appropriate. In Iran, in 1979, \nit was the Embassy takeover and the terrorist activities associated \nwith that.\n  So we have a parallel. I do not think there is any question about it. \nWe terminated a relationship in the sanction action against Libya and \nIran for fostering terrorism.\n  If what is going on with Saddam Hussein is not an act of terrorism, I \ndo not know what is. I indicated in my statement pretty much \nthroughout, this is a matter of principle for the United States. I do \nnot think there is any question about the justification. It is the same \njustification. Saddam Hussein is fostering terrorism, and I think we \nwould all acknowledge that. So I think, with all due respect, that is \nthe justification for this action.\n  Today, who is more of a threat to the world? Is it Iran, is it Libya, \nor is it Iraq? Well, no question in my mind.\n  I am happy to respond to any questions.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time \nas well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3159. The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I have discussed with Senator Bingaman a \nconcern with his amendment No. 3016. In particular, I question whether \nwe should structure the renewable portfolio standard to refer to the \n``capacity'' of a renewable system or, as done in Senator Bingaman's \namendment, to the ``energy generated.'' I think we would simplify \ncompliance by staying with a ``capacity-based'' standard, but I realize \nthat this is a complex issue. I strongly recommend that we return to \nthis issue in conference and carefully evaluate the pros and cons of \nthese two approaches.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I concur with my colleague that this issue deserves \nmore discussion. I look forward to further analysis and discussion of \nthis in conference in order to arrive at a final position.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/18/senate-section/article/S2916-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2916-S2932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ENHANCED BORDER SECURITY AND VISA ENTRY REFORM ACT OF 2002\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of H.R. 3525, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n  A bill (H.R. 3525) to enhance the border security of the United \nStates, and for other purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand that we have a time limit on \nboth the bill and the particular amendments. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And the time on the overall bill is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And 40 minutes on each amendment equally divided. Am I \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that we are enacting the Enhanced \nBorder Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002.\n  I would like at the outset to thank my colleagues and fellow \nsponsors, Senators Brownback, Feinstein, and Kyl, as well as their \ndedicated staff, David Neal, LaVita Strickland, and Elizabeth Maier. We \nbegan working together on this legislation in November and have moved \nthrough every stage of this process as a united team.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Hollings and Senator Gregg for \ntheir invaluable contributions to the bill. I thank Senator Byrd for \nsteadfastly working with us to make important improvements to the \nlegislation.\n  Finally, I thank all of our colleagues in the Senate for withdrawing \ntheir unrelated amendments to assure the swift passage of this vital \nlegislation, the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act, \nwhich will strengthen the security of our borders. It will improve our \nability to screen visitors, monitor foreign nationals, and enhance our \ncapacity to deter potential terrorists.\n  Our bill provides real solutions to real problems. It closes \nloopholes in our immigration system. Our solutions include expanding \nintelligence and law enforcement capabilities, upgrading 21st century \ntechnology, and establishing an electronic interoperable data system. \nVital information will be shared in real time among our front line \nagencies.\n  Our legislation sets realistic deadlines for the Attorney General and \nthe Secretary of State to issue to all foreign nationals machine-\nreadable, tamper-resistant travel documents with biometric identifiers. \nIt also sets a realistic deadline for our ports of entry to be used \nwith biometric data readers and scanners.\n\n  It also recognizes the valuable role of our border security and INS \npersonnel by ensuring that these offices receive adequate pay and \ntraining and have the technology they need to secure our borders \nwithout obstructing the efficient flow of persons and commerce.\n  It also recognizes the demands on our consular offices, and provides \nthem with the additional training and resources to screen for security \nthreats.\n  In this legislation, we preserve the visa waiver program but require \na stringent reporting requirement on passport theft and more frequent \nevaluation of participating countries' compliance with the programs' \nconditions.\n  Our bill honors our proud immigration tradition. It safeguards the \nentry of the more than 31 million persons who enter the United States \nlegally each year as visitor students, temporary workers, and the 550 \nmillion who legally cross our borders each year to visit family and \nfriends.\n\n[[Page S2917]]\n\n  We recognize that immigration is not the problem--terrorism is. We \nmust identify and isolate potential terrorists--not isolate the United \nStates. ``Fortress America'' is not a solution that we would consider.\n  In defending America, we are defending the fundamental constitutional \nprinciples of diversity, cultural exchange, and civil rights that have \nmade America strong in the past and which will make us even prouder in \nthe future.\n  This legislation strikes the appropriate balance. I hope we will \nreceive overwhelming support for it.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Kennedy, \nas ranking member on the Immigration Subcommittee to support this bill.\n  This bill cleared the House of Representatives twice on a unanimous \nconsent calendar. It is important. We still have problems at our \nborders. This bill deals with trying to get at the terrorists who seek \nto enter our land and not the legitimate people who are seeking to come \nhere for reasons that are positive to the United States.\n  This bill is a testament to the dedication of this body and in \nCongress. It is bipartisan. It has had the input of many Members. The \nbill reflects how truly united we as Americans stand before the threat \nof terrorism.\n  The bill is the product of a lot of dedicated people, too many to \nname--elected officials from both sides of the aisle, from both Houses, \nand experts from both inside and outside of Government. The entire \ncommunity in and around Washington and the country came together for \nthis common goal of defending America.\n  The bill is endorsed by the entire immigration spectrum. The groups \nthat are the most impacted by it endorse it. They appreciate the hard \ndecisions that have to be made after September 11 and see the wisdom in \nthis legislation.\n  We have legislation here that protects our borders without \ncompromising our values or our economy. This legislation is a measured, \nintelligent response to an evil that we will defeat. I am proud to be a \npart of this bill.\n  I will describe quickly, what we are trying to do--and we will get it \ndone--is to get information sharing from the various governmental \nagencies--the INS, the State Department, but also the CIA, the FBI, the \nDIA, and, hopefully, even other intelligence sources--so that we will \nhave information sharing so we can catch before they enter this country \npeople who seek to do harm. That information sharing is not taking \nplace to the degree it needs to be today. Senator Kennedy noted how \nmany people yearly enter this country legally--over 300 million \nentries--and we are looking for those few who seek to come in here to \ndo us harm. We are looking for a needle in a haystack, so we have to \nhave that information sharing.\n  We are trying to expand the perimeter around the United States. This \nwould include working with Canada and Mexico to get our perimeter \nbroader and more secure.\n  I visited the El Paso INS detention facility 1 year ago. There at the \ndetention center were people who had tried to enter our country \nillegally from 59 different countries, coming in through Central \nAmerica, going up by land through Central America, through Mexico. We \nneed to get the Mexican Government's support and help in protecting our \nperimeter.\n  We require manifests from other countries before the flights leave so \nwe can check those when they come in. We provide more monitoring of \nforeign students in this country once they come here.\n  On September 11, unfortunately, some of those terrorists were here \nunder student visas. We have to monitor the foreign students better in \nthis country.\n  This bill provides biometrics. It provides more information we can \nuse in checking people at the border. We have a number of other \nprovisions that are in the bill. It provides for more border security \nofficials to be able to check to make sure we are getting our job done.\n  In short, Mr. President, this bill has received a lot of work. We \nneed to pass this legislation. I believe we will get it passed today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a question from the Senator \nfrom New Mexico?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would be happy to yield for a question. I have \nyielded back the floor.\n  If I could secure the floor, Mr. President, I would be happy to yield \nfor a question from the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, I would just like to eliminate a \nlittle bit of confusion. This bill is going to pass unanimously--or \nalmost--today. And stories are going to say we provided 1,000 new \nagents for the INS and all the other things you provide in this bill.\n  I wonder if you might tell me, is any of this money appropriated by \nthis bill?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I could respond to that question, within the \nPresident's budget is allocated $742 million in the first year for the \nimplementation of this bill. It is within the President's budget. It is \nbelieved that the budget needs for the first year are $1.3 billion \ntotal. We have over half of that in the President's budget, and we are \ngoing to be seeking the approval for additional resources. We think we \ncan compete for the necessary funding with the homeland security issues \nwithin it. It is going to take authority, and this is the authority it \nis going to take appropriations to be able to get this implemented. The \nSenator from West Virginia has been raising in hearings and in this \nChamber this issue about the implementation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, as I indicated, I do not doubt it \nhas wonderful provisions in it. I have read them. I come from the \nborder, and I confirm that they are all good; our border people would \nlike to have them.\n  I just want to make sure we understand that there is no money \nprovided in this bill. So the public will get the story today or \ntomorrow that we passed this bill, but 3 or 4 months from now, when the \nappropriations bill comes that funds these kinds of activities, the \nAppropriations Committee has to have the money or we will just have \nanother bill that expresses, in beautiful words, what we would like to \nhave happen for our country. Is that about right?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. No. I would disagree, if I could, with my colleague. \nThe appropriate way to proceed is authorization language, then \nappropriations, of course. What we are doing here is the authorization \nlanguage. The President has built into his budget request over half of \nthe funding for this already. Now we will have to appropriate it. But \nto get there, first we are supposed to authorize. This is authorizing \nlanguage.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure. There is nothing tricky about my question. I am \nnot trying to put anyone on the spot. I am just trying to establish \nthat unless the money is appropriated later on by another act of \nCongress, and signed in another act by the President, we do not have \n200 new agents this year in each of the Departments, we don't have the \nresearch money that is in this bill for new technology, because this \nbill does not provide for any money to be spent. If that is not a \ncorrect statement, then I withdraw it.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. That is correct. This is authorizing language.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself a half a minute.\n  I want to add to what my colleague said. There is also $100 million \nin fees here. We have raised the fee part of it, which will be self-\nfunding, making the total $843 million. This agency has a budget of $6 \nbillion. It is our intention to try to work within that $6 billion to \nfind the additional money and to work with the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  But I think that the point the Senator from New Mexico makes about \nthe difference between authorization and appropriations is always \nworthwhile to point out so people have a very full understanding of the \nprocess.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senators.\n\n[[Page S2918]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico leaves the floor, I say to the Senator from New Mexico, he has \nmade a very important observation.\n  I am going to vote for this bill. But we do not have a CBO estimate \nof the cost. We have no estimate of the cost. There is an estimate by \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service. Now, that may be off a \ngreat deal or it may not be off a great deal.\n  I think it is important to keep in mind what the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico has pointed out. There is a great difference \nbetween authorizations and appropriations. And it is the money that \ncounts. Cicero, that great Roman orator, said: ``There is no fortress \nso strong that money cannot take it.'' So it is the money that counts. \nAnd the Senator has made an important observation. I made that \nobservation, too, early on. And I don't know what the estimate of the \ncost is going to be in here. We have certain estimates, the $1.1 \nbillion for the first year, and the $3.2 billion--or something like \nthat--$3.2 billion for 3 years. But those are estimates. They are by \nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service. And, of course, that is not \na great bank to put your money into when the INS estimates it. We have \nseen that agency fall on its face so many times in recent years.\n  But, in any event, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. A question along with this observation: I say to the \nSenator, it seems to me that what we do--and what we are doing in this \ncrisis, which is a very big crisis, with the President putting large \nnumbers of billions of dollars in homeland security and saying this is \nnew money--we come along and pass bills that authorize the new programs \nthat he is saying he wants new money for, but the truth of the matter \nis that very seldom are any existing programs that are being paid for \neliminated.\n  So you are going to have a subcommittee of your Committee on \nAppropriations, maybe two, that are going to fund this authorization \nbill--or maybe not, or maybe part of it; who knows? But the President \nhad in mind canceling a whole bunch of programs in order to pay for \nthis. And the point I make is, nobody helps with that part of the \nburden. Nobody carries any weight on trying to make room within the \nGovernment. They just pass on to the appropriators a very good, \nwonderful, new set of authorizations that we have all passed, and we go \nhome and tell our people it is going to help solve the crisis that is \nbefore us with reference to taking care of our borders, which are \nporous and should not even be called borders, they are so bad.\n\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, the Senator is correct. There will be a lot of eyes \nlooking toward the Senator from New Mexico and toward me, and the other \n27 members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, when it comes time \nto put the money on the barrelhead.\n  But having said that, I am going to vote for this bill. I am still \ngoing to seek a CBO estimate of the cost because I think that would be \nhelpful in the coming days as we proceed to the conference and then to \nthe conference report, and so on.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3161\n\n     (Purpose: To revise provisions relating to the compliance by \n   institutions and other entities with recordkeeping and reporting \n    requirements with respect to nonimmigrant students and exchange \n                               visitors)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the opportunity to seek a quality higher \neducation has long enticed men and women to leave their homelands to \ntravel to America.\n  We are, by and large, a generous Nation when it comes to providing an \neducation to foreign citizenry. Indeed, American colleges, \nuniversities, and technical schools have opened wide their doors to \nstudents from foreign lands. And all levels of schooling are available \nto foreign nationals of every age--from preschool to post-graduate \nwork, from public grade schools to private technical-training \ninstitutions.\n  In fact, foreign students have proven to be a lucrative source of \nrevenue for U.S. educational institutions. Private-sector analysts \nestimate that foreign students contribute between $9 billion and $13 \nbillion to the U.S. economy every year. Any number of marketing efforts \nare made by colleges and universities to recruit foreign students, \nwhose tuition fees serve to bulk up college budgets.\n  As a result, we have opened our borders to a stream of foreign \nstudents with precious little oversight of their movement through the \nAmerican educational stream. According to the INS, there are currently \n2 million foreign students admitted to study in this country--649,000 \nof whom were admitted just last year. These include nuclear engineering \nscholars, biochemistry students, and pilot-trainees, who have access to \nsensitive technology, training, and information.\n  Yet while our schools have been training would-be pilots in the art \nof flying airliners, we have been asleep at the switch! There has been \ntoo little accountability, and too few checks, largely because \noversight has proven too burdensome and costly for the government and \nthe U.S. educational industry.\n  The lax government oversight of these student visa beneficiaries was \nunderscored by the fact that three of the September 11 hijackers were \nawarded student visas--not to mention the fact that the INS was still \nprocessing the student visa applications for two of them 6 months after \nthey had crashed two planes into the World Trade Center towers and gone \non to meet their eternal destiny.\n  Clearly INS has not been up to the job of monitoring foreign \nstudents, and, in its current condition, placing new burdens on that \nagency alone is no solution. Therefore, as we look at our Nation \nthrough the prism of the new realities of terrorism, we must reconsider \nways to involve those who have the best opportunity to prevent attacks. \nWe need the assistance of our educational institutions.\n  In recent years, efforts to impose more stringent reporting \nrequirements on schools have faltered because educational institutions \nhave been reluctant to get into the job of monitoring foreign students. \nIn fact, colleges and universities have lobbied heavily against such \nrequirements, and the current lack of a national program to monitor \nforeign students indicates the effectiveness of that lobbying effort.\n  The pending legislation takes some important steps toward closing \nmany of the loopholes in our foreign student policies that could be \nexploited by a potential terrorist. If the student monitoring \nprovisions in this bill are to be successful, however, we must ensure \nthe participation of our schools. These institutions are best suited to \ninform the INS and the State Department as to which students have been \naccepted to attend a school, whether they actually show up for class \nonce they enter the country on a student visa, and whether they \ncontinue their classes or merely drop out of sight after checking in \nwith the admissions office.\n\n  Monitoring the student via program requires a partnership between the \ngovernment and all colleges, and technical schools that accept \nforeigners.\n  The pending bill gives the INS and the Secretary of State too much \ndiscretion in determining whether or not these educational institutions \nshould be penalized.\n  Section 502(c) of this bill reads:\n\n       Effect of Failure To Comply.--Failure of an institution or \n     other entity to comply with the record keeping and reporting \n     requirements to receive nonimmigrant students or exchange \n     visitor program participants under section 101(a)(15) (F), \n     (M), or (J) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1101(a)(15) (F), (M), or (J)) or Section 641 of the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \n     (8 U.S.C. 1372), may, at the election of the Commissioner of \n     Immigration and Naturalization or the Secretary of State, \n     result in the termination, suspension, or limitation of the \n     institution's approval to receive such students or the \n     termination of the other entity's designation to sponsor \n     exchange visitor program participants, as the case may be.\n\n  What's more, in section 502 of this bill, the ``periodic reviews,'' \nwhich the INS Commissioner, Secretary of State, and Secretary of \nEducation are required to make to determine whether institutions are \ncomplying with this legislation, are not defined. A ``periodic review'' \ncould mean every 5 years or it could mean every 20 years or it could \nmean every 50 years.\n\n[[Page S2919]]\n\n  That is very soft language.\n  My amendment would require reviews by the relevant agency heads at \nleast once every two years. Further, if they found that U.S. \neducational institutions were materially not complying with the \nreporting requirements in this bill, my amendment would require the \nrelevant agency heads to terminate or suspend, for at least one year, \nthe right of those institutions to accept foreign students.\n  This amendment makes clear the serious concern about this Nation's \nability to help foreign students while also protecting our homeland. \nEducational institutions are essential partners in our efforts to \nensure that foreign students really are ``students'' with no other \nagenda but learning.\n  I thank Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Feinstein, and Kyl for their \nsupport of this amendment. I hope that the Senate will adopt it.\n  Mr. President, I have made my statement prior to calling up the \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that the time I have consumed in \nreading my statement come out of my time on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3161:\n       On page 49, beginning on line 4, strike ``The'' and all \n     that follows through ``reviews'' on line 7 and insert ``Not \n     later than two years after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and every two years thereafter, the Commissioner of \n     Immigration and Naturalization, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Education, shall conduct a review''.\n       On page 49, lines 22 and 23, strike ``The Secretary of \n     State shall conduct periodic reviews'' and insert ``Not later \n     than two years after the date of enactment of this Act, and \n     every two years thereafter, the Secretary of State shall \n     conduct a review''.\n       On page 50, line 16, strike ``(c) Effect of Failure To \n     Comply.--Failure'' and insert ``(c) Effect of Material \n     Failure To Comply.--Material failure''.\n       Beginning on page 50, line 24, strike ``may'' and all that \n     follows through the period on line 5 of page 51 and insert \n     the following: ``shall result in the suspension for at least \n     one year or termination, at the election of the Commissioner \n     of Immigration and Naturalization, of the institution's \n     approval to receive such students, or result in the \n     suspension for at least one year or termination, at the \n     election of the Secretary of State, of the other entity's \n     designation to sponsor exchange visitor program participants, \n     as the case may be.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will urge our colleagues to support \nthis amendment for the excellent reasons that the sponsor gave in \nsupport and in justification of the amendment.\n  There are now 26,000 universities and schools that can effectively \napprove a foreign student to come and study. But the foreign student \nhas to qualify for the visa project at the current time. We have \nincluded some very important requirements in this legislation because \nthis has been one of the great loopholes in our monitoring of who comes \ninto this country and who does not.\n  The State Department must first receive the electronic evidence of \nthe acceptance from an approved U.S. institution prior to issuing a \nstudent visa. The State Department must inform the INS that a visa has \nbeen approved. The INS must inform the approved institution the student \nhas been admitted into the country, and then the approved institution \nmust notify INS when the student has registered and enrolled. If the \nstudent doesn't report for class, the school must notify the INS of \nthis absence not later than 30 days after the deadline for the classes.\n  So the colleges and universities have to develop that kind of system \nin order to be qualified for these programs, which is enormously \nimportant and a very significant, dramatic change from the current \nsituation.\n  Currently, there are sporadic inspections of the universities. So now \nthe Byrd amendment comes along and says, well, what you have in here \nlooks good on paper, but what we take note of is the fact that, even if \nit is good on paper, the INS, in its history, has been sporadic in \ninspecting and finding out whether the schools and colleges are doing \nwhat they said and what they are supposed to do. That has been true. \nThis tightens that provision up in a very important way.\n  If there is a material breach, then there will be a suspension of \nthat institution from being able to receive the foreign students. So I \nbelieve it is going to make a very important difference in terms of \ncompliance with one of the most important aspects of this legislation, \nwhich is understanding the students who are coming here, monitoring the \nstudents when they are here, knowing when the students are leaving, and \nif the students are not attending the schools, having access to that \nkind of information as well.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for the amendment. What it \ndoes is put real teeth into this provision which we had worked out in \nthe committee to achieve the kind of oversight the INS has not had up \nto this time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues, as well, to \nsupport the Byrd amendment. The reasons have been stated by both \nSenators Byrd and Kennedy. I think the important thing to look at and \nsee here is that we have a number of foreign students in the United \nStates, and this has been a very positive thing, overall, for the \nUnited States and for the rest of the world. I don't think anybody \nwould disagree with that statement. Yet what we have had taking place \nis a system that, over time, has gotten far too loose, and we saw the \neffects of that on September 11, where a couple of these individuals \nwho came into the United States and did this operation, this horrific \nthing that happened, came in under student visas because they were \nlooking for weaknesses in the system to get into the United States in a \nless restrictive, reviewed area. So that is why this has been at the \nvery heart of this bill.\n  Senator Byrd puts in a good provision. There have been sporadic \nreviews by the Government of the educational institutions to see that \nthey are doing this right, that they are taking the program seriously \nand not just finding some way of being able to bump up their student \naccount and the number of students coming to the United States. We will \nhave a regular reporting requirement and we will be able to monitor \nthis much more closely. It should not inhibit legitimate students from \ncoming here, nor the institutions that are legitimate and serious about \nwhat their projects are. It will be a bit more of a hindrance to those \nlooking to increase their foreign student accounts and, hopefully, it \nwill help us to get at those students who are here to do us harm.\n\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment actually came into the \nbill from the original parts of the bill, Senator Kyl's and my \ninvestigations from the Terrorism and Technology Subcommittee. What we \nfound is the student visa program was greatly in disarray. We found \nthat we have about 660,000 students coming in a year, and there is no \ntracking of any of them. Nobody knows whether they are really at a \nschool.\n  Up to this point, the schools have had no responsibility to report \nthat a student has arrived, that a student is taking this or that \ncourse and, yes, that the student has stayed in school. So I think \nSenator Byrd's amendment strengthens what is already in the bill. I \nthink it makes it a better bill. We intend to follow up on this. \nSenator Kennedy and I have discussed it. We intend to see, in fact, \nthat the schools do keep their word and do, in fact, do the reporting \nthey are required to do under this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Senator Feinstein and I were upstairs a \nmoment ago during the time allotted for discussion of the bill in \ngeneral. Let me take a couple of minutes, if I could, to express my \nsupport also for the amendment pending that Senator Byrd offered. As \nSenator Feinstein said, it will strengthen what we are trying to do \nwith the student visa program.\n  Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee has a couple of subcommittees \nof jurisdiction. Senator Kennedy and Senator Brownback are the chairman\n\n[[Page S2920]]\n\nand ranking member of the Immigration Subcommittee, and I have the \nhonor of serving on that committee, as does Senator Feinstein. She \nchairs and I am ranking member of the Terrorism Subcommittee. So we \nhave had the ability in both of these subcommittees to hold hearings \nand to discover after September 11 areas in which we can improve our \nimmigration laws to make it much more difficult for terrorists to enter \nthis country or to stay here illegally.\n  This legislation is designed to close as many of those so-called \nloopholes as we can. I think it is a good effort in that regard. Each \nof the amendments that will be offered by Senator Byrd, in one way or \nanother, strengthens the bill we have already offered.\n  I wanted to make two quick comments. Eighteen of the terrorists who \nentered the country and flew airplanes into the World Trade Center, the \nPentagon, and into the ground in Pennsylvania came in using B-1, B-2 \ntourist visas. According to the Department of State, 47 foreign-born \nindividuals, including these 19, have been charged with, pled guilty \nto, or been convicted of involvement in terrorism over the past decade. \nAll 47 of these people had contacts with an INS inspector. Yet, \nsomehow, they were able to get into the country. The 19th of the 19 was \nHani Hanjour. He entered the country on an F1 student visa, the subject \nof the specific amendment now before us. He supposedly came here to \nattend classes and study English. He never showed up for class. The \nschool did not notify the authorities that he never attended classes. \nHe overstayed his visa and just melted into our society.\n  Another example of one of the terrorists, Mohamed Atta, came in on a \ntourist visa. According to several sources, he was placed on the FBI \nwatch list 6 weeks before the terrorist attacks. But his name was never \nentered into INS's system. Before his visa expired in December of 2000, \nAtta actually went to the INS to change his status to that of student. \nAfter December of 2000, even without the information that showed his \nplacement on a watch list, he should not have been allowed to reenter \nthe country.\n  Yet, on June 3, 2000, at Newark International Airport on a Czech Air \nflight from Prague, after being questioned by INS for an hour, he was \nadmitted back into the United States.\n  My point of illustrating with these two examples is to point out that \nthe INS had contact with all of these people. They clearly should have \nbeen caught, but they were not caught because the INS officials either \ndid not have the information they should have had or for some other \nreason did not ask the right questions.\n  Mary Ryan, who is one of the people who testified before Senator \nFeinstein's subcommittee--her title is Assistant Secretary for Consular \nAffairs, Department of State--actually said: we felt like the woman \ndriving through the school zone at 15 miles an hour and the little girl \nruns out behind the parked cars. She gets hit, and we feel terrible, \nbut what could we do about it? That is why we set about trying to \nfigure out what we could do about it.\n  One provision is to tighten up the student visa requirements. Without \ngoing into anything further, I think it sets the stage for what we are \ntrying to accomplish and trying to close some of these loopholes, how \nwe hope it will have some good, positive effect--not the overall answer \nto terrorism, but it will help to some extent.\n  As I said, the amendments Senator Byrd offers strengthen the bill. I \nam supportive of them, and I hope we can get to final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if it is agreeable with Senator Kennedy and \nthe other cosponsors of the amendment, I will yield back the remainder \nof my time on the amendment. Some Senators have been promised that \nthere will be no votes until about 7:15 p.m. If it is agreeable with \nall the cosponsors, I will be happy to ask unanimous consent that the \nvote on this amendment occur upon the expiration of all time on the \namendments and further statements can be made in regard to the bill so \nthat the votes would be stacked for beginning, say, around 7:15 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, stacking the votes is fine with me. I \nwould rather have our colleagues available so that we can move along. \nIt is just 6 o'clock now. Maybe my cosponsors want to spend time \ndescribing the amendments. I do not think so. I know Senator Feinstein \nhas not had a chance to address the whole issue as a prime sponsor. It \nseems to me we should be able to consider these amendments in a timely \nmanner. I would like to see if we can move the votes to prior to 7:15 \np.m. If the leader set that time, then that will be the time, but I \nhope we can make progress prior to that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if we stack these votes, I certainly \nthink our colleagues will appreciate that. I believe there is going to \nbe, if I understand the intention of the Senator from West Virginia and \nthe amendments he is putting forward, broad agreement amongst the \ncosponsors of the amendments.\n  All of these are strengthening amendments. I see no reason why we \ncannot do all of the amendments together in an expedited fashion. What \nthe Senator is doing is really making the bill better. I do not know if \nit is possible, but if we could do it, we could have a limited number \nof votes for which we would call our colleagues back.\n  These are good amendments. I do not anticipate anybody coming to the \nChamber in opposition to them. Possibly we could adopt these together \nas one. Of the ones I have looked at, they appear to look quite good. \nMy hope is to complete them quickly. If we need to do it at 7:15 p.m., \nfine, and we can do them possibly altogether.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I think it will work out all right if we just proceed.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the vote on this \namendment occur at the expiration of the time on all the amendments \nwith the yielding back of that time and yielding back or making final \nstatements on the bill, if that is agreeable with the cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3162\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send to the desk the second amendment, and \nI ask that the clerk read the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3162.\n\n   (Purpose: To require as a condition of a country's designation or \n   continued designation as a program country under the Visa Waiver \n Program that the country reports to the United States Government the \n            theft of blank passports issued by that country)\n\n       Beginning on page 32, strike line 23 and all that follows \n     through line 5 on page 33 and insert the following:\n       (a) Reporting Passport Thefts.--Section 217 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1187) is amended--\n       (1) by adding at the end of subsection (c)(2) the following \n     new subparagraph:\n       ``(D) Reporting passport thefts.--The government of the \n     country certifies that it reports to the United States \n     Government on a timely basis the theft of blank passports \n     issued by that country.''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c)(5)(A)(i), by striking ``5 years'' and \n     inserting ``2 years''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end of subsection (f) the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(5) Failure to report passport thefts.--If the Attorney \n     General and the Secretary of State jointly determine that the \n     program country is not reporting the theft of blank \n     passports, as required by subsection (c)(2)(D), the Attorney \n     General shall terminate the designation of the country as a \n     program country.''.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield such time as I may consume from my \ntime on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in my testimony before the Immigration \nSubcommittee last week, I spoke about the safety of the American people \nand how that safety within their own borders often takes a back seat to \nsuch issues as commerce and diplomacy.\n\n[[Page S2921]]\n\n  The visa waiver program, I believe, is a clear example of what I was \ntalking about.\n  The program allows 23 million citizens from 28 countries to enter the \nUnited States without first obtaining a visa from a U.S. consulate \nabroad. This program, by eliminating the visa requirement and the \nsubsequent State Department background check, expedites travel and \ncommerce, but waives the usual first step by which foreigners are \nscreened for admissibility when seeking to enter the United States.\n  Consequently, in a 1999 study, the Justice Department's Office of the \nInspector General found that terrorists, criminals, and alien smugglers \nhave attempted to gain entry into the United States through the waiver \nprogram. The inspector general's office also commented on the danger of \nstolen passports from visa waiver countries being used by terrorists to \nenter the United States without a visa.\n  It has been noted that in 1992 one of the conspirators in the 1993 \nWorld Trade Center bombing tried to get into the United States through \nthe visa waiver program with a fake Swedish passport. Fortunately, he \nwas caught, and a search of his luggage revealed bomb-making \ninstructions.\n  In recent years, tens of thousands of blank passports from visa \nwaiver countries have been stolen. These passports are sold on the \nblack market to terrorists, criminals, and anyone else who may wish to \navoid a State Department background check before entering the United \nStates.\n  While only countries deemed ``low-risk'' are allowed to participate \nin the visa waiver program, and they must meet certain qualifications, \nthe Attorney General is only required to review these countries' \nparticipation once every 5 years. Moreover, the Attorney General is not \nrequired to consider the efforts to prevent theft when determining \nwhether to accept the country into or allow the country to continue to \nparticipate in the visa waiver program.\n  My amendment would require the Attorney General to review the \ncountries that participate in the visa waiver program at least once \nevery 2 years to help ensure that those countries continue to meet the \nprograms's standards, and it also requires the Attorney General to \nremove countries from the program that do not report stolen passports. \nI am hopeful that my amendment will foster the kind of review that will \nresult in greater scrutiny of this program and of those who enter the \ncountry through it.\n  This is a commonsense amendment, and I hope that Senators will \nsupport it.\n  I have discussed it with Senator Kennedy, and he in turn has \ndiscussed it with the other authors of the bill and I hope that all \nSenators will support the amendment. I believe it to be a good one, a \nvery worthwhile amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I urge our colleagues to support this amendment as well. \nIt strengthens an important provision in the legislation. The Senator \nhas outlined what the visa waiver program is, available now to 28 \ndifferent countries.\n  Why the visa waiver? It was the judgment and the determination that \nif 2 percent, or less than 2 percent, of the visa applications were \ngoing to be rejected, then it probably made sense in terms of the \nefficiency to grant a visa waiver to that particular country. These are \ngenerally our oldest allies and friends as nations. A country has to \nstay at 2\\1/2\\ percent in order to stay in the program. Six countries a \nyear is the general rule.\n  So what the Senator's amendment does is it says, look, given the \nchanged circumstances that exist in the world, at least every 2 years \nwe want to see countries reviewed. This is certainly supportable.\n  One of the principal reasons, obviously, in reviewing a country in \nterms of a visa waiver, may be because there are national security \nissues that are different. There may be law enforcement issues that are \ndifferent. If there are security issues that are different, then we \nwould want to know it and know about it in a timely way.\n  We have seen in recent times, a month ago, Argentina was dropped from \nthe visa waiver program because of the turmoil that exists there and \nthe enormous numbers of people who were leaving with very little \nintention perhaps of returning. So the amendment of the Senator will \nensure that the visa waiver program will carry forward its real \nintention, and it will be carefully reviewed every 2 years with the \nidea that the review, which will be by the State Department and the \nAttorney General, will look at the country and see if there are new \nissues of security that may pose a potential threat to the United \nStates. If they do, they can take the action of removing the country, \nor make other recommendations.\n\n  The second feature of this amendment, which is enormously important, \nis the requirement that we are going to have the report of stolen \npassports. That has been a very slipshod process in the past. The Byrd \namendment puts teeth into that provision. If the countries themselves \nare not going to be reporting these stolen passports, they will no \nlonger be participating in this favored position in terms of the visa \nwaiver.\n  Getting a handle on stolen passports is enormously important. It is \ngoing to be even more important as we move on into the future. This \namendment makes sense. I hope our colleagues will support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \nsecond Byrd amendment. It is a strengthening amendment, for the reasons \nthat have been articulated by the Senator from West Virginia and the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  I wish to focus on the final point that Senator Kennedy put forward \nwith an exclamation mark. This is an important program. The visa waiver \nprogram has certainly been a very valuable one for the countries that \nwork closely with the United States. They like it. A number of people \nwho travel really like and appreciate it, and yet in some places we are \nhaving thefts, losses of passports with which people can penetrate our \nborders. That has not been as forcefully enforced by other countries on \nthis visa waiver provision.\n  Now, with the Byrd amendment requiring an every 2-year review, if \nthey are not enforcing this provision when there is a loss or a theft \nof a passport, it is not being reported aggressively, there is a real \nhammer here: No more visa waiver.\n  I rather imagine there are a number of countries that are in this \nvisa waiver program that do not like this amendment, but for us and for \nour security this is an excellent provision given the world of today. \nIf this were 10, 20 years ago and we did not have quite the present \nthreat on us of terrorist attacks in the United States and people \ntrying to slip through our borders, one might say this is going to be \nan added burden that maybe we should not have. But given the situation \nwe are in today, I think we would have been wise to have had it 10 or \n20 years ago. It is clearly a needed provision, and it will cause \npeople who are working closely with the United States, that have this \nvisa waiver, they will scrutinize their practices more closely and \nreport these passports if they have been stolen.\n  This is an excellent strengthening provision. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield back the remainder of my time. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the vote on this amendment occur immediately after the \nvote on the student monitoring amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Massachusetts yield back \nthe remainder of his time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back all of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3163\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I now offer a third amendment. I anticipate we could have a \nvoice vote on this amendment, unless enough Senators wish to have a \nrollcall vote.\n\n[[Page S2922]]\n\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is laid aside. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3163.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To substitute October 26, 2004, for October 26, 2003, for the \n achievement of requirements with respect to machine-readable, tamper-\n                  resistant entry and exit documents)\n\n       On page 25, line 21, strike ``October 26, 2003'' and insert \n     ``October 26, 2004''.\n       On page 26, lines 12 and 13, strike ``October 26, 2003'' \n     and insert ``October 26, 2004''.\n       On page 26, lines 24 and 25, strike ``October 26, 2003'' \n     and insert ``October 26, 2004''.\n       On page 28, line 2, strike ``October 26, 2003'' and insert \n     ``October 26, 2004''.\n       On page 28, line 16, strike ``October 26, 2003'' and insert \n     ``October 26, 2004''.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume of \nthe time allotted to me on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as we strive to respond to the new \nchallenges of terrorism, we must be cognizant of the essential \ncomponent of public trust. Without the confidence of the people, our \nefforts to improve domestic security, including our efforts to tighten \nour border defenses, cannot succeed.\n  To help ensure that we do not undermine the public's confidence in \nour efforts to secure our borders, we must set realistic mandates--that \nis, guidelines and time frames that are measurable and achievable.\n  This bill, in two separate instances, sets an October 26, 2003, \ndeadline for the Attorney General and the Secretary of State to meet \ntwo separate mandates.\n  Section 303(b)(1):\n\n       Not later than October 26, 2003, the Attorney General and \n     the Secretary of State shall issue to aliens only machine-\n     readable, tamper-resistant visas and travel and entry \n     documents that use biometric identifiers.\n\n  Section 303(b)(2):\n\n       Not later than October 26, 2003, the Attorney General, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of State, shall install at \n     all ports of entry of the United States equipment and \n     software to allow biometric comparison of all United States \n     visas and travel and entry documents issued to aliens, and \n     passports issued pursuant to subsection (c)(1).\n\n  A third October 26, 2003, deadline applies to visa waiver countries \nissuing to their nationals machine-readable passports that are tamper-\nresistant and that incorporate biometric identifiers.\n  I question whether the Attorney General and the Secretary of State \nwill be able to meet these deadlines. When I asked one of the authors \nof this bill, Senator Kyl, about this deadline during the floor debate \non Monday, Senator Kyl said:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia raises a good question with \n     respect to those deadlines. Frankly, on two of the three, \n     there is no good answer. The Senator is absolutely correct \n     about that. . . . As to precisely how long it will take to \n     get those [systems] online, there is not a good specific \n     answer, nor is there an answer as to when we can have the \n     interoperable system developed, which is one of the central \n     features of the bill.\n\n  These dates are not based on the availability of technology, or even \nprojections about the availability of technology. Nor are they based on \nany realistic expectation about the availability of funding. As far as \nI can tell, these deadlines are based solely on the fact that the USA \nPATRIOT Act was signed into law on that same day in 2001.\n  I appreciate the notion that, without deadlines, it is difficult to \npress the agencies to act expeditiously. But, when this deadline comes \nand goes, and the Attorney General and the Secretary of State have not \nmet these goals, the public will have reason to become disillusioned \nwith our efforts to tighten our border defenses. Considering the \npublic's current skepticism regarding the INS and its ability to \nsafeguard our borders, I suggest that we be careful about committing \nour border defense agencies to deadlines that they cannot meet.\n  Under the regular appropriations process, Congress cannot make the \nnecessary funding available to the agencies before October 1, 2002, and \nthat assumes that all 13 appropriations bills are completed on time, by \nthe end of the fiscal year. Even if the bills are completed on time, it \ncould still take months before funds are released to the agencies to \nmeet these mandates.\n  With the support of Senator Kennedy, I am offering an amendment that \nwould move the October 26, 2003, deadlines back by one year to October \n26, 2004. This amendment allows the Congress more time to appropriate \nthe necessary funds, and help to ensure adequate time for the State and \nJustice Departments to meet these deadlines.\n  Our efforts to tighten our border defenses will require the long-term \nsupport of the American people. It is an effort that will require the \ntrust and confidence of the American people. We should not place that \ntrust at risk by setting deadlines we know to be unrealistic. So it is \nfor that reason Senator Kennedy and I and the other authors of this \namendment have worked together to fashion this amendment. I urge \nadoption of this amendment.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Byrd \namendment. This is a positive amendment in the overall bill, it is \nappropriate, and it was the topic of a great deal of discussion \npreviously as we were putting together this bill overall. The bill, in \nits design, had a number of people working together to try to figure it \nout. One of the most contentious issues was this issue about the time \ndeadline in which we would be able to accomplish these biometric \nidentifiers.\n  The administration had a great deal of concern about meeting the very \naggressive dates set in the overall bill. A number of our colleagues \ninvolved in the negotiation said: We realize this may be aggressive, \nbut we need to push it because this is such an important issue. A lot \nof people within the executive branch were saying: I don't know that we \ncan meet this deadline.\n  This amendment will be well received by a number of people who \nbelieved the time deadlines put forward in the original bill were just \ntoo aggressive to be accomplished. This will set a far more realistic \ndate as to when we accomplish it. I know people in the executive branch \nwill try to do this as quickly as possible. They are clearly going to \nbe far more comfortable with this date as being more realistic, one \nthat can be accomplished.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this Byrd \namendment to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I have a different take on it. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment, but I think we need to send a message to the \nINS that it can't be business as usual any longer and that instead of a \n``can't do'' attitude, they have to have a ``can do'' attitude.\n  I personally spoke with Governor Ridge about this deadline and asked \nhim what he thought. He said: Let me get back to you. When he did get \nback to me, he said: We have to move forward as quickly as possible. I \nsupport the date that Senators Kennedy, Brownback, and Feinstein and I \nagreed upon. We have to show the American people we will get on with \nthis and the delay will no longer be acceptable.\n  Senator Brownback is correct when he says that this will make some \npeople a lot happier. There were people who were saying: We are not \nsure we can meet this deadline in the bill. To that extent, the \namendment of the Senator from West Virginia will be well received.\n  I want to make it clear, we are not sending a signal by agreeing with \nthe Senator from West Virginia tonight--and I know he doesn't mean to, \neither, as I understand this amendment--because we have decided it is \nOK to sit back and relax because we have extra time. It is simply a \nreflection of the fact that it will not be easy. It will take time. \nNobody knows for sure exactly how much. However, all five of us, I am \nsure I can say, are strongly of the view that we have to get on with \nthis. Business as usual is not going to cut it.\n  The good news is that while technology may be a little more difficult \nto implement in the very beginning, and a little costly, in the long \nrun it will be both cheaper and much more efficient in enabling \nanalysis of the data in this huge country of ours with all of the \nmillions of people who come into it by visas and other means. The \ntechnology will help enforce the provisions of this bill and other \nlegislation on the books.\n\n[[Page S2923]]\n\n  Technology will be the answer eventually. It will take time to get \ngoing. But by agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from West \nVirginia, I can speak for everyone by saying to those folks who have to \nimplement it, we do not mean for you to relax; we mean for you to get \non with it. We have to do our part by giving you the resources to do \nit.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I, too, hope our colleagues will support \nthe amendment. There really is not any difference in the views that are \nbeing shared on the Senate floor this evening. That is, we want to get \nthe best technology, and we want to then get a process so that it can \nbe utilized effectively in order to protect our security.\n  I want to give assurances to those who favor the earlier date that \nour committee will be meeting with the Commissioner, with Mr. Ziglar, \nand we welcome other colleagues, to try to monitor this as aggressively \nas we possibly can. This is the final date, but it is certainly the \nsense here for the INS to understand we want it done as early as \npossible. But we want to make sure it is complete, and we are going to \nhave the best technology. Then we are going to have the best technology \nin terms of the implementation of the legislation.\n  We give assurance to our colleagues that our committee will monitor \nthis very carefully and periodically give reports back to the Senate \nbecause this is enormously important.\n  What we are basically saying is with 550 million people moving in and \nout of the United States, there is a limited number who pose a security \nthreat. The immigrants are not the danger, terrorists are the danger. \nWe have to be able to use that knowledge to detect them. We have great \nopportunities to do it. We want to get the right technology and \nimplement it and we want to do it in the shortest possible time.\n  This legislation will establish sending that message. I agree with \nthose who say we want to get started, we want to get it done right, but \nwe have altered the date to take into consideration those who believe \nwe would not have done the right job if we had the earlier date. We \nthink this makes sense, and we hope colleagues will support the \namendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues \nsupporting this amendment. There is one thing I would like to point \nout. I have serious concerns about the visa waiver program. I have \nconcerns about its wisdom in the first place.\n  When you have 23 million people coming in without visas, from 29 \ndifferent countries, it becomes so easy for passports to be misplaced \nand for people who are threats to get into this program. I think we \nhave to watch it very carefully. We have to depend on the fact that the \nstrictures in this bill are meant to be carried out.\n  I, for one, would not have a problem with doing away with the program \nif we find any more irregularities in it. We have actual instances \nwhere terrorists have used this visa waiver program. We know 100,000 \npassports were missing. We know they were not reported in a timely way. \nThis bill requires, first of all, the thefts of passports, or that \npassports are missing, be reported immediately. Then the INS, within 72 \nhours, would have to enter them into an interoperable database, \nassuming we get to that interoperable database. Until that system is \nestablished, the INS would enter the information into an existing data \nsystem.\n  I, for one, am going to ask my staff to watch very carefully as to \nhow these passport numbers get entered, and I will try to do my level \nbest to see it is carried out. If it is not, I think we will have to go \nback and assess the wisdom of this entire program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am happy to yield the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3163) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3164\n\n     (Purpose: To increase the penalty for noncompliance with the \n             requirements to provide manifest information)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3164:\n\n       On page 39, line 25, strike ``$300'' and insert ``$1,000''.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the border security bill before the Senate \nrequires ships and aircraft entering the United States to provide to \nour immigration officials a manifest of all passengers and crew on the \nvessel before they arrive in U.S. ports. If a commercial carrier fails \nto do so, this bill imposes on the carreer a $300 fine for each person \nnot mentioned, or for each person incorrectly identified, in the \nmanifest.\n  This penalty is wholly inadequate in my judgment. It is really a slap \non the wrist for an airline or sea carrier that fails to provide \nimportant information to our immigration officials. This amendment \nwould increase this penalty to $1,000 for each person that a commercial \ncarriers fails to list accurately on the passenger manifest.\n  Airlines and sea carries must be more than a passive conduit for \ninformation between ticket agents and our border defense agencies. We \nneed the commercial carriers that bring people to this country to be \npartners in identifying persons who might have suspicious travel \ndocuments or travel plans.\n  Increasing the fine for noncompliance is one way to emphasize to \ncommercial carriers that they have an important role in border \nsecurity.\n  This amendment has the support of the managers of the bill and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  I support the amendment. I think it demonstrates support for a very \nimportant provision in the legislation, and that is for the INS to \nreceive the manifests of those who are coming into the United States in \na timely fashion. It demonstrates, by increasing the penalty, that we \nare serious about this issue.\n  The American carriers, as I understand it, do this regularly, \nroutinely. In any event, there are a number of carriers that do not. \nWhat the amendment does is underline the importance of this function \nand establishes the seriousness with which we take this function of \ninformation by increasing the penalty. I think it helps the legislation \nand I support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is another strengthening \namendment. We have teeth in this provision. They get bigger with the \nByrd amendment. I think that is a good provision for us on the \nprearrival of aircraft coming into this country. For whatever reason, \nwe have had some difficulty with airlines providing this manifest ahead \nof time. This is going to make this a more significant penalty.\n  We need to have this information. We should have this information \nahead of time. This is a key security issue. It is part of this \nextension to try to deal with terrorists trying to enter our land.\n  This is a good strengthening amendment. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I congratulate and thank the Senator from West Virginia once again \nfor helping to make what I think is a good bill better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time on this \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n\n[[Page S2924]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 3164) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor the study that he has given to this issue, and for the \nrecommendations that he has made on this legislation. We are urging our \ncolleagues to support this.\n  I thank him for his cooperation and for the seriousness which he has \ngiven to this legislation. I thank him.\n  Mr. President, under the consent agreement we still have the \nadditional item; that is, the managers' amendment. I ask that we now \nproceed to the consideration of the managers' amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield for a \nquestion prior to proceeding?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the \nprevious amendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3160\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself \n     and Mr. Brownback, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Kyl, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3160.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope we will approve the managers' \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3160) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand that two rollcalls have been \nordered. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to ask for the \nyeas and nays on final passage of H.R. 3525, the underlying measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am very pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering H.R. 3525, the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry \nReform Act. This bill mirrors S. 1749, which Senator Kennedy introduced \nwith Senators Feinstein, Brownback, Kyl, and others. I am one of 58 \ncosponsors of S. 1749, which has commanded extraordinary bipartisan \nsupport and the sponsorship of most of the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, from which H.R. 3525 was discharged. Indeed, this bill \nreflects the results of sustained bipartisan negotiation, and \nrepresents the consensus view of Senators across the ideological \nspectrum. In other words, this is legislation the Senate should pass \nwithout delay.\n  As a Senator from Vermont, I know what a serious issue border \nsecurity is. For too long, Congress has taken a haphazard approach to \nborder security, meeting many of the needs of our southwest border but \nneglecting our border with Canada. Since the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, we have taken a far more comprehensive approach. Congress \ntook its first steps to strengthen our borders in the USA PATRIOT Act, \nwhich authorized tripling the number of Border Patrol personnel, INS \nInspectors, and Customs Service agents serving along our northern \nborder, and $100 million in funding for improved technology for the INS \nand Customs Service's use in monitoring the border. As the author of \nthose provisions, I am pleased that the administration has requested \nsubstantial increases in funding for border security personnel. I urge \nthe Congress not only to fund this priority, but to ensure that the \nnorthern border receives at least half of any new supply of border \nsecurity enforcement officers.\n  The legislation before us today builds on the first steps taken in \nthe USA PATRIOT Act to strengthen substantially the security of our \nborders. It will further increase the number of INS Inspectors and INS \ninvestigative personnel, and authorize raises for Border Patrol agents \nand inspectors so that we can retain our experienced border security \nofficers, who have been so overworked over the past 7 months. The bill \nalso authorizes funding for training of INS personnel for more \neffective border management, and for improving the State Department's \nreview of visa applicants abroad. In addition, it authorizes $150 \nmillion for the INS to improve technology for border security, another \nimportant follow-up to the USA PATRIOT Act.\n  Beyond authorizing badly needed funding for our borders, this \nlegislation includes a number of important security provisions, a few \nof which I would like to highlight today. First, it requires the \nAttorney General and Secretary of State to issue only machine-readable \nand tamper-resistant visas, and travel and entry documents using \nbiometric identifiers, by October 26, 2003. They must also have \nmachines that can read the documents at all ports of entry by that \ndate.\n  Second, the bill requires the Secretary of State to establish \nterrorist lookout committees within each U.S. mission abroad, to ensure \nthat consular officials receive updated information on known or \npotential terrorists in the Nation where they are stationed.\n  Third, the bill will foster information sharing between other \nGovernment agencies and the State Department and INS, and shorten the \ndeadline established in the USA PATRIOT Act to develop a technology \nstandard to identify visa applicants.\n  Fourth, the legislation requires all commercial vessels or aircraft \nentering or departing from the United States to provide complete \npassenger manifests.\n  Fifth, this bill would substantially strengthen existing law for the \nmonitoring of foreign students. The Government would be required to \ncollect additional information about student visa applicants, and \neducational institutions would be obligated to report visa holders who \ndid not appear for classes. In addition, the INS Commissioner would \nperform periodic audits of educational institutions entitled to accept \nforeign students.\n  I will vote for this bill because it will help protect our Nation and \nour borders. More than ever since September 11, those issues are \nfundamental priorities for this Congress. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in supporting this bill, and look forward to its becoming law.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, today we are considering legislation \non one of the most important issues in our fight against terrorism--how \nwe can effectively secure our borders.\n  For me and for my State, one of the most critical things this bill \ndoes is to build on our efforts last year to increase staffing at the \nborder by authorizing annual staffing increases on the borders for each \nof the next 5 years.\n  Those of us who represent States along the northern border knew \nbefore September 11 that the northern border was woefully understaffed. \nWhile we were able to double staffing across the border last year, the \nnorthern border will need a yearly infusion of staff to guarantee our \nsecurity for the future.\n  This bill also incorporates many of the ideas of our colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, to create a workable entry and exit \nsystem and better tracking of those in this country on student visas, \nand I would like to thank her for her many years of work on these \nissues.\n  Finally, this bill is about better use of technology to provide the \nenhanced security and border efficiency we need. But with every \ntechnological solution, comes the very real risk that the technology \ncould be misused to invade personal privacy.\n  I have worked hard to make sure that provisions of this bill preserve \nthe right to privacy. As we come to rely more on technology, including \nvoluntary programs that require our citizens to provide personal \ninformation to government agencies, we will need to make very sure that \nwe have sufficient\n\n[[Page S2925]]\n\nsafeguards in place to protect how that information is stored and used.\n  Many of the provisions of this bill are based on and cross-reference \na provision I was able to include in the USA PATRIOT Act. That \nprovision requires the State Department and the Department of Justice \nto develop a technology standard for the purpose of exchanging law \nenforcement and intelligence information necessary to screen applicants \nfor U.S. visas and individual's using visas to enter the country.\n  Within that standard, there are specific privacy safeguards to limit \nthe application of the standard of aliens; limit the purposes the date \ncollected could be used to background checks and border verification; \nlimit the distribution of the data to consular officers and border \ninspectors; require that any changes to expand access to the data has \nto be done by regulation so that the public can have input; finally, we \nrequire Congressional oversight of the implementation of the technology \nstandard.\n  I am pleased that this legislation incorporates these safeguards and \nadds others specific to the ``interoperable database system'' that \nfacilitates the sharing of law enforcement and intelligence information \nwith the State Department and INS.\n  The bill before us today limits re-dissemination of information \naccessed through the system; ensures that the information is used \nsolely to determine the admissibility or deportability of an alien to \nthe United States; requires accuracy, security and confidentiality; \nrequires protection of any privacy rights of individuals who are \nsubject of the information in the system; and requires the timely \nremoval and destruction of obsolete or inaccurate information.\n  Even with these provisions, Congress must keep a watchful eye on the \nimplementation of the provisions of this legislation. We need to be \nvigilant to make certain we are achieving the proper balance between \nthe need for national security and the need to protect the privacy of \nour citizens.\n  I am concerned about protecting the privacy of my constituents and \ncitizens across our country, and I thank the authors of this bill for \nworking with me to address these concerns.\n  I support this legislation because I believe that the security \nmeasures are well balanced against privacy concerns--and both security \nand privacy must be served.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I rise today to support H.R. 3525, \nthe Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2001. This \nbill includes important provisions that will enhance our overall \nsecurity. As a member from a border State, I am especially supportive \nof provisions that improve our ability to provide security on the \nNorthern border.\n  H.R. 3525 authorizes the addition of 200 Immigration and \nNaturalization Service agents on the border, raises their pay and \nimproves their retirement benefits, increases funding for their \ntraining, and authorizes money for them to improve and buy new \ntechnology. In Minnesota, some of our borders crossings, such as the \ncrossing at Crane Lake, are staffed only part-time in the summer and \neven then are not staffed around the clock. Some parts of the border \nare staffed via telephone and video. For example, a person wanting to \ncross into the United States from Canada arrives at a border station, \npicks up a telephone or video-phone, and calls Border Patrol personnel \nlocated elsewhere to announce his arrival. We must address this \nsecurity risk. We must address the vulnerability of our borders.\n  The situation on our northern border demands immediate attention but \nsimply putting new staff there is not enough. We must retain \nexperienced officials and provide adequate training to identify and \nintercept would-be terrorists. By raising the pay grade of INS border \npersonnel and improving their retirement benefits, we can ensure the \nretention of dedicated, experienced officials. By providing them \nadequate training and improving their ability to share information, we \ncan prevent the entry of people who intend to do this country harm.\n  The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2001 also \nhas provisions to help us determine who is coming to the US before they \narrive. It requires our consulates to transmit to INS officials \nelectronic versions of the visas they issue so that information is \navailable on the person prior to this arrival. It requires commercial \nflights and ships to provide manifests about each passenger prior to \ntheir arrival and it fills the gaps in the foreign student monitoring \nprogram to ensure we know who is coming to the United States to study \nat our universities before they get here. The more we can do to know \nwho is coming to the United States before they actually arrive, the \nmore secure we will be.\n  I would like to take a moment to address the issue of civil \nliberties. Many of us have concerns about the changes taking place in \nregard to our Federal agencies sharing intelligence information. Today, \nmore than ever, we must ensure that Federal law enforcement and other \nagencies have the ability to share information in a timely and \neffective manner. Nothing is more distressing than to think that the \nhorrible events of September 11 may have been prevented through better \ninteragency communication and organization. Yet, we must ensure that we \nvigorously monitor the effects structural changes now underway will \nhave on our civil liberties. We must continue to monitor implementation \nof laws that question the fundamental balance between our security and \nliberty.\n  We are doing that here today. The USA PATRIOT Act which we passed \nlast October required the FBI to provide the State Department and INS \nwith access to certain FBI databases. During the debate on that bill \nthere were serious concerns over how to determine what information \nthose agencies needed and how to protect that information. The bill \nbefore us requires the President to report to Congress on exactly what \ninformation the State Department and INS need, and to develop a \ncomprehensive information-sharing plan with adequate privacy \nprotections. I support this important provision and believe it is a \ngood example of what needs to be done in the future. We must review, \nand improve legislation if necessary, to ensure protection of our \nfundamental freedoms.\n  Colleagues, H.R. 3525 is a comprehensive bill which will strengthen \nthe security of our borders, secure our visa entry system and enhance \nour ability to deter potential terrorists. It is another important step \ntowards ensuring that we will never again witness the tragic event of \nSeptember 11. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I am pleased to rise today in support of \nthe Enhanced Border Security and Visa Reform Act of 2001.\n  I have worked with Senators Kyl and Feinstein, first on their Visa \nEntry Reform Act of 2001, and subsequently with them and Senators \nKennedy and Brownback on this legislation. These sponsors have worked \nfeverishly to bring this bipartisan bill to fruition and I have very \nmuch appreciated the opportunity to work with them in assembling a \nstrong and meaningful package to help secure our homeland.\n  The bottom line is, at this extraordinary time, in the wake of \nhorrific attacks from without against innocent lives within our \nborders, we must take every conceivable step with regard to those \nvariables we can control in securing our Nation. How can we do anything \nless when it has become so abundantly and tragically apparent that \nadmittance into this country cannot and must not be the ``X-Factor'' in \nprotecting our homeland?\n  Entry into this country is a privilege, not a right, and it is a \nprivilege that has clearly been violated by perpetrators of evil who \nwere well aware of inherent weaknesses in the system. Just look at the \nstory of Mohamed Atta, coming into Miami, he told the INS that he was \nreturning to the U.S. to continue flight training, despite the fact \nthat he presented them with a tourist visa, not the student required \nvisa for his purposes, and they let him in. INS has since said that \nAtta had filed months earlier to change his status from tourist to \nstudent so they let him in, despite long-standing policy that once you \nleave the country, you're considered to have abandoned your change of \nstatus request.\n  What this bill is about is stopping dangerous aliens from entering \nour country at their point-of-origin and their point of entry by giving \nthose Federal agencies charged with that responsibility the tools \nnecessary to do\n\n[[Page S2926]]\n\nthe job. Now, some say the tools we need are better technologies, some \nsay better information, some say better coordination. The beauty of \nthis bill is that it stands on all three legs, because I can tell you \nif there is one thing I learned from my experience in working on these \nissues on the House Foreign Affairs International Operations \nSubcommittee is that we are only going to get to the root of the \nproblem with a comprehensive approach.\n  This was clear from the aftermath of our investigation of the comings \nand goings of the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, \nthe radical Egyptian cleric Sheikh Rahman. We found that the Sheikh had \nentered and exited the country five times totally unimpeded, even after \nthe State Department formally revoked his visa and even after the INS \ngranted him permanent resident status. In fact, in March of 1992, the \nINS rescinded that status which was granted in Newark, NJ about a year \nbefore.\n  But then, unbelievably, the Sheikh requested asylum in a hearing \nbefore an immigration judge in the very same city, got a second \nhearing, and continued to remain in the country even after the bombing, \nwith the Justice Department rejecting holding Rahman in custody pending \nthe outcome of deportation proceedings and the asylum application, \nstating that ``in the absence of concrete evidence that Rahman is \nparticipating in or involved in planning acts of terrorism, the \nassumption of that burden, upon the U.S. government, is considered \nunwarranted.''\n  To address the trail of errors, I introduced legislation to modernize \nthe State Department's antiquated Microfiche lookout system, but as we \nhave painfully learned in the interim, such a system is only as good as \nthe information it can access. That is why we fought tooth and nail to \nrequire information sharing between the FBI and the State Department. \nIn 1994 Congress passed my legislation to give State Department \nofficials access to FBI criminal records for every visa application, \nwhether for immigrant or non-immigrant purposes. Addressing non-\nimmigrants who enter the U.S. using student visas was particularly \nimportant, as was demonstrated by the inexplicable errors by INS, and \nin the case of the bomber who entered the U.S. on a student visa before \ndropping out of school, remaining undetected for two years on the \nexpired visa, and driving a truckload of explosives into the World \nTrade Center in 1993. Unfortunately a revised provision limited this \naccess only for purposes of immigrant visas, dropping my requirement \nfor the non-immigrant visas initially used by all 19 of the September \n11 hijackers.\n  So I am pleased that the USA PATRIOT counterterrorism bill we passed \nlast year does require information sharing between the State Department \nand the FBI, but we can and must do more, we must also require \ninformation sharing among all agencies like the CIA, DEA, INS, and \nCustoms.\n  And that is what this bill does, along with my measure that is \nincluded to establish ``Terrorist Lookout Committees'' at every \nembassy, which are required to meet on a monthly basis and report on \ntheir knowledge of anyone who should be excluded from the U.S.\n  I am also pleased to have worked further with Senators Kennedy and \nKyl to include in the managers' amendment a provision increasing \naccountability by requiring the Terrorist Lookout Committees to report \nto the Secretary of State after each monthly meeting and with reports \nfrom the Secretary to Congress on a quarterly basis.\n  We ought to ensure that the person standing in front of the INS agent \nat the border is the same person who applied for that visa. It does no \ngood to do every background check in the world overseas, only to have \nsomeone else actually show up at our doorstep. The fact is, we have the \nso-called ``biometric technology'' available to close this gap, and I \nam pleased that my measure requiring the use of this biometric \ntechnology such as fingerprinting for visa applicants both abroad and \nat the border has been included, although not exclusively limited to \nfingerprinting. The information collected by the consular officer \nissuing the visa must then be electronically transmitted to the INS so \nthat the file is available to immigration inspectors at U.S. ports of \nentry before the alien's arrival.\n  In addition to these protections, the bill provides funding for an \nincrease in border patrol personnel and for training of those agents \nand other agency staffs at U.S. ports of entry and in our consular \noffices to improve the ability of these officers, our first line of \ndefense on our borders, to more easily identify and intercept would-be \nterrorists.\n  As the President has said, ``We're going to start asking a lot of \nquestions that heretofore have not been asked.'' By giving the Director \nof Homeland Security the responsibility of developing a centralized \n``lookout'' database for all of this information, along with \ninstituting tighter application and screening procedures and increased \noversight for student visas, we will close the loopholes and help bring \nall our Nation's resources to bear in securing our Nation.\n  This is a crucial bill in our war on terrorism and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I first want to commend the chairman of \nthe Immigration Subcommittee, Senator Kennedy, my colleague from \nMassachusetts, for his leadership on this bill. The Enhanced Border \nSecurity and Visa Entry Reform Act gives law enforcement and \nimmigration authorities greater access to the tools they need to \nimprove border security. The legislation enhances our ability to \nidentify terrorists and other individuals who should not be allowed to \nenter the Untied States and establishes new programs to ensure that \npeople whom we welcome as visitors live up to their responsibilities \nunder our immigration laws.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill contains two amendments that \nI authored: one extending training opportunities to Border Patrol \nagents and another requiring the Department of Justice to provide \nCongress information on aliens who fail to appear at removal hearings.\n  It is critical that every law enforcement agent who works on the \nborder understands and correctly applies our immigration laws. The \nEnhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act authorizes \nappropriations for such training for various law enforcement and \nimmigration personnel at the border. My first amendment ensures that \nthese training opportunities are extended to Border Patrol agents.\n  My second amendment requires the Department of Justice to report to \nthe Congress how many aliens arrested while entering the country \noutside ports of entry fail to show up for their removal hearings. The \namendment is the result of a hearing I held last November at the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n  At that hearing, members of the subcommittee heard from current and \npast employees of the U.S. Border Patrol who came forward to express \ntheir concerns with INS practices involving the release on \nrecognizance, that is on their promise to return, of people arrested \nwhile trying to gain illegal entry into the United States outside ports \nof entry. While the problems raised by the Border Patrol agents at the \nhearing would have been serious in normal circumstances, they carried \nparticular weight following the attacks of September 11.\n  What the agents told my subcommittee is that when people are arrested \nby the Border Patrol, at places other than ports of entry, most who \ndon't voluntarily return to their country of origin, usually Mexico or \nCanada, are given a notice to appear at a removal hearing. The Border \nPatrol initially decides whether the person should be detained, \nreleased on bond or released on his or her own recognizance while \nawaiting the hearing. The removal hearing can take several months to \noccur.\n  But detention decisions are not made by the Border Patrol alone. If \nthe Border Patrol decides to detain a person or set a bond to help \nassure that a person shows up at the hearing, the INS deportation \noffice can revise that decision and order the person released on a \nlower bond or on his or her own recognizance. It was revealed at the \nhearing that the Border Patrol and the INS simply release on \nrecognizance a large percentage of people who are arrested for illegal \nentry. That means people who get caught and are arrested at the border \nwhile attempting to enter the country illegally are nonetheless allowed \nto move at will in this country\n\n[[Page S2927]]\n\nwith no constraints other than a written instruction to appear at a \nhearing, the purpose of which is to remove them from the country.\n\n  This practice is absurd. And statistics from the Detroit Sector \nillustrate the extent of the absurdity. In fiscal year 2001, the \nDetroit Sector of the Border Patrol arrested slightly more than 2100 \npeople. A significant percentage of these people were arrested while \nactually attempting to enter the country illegally. Of those 2100 or \nso, slightly less than two-thirds were voluntarily returned to their \ncountry of origin and 773 were issued notices to appear at a removal \nhearing. Pending their removal hearing, 595 or more than 75 percent of \nthose issued notices to appear were released on their own recognizance. \nMany of these people were released without a criminal background check \nand some were not even able, or perhaps willing, to provide the Border \nPatrol with an address. We learned that people released on their own \nrecognizance who don't have an address are simply given a form to mail \nto the INS when they get an address so the agency can mail them a \nnotice of their hearing date. That is the extent of the follow-through \nby the INS.\n  So, how many of these 575 people actually showed up for their \nhearings? One former INS District Director and Border Patrol Chief has \nsaid that in one of his sectors he thought the percentage of persons \narrested outside a port of entry and released on their own recognizance \nwho don't show up for their hearing was 90 percent. When I asked the \nINS what the actual number was, the agency couldn't tell me. The INS \ndoesn't even keep this statistic.\n  Moreover, we learned at November's hearing that there was no \nrequirement that, before releasing them, the Border Patrol complete a \ncriminal background on people arrested for crossing the border \nillegally. I found that situation unjustifiable, and apparently so did \nthe INS when they were made aware of it. As a result of my November \nhearing, the INS issued a memorandum requiring that a criminal \nbackground check be conducted on all aliens arrested and released on \nbond or recognizance. That change is important but additional \nimprovements in both policy and practice are necessary.\n  The manner in which the Border Patrol and INS process aliens arrested \nbetween ports of entry remains unacceptable. That is why my second \namendment to the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act \nrequires the Department of Justice to provide the Congress an annual \nreport containing the number of aliens arrested outside ports of entry \nwho were served a notice to appear for a removal hearing and released \non recognizance and who failed to attend their removal hearing. It is \nmy hope that once the INS and the Congress comprehend the extent of the \nproblem, we will change the way we process aliens who are arrested at \nthe border while attempting to enter the country illegally.\n  We are an open and generous country and we welcome people from around \nthe world who share our commitment to hard work, common decency and \negalitarian values. But we are also a Nation of laws. And with the \nprivilege of living in America comes an obligation to follow the law. \nThe hearing I held at the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nhighlighted a situation where our immigration laws were simply not \nbeing followed. My amendment ensures that Congress is able to track \nwhether or not this situation improves.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, this is a good day for the security of the \nUnited States. The terrorist attacks that so changed our nation \noccurred over seven months ago. Seven months is too long to wait to \npass a measure as important, as potentially life-saving, as this one \nis.\n  After months of meetings about these issues, it is time to do what is \nright--to fix our immigration and via-processing systems so that \nterrorists cannot enter or remain in the United States in violation of \nour laws.\n  Congress took an important first step shortly after the terrorist \nattacks. The USCA PATRIOT Act, signed into law on October 26, 2001, \nprovided us with better tools to fight terrorism. Among other \nprovisions, that bill changed the definition of a terrorist--and, \ntherefore, changed who is inadmissible to the United States. It \nclarified that the FBI can share information on its terrorist watch-\nlist with other relevant Federal agencies. It provided the Attorney \nGeneral with additional limited authority to detain would-be terrorists \nfor a limited amount of time.\n  Our Nation, however, continues to face overwhelming infrastructure \nand personnel needs at our consular offices aboard, along both our \nsouthern and northern borders, in our immigration offices, and \nthroughout other Federal law and intelligence offices throughout the \nUnited States.\n  The Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act will provide for such \nresources, for such changes to existing law and infrastructure, the \nright way. As a result of this bill, resources will be efficiently \ntargeted--funds, for example, will not be sent to the INS without a \nclear directive that explains to the agency exactly what it is \nresponsible for producing. We have learned that it is only through \ndirect instructions that we will see loopholes closed in our \nimmigration system, our borders secured, intelligence shared \nappropriately and infrastructure modernized to achieve stated goals. If \nwe do not provide this infrastructure and guidance, I fear that other \nunthinkable incidents will occur.\n  Sadly, the real-life terrorist incidents that we suffered gave us too \nmany real-life reasons why this bill is so desperately needed.\n  In a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on \nTerrorism and Technology, Senator Feinstein and I heard some very \ntrenchant testimony from Mary Ryan, Assistant Secretary of State for \nConsular Affairs, about the gaping holes in the system. Secretary \nRyan's statement points to the dire need for better intelligence-\ngathering and significantly improved intelligence-sharing among all \nrelevant agencies. The Border Security Visa Reform Act will provide for \nbetter information-sharing among appropriate agencies.\n  Surprisingly to some, 18 of the 19 terrorists entered the country \nusing B1/B2 tourist visas. According to State Department statistics, 47 \nforeign-born individuals, including the 19 terrorists, have been \ncharged, have pled guilty, or have been convicted of involvement in \nterrorism over the past decade. All 47 had contact with an INS \ninspector. This, of course, points to the need for more inspectors, as \nthe Border Security bill authorizes, and for better informed inspectors \nthrough the sharing of information, which the bill will facilitate as \nwell.\n  Madam President, the Mohammed Atta case perhaps illustrates what is \nwrong with the system better than any other. Atta entered the country \non a B1/B2 visa that expired at the end of 2000. According to several \nsources, he was placed on the FBI's watch list 6 weeks before the \nterrorist attacks but his name was not entered into INS's system. The \nborder-security bill will help by facilitating the real-time sharing of \nthis type of information to relevant Federal law-enforcement and \nintelligence agencies, including all Federal agents who are responsible \nfor determining the admissibility of aliens to the U.S., and all \nofficers investigating and identifying aliens.\n  An entry-exit system at our Nation's ports of entry, using biometric \nidentifiers, linked to an interoperable data-sharing system, will go a \nlong way toward ensuring that people like Mohammed Atta are never \nallowed to enter the country. This system, coupled with the significant \nincrease in interior investigative personnel that this bill makes \npossible, will better enable authorities to find terrorists if they \ninfiltrate our borders. Information about Atta would have been tapped \nat a port of entry's entry-exit system. And, three other terrorists \namong the 19 who overstayed their visas would have been identified at \nports of entry as well.\n  Before his visa expired on December 2, 2000, Atta asked the INS to \nchange his status to that of ``student.'' After that expiration, and \neven without the information that showed his placement on a watch list, \nhe should not have been allowed to reenter the country. Yet, in January \n2001, he arrived back in Miami and, after he was questioned by the INS \nfor an hour, he was admitted back into the United States.\n  Another terrorist, Hani Hanjour, entered the country in December 2000 \non an F1 student visa to study English but he never attended class. The \nschool did\n\n[[Page S2928]]\n\nnot notify authorities that Hanjour never attended class. He overstayed \nhis visa and melted into obscurity in the United States. The Border \nSecurity and Visa Reform Act will address both of the loopholes that \nallowed Hanjour to stay in the country undetected by requiring strict \nreforms in our student-visa system and, again, by requiring that our \nentry-exit system employ biometric passports and other travel documents \nto protect against fraud and to find visa overstayers such as Hanjour.\n  Madam President, Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Feinstein, and I have \nworked hard to craft this bill. The staff of each of those members, \nEsther Olavarria, Lavita Strickland, and David Neal, should also be \npersonally commended. After Senators Kennedy and Brownback, and \nseparately Senator Feinstein and I, developed separate counter-\nterrorism bills, during a difficult time, while offices were closed on \nCapitol Hill, we all came together to produce the final product we now \nanticipate will be sent shortly to the President for signature.\n  This bipartisan, streamlined product, cosponsored by both the \nchairman and ranking Republican of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and \nthe ranking Republican of the Senate Appropriations Committee, will \nsignificantly enhance our ability to keep terrorists out of the United \nStates and find terrorists who are here.\n  Under the Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2001, at the \ndirection of the President, all Federal law-enforcement and \nintelligence communities, the Departments of Transportation, State, \nTreasury, and all other relevant agencies will develop and implement a \ncomprehensive, interoperable electronic data system for these \ngovernmental agencies to find and keep out terrorists. That system \nshould be up and running by October 26, 2003, 2 years after the signing \ninto law of the USA PATRIOT Act.\n\n  Under our bill, terrorists will be deprived of the ability to present \nfake or altered international documents in order to gain entrance, or \nstay here. Foreign nationals will be provided with new travel \ndocuments, using new technology that will include a person's \nfingerprint(s) or other form of ``biometric'' identification. These \ncards will be used by visitors upon entry into and exit from the United \nStates, and will alert authorities immediately if a visa has expired or \na red flag is raised by a Federal agency. Under our bill, any foreign \npassport or other travel document issued after October 26, 2004, will \nhave to contain a biometric component. The deadline for providing a way \nto compare biometric information presented at the border is also \nOctober 26, 2004.\n  Another provision of the bill will further strengthen the ability of \nthe U.S. Government to prevent terrorists from using our ``Visa Waiver \nProgram'' to enter the country. Under our bill, the 29 participating \nVisa Waiver nations will, in addition to the USA PATRIOT Act Visa \nWaiver reforms, be required to report stolen passport numbers to the \nState Department; otherwise, a nation is prohibited from participating \nin the program. In addition, our bill clarifies that the Attorney \nGeneral must enter stolen passport numbers into the interoperable data \nsystem within 72 hours of notification of loss or theft. Until that \nsystem is established, the Attorney General must enter that information \ninto any existing data system.\n  Another section of our bill will make a significant difference in our \nefforts to stop terrorists from ever entering our country. Passenger \nmanifests on all flights scheduled to come to the United States must be \nforwarded in real time, and then cleared, by the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service before the flight's arrival. Our bill also \nremoves a current U.S. requirement that all passengers on flights to \nthe United States be cleared by the INS within 45 minutes of arrival. \nClearly, in some circumstances, the INS will need more time to clear \nall prospective entrants to the U.S. These simple steps will give \nappropriate officials advance notice of foreigners coming into the \ncountry, particularly visitors or immigrants who pose a security threat \nto the United States.\n  The Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act will also improve our \nlax U.S. foreign student visa program, which has allowed numerous \nforeigners to enter the country without ever attending classes and, for \nthose who do attend class, with little or no oversight of such students \nby the Federal Government. Our bill will change that, and will require \nthat the State Department within 4 months, with the concurrence of the \nINS, maintain a computer database with all relevant information about \nforeign students.\n  America is a nation that welcomes international visitors--and should \nremain so. But terrorists have taken advantage of our system and its \nopenness. Now that we face new threats to our homeland, it is time we \nrestore some balance to our consular and immigration policies.\n  As former chairman and now ranking Republican of the Judiciary \nCommittee's Terrorism Subcommittee, I have long suggested, and strongly \nsupported, many of the antiterrorism and immigration initiatives now \nbeing advocated by Republicans and Democrats alike. In my sadness about \nthe overwhelming and tragic events that took thousands of precious \nlives, I am resolved to push forward on all fronts to fight against \nterrorism. That means delivering justice to those who are responsible \nfor the lives lost on September 11, and reorganizing the institutions \nof government so that the law-abiding can continue to live their lives \nin freedom.\n  Madam President, as I said, 7 months is too long a period of time for \nthe American people to wait for action on legislation that will make it \ntougher for terrorists to infiltrate the United States. I, therefore, \nurge my colleagues to act quickly to pass this bill. It really could \nmean the difference between a secure nation and one that continues to \nbe vulnerable to infiltration by those who mean us no good. Time is \nabsolutely of the essence.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, last September--5 days before the \nterrorist attacks on our Nation--President Vicente Fox delivered an \nhistoric address to this Congress on the importance of U.S.-Mexican \nrelations.\n  On both sides of the political aisle, and on both sides of the U.S.-\nMexican border, there was wide agreement that reforming our Nation's \noutdated immigration laws was an essential step in strengthening the \nrelationship between our two countries.\n  Then came September 11.\n  One of the important lessons we learned on that horrific day is that \nborder security is not simply a matter of immigration policy. It's a \nmatter of urgent national security.\n  In the months since September 11, we have seen that the INS and the \nFBI lack the tools and resources to effectively track foreign nationals \nin our country. This includes even individuals with known links to \nterrorist networks. Not only are we unable to expel people who have \nviolated their visas, very often we can't even find them.\n  Then last month, we were stunned to learn that the INS had just \nmailed confirmations of visa extensions to two of the terrorist \nhijackers responsible for the September 11 attacks.\n  I am proud to be one of the 61 sponsors of the bipartisan Enhanced \nBorder Security and Visa Entry Reform Act, and I urge my colleagues to \nvote for it.\n  This act will strengthen America's border security and improve our \nability to track visa holders--including foreign students.\n  It gives law enforcement agencies new tools and technology to share \ncritical information, and to identify and intercept visitors who \nthreaten our national security.\n  It also increases staffing and training for border security officers.\n  I want to thank Senator Kennedy, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nImmigration, and Senator Feinstein for their leadership. Without their \nhard work and determined persistence, we would not be here today.\n  I also thank Senator Byrd for his efforts to improve this bill--and \nfor his invaluable leadership on the larger challenge of strengthening \nAmerica's homeland security in general.\n  We all know that authorizing legislation is important. But it takes \nresources to turn policies into workable laws. No one in Washington has \nfought harder to protect America from future terrorist attacks than \nRobert C. Byrd. I look forward to working with him to ensure that this \nand other homeland security measures are given the resources they need \nto work.\n  We cannot strengthen America's homeland security on the cheap, and\n\n[[Page S2929]]\n\nwe should not try. We need to do this right.\n  Just before President Fox's visit last September, Congressman \nGephardt and I outlined principles for comprehensive immigration \nreform. Enhanced border security is one of those principles.\n  Unfortunately, another of our principles--extension of section 245(i) \nof the immigration code--is not included in this bill.\n  Section 245(i) would allow immigrants who are in this country, who \nhave applied to become permanent residents and who are contributing to \nour society, to remain in this country while they wait for their \n``green card.''\n  Many of these immigrants are married to Americans, and have children \nwho were born in this country. Without Section 245(i), many of them \nface the impossible choice of leaving their families for up to 10 \nyears, taking their families back with them to a country they may have \nfled to escape poverty or terror, or breaking the law, thus forgoing \nthe chance to ever become a lawful permanent resident.\n  The Senate voted to extend section 245(i) last year, the same week \nPresident Fox spoke to Congress.\n  We had hoped and expected that the House would quickly do the same. \nInstead, it delayed for six months. By the time it finally acted, key \ndeadlines contained in the bill had become unworkable.\n  I remain strongly committed to a meaningful 245(i) extension--one \nthat gives long-time, tax-paying residents a genuine opportunity to \nremain in this country--with their families--while they wait to become \npermanent legal residents.\n  My colleagues and I look forward to working with Senators Lott, Hagel \nand Brownback and others, on a bipartisan basis, to send President Bush \na 245(i) extension bill with realistic deadlines.\n  America needs an immigration system that is pro-family, pro-business \nand fair. Together, we can create such a system--one that sacrifices \nneither our security nor our ideals.\n  The new border security bill on which we are about to vote, and a \nmeaningful extension of 245(i), are essential parts of such a system.\n  We also look forward to working with our Republican colleagues, and \nwith the administration, to restructure and strengthen the INS, end the \nbacklogs, provide meaningful access to earned legalization, and reunite \nfamilies. We look forward to creating a new and better temporary worker \nprogram that treats workers with the respect they deserve and provides \nbusinesses with the employees they need.\n  Within hours after the twin towers collapsed, we heard some people \nsay that America should close its doors to immigrants. Some people even \nsaid we should force out immigrants who are already here, working and \ncontributing to our society.\n  People who say such things need to understand that our enemy is not \nimmigrants, it is intolerance and hatred. America is strong not in \nspite of our diversity, but because of our diversity.\n  By passing this bill today, we are strengthening not only our border \nsecurity, but our basic American values. It is the right thing to do, \nand I thank all of our colleagues who helped get us to this point.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as we are getting this matter wrapped \nup, I wish to recognize four key staff members who really helped \nshepherd this bill through. This is important safety legislation.\n  I, first, recognize Senator Kennedy's lead staff on this, Esther \nOlavarria, who is a humble, diligent servant of the State and who does \na wonderful job on these sorts of issues. She worked closely with my \nstaff member, David Neal, who is relatively new to the process but has \ndiligently worked to shepherd this legislation on through.\n  Also, for Senator Feinstein and for Senator Kyl, two wonderful staff \nmembers who helped make the core nucleus in negotiating this through; \nElizabeth Maier and LeVita Strickland are excellent people.\n  I think at the end of the day when we look to strengthen the borders \nof this country to protect our people, these four great citizens really \ndedicated a lot of time and a lot of soul to be able to get this \nthrough. I want to note their tremendous activity in this regard.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before we proceed to this series of votes, I \nwould like to make a few remarks concerning the bill.\n  I believe there is a certain amount of time on the bill. Is there?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is time under the control of Senators \nKennedy and Brownback.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to give whatever \ntime we have remaining to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in my long career of serving in various and \nsundry legislative branches, I have from time to time been awarded the \nhonor of being the ``legislator of the year'' in connection with \nsomething. Let me say that as one who has served now in my 50th year in \nCongress this year, and having served as majority leader in this body \nduring the years 1977, 1978, 1979, and 1980, and again during the years \n1987 and 1988, and also having served as minority leader over a period \nof 6 years, and having served in the leadership in the Senate for 22 \nyears, including my stint as majority whip and my stint as secretary of \nthe Democratic Conference, I have had occasion to note some very \nsuccessful and outstanding legislators. I would include among the most \noutstanding of those legislators Senator Kennedy.\n  The late Senator Henry Jackson was another one of the outstanding \nlegislators with whom I served. He was responsible for bringing a great \ndeal of legislation to the floor dealing with energy, with the \nenvironment, and on various and sundry other matters. He was an \noutstanding legislator.\n  Senator Kennedy is one who has proved to be an outstanding chairman \nof the committee. I think Senators will agree with me in observing that \nwhen Senator Kennedy comes to the floor with a bill, especially if it \nis a bill that has been reported by his committee, a committee which he \nchairs, or by a committee on which he sits, he is always prepared. He \nhas done his homework, and he makes a very forceful expression. He \nmakes a very forceful expression of support of the managers of the \namendment thereon. He is a formidable opponent of one who opposes a \nbill. Senator Kennedy brings to the floor a formidable opponent of any \nSenators who offer amendments in opposition thereto. He is a well-\nrounded legislator in that his experience, and his knowledge of the \nsubject matter of the legislation which he promotes, is, indeed, \nremarkable. As far as I am concerned, he is an outstanding legislator \nin the 50 years in which I have served in Congress.\n  Senator Kennedy and I have not always been together on matters. We \nhave been opponents in some instances. We have not necessarily, in the \nearly days, held each other in terms of endearment.\n  But we have passed through those years and in the subsequent years--\nespecially in the years when I served as majority leader, and the first \ntime I served as majority leader in 1977, during those years, and in \nsubsequent years, Senator Kennedy has been one of my most supportive \nfriends and fellow Senators. And I have counted his support as \ninvaluable, particularly when I was majority leader. As the majority \nleader or the majority whip, sometimes one looks around and wonders \nwhere the troops are. And there are times when we look back over our \nshoulders and find that the troops are not necessarily there.\n\n  But Senator Kennedy was always very supportive of me. There were \ntimes when he perhaps could not vote with me or could not exactly \nsupport a particular amendment of mine, but he was always most \ncourteous and most considerate to me.\n  As we close the debate on this bill, I want to say once more, as I \nhave said before, that Senator Kennedy is a Senator who could well have \ngraced the Senate at any moment of the Senate's long history, dating \nback to March 4, 1789. He would have been a worthy protagonist or \nantagonist, whatever the case might have been. I have learned to \nrespect him and appreciate him as the years have come and gone. I have \nlearned to appreciate him and respect him more and more.\n  So, Mr. President, I take this occasion to thank Senator Kennedy for \nhis\n\n[[Page S2930]]\n\ncourtesies during this debate. He invited me to testify before his \nImmigration Subcommittee last week. He visited my office several times \nover the last 4 months to listen to my concerns. He has always been \nvery gracious to me, and I thank him for that.\n  I thank the other proponents of this legislation--Senator Brownback, \nSenator Kyl, and Senator Feinstein. They have all been very fine \nauthors of amendments. In particular, I think with respect to this \nbill, they have done an excellent job. They have been very kind to me, \nand they have been considerate. I want to take this occasion to thank \nthem for their work on the bill. No one could be more patriotic than \nthese Senators. No one could pay more attention to their duties in the \nSenate, their duties to their constituents whom they represent.\n  This is a bill that may still have some flaws in it. No piece of \nlegislation, I would say, ever passes the Senate that is perfect, but \nthey certainly have done their best in trying to improve it as we have \ngone along. I thank them all for the courtesies they have extended to \nme and the support they have expressed for these amendments I have \noffered.\n  So let me say, again, that with one of these Senators I have served \nsince November 1962. And Senator Kennedy well understands my interest \nin the institution of the Senate. To me, that is why I am here today, \nbecause of my interest in this institution and the Constitution. That \nis why I am here. I did not have to run last time to put bread and \nbutter on my table. I could have retired and probably earned a bigger \ncheck in retirement. Since I have been paying into the retirement fund \nnow for 50 years, this year, I could probably have earned a bigger \ncheck in retirement than I will have earned as a Senator.\n  But I am here to defend this institution. That is the only reason I \nam here. That is the only reason. I could have been better off if I had \nretired. Perhaps somebody would have had pity on me and asked me to \nserve on some board, and I could have raked in a little additional \nmoney. But that is neither here nor there.\n  I chose to serve here. This has been my career. I have loved this \nSenate from the first day I walked into it. And so I am proud to serve \nin it. The only reason I am here is that I believe in the Senate. I am \nnot here because of any particular legislation. As a matter of fact, I \nam here because I love the Senate and want to do what I can to preserve \nthe Senate prerogatives.\n  I believe there are three separate and distinct coordinate branches \nof Government. I believe that the legislative branch is the branch of \nthe people. I think it is the people's branch. I believe that the \nSenate is the premier institution, the premier legislative \ninstitution--the U.S. Senate--in the world today. And there have been \nmany senates. Perhaps the next greatest of all was the senate of the \nRoman people.\n  I am proud the people of West Virginia have seen fit to send me here, \nand send me back from time to time, and overlooked the warts and all in \nmy makeup, politically and otherwise. But I reverence the Senate, honor \nit, and respect all Members of the body. It doesn't make a difference \nwhether they are Republicans or Democrats or Independents; I respect \nthem. We may not agree, but they are Senators. They are my equal any \nday. They are entitled to their viewpoint as much as I am entitled to \nmine.\n  So having said that, let me say, far too often Members of this body \nare willing to give up their right to debate and to amend legislation. \nI am pleased that at least some public debate has been generated on \nthis bill and that the right of Senators to offer amendments was \nrespected. I think the end product is a better piece of legislation \nthan it was heretofore.\n  With regard to the amendment I offered on the importation of goods, \nespecially Chinese goods, that are made using forced labor, I, of \ncourse, have determined not to press to include that amendment in this \nbill. But I continue to believe that the Congress needs to pass \nlegislation to prevent goods made in foreign prisons and detention \ncamps from crossing our borders. We also have a responsibility to \nprotect our businesses from this unfair and reprehensible trade \npractice. I expect to raise the issue again at some point on some bill \nbecause much more needs to be done to discourage this blatant violation \nof our trade laws.\n  Senators should also be aware that we still do not have a cost \nestimate of this bill from the Congressional Budget Office. The INS \nestimates that the bill will cost $1 billion in the first year and $3.2 \nbillion over 3 years, but those estimates likely underestimate the true \ncosts. It is very well to authorize these funds--and I intend to vote \nfor the bill--but this bill will require the appropriation of funds and \nthe support of its proponents, and the support of the administration, \nfor those appropriations if its provisions are to be implemented.\n  Again, I thank Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Feinstein, and Kyl for \ntheir interest in improving our Nation's border defenses. I thank them \nand I love them. I salute them for the work they have done in this \nrespect. I hope we can maintain the bipartisan support we have seen on \nthis bill when it comes time to appropriate the funds necessary to \nimplement these provisions.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. \nHe is my friend. I know I really can speak for all Members in saying he \nis the defender of all of the constitutional prerogatives of this great \ninstitution. We have heard him speak this evening. We have listened to \nthat clear and compelling voice tonight, as we have heard it in \ndefending the institution at other times.\n  I am wondering if I could ask a special favor of the Senator. He has \nbeen extremely kind. But what we have not heard tonight is the poem \nabout the ambulance in the valley. I know it is late in the evening, \nbut could the Senator--if we were to yield the Senator a few more \nminutes--recite that poem? Or would he prefer to wait for another time? \nIf he would prefer not to, I would certainly understand.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator honors me by \ncalling on me to repeat the lines of the poem by Joseph Malins titled \n``A Fence or an Ambulance.'' I am not sure I am really up to it at this \npoint in the day. I am not sure I can do it on this short notice, but I \nwill certainly try. It will not be the first time I have failed on a \npoem. Occasionally I do fail.\n  Let me think for a minute. Perhaps I could do that.\n\n       ``Twas a dangerous cliff, as they freely confessed,\n       Though to walk near its crest was so pleasant;\n     But over its terrible edge there had slipped\n       A duke and fall many a peasant.\n       So the people said something would have to be done,\n       But their projects did not at all tally;\n     Some said, ``Put a fence around the edge of the cliff,''\n       Some, ``An ambulance down in the valley.''\n     But the cry for the ambulance carried the day,\n       For it spread through the neighboring city;\n       A fence may be useful or not, it is true,\n       But each heart became brimful of pity\n     For those who slipped over that dangerous cliff;\n       And the dwellers in highway and alley\n     Gave pounds or gave pence, not to put up a fence,\n       But an ambulance down in the valley.\n     ``For the cliff is all right, if you're careful,'' they said,\n       ``And, if folks even slip and are dropping,\n     It isn't the slipping that hurts them so much,\n       As the shock down below when they're stopping.''\n     So day after day, as these mishaps occurred,\n       Quick forth would these rescuers sally\n     To pick up the victims who fell off the cliff,\n       With their ambulance down in the valley.\n       Then an old sage remarked: ``It's a marvel to me\n       That people give far more attention\n     To repairing results than to stopping the cause,\n       When they'd much better aim at prevention.\n     Let us stop at its source all this mischief,'' cried he,\n       ``Come, neighbors and friends, let us rally;\n     If the cliff we will fence we might almost dispense\n       With the ambulance down in the valley.''\n       ``Oh, he's a fanatic,'' the others rejoined,\n       ``Dispense with the ambulance? Never!\n     He'd dispense with all charities, too, if he could;\n       No! No! We'll support them forever.\n     Aren't we picking up folks just as fast as they fall?\n       And shall this man dictate to us? Shall he?\n     Why should people of sense stop to put up a fence,\n\n[[Page S2931]]\n\n       While the ambulance works down in the valley?''\n     But a sensible few, who are practical too,\n       Will not bear with such nonsense much longer;\n     They believe that prevention is better than cure,\n       And their party will soon be the stronger.\n     Encourage them then, with your purse, voice, and pen,\n       And while other philanthropists dally,\n     They will scorn all pretense and put up a stout fence\n       On the cliff that hangs over the valley.\n     Better guide well the young than reclaim them when old,\n       For the voice of true wisdom is calling,\n     ``To rescue the fallen is good, but 'tis best\n       To prevent other people from falling.''\n     Better close up the source of temptation and crime\n       Than deliver from dungeon or galley;\n     Better put a strong fence round the top of the cliff\n       Than an ambulance down in the valley.''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Hear. Hear. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, it is my understanding now that we will proceed to \nthree votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The order of the votes will be the two amendments of the \nSenator from West Virginia in the order in which they were offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that there be no intervening \nbusiness in between the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I further ask unanimous consent that after the first \nvote, the remaining two votes be 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So that would include final passage; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nfinal passage of H.R. 3525, the Senate then proceed to executive \nsession to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 761, Legrome \nD. Davis to be United States District Judge; that Senator Specter be \nrecognized for up to 5 minutes, and the Senate then vote on the \nnomination; the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that any \nstatements thereon be printed at the appropriate place in the Record, \nand the Senate return to legislative session, without any intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to ask for the \nyeas and nays on that nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address \nthe body for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I note a word of thanks to Senator \nByrd. He has dealt with many of us for some period of time on this \nparticular issue in some contentious situations. He has dealt with us \nprivately, publicly, and in other forums. At the end of the day, we do \ncome out with a better piece of legislation. For that I thank the \nSenator. At the time, going through it, I was not quite as thankful for \nthat.\n  He has done a service to the country. And at the end of the day, we \nwill have a better piece of legislation. I thank my colleagues, \nSenators Kennedy, Kyl, and Feinstein. Together we crafted a good piece \nof legislation. I am thankful to be a part of it. I think it will be a \nvery positive move for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3161\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 3161.

DAVIS, OF PENNSYLVANIA TO BE UNITED STATES \n        DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will go \ninto executive session.\n  The nomination will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Legrome D. Davis, of \nPennsylvania, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the confirmation of Judge Legrome Davis \nto the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania will be \nthe 17th judge confirmed since the beginning of this session. Under \nDemocratic leadership, in less than 4 months the Senate has confirmed \nas many judges as were confirmed in all 12 months of the 1996 session \nunder Republican leadership. In fact, included among the 17 judges whom \nwe will have confirmed since January this year are 2 judges to our \nCourts of Appeals. That stands in sharp contrast to the 1996 session in \nwhich the Republican majority did not allow even a single Court of \nAppeals nominee to be confirmed--not one. I submit that we have already \ndone better in less than 4 months than our predecessors and critics did \nduring the entire 12 months of the 1996 session.\n  The confirmation of Judge Davis today illustrates the progress being \nmade under Democratic leadership and the fair and expeditious way in \nwhich we have considered nominees. Judge Legrome Davis was first \nnominated to the position of U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania by President Clinton on July 30, 1998. The \nRepublican-controlled Senate took no action on his nomination and it \nwas returned to the President at the end of 1998. On January 26, 1999, \nPresident Clinton renominated Judge Davis for the same vacancy. The \nSenate again failed to hold a hearing for Judge Davis and his \nnomination was returned to the President on December 15, 2000, after 2 \nmore years of inaction in a second full Congress while the Senate was \ncontrolled by a Republican majority. Under Republican leadership, Judge \nDavis' nomination languished before the Committee for 868 days without \na hearing. Unfortunately, Judge Davis was subjected to the kind of \ninappropriate partisan rancor that befell so many other nominees to the \ndistrict courts in Pennsylvania and to the Third Circuit during the \nyears Republicans controlled the Senate. I want to note emphatically, \nhowever, that I know personally that the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Specter, supported Judge Davis's nomination and \nworked hard to get him a hearing and a vote. The lack of Senate action \non Judge Davis's initial nominations are in no way attributable to a \nlack of support from the senior Senator from Pennsylvania. Far from it. \nIn fact, I give Senator Specter credit for getting President Bush to \nrenominate Judge Davis earlier this year and want to commend him \npublicly for all he has done to support this nomination from the \noutset.\n  This year we have moved expeditiously to consider Judge Davis. Judge \nDavis was nominated by President Bush in late January 2002, the \nCommittee received his ABA peer review on March 12, he participated in \na confirmation hearing the next week on March 19, and he received a \nunanimous vote by the Judiciary Committee on April 11--less than 3 \nmonths after his nomination, and less than 1 month after his paperwork \nwas completed. The saga of Judge Davis recalls for us so many nominees \nfrom the period of January 1995 through July 10, 2001, who never \nreceived a hearing or a vote and who were the subject of secret \nanonymous holds by Republicans for reasons that were never explained.\n  At Judge Davis' recent confirmation hearing Senator Santorum \ntestified that Judge Davis did not get a hearing after President \nClinton nominated him because local Democrats objected. I was the \nranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee during those years and \nnever heard that before. My understanding at the time, from July 1998 \nuntil the end of 2000, was that Judge Legrome Davis would have had the \nsupport of every Democrat on the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate. \nHe was not included in the May 2000 hearing for a few other \nPennsylvania nominees. His not being included was a part of the \ndiscussion on the record, a discussion about unwillingness of some to \nact on nominees in a presidential election year although Senator \nSpecter emphasized his personal commitment to supporting Judge Davis. \nSenator Hatch never indicated to me that he thought Democratic \nopposition was the reason he could not include Judge Legrome Davis in a \nhearing over those 3 years.\n\n  Judge Davis has served as a Judge on the Court of Common Pleas in the \nFirst Judicial District in Pennsylvania for more than 13 years. Prior \nto serving as a judge, he had an extensive career litigating criminal \ncases in State courts. He has participated in numerous task forces and \na variety of pro bono projects aimed to improve the judicial system. He \nis well-qualified and has broad bipartisan support. I know that Judge \nDavis and his family are glad that this day has finally arrived. I \nexpect that the people served by the Eastern District of Pennsylvania \nwill be happy with the Senate's action today.\n  Judge Davis will be the 45th judicial nominee to be confirmed since \nlast July when the Senate Judiciary Committee reorganized after the \nSenate majority changed. With today's vote on Judge Davis, the Senate \nwill confirm its 45th judicial nominee in the less\n\n[[Page S2933]]\n\nthan 10 months since I became Chairman this past summer. The Senate has \nconfirmed more judges in the last 10 months than were confirmed in 4 \nout of 6 full years under Republican leadership. The number of judicial \nconfirmations over these past 10 months 45 exceeds the number confirmed \nduring all 12 months of 2000, 1999, 1997 and 1996.\n  As our action today demonstrates, again, we are moving at a fast pace \nto fill judicial vacancies with nominees who have strong bipartisan \nsupport. Those partisan critics who assert that our rate of confirming \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees is bad are ignoring the facts. They \nwillfully confuse the actual ``pace,'' or rate, of confirmation with \nthe misleading percentages they like to construct. The facts are that \nlooking at the number of confirmations in similar time periods shows \nthat we are confirming President Bush's nominees at a faster pace than \nthe nominees of prior presidents, including those who worked closely \nwith a Senate majority of the same political party.\n  The rate of confirmation in the past 10 months actually exceeds the \nrates of confirmation in the past three presidencies. For example, in \nthe first 15 months of the Clinton administration, 46 judicial nominees \nwere confirmed, a pace on average of 3.1 per month. In the first 15 \nmonths of the first Bush administration, 27 judges were confirmed at a \npace of 1.8 judges per month. Likewise, in President Reagan's first 15 \nmonths in office, 54 judges were confirmed, a pace of 3.6 per month. In \nless than 10 months since the shift to a Democratic majority in the \nSenate in less than two thirds of the time period--President George W. \nBush's judicial nominees have been confirmed at a rate of more than 4.5 \njudges per month, a faster pace than for any of the past 3 Presidents.\n  During the 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control of the Senate, judicial \nconfirmations averaged 38 per year a pace of consideration and \nconfirmation that we have already exceeded under Democratic leadership \nover these past 10 months in spite of all of the challenges facing \nCongress and the Nation during this period and all of the obstacles \nRepublicans have placed in our path. At the end of today, we have \nconfirmed 45 judicial nominees in just 10 months. This is almost twice \nas many confirmations as George W. Bush's father had over a longer \nperiod--27 nominees in 15--months than the period we have been in the \nmajority in the Senate.\n\n  The Republican critics typically compare apples to oranges to \nmischaracterize the achievements of the last 10 months. They complain \nthat we have not done 24 months of work in the less than 10 months we \nhave been in the majority. That is an unfair complaint. A fair \nexamination of the rate of confirmation shows that Democrats are \nworking harder and faster on judicial nominees, confirming judges at a \nfaster pace than the rates of the past 20 years. The double standards \nasserted by Republican critics are just plain wrong and unfair, but \nthat does not seem to matter to Republicans intent on criticizing and \nbelittling every achievement of the Senate under a Democratic majority. \nI would like to commend the members of the Judiciary Committee and our \nMajority Leader and Assistant Majority Leader for all of their hard \nwork in getting us to this point. The confirmation of the 45th judge in \nless than 10 months, especially these last 10 months, in spite of the \nunfair and personal criticism to which they have each been subjected, \nis an extraordinary achievement and a real example of Senators acting \nin a bipartisan way even when the other side makes it as difficult as \npossible.\n  Republicans have been imposing a double standard on circuit court \nvacancies as well. The Republican attack is based on the unfounded \nnotion that the Senate has not kept up with attrition on the Courts of \nAppeals. Well, the Democratic majority in the Senate has more than kept \nup with attrition, and we have been acting to close the vacancies gap \non the Courts of Appeals that more than doubled under the Republican \nmajority.\n  Just this week, the Senate confirmed Judge Terrence O'Brien to the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit by a vote of 98 to \nzero. His confirmation was the eighth circuit court nominee to be \nconfirmed in the almost 10 months since I became Chairman this past \nsummer. Just today, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted on the 11th \nCourt of Appeals nominee to come before the Committee in less than 10 \nmonths. Thus, another Court of Appeals nominee is already on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar and being scheduled for floor action.\n  In a little less than 10 months since the change in majority, the \nSenate has confirmed 8 judges to the Courts of Appeals and held \nhearings on 3 others. In contrast, the Republican-controlled majority \naveraged only 7 confirmations to the Courts of Appeals per year. Seven. \nIn the less than 10 months the Democrats have been in the majority, we \nhave already exceeded the annual number of Court of Appeals judges \nconfirmed by our predecessors. The Senate in the last 10 months has \nconfirmed as many Court of Appeals judges as were confirmed in all of \n2000 and more than were confirmed in 1997 or 1999, and 8 more than the \nzero from 1996. Another way to put it is that within the last 10 \nmonths, the Democratic majority in the Senate has confirmed as many \nCourt of Appeals judges as were confirmed in the 2000 and 1996 sessions \ncombined and confirmed more Court of Appeals judges than were confirmed \nin the 1999 and 1996 sessions combined or in the 1997 and 1996 sessions \ncombined.\n  The Republican majority assumed control of judicial confirmations in \nJanuary 1995 and did not allow the Judiciary Committee to be \nreorganized after the shift in majority last summer until July 10, \n2001. During that period from 1995 through July 10, 2001, vacancies on \nthe Courts of Appeals increased from 16 to 33, more than doubling.\n  When I became chairman of a Committee to which Members were finally \nassigned on July 10, we began with 33 Courts of Appeals vacancies. That \nis what I inherited. Since the shift in majority last summer, 5 \nadditional vacancies have arisen on the Courts of Appeals around the \ncountry. With this week's confirmation of Judge O'Brien, we have \nreduced the number of circuit court vacancies to 30. That is, we have \nkept up with attrition by confirming 5 Court of Appeals judges and then \nacted to lower the number of vacancies by already confirming 3 \nadditional judges. Those are the facts.\n  Since our Republican critics are so fond of using percentages, I will \nsay that we will have now reduced the vacancies on the Courts of \nAppeals by almost 10 percent in the last 10 months. In other words, by \nconfirming 3 more nominees than the 5 required to keep up with the pace \nof attrition, we have not just matched the rate of attrition, but \nsurpassed it by 60 percent. I add this facetiously to show how \nridiculous their use of percentages is in this setting.\n  Rather than the 38 vacancies that would exist if we were making no \nprogress, as some have asserted, there are now 30 vacancies--that is \nmore than keeping up with the attrition on the Circuit Courts. \nRepublican critics unfairly seek to attribute to the Democratic \nmajority the lack of action by the Republican majority before the \nhistoric change last summer.\n  While the Republican Senate majority increased vacancies on the \nCourts of Appeals by over 100 percent, it has taken the Democratic \nmajority less than 10 months to reverse that trend, keep up with \nextraordinary turnover and, in addition, reduce circuit court vacancies \noverall. This is progress. Rather than having the circuit vacancy \nnumbers skyrocketing, as they did overall during the prior 6\\1/2\\ \nyears--more than doubling from 16 to 33--the Democratic-led Senate has \nreversed that trend. The vacancies numbers are moving in the right \ndirection--down.\n  It is not possible to repair the damage caused by longstanding \nvacancies in several circuits overnight, but we are improving the \nconditions in the 5th, 10th and 8th Circuits, in particular. The \nconfirmation of Judge O'Brien this week made the second judge confirmed \nto the 10th Circuit in the last 4 months. Next week we will proceed \nwith a nominee to the 6th Circuit.\n  Overall, in little less than 10 months, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has held 16 hearings involving 55 judicial nominations. That \nis more hearings on judges than the Republican majority held in any \nyear of its control of the Senate. In contrast, one-sixth of President \nClinton's judicial nominees--more than 50--never got a Committee \nhearing and Committee vote from the Republican majority, which \nperpetuated\n\n[[Page S2934]]\n\nlongstanding vacancies into this year. Vacancies continue to exist on \nthe Courts of Appeals in large part because a Republican majority was \nnot willing to hold hearings or vote on more than half--56 percent--of \nPresident Clinton's Court of Appeals nominees in 1999 and 2000, and was \nnot willing to confirm a single judge to the Courts of Appeals during \nthe entire 1996 session.\n  Despite the new-found concern from across the aisle about the number \nof vacancies on the circuit courts, no nominations hearings were held \nwhile the Republicans controlled the Senate in the 107th Congress last \nyear. No judges were confirmed during that time from among the many \nqualified circuit court nominees received by the Senate on January 3, \n2001, or from among the nominations received by the Senate on May 9, \n2001.\n  The Democratic leadership acted promptly to address the number of \ncircuit and district vacancies that had been allowed to grow when the \nSenate was in Republican control. The Judiciary Committee noticed the \nfirst hearing on judicial nominations within 10 minutes of the \nreorganization of the Senate, and held that hearing on the day after \nthe Committee was assigned new members.\n  That initial hearing included a Court of Appeals nominee on whom the \nRepublican majority had refused to hold a hearing the year before. We \nheld unprecedented hearings for judicial nominees during the August \nrecess. Those hearings included a Court of Appeals nominee who had been \na Republican staff member of the Senate. We proceeded with a hearing \nthe day after the first anthrax letter arrived at the Senate. That \nhearing included a Court of Appeals nominee. In a little less than 10 \ntumultuous months, the Senate Judiciary Committee has held 16 hearings \ninvolving 55 judicial nominations--including 11 circuit court \nnominees--and we are planning to hold another hearing next week for \nhalf a dozen more nominees, including another Court of Appeals nominee. \nThat is more hearings on judges than the Republican majority held in \nany year of its control of the Senate. The Republican majority never \nheld 16 judicial confirmation hearings in 12 months and we have to do \nso in less than 10 months.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee is holding regular hearings on \njudicial nominees and giving nominees a vote in Committee, in contrast \nto the practice of anonymous holds and other obstructionist tactics \nemployed by some during the period of Republican control. The \nDemocratic majority has reformed the process and practices used in the \npast to deny Committee consideration of judicial nominees. We have \nmoved away from the anonymous holds that so dominated the process from \n1996 through 2000. We have made home State Senators' blue slips public \nfor the first time.\n  I do not mean by my comments to appear critical of Senator Hatch. \nMany times during the 6\\1/2\\ years he chaired the Judiciary Committee, \nI observed that, were the matter left up to us, we would have made more \nprogress on more judicial nominees. I thanked him during those years \nfor his efforts. I know that he would have liked to have been able to \ndo more and not have to leave so many vacancies and so many nominees \nwithout action.\n  I hope to hold additional hearings and make additional progress on \njudicial nominees. In our efforts to address the number of vacancies on \nthe circuit and district courts we inherited from the Republicans, the \nCommittee has focused on consensus nominees for all Senators. In order \nto respond to what Vice President Cheney and Senator Hatch now call a \nvacancy crisis, the Committee has focused on consensus nominees. This \nwill help end the crisis caused by Republican delay and obstruction by \nconfirming as many of the President's judicial nominees as quickly as \npossible.\n  Most Senators understand that the more controversial nominees require \ngreater review. This process of careful review is part of our \ndemocratic process. It is a critical part of the checks and balances of \nour system of government that does not give the power to make lifetime \nappointments to one person alone to remake the courts along narrow \nideological lines, to pack the courts with judges whose views are \noutside of the mainstream of legal thought, and whose decisions would \nfurther divide our nation.\n  The Committee continues to try to accommodate Senators from both \nsides of the aisle. The Court of Appeals nominees included at hearings \nso far this year have been at the request of Senator Grassley, Senator \nLott, Senator Specter, Senator Enzi and Senator Smith from New \nHampshire--five Republican Senators who each sought a prompt hearing on \na Court of Appeals nominee who was not among those initially sent to \nthe Senate in May 2001. Next week's hearing will continue that effort \nand include a Court of Appeals nominee from Tennessee at the request of \nSenator Thompson.\n  Each of the 45 nominees confirmed by the Senate has received the \nunanimous, bipartisan backing of the Committee. Only Judge Roger \nGregory has had a single vote cast against his confirmation in all of \nthe Senate votes on all of these nominees. The confirmation of Judge \nDavis is the 45th judicial nominee to be confirmed since I became \nChairman last July. Like Judge Roger Gregory, this is the confirmation \nof a qualified nominee who could not get a hearing when the Republican \nmajority controlled the Senate. I had hoped that at the end of the day, \njustice would be done. I am glad that this is that day, and that at the \nend of today Judge Davis will also have been considered and confirmed. \nThese consensus nominees could and should have been acted upon before \nthis year. I thank Judge Davis for his commitment and patience, and \ncongratulate him and his family on this important day.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise in support of the confirmation of \nJudge Legrome Davis to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof Pennsylvania.\n  Judge Davis' nomination is yet another example of President Bush's \nbipartisan approach to judicial nominations. This is the second time, \nJudge Roger Gregory being the first, that this administration has \nrenominated a candidate who was originally nominated by the previous \nadminstraiton. It is a rarity for a new adminstration to renominate a \nprevious administration's judicial nominees, especially when the two \nadministrations are of different parties. Clearly, the President is \nleading by example when he calls upon the Senate to rise above petty \npartisanship and provide fair hearings and prompt votes to every \njudicial nominee regardless of what party controls the White House or \nthe Senate.\n  I have had the pleasure of reviewing Judge Davis' distinguished legal \ncareer, and I have come to the conclusion that he is a fine \nPennsylvania State judge who will only add to the distinguished Federal \nbench in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  Judge Davis graduated from Princeton University and Rutgers-Camden \nSchool of Law. After graduation, he joined the Office of the District \nAttorney of Philadelphia as an Assistant District Attorney in the Law \nand Trial Divisions. Eventually, he rose to become Assistant Chief of \nNarcotics and then Chief of the Rape Unit.\n\n  One of the many examples of his fine character revolves around a \ndefendant's rape conviction before Judge Davis led the D.A.'s Rape \nUnit. Upon examination of new evidence, it became clear that the \nalleged victim, in the case, suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and \nhad hallucinated the criminal episode. The investigation that freed the \ndefendant was conducted by Davis.\n  His record of rulings before the appellate courts is equally as \nimpressive. Judge Davis has filed approximately 150 cases, of which \nonly 3 were overturned on appeal--and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court \nreinstated his decision in one of those cases.\n  Judge Davis has been a champion in reforming the Philadelphia court \nsystem. He helped author and was an early proponent of Philadelphia's \ndifferentiated case management system. This system, which groups \ndefendants with similar case dispositions into one of four ``tracks,'' \nhas resulted in a 47 percent reduction in the Felony-Waiver Unit's \npending inventory.\n  I am very pleased that we will confirm Judge Davis today.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, in January 2002, Judge Legrome Davis \nwas nominated by President Bush to serve on the United States District \nCourt, Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S2935]]\n\n  The American Bar Association rated Judge Davis as well-qualified for \na judgeship on the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n  Judge Davis presently serves on the Court of the Common Pleas of \nPhiladelphia County, a position he has held since 1987.\n  From 1992 until January 2001, Judge Davis served as the Supervising \nJudge of the Criminal Division, with principal responsibility for all \nissues of policy, planning and administration involving criminal case \nprocessing.\n  During his tenure as Supervising Judge, numerous city, state and \nfederal funding authorities awarded the First Judicial District more \nthan nineteen million dollars to support supervisory endeavors for \ndefendants developed by Judge Davis and administered under his \ndirection.\n  He is the Coordinator of the Female Offenders' Criminal Justice \nTreatment Network, a collaborative project linking the criminal justice \nand treatment communities in addressing the complex and special \nchallenges of women in the criminal justice system.\n  Judge Davis was integral in conceptualizing and implementing the \ncourt reforms which were integral to the suspension of the federal \nprison cap in 1995.\n  Previously he worked for Ballard, Spahr, Ingersoll & Andrews, and the \nOffice of the General Counsel of the University of Pennsylvania. He was \nalso an Assistant District Attorney for nine years, serving in the \nHomicide, Narcotics, and Career Criminal Units, and was the Chief of \nthe Rape Prosecution Unit when he left office to seek a state court \njudgeship.\n  He has been honored by the Pennsylvania Trial Judges Association \n``Golden Crowbar Award, the Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Board of \nJudges Exceptional Service Award, the Philadelphia Bar Association; \nThurgood Marshall Award, the Philadelphia Coalition for Victim \nAdvocacy; Victim Advocacy Award and the Fraternal Order of Police \nHonorary Lifetime Membership--Lodge 92.\n  Mr. REID.

Mary Jane Ogilvie, wife of our \nChaplain, a very treasured member of our Senate family, is battling \nbacterial pneumonia this week. She is in an area hospital and in \nserious but stable condition.\n  Dr. Ogilvie and his children are, of course, with her as they have \nbeen throughout this ordeal. Dr. Ogilvie has been our Chaplain now for \n7 years, since 1995, and over the years he has been the source of real \nstrength for many of us in times of sorrow, in times of difficulty. \nEspecially these last difficult months, we have relied on his wise and \ncompassionate counsel over and over again. Now it is our turn to be the \nsource of strength for him, for Mrs. Ogilvie, and for their family.\n  The Chaplain's Office asked that we not send flowers because they are \nnot permitted in intensive care, but if you believe in prayer, they \nsay, please pray for Mrs. Ogilvie. We will certainly do so.\n  We want to extend--I know on behalf of all Senators, Republican and \nDemocratic--our sincere best wishes for a complete and full recovery. \nWe wish her strength, and we want her to know that our thoughts and \nprayers are with her tonight and will continue to be with her until she \nreturns to good health.\n  I just talked to Dr. Ogilvie this afternoon. He has informed me that \nthe prognosis is improving. We hope that that will be the case \nthroughout the weekend. We wanted to make note of this at this time.\n  I know my colleague, the distinguished Republican leader, has also \nhad a conversation with Dr. Ogilvie, and to accommodate his words at \nthis time, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Daschle for making our colleagues and those \nwho follow the situation in the Senate aware of the struggle our \nChaplain is going through now. He has been a chaplain and a minister \nfor all of us.\n  As Senator Daschle said, each one of us has had moments of difficulty \nover the past 7 years. He is always there. Just recently, when my wife \nlost her father, she didn't get to talk to Dr. Ogilvie, but he left a \nmessage on the recorder. It was like a message from heaven, just \nmagnificent; so meaningful, my wife saved it and listened to it more \nthan once.\n  So at this time when our Chaplain is facing difficulty, certainly we \nneed him to know of our thoughts and our prayers. When I spoke to him, \nI told him that I believe in miracles and that his wife can pull \nthrough this and rejoin the Senate family.\n  Mary Jane is very much a part of the family. She attends events; she \ngoes with our Chaplain so many places. She is his helpmate. As I spoke \nwith him a few minutes ago, I could just feel it in his voice; he is \njust really so worried.\n  I join Senator Daschle and all of the Senate in extending to them our \nlove and our thoughts and prayers. We look forward to continuing to \nfollow her improvements. We have the Senate physician, Dr. Frist, on \nthe job. He is keeping us posted of how she is doing. We will be \nthinking about them over the next weekend and look forward to them \nbeing back in full form and with\n\n[[Page S2936]]\n\nus on all these many occasions at which we enjoy their presence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

What is the business of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. S. 517 is the pending business.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a \ntime limitation of 1 hour equally divided between myself and Senator \nGrassley for debate on the Finance Committee energy tax amendment; that \nno amendments be in order to my amendment except a second-degree \namendment by Senator Grassley; that at the conclusion or yielding back \nof the time, the Senate vote in relation to Senator Grassley's second-\ndegree amendment and to my Finance Committee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, I supported this tax section \nthat Senator Baucus is trying to add to the energy bill at this time \nwhen we had it in the Finance Committee. Obviously, there are some \nthings in there that I would prefer not be in there. But we had an \noverwhelming vote out of the Finance Committee in support of this \npackage.\n  An energy policy that does not include a tax section is not a \ncomplete policy. We have to have some incentives for these hybrid cell \nvehicles and to try to get marginal wells back in production, to \nencourage biomass, to do everything we can, along with the policy that \nis included in this bill, to also encourage more energy production and \nmore energy conservation through the Tax Code.\n  I support this. I will be glad to work with Senator Baucus to see \nthat we get it included in the Senate package or certainly in the \nconference when a conference is completed. We have to do that.\n  But at this time, we do have an objection from our side of the aisle. \nAnd on behalf of a Senator who has a tax provision in which he is very \ninterested, I am constrained to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I hear the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi. I very much understand the reasons for his objection. I \ndeeply appreciate his statement in support of the Finance Committee \ntitle that we hope to offer to this bill.\n  The provisions in the Finance Committee title total roughly $15 to \n$16 billion over 10 years. The Senate hopefully will pass the Senate-\npassed version of tax incentives. It will be incentives for production, \nconventional production, renewables, unconventional production, for \nconservation. The House passed a tax title to their energy bill which \ntotals about $30 billion.\n  I fully agree with the distinguished Senator that the Finance \nCommittee provisions, which will help wean us away from OPEC by \nproviding incentives on matters that I suggested, are vitally \nimportant. And I hope--in fact, I expect--that the Senate, before it \npasses an energy bill, will also include these provisions because they \nare such an integral and vital part of the bill.\n  I thank all concerned, particularly my good friend from Mississippi.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, since President Bush signed into law a \nprovision to overturn the ergonomics rule, over 1.8 million workers \nhave suffered ergonomic injuries. At that time Secretary Chao promised \n``to pursue a comprehensive approach to ergo-nomics.'' However, now \nmore than a year later, the Department of Labor has unveiled a plan \nthat ultimately falls short of the substantive protections needed to \nprotect America's workers.\n  In response, Senator John Breaux and others have introduced a bill \nthat would require that the Department of Labor promulgate a new rule \non ergonomics within 2 years.\n  I am deeply concerned that the administration continues to build on \nits record of putting special interests above working Americans. I \nbelieve that Senator Breaux's bill is an important measure that \nclarifies that workers deserve real protections, not more studies and \nvoluntary guidelines.\n  Unfortunately, the administration's late announcement fails to \nprovide workers adequate protections. The administration's plan states \nan ``intent'' to develop voluntary guidelines for selected industries. \nSenator Breaux's bill will ensure that the administration provides real \nprotections and not hollow promises.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/18/senate-section/article/S2936-4", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2936-S2938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    STATUS OF JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I would like to respond to some comments \nmade yesterday on the topic of judicial confirmations. I had no \nintention of bringing up this topic today, but now I find myself with \nno choice but to again set the record straight with respect to the \ncomments my colleague made earlier yesterday.\n  First, I would like to put my remarks in context. I began this \nSession of the 107th Congress by praising the way that Chairman Leahy \nand the Senate's Democratic leader had begun to handle judicial \nnominations. One of the reasons I did so was that I had detected the \npossibility that the Judiciary Committee may be headed in a new \ndirection as we began a new Session. I sensed a chance that, after more \nthan eight months of Democratic control, the leaders might stop \nsteering their course by staring at the rear-view mirror, and would \nbegin to look forward through the windshield at the work ahead. I \nthought that they might begin to sense the American people's \nfrustration at the Senate's stonewalling of President Bush's \npriorities--especially his selections for the judiciary. Obviously, now \nthat we are in the eleventh month of Democratic control, my optimism \nhas become tarnished not only by the continuing extremely slow pace of \nconfirmations and the blatant mistreatment of Judge Pickering, but also \nby the kind of comments we heard this morning that actually attempt to \npersuade the American people that the Senate's record is acceptable.\n  I want to correct a couple distortions of the record and explain what \nis really going on in the Judiciary Committee.\n  My colleague began his comments with the assertion that the Democrats \nhave only been in charge of the Judiciary Committee since the end of \nJuly rather than the beginning of June--\n\n[[Page S2937]]\n\nwhich somehow adds up to 9 months. This particular exercise in make \nbelieve is apparently very important for some of my colleagues to \nrepeat over and over. But the fact is--as everyone in the Senate \nknows--that Democrats took charge of the Senate on June 5, not at the \nend of July. Considering that it is now the middle of April, we are now \nin the eleventh month of Democratic control.\n  Why is this important? Playing make-believe that the month of June \ndidn't exist last year helps some of my colleagues explain away the \nfact that they failed to hold any confirmation hearings during that \nentire month. There is no basis for the underlying assertion that the \nlack of an organizational resolution prevented the Judiciary Committee \nfrom doing so. It certainly didn't stop 9 other Senate Committees from \nholding 16 confirmation hearings for 44 nominees during that same \nmonth. And it did not prevent the Judiciary Committee from holding five \nhearings in three weeks on a variety of issues other than pending \nnominations.\n  Of course, the month-of-June distortion is simply part of the larger \ncharade of pretending that the current judicial vacancy crisis has less \nto do with the last 11 months of foot dragging than with the \nCommittee's work between the years 1994 and 2000. The fact is that, at \nthe close of the 106th Congress, there were only 67 vacancies in the \nfederal judiciary. In the space of one Democratic-controlled \ncongressional session last year, that number shot up to nearly 100, \nwhere it remains today. The broader picture shows that the Senate \nconfirmed essentially the same number of judges for President Clinton \n(377) as it did for President Reagan (382), which proves bipartisan \nfairness--especially when you consider that both Presidents has six \nyears of Republican control in the Senate.\n  So, how did we go from 67 vacancies at the end of the Clinton \nAdministration to nearly 100 today? There can be only one answer: The \ncurrent pace of hearings and confirmations is simply not keeping up \nwith the increase in vacancies. We are moving so slowly that we are \nmaking no forward progress. President Bush nominated 66 highly \nqualified individuals to fill judicial vacancies last year. But in the \nfirst four months of Democratic control of the Senate last year, only 6 \nfederal judges were confirmed. At several hearings, the Judiciary \nCommittee considered only one or two judges at a time. The Committee \nvoted on only 6 of 29 circuit court nominees in 2001, a rate of 21%, \nleaving 23 of them without any action at all. In fact, eight of the \nfirst eleven judges that President Bush nominated on May 9 of last year \nstill have not had a hearing--despite being pending for 344 days as of \ntoday.\n  It is time for this Senate to examine the real situation in the \nJudiciary Committee, rather than listen to more inventive ways of \ndistorting it. We have lots of work to do. There are 96 vacancies in \nthe Federal judiciary--a vacancy rate of more than 11.2 percent--and we \nhave 53 nominees pending--plus 4 nominees for the Court of Federal \nClaims. Twenty of the pending nominees are for circuit court positions, \nyet the Senate has confirmed only 2 circuit judges this session. This \nis despite a crisis of 30 vacancies pending in the circuit courts \nnationwide--virtually the same number of vacancies pending when the \nDemocrats took control of the Senate in June of last year.\n  These numbers beg the question: If the Judiciary Committee is not \nmaking any progress on the judicial vacancy crisis, What is happening \nin the Judiciary Committee? What is the Committee doing in lieu of \nconfirming President Bush's nominees?\n  Well, the judicial confirmation process appears to be falling into \nthe hands of some extreme-left special-interest groups whose political \npurposes are served by launching invidious attacks on the good people \nPresident Bush has nominated to serve as judges.\n  We all know too well what happened to Judge Pickering, who was a \ndecent, honorable man who is clearly qualified to be a judge on the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals. So I won't recount that very \nunfortunate situation. But I would like to warn everyone that the \nstoves of the special interest groups are readying to boil up an attack \non Judge Brooks Smith of Pennsylvania who had a hearing nearly two \nmonths ago but still has had no vote in the Judiciary Committee.\n  If you are waiting to hear that some profound issue has been raised \nabout a complicated or important legal issue, I am sorry to disappoint \nyou. The fact is that Judge Smith has a very distinguished record as a \nFederal judge for nearly 14 years, and no one has questioned his \nability or competence. So what is the great issue that may well be \nendangering his nomination--you might ask? Well, believe it or not, \nsome are trying to make hay out of the fact that Judge Smith used to be \na member of a small family-oriented fishing club--like hundreds that \nexist from Vermont to Wisconsin to North Carolina to Utah, that happens \nto limit membership to men.\n  Let me note at the outset that Judge Smith's nomination is supported \nby the Women's Bar Association of Western Pennsylvania and the local \nDomestic Violence Board in Pennsylvania. The people who know him best \nare the ones who support him the most.\n  It is also important to recognize that the Judiciary Committee, in \n1990, and the Judicial Conference, in 1992, each made clear that Judges \nor nominees can belong to single-gender clubs so long as the club \nexhibits certain attributes of privacy first articulated by Justice \nWilliam Brennan for the Supreme Court in Roberts v. Jaycees.\n  In Roberts, Justice Brennan--the great liberal patriarch of American \njurisprudence--first articulated the right of intimate association in \nfurtherance of the Freedom of Association recognized by the Supreme \nCourt in NAACP v. Alabama as an extension of First Amendment speech. \nSuch intimate association, Justice Brennan said, must be protected ``as \na fundamental element of personal liberty,'' and ``choices to enter \ninto and maintain certain intimate human relationships must be secured \nagainst undue intrusion . . . because of the role of such relationships \nin safeguarding the individual freedom central to our constitutional \nscheme.'' The Court went on to describe the attributes of such intimate \nassociations as ``relative smallness . . . a high degree of selectivity \nin decisions to begin and maintain the affiliation, and seclusion from \nothers in critical aspects of the relationship.''\n  I should note that the club that Judge Smith belonged to has only 115 \nmembers.\n  I for one, stand by the American people's Freedom of Association as \ndefined by the Supreme Court. As Justice Thurgood Marshall pointed out, \nthe ability to associate as we see fit is part of what makes this \ncountry great, and a freedom we honor. And I hope we can all recognize \nthat Judges, or people who might want to be Judges someday, should be \njust as free as anyone else to exercise that right. There is no point \nto turning the nomination of Judge Smith into a referendum on the \nFreedom of Association. And there is certainly no sympathy among the \nAmerican electorate to turn yet another of President Bush's judicial \nnominees into a mere single-issue caricature when Judge Smith has an \noutstanding record of service to our country.\n  I am very concerned that any further delay of Judge Smith's \nconfirmation will lead to even more cynicism about the Senate in the \nminds of the American people. The voters who have watched the Judiciary \nCommittee during the past eleven months already know that the vacancy \ncrisis is not tit for tat or mere payback for anything that happened in \nthe past. The voters know that the Democratic leadership has plunged \ninto truly uncharted territory, holding up an absolutely unprecedented \npercentage of President Bush's nominees and, in the process, allowing \nleftist special interest groups to smear decent and accomplished public \nservants in order to serve highly partisan political aims.\n  There is no better way to understand the extreme partisanship of \nthese powerful leftist groups than to look at the irony in their call \nfor ``diversity'' on the circuit courts of appeal. I of course agree \nwith having a diverse judiciary, but I do not believe that these groups \nmean what they say.\n  Let's look at judicial diversity. Right now, over 50 percent of the \nactive federal judges in America were appointed by President Clinton. \nThe best way to ensure diversity on the bench is for the Senate to \nconfirm more Bush nominees who will enforce existing law and leave\n\n[[Page S2938]]\n\nlawmaking to the people's elected representatives, including the \nPresident's nominees from Minority groups.\n  But I fear that nominees like Miguel Estrada, whom the President has \nnominated to be the first Hispanic to sit on the second most \nprestigious court in the land, are not getting a fair shake because \nout-of-the-mainstream liberal groups show increasing intolerance to \nHispanics and African-Americans who don't subscribe to the left-of-\nmainstream ideology. The intolerance is not because of race, but \nbecause many liberals will not give the time of day to any minority or \nwoman who have become accomplished in any field other than liberal \nactivism. I fear that the Liberals are seriously thinking about \nshutting the door to our Courts of Appeal to any Hispanic, African-\nAmerican or woman who does not toe the line of the radical, left-of \ncenter special interest groups. That would be a great tragedy for our \ncountry. I would be an end to the very diversity that is the strength \nof America and its judicial system.\n  We cannot allow outside groups to impede progress. In fact, what we \nneed is to approve more circuit judges at a faster pace to address the \nvacancy crisis in the federal appellate courts. The Sixth Circuit is \npresently functioning at a 50 percent capacity. Eight of that court's \n16 seats are vacant. President Bush has nominated 7 well qualified \nindividuals to fill the vacancies on that court. Two of those nominees, \nDeborah Cook and Jeffrey Sutton, have been pending since May 9 of last \nyear--344 days of inaction. They have languished in Committee without \nso much as a hearing while the Sixth Circuit functions at 50 percent \ncapacity. Another appellate court that is in trouble is the D.C. \nCircuit, which is missing one-third of its judges: It has only 8 of its \n12 seats filled. President Bush nominated two exceedingly well \nqualified individuals to fill seats on the D.C. Circuit on May 9 of \nlast year. Those individuals, Miguel Estrada and John Roberts, are \namong the most well respected appellate lawyers in the country. Yet the \nJudiciary Committee has not granted them a hearing, much less a vote.\n  Part of the problem is a decision by the Committee not to consider \nmore than one circuit judge per hearing. In fact, the Committee has not \nmoved more that one circuit judge per hearing during the entire time \nthe Democrats have had control of the Senate. When I was Chairman, I \nhad 10 hearings with more than one circuit nominee on the agenda. If we \nare going to get serious about filling circuit vacancies, then I \nencourage my Democratic colleagues to move more than one circuit \nnominee per hearing.\n  The bottom line of all this is that America is facing a real crisis \nfacing its federal judiciary, especially the circuit courts of appeals, \ndue to the nearly 100 vacancies that plague it. The Judiciary Committee \nhas decided not to make any progress toward remedying this situation. \nInstead, it is pouring its energy into creative accounting and make \nbelieve. But the American people are sick of the charades and are \ndisgusted by the personal destruction for partisan purposes. They want \nthe Senate to help--not hinder--President Bush. I urge my friends \nacross the aisle to focus on this situation, to step up the pace of \nhearings and votes, to resist the powerful leftists who are the enemies \nof the independent judiciary, and to do what's right for the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/18/senate-section/article/S2938-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION TO THE BANKRUPTCY BILL\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, the bankruptcy conference will meet on \nTuesday to discuss and attempt to resolve the remaining differences \nbetween the House and Senate versions of the bill.\n  One of those issues is the Senate provision that addresses the single \nmost offensive abuse in the bankruptcy system, the homestead exemption. \nAs we all know, the homestead exemption allows debtors in five \nprivileged States to declare bankruptcy but still shield unlimited \nmillions of dollars in their homes from their creditors.\n  With every year that passes, we learn of new cases where scoundrels \nhave declared bankruptcy in States like Florida and Texas but have \ncontinued to live like kings in multi-million dollar mansions.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the New York Times ran a story on former Enron \nexecutives like Ken Lay and Andrew Fastow who are doing some bankruptcy \nplanning of their own. They are selling numerous properties around the \ncountry worth millions of dollars, but retaining--or in some cases even \nbuilding--luxury homes in Texas or Florida. Using the homestead \nexemption, Lay will be able to retain his $7.1 million condominium in \nthe finest apartment building in Houston and Fastow will keep his \nmulti-million dollar mansion currently under construction. They will be \nable to enjoy their mansions, even if they declare bankruptcy, as their \nformer employees struggle to find a new paycheck or to cover the rent.\n  Last year, it was Paul Bilzerian--a convicted felon--who tried to \nwipe out $140 million in debts and all the while held on to his 37,000 \nsquare foot Florida mansion worth over $5 million--with its 10 \nbedrooms, two libraries, double gourmet kitchen, racquetball court, \nindoor basketball court, movie theater, full weight and exercise rooms, \nand swimming pool.\n  The Bankruptcy Conference has a real chance to put an end to this \nnow. The Senate has repeatedly--year after year--voted overwhelmingly \nin favor of a provision that would put a hard cap on the amount of home \nequity that a debtor can retain even after bankruptcy. The Senate \nshould insist on a real and meaningful solution to this problem.\n  But so far, the only compromises we have been offered are road maps \nthat show debtors how to circumvent the law. We have been told that we \ncan only impose a residency requirement of two and a half years\n  This will not do. First, it does nothing to stop lifelong residents \nof Texas or Florida. Ken Lay has lived there most of his life. So has \nAndrew Fastow. They get away scot free under this proposal. Second, \nmost bankruptcy attorneys will tell you that anyone rich enough can \nplan 2 to 3 years in advance.\n  In the spirit of compromise, we have agreed to raise the homestead \ncap to $175,000--a figure that far exceeds the average amount of equity \na Houston homeowner has in their house. So, the average homeowner will \nnot be affected at all by this provision, only the extraordinarily \nwealthy debtor. And even now, we remain open to effective and practical \nproposals aimed at solving this inequity.\n  Yet, we may not have an opportunity to reach that compromise. \nInstead, those that want the bill so badly that they are willing to \nlegislate unfairness into the bankruptcy code are trying to get their \nway.\n  We should remember that one of the central principles of the \nbankruptcy bill is that people who can pay part of their debts should \nbe required to do so. But the call to reform rings hollow when the \nproposal creates an elaborate, taxpayer-funded system to squeeze an \nextra $100 a month out of middle-class debtors but allows people like \nBurt Reynolds to declare bankruptcy, wipe out $8 million in debt, and \nstill hold on to a $2.5 million Florida mansion.\n  To put it another way, political expediency may well trump fairness. \nThe rich will be able to pour millions of dollars into the value of \ntheir Florida home, their Texas ranch, or their unimproved plot of land \nsecure in the knowledge that their creditors will never be able to \ntouch it. Yet, the average debtor will lose their house and most of \ntheir personal possessions as they try to repay their debts.\n  We have made historic changes to the bankruptcy code, but have chosen \nnot to remedy the worst abuse of them all. We can only hope that \nbetween now and the conference committee's meeting on Tuesday, the \nparties to this deal will have a change of heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/18/senate-section/article/S2938-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2938-S2939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JAMES GRIMMER\n\n Mr. SHELBY.

Upon finishing high school and unable to join the armed \nforces due to age restrictions, James joined the Royal Canadian Air \nForce in 1937 before he turned eighteen. However, with America's \nimminent entrance into World War II, James dutifully returned to the \nUnited States to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps. He eventually \nretired from the military as a Lt. Colonel in the U.S. Air Force.\n  After the war, James embarked on a long and stellar career in real \nestate development. In 1955, he joined the firm of Moulton, Allen & \nWilliams. It was with this firm that he developed the Eastwood Mall, \nwhich was the Southeast's first enclosed mall. It had such a positive \nimpact on the community that other developers soon followed James' lead \nand established numerous shopping centers in the Birmingham area. This \nled to new jobs, economic growth and was instrumental in Birmingham's \nexpansion during the fifties and sixties. In 1962, James decided to \nbuild on his success and founded the Grimmer Realty Company. With his \nnew independence, James went on to develop numerous other malls, \nincluding: the Western Hills Mall, the Montgomery Mall, Quintard Mall \nin Oxford, AL, and Jackson Mall in Jackson, MS. In fact, James Grimmer \ndeveloped over eight and a half million square feet of retail space \nthroughout the Southeast.\n  James was also closely involved with the Birmingham community and had \nclose ties to real estate developers around the nation. He enjoyed \nscouting, golfing and fishing with family and friends, and was a member \nof the Independent Presbyterian Church. He was a member of the \nInternational Council of Shopping Centers, The Club, Summit Club; \nVestavia Country Club and the New York Real Estate Board.\n  It is with sincere respect that I pay tribute to James Grimmer. He \nwill be remembered as a pioneering businessman not only in the \nBirmingham community but the entire Southeastern region. He will be \nmissed by the community as well as by his many close friends and \nrelatives. My thoughts and prayers extend to his wife, Rose, children, \nPark and Susan, grandchildren, Leslie, Shelly and Jamie, and his \nsister, Evelyn Williams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/18/senate-section/article/S2939-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nIN HONOR OF THE RETIREMENT OF SUPERINTENDENT FOR CLOVIS UNIFIED SCHOOL \n                     DISTRICT, DR. WALTER L. BUSTER\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I recognize and pay tribute \nto Dr. Walter L. Buster, Superintendent of Clovis Unified School \nDistrict in Clovis, CA as he prepares to retire.\n  Dr. Buster has been in education for over 50 years, seventeen of \nthose years as a school superintendent and the last 7 years as \nSuperintendent for Clovis Unified School District. Dr. Buster is \ncommitted to educational excellence. He has taught all levels of \nschool: elementary, junior high, high school and college, successfully \nserving many school districts in California and along the way has \nimplemented visionary programs.\n  In Clovis Unified, Dr. Buster implemented Class Size Reduction and \nEarly Literacy Instruction in grades 1-3. In these grade levels, only \n20 students or fewer are enrolled in each class, thus giving the \nstudents a better ability to learn during these critical early years. \nSome of his most prized work in Clovis Unified School District has been \nin the following programs: Community of Readers, a program where \nvolunteers in the community are trained to assist students with reading \none hour each week; CHARACTER COUNTS, a program that teaches the six \npillars of success--Responsibility, Respect, Fairness, Caring, \nCitizenship and Trustworthiness; and Laptops for Learners, a program \ndeveloped to assist 7th, 8th and 9th graders in classes where laptop \ncomputer are used as learning tools.\n  Dr. Buster is truly a credit to the educational system. He has \nestablished as a standard a high level of integrity and decency. He is \na man of great determination and dedication who has worked tirelessly \nto educate our children. I am honored to congratulate and pay tribute \nto him, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in wishing Dr. Walter \nL. Buster best wishes as he embarks on future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/18/senate-section/article/S2939-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

SEIJI OZAWA\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \ncelebrate one of this Nation's brightest stars, Mr. Seiji Ozawa, who \nhas presided over the Boston Symphony Orchestra as music director for \nthe last 29 years. On April 20, Seiji will conduct the BSO in Mahler's \nNinth Symphony and the conclusion of that performance will mark the \nfinal installation of his work in Massachusetts. The enthusiasm and \nprecision he brings to his craft are legendary, and as he prepares to \nassume his new post at the Vienna State Opera, I want to take a moment \nto join people throughout Massachusetts and across the country in \nexpressing our gratitude for the contributions he has made during his \ntime with the BSO.\n  For the last three decades Seiji Ozawa has challenged colleagues with \nhis innovative interpretations and charmed audiences with his playful \nenergy and focus. Through award-winning recordings, and celebrated \nperformances in cities around the world, he has brought the beauty and \ninsight of classical music to life for people of all ages. His service \nto the BSO stands as the longest continuous directorship in the history \nof the symphony, surpassing even Serge Koussevitzky, who held the baton \nfrom 1924 to 1949. Throughout that time, Seiji has lent his skills to \nthe Berlin Philharmonic, the Vienna Philharmonic, the Orchestre de \nFrance and the Paris Opera, where he presided over the debut of \nMessiaen's ``Saint Francois d'Assise.''\n  Seiji began his musical journey by enrolling at the Toho Music School \nin Tokyo, Japan, as a child. A rugby injury changed his original plans \nof becoming a concert pianist and soon after he shifted focus to the \nunique art of conducting. Once Seiji settled on this pursuit, his \ninstructor at the Toho School, Mr. Hideo Saito, urged him to travel \nabroad and refine his skills. Following that advice, he won first prize \nat the International Competition of Orchestral Conductors, in Besancon, \nFrance in 1959. This accolade earned Seiji an invitation in 1960 from \nCharles Munch, then music director of the BSO, to study at the \nTanglewood Music Center. That first Tanglewood visit resulted in Seiji \nwinning the Koussevitzky Prize for outstanding student conductor, and \nit also marked the beginning of a mutual love affair between \nMassachusetts and the young conductor.\n  Upon completion of his studies, Seiji moved to West Berlin to work \nwith Herbert von Karajan. It was here that Seiji's unique presentation \nand style caught the eye of Leonard Bernstein, and upon returning to \nthe United States he accepted Bernstein's offer to serve as assistant \nconductor of the New York Philharmonic for 1961 and 1962. In 1964, he \nconducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Tanglewood, raising the \nbaton in a concert hall where he had studied just 4 years before. Word \ncontinued to spread about the enthusiastic Ozawa, and offers came in \nfrom orchestras around the world. Seiji\n\n[[Page S2940]]\n\ndecided on becoming the music director of the Ravinia Festival in \nChicago, where he remained for five summers, and then moved to the \nToronto Symphony until 1969. After a brief period with the San \nFrancisco Symphony, Seiji became artistic director at Tanglewood in \n1970, and was subsequently asked to assume the role of music director \nfor the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1973.\n  It has been during his time with the BSO that Seiji became the \ncultural icon that we celebrate this year. In 1976, he was honored with \nan Emmy Award for the Boston Symphony Orchestra's PBS television \nseries, ``Evening at Symphony.'' In 1994, he won a second Emmy Award \nfor Individual Achievement in Cultural Programming, in recognition of \nhis work ``Dvorak in Prague: A Celebration with the Boston Symphony \nOrchestra.'' In a nod to his early instructor and the Japanese heritage \nhe has proudly shared with the world, he co-founded the Saito Kinen \nFestival in Japan, which will provide young people the same chance he \nhad to learn the arts of conducting and performing. The academic \ncommunity of my home state has recognized Seiji's tremendous talent \nwith honorary Doctor of Music degrees from the University of \nMassachusetts, the New England Conservatory of Music and Wheaton \nCollege, and certainly our beloved Red Sox have never had a more \nenthusiastic supporter.\n  Seiji arrived in Massachusetts as a young man finishing his education \nand beginning his professional ascension. After April 20, he will leave \nthe Boston Symphony Orchestra a true master of his craft. While he has \nbeen guided by a deep respect for the past and its masters, Seiji \nremains the consummate modernist; a solitary individual fueled by an \ninstinctual fascination and hunger for the unexplored frontier of the \nfuture.\n  My constituents and I have been so proud to host Mr. Ozawa over these \nlast three decades. For the rest of his career we will proudly think of \nhim as one of our own in Massachusetts, and I join my constituents in \nthanking Seiji Ozawa for the invaluable contributions he has made \nthroughout his time at Tanglewood and with the Boston Symphony \nOrchestra.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/18/senate-section/article/S2940-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING THE JEWISH COMMUNITY FEDERATION OF LOUISVILLE\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today in order to thank and \nhonor the 50 members of the Jewish Community Federation of Louisville, \nKy for participating in Monday's Pro-Israel rally held outside our \nNation's Capitol. I truly believe these individuals along with the \nentire Jewish Community Federation of Louisville deserve to be honored \nfor their commitment to Israel and all that it stands for.\n  Monday's rally was quite a sight to see. Over 100,000 supporters \ngathered, including former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \nand former mayor of New York Rudy Guilani, to demonstrate support for \nIsrael in its current struggle against terrorism. Since September 11, \nthe citizens of the United States of America have unfortunately and \ntragically been forced to face the realities that accompany terrorism; \nthe fear, the pain, and the struggle. The American people now have an \nunderstanding of what it means to live in fear of a cowardly and \nradical enemy.\n  The terrorist threat and presence Americans currently fear and feel \neveryday has been a reality for the people of Israel since 1948, when \nthe state of Israel was officially established and recognized. For 54 \nyears now, the Israeli people have fought for their freedom and right \nto exist. In recent weeks, the Israeli government has come under fire \nfor their aggressive but necessary military actions in Palestinian-\ncontrolled areas of the West Bank. While I pray for the innocent \nPalestinians who suffer the consequences of their leader's failures, I \ncannot find it in myself to condemn Israel, doing all it can to protect \nits families, future, and freedom.\n  Since the time he was a 17-year old arms dealer in Cairo fighting to \nrid Palestine of all British and Jewish influence, Yasser Arafat has \ndedicated his time, thoughts, and efforts to bringing terrorism to the \nhomes and streets of the Jewish people. In 1958, Arafat founded the Al-\nFatah movement, an underground network of terrorist cells working as \none to bring about the demise of the Jewish state. Just one year after \nthe organization was established, Al-Fatah was publishing a radical \nmagazine advocating the armed struggle against Israel and its people. \nSince Al-Fatah, under the leadership of Arafat, took control of the PLO \nin 1969, both Jordan, for attempting to overthrow King Hussein, and \nLebanon, for using Palestinian refugee camps as bases for cross-border \nattacks against Israel, have expelled Arafat and his terrorist group \nfrom their land. Even today, Arafat continues to support the terrorist \nactivity of such barbaric groups as Hamas and Palestine Islamic Jihad \nby agreeing to compensate the families of their homicide bombers. These \nhomicide bombers are no different from the 19 Al-Qaeda terrorists who \npiloted two planes into the World Trade Centers, and one into the \nPentagon killing thousands of innocent American citizens. They are all \nwilling to kill innocent civilians as well as themselves for fanatical \nleaders such as Osama bin Laden and Yasser Arafat.\n  In 1988 at a special session of the UN, Arafat showed signs that he \nwas willing to negotiate for peace. He renounced terrorism and vowed to \nprosecute those who took part in terrorist activities. This empty \nrhetoric however proved to be short-lived. In 1991, Arafat fully \nsupported Saddam Hussein and Iraq in the Persian Gulf War just three \nshort years after he gave his UN speech. He has also refused to take a \ntough stance on terrorism, failing to live up to his promise to \nprosecute those responsible for such horrific acts as we have seen in \nthe past six months. Arafat has now had the opportunity to deal with \nmultiple Israeli Prime Ministers and U.S. Presidents but to no avail. \nHe has been offered land, statehood, and a peaceful existence with the \nstate of Israel. In every instance, talks ended and violence ensued.\n  I once again would like to thank the Jewish Community Federation for \nsending 50 of its most devoted individuals to the rally. Israel has \nalways been a good friend to both the U.S. and to democracy, and it \nalways will be. I finally ask that my colleagues join me in praying \nthat this situation ends as quickly and as peacefully as possible. I \nknow that we all would like to see this conflict resolved without any \nfurther bloodshed, but we must be willing to stand by our in friends in \nIsrael in our fight to eradicate terrorism from the globe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/18/senate-section/article/S2940-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2940-S2941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE FUTURE OF AMERICAN STEEL\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. I am proud to join Majority Leader Daschle, \nSenator Rockefeller and the other cosponsors today in introducing the \nSteel Industry Consolidation and Retiree Benefits Protection Act, a \nbill that seeks to maintain the viability of a critical domestic \nindustry, and maintain a safety net for its workers and retirees who \ntoday live in fear of losing their healthcare coverage.\n  I am on the side of steel and steelworkers. I will stand up for \nsteelworkers and make sure that their voices are heard in the Senate.\n  On March 20th, President Bush announced that he would impose tariffs \non steel imports, the tariffs weren't as high as we believe necessary \nto give America's steel industry the opportunity to consolidate and get \nback on its feet. The tariffs imposed under section 201 were a first \nstep, but we can not afford half-measures. Congress now needs to take \nthe next step and address retiree health care benefits.\n  I recently held a hearing to listen to the people behind ``legacy \ncosts''--the workers; the retirees; the widows; the executives; and \nworker representatives whose voices are not being heard. I heard from \nretirees and widows from the Bethlehem Steel plant at Sparrow's Point \nin Baltimore. I will never forget hearing Gertrude Misterka tell me \nthat she would have to spend nearly $7,000 on her prescriptions if she \nlost her husband's health care benefits. She would be in tough shape if \nshe lost those health benefits that her husband, a proud Korean War \nveteran, Charlie, worked so hard for.\n  I will not forget Jeff Mikula who has a job at Sparrow's Point but if \nthat plant closed, he lose the benefits he has worked so hard for over \nthe last 26\n\n[[Page S2941]]\n\nyears. I will not forget McCall White, a retired steelworker, a proud \nveteran, who worked at Sparrow's point for nearly 40 years. It is for \nthem and hundreds of thousands in similar situations that I will fight. \nI will fight to make sure legacy costs are addressed in a very serious \nway.\n\n\n     How would the Rockefeller bill help steelworkers and retirees?\n\n  This bill would help protect the U.S. steel industry and would \nprovide health care and life insurance to steel retirees of those \ncompanies directly effected by unfair trade practices.\n  This bill helps companies consolidate by addressing the liability \ncosts that have served as barrier to the restructuring that many argue \nthat is needed by this industry in order to be able to compete. At my \nhearing on the steel industry, I heard how restructuring would help to \nmaintain a competitive U.S. steel industry, which is in the national \ninterest and would preserve American jobs today and tomorrow good \npaying, American jobs.\n  This bill would mean that promises made are promises kept. Steel \nretirees, their families and dependents would have the retirement \nsecurity earned through decades of hard work and sacrifice. This bill \nwould establish a health benefits program for retirees modeled on the \nmost popular health care for Federal employees the Blue Cross/Blue \nShield standard plan. This is not the Cadillac, gold-plated health plan \nthat some claim these retirees have. These are the benefits that our \nsteel workers worked hard for. Under this bill, any steelworker with at \nleast 15 years of work in our nation's steel mills would have a basic \nhealth benefit package that they can count on. This bill would also \nprovide a very modest death benefit of $5,000 to the widows of steel \nretirees.\n\n\n                       Who would this bill help?\n\n  Now, there are now about 142,000 active steelworkers, but there are \nabout 600,000 retirees counting on these benefits. By helping those \nwith more than 15 years of hard work in our mills, this bill would help \nmany of our Nation's active and retired steelworkers. In my own State \nof Maryland, 3,700 people work at the Bethlehem Steel Sparrows Point \nfacility, but there are 23,000 retired steelworkers, widows and \ndependents. These workers and retirees deserve a basic health benefit \npackage that they can rely on.\n  I agree with President Bush when he said, ``Steel is an important job \nissue. It is also an important national security issue.'' We need to \nsee the President join us on this issue in fighting for American jobs \nand for national security. A sound domestic steel industry is critical \nas we fight the war on terrorism. Steel builds our tanks, our planes \nand our ships. Bethlehem Steel produced the armor to repair the USS \nCole.\n  The policy of our government is to support producers when it is in \nthe national interest. National interest means national responsibility. \nCongress voted for nearly $80 billion in farm support over the next 10 \nyears. It is important to support farmers to make sure we have the \nproducers to be food-independent. I voted for the bill that is now in \nconference, and I am happy to stand up for American farmers. Congress \ngave the airlines $15 billion after September 11 because of a national \nemergency. It was the right thing to do.\n  Now, we need to stand up for steel. We need to have producers here in \nAmerica to be steel-independent and be ready for national emergencies. \nMake no mistake: This is a national emergency for steel. Standing up \nfor steel is in the national interest just like farmers, just like \nairlines.\n  There is much to do to ensure that there is a viable U.S. steel \nindustry. We need to make sure that the Section 201 tariffs are being \nimplemented properly. Steel legacy costs are also a vital, necessary, \ncrucial part of ensuring a viable U.S. steel industry. This is part of \nthe comprehensive solution. We can not afford half-measures, not with a \ncritical industry at the brink of collapse, not with the retirement \nsecurity of hundreds of thousands at risk.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us to protect American steel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/18/senate-section/article/S2941-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORY OF CLAIRE T.

Mr. President, I want to share with my \ncolleagues an excellent essay by a long-time friend of this Senator, \nBernard Rapoport. The essay points out that using any means to make \nmoney as those at Enron did, or evading taxes as too many American \ncorporations do today by creating off-shore schemes, are unpatriotic \nacts, which should outrage the American people.\n  As the message comes from someone who has distinguished himself as a \nbusiness leader and whose generosity has made our society a little more \njust and equal, it is a message I hope all American business executives \nnot only hear, but heed.\n  The essay follows:\n\n                   ``Enronics''--(Lack of Patriotism)\n\n       My father was a Russian Jewish revolutionist, (the Agrarian \n     Revolution of 1905). He was a Marxist which advocated the \n     philosophy that the ``ends justified the means.'' It is, \n     perhaps, an understandable point of view of someone subjected \n     to the despotic czarist rulers of the Russia in the time in \n     which he was raised. A few years after he escaped from \n     Siberia, to which he was exiled for life for participation in \n     the revolution, he came to America still convinced about ends \n     and means from the Marxian view. I, too, was raised with that \n     philosophy. Fortunately, and I think at the same time as he, \n     I was influenced by Emerson's wonderful admonition that \n     ``character is that which can do without success,'' and it \n     brought both of us to a new understanding. Yes, how one \n     achieves is more important than if one achieves.\n       It's the ``means'' that in fact does determine the \n     ``ends.'' In my eight and a half decades of living I've had \n     three poignant examples of unrestrained American patriotism. \n     Of course, there have been many others, but what follows are \n     the three that are most firmly imprinted in my memory.\n       The first was America's reaction to Pearl Harbor. Second, \n     during World War II, on that day that General Dwight \n     Eisenhower told us by radio that D-Day had begun and that \n     there would be a large loss of lives, and, third, 9/11! The \n     most essential ingredient in patriotism is love of country, \n     which requires a commitment that we conduct ourselves in such \n     a manner as to consistently do those things to make our \n     country better.\n       The tragedy of ``Enronics'' is that these high-falutin' \n     capitalists lowered themselves to a Marxian philosophy. Yes, \n     their end was making money. Any means legal or otherwise, was \n     justified because of their ``ends!''\n       My reason for this essay is that I'm not angry--``I'm \n     mad!'' My father's daily plea was to me was to ``have a sense \n     of outrage at injustice.'' ``Enronics.'' Gives just cause to \n     understand outrage because it is unrestrained unpatriotism.\n       Here's another example of what I perceive to be \n     unpatriotism. In the New York Times\n\n[[Page S2942]]\n\n     of February 18, 2002, the column headline on the front page \n     was, ``U.S. Companies Use Filings in Bermuda to Slash Tax \n     Bills.'' I always thought I was fairly sophisticated when it \n     came to finance, but I quickly learned after reading that \n     article that I wasn't nearly as ``smart'' as I thought I was. \n     This is an occurrence that happens often in my life. I \n     majored in economics at the University of Texas. The \n     bibliography included Adam Smith's ``Wealth of Nations,'' \n     which is the predicate for capitalism. Smith realized the \n     greed instinct within all of us, but thought that the \n     invisible hand, i.e. competition, would be the moderator or \n     leveler of the greed instinct. Well, this particular article \n     to which I've alluded is beyond my comprehension. Evidently \n     intelligent lawyers and accountants had come up with schemes \n     to ``legally'' avoid the rules by which the rest of us must \n     play. Secondly, this was combined with lobbyists who appealed \n     to members of Congress to include riders to particular pieces \n     of legislation which would benefit one particular \n     corporation, and enable it to escape the responsibilities \n     that any patriotic company would observe. Competition is \n     making a better product, merchandising it more intelligently, \n     and paying the taxes that all the rest in the same category \n     pay. Well, not in the legal sense, but morally. I ask the \n     question, ``Why do we put up with these kind of shenanigans? \n     Why don't we have a sense of outrage at this injustice? \n     Why don't we get mad?\n       I'm reminded of Murray Edelman's wonderful though, \n     ``Political history is largely an account of mass violence \n     and of the expenditure of vast resources to cope with \n     mythical fears and hopes. At the same time, large groups of \n     people remain quiescent (that's us!) under noxiously \n     oppressive conditions and sometimes passionately defend the \n     very social institutions that deprive or degrade them.''\n       For example, in the New York Times article, it points out \n     that one company made $30 million additional profit because \n     they didn't pay taxes. Now if they had played by the same \n     rules as other companies, they would've shown $30 million \n     less profit because of the payment of what it really owes. \n     Guess what! Their stock sells at a much higher price because \n     they are taking advantage of what I call an ``Enronic'' \n     approach. At least, such companies should have the courtesy \n     and be required to show what their earnings would be if they \n     were paying on the same basis as their competitors. In the \n     New York Times article it is pointed out that one corporation \n     saved $400 million in taxes! Reducing taxes can really be a \n     meaningful objective if these groups to which I've referred \n     to were truly patriotic. All these companies do to avoid \n     these taxes is to have an office in Bermuda or the Cayman's \n     or some other island, and obtain this unfair advantage. As \n     ridiculous as it may sound, a company with one of these \n     offices in Bermuda, for example, can borrow money from its \n     Bermuda account, charge out the interest that it pays, \n     reducing their taxes in the United States. Let's be quickly \n     reminded that there is no tax on the interest earned by the \n     Bermuda parent. So an additional injustice is compounded as a \n     result of this tax avoidance scheme.\n       The U.S. Treasury has to borrow money, sell bonds, and you \n     know who buys them? These same corporations! Guess what! The \n     interest they have received on their bonds as a result of \n     their Bermuda office will not be taxable. It's a vicious \n     circle! Where, of where, is there not a sense of outrage to \n     their unconscientious acts of unpatriotism?\n       We must be constantly reminded of what Guiseppe Mazzini \n     said, ``God has given you your country as cradle, and \n     humanity as mother; you cannot rightly love your brethren of \n     the cradle if you love not the common mother.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/18/senate-section/article/S2942-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NINETY DAYS IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH TIME\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a letter released last week by the \nGeneral Accounting Office highlighted serious problems that could \nresult from reducing the period of time that National Instant Criminal \nBackground System records are retained to only 24-hours after a firearm \nsale. Under current NICS regulations, records of allowed firearms sales \ncan be retained for up to 90 days, after which the records must be \ndestroyed. On July 6, 2001, the Department of Justice published \nproposed changes to the NICS regulations that would reduce the maximum \nretention period from 90 days to only one day.\n  According to FBI officials and the GAO letter, retained records that \nwere more than 1 day old but less than 90 days old were used to \ninitiate over 100 firearm-retrieval actions by law enforcement in the \n4-month period beginning July 3, 2001, through October 2001. As a \nresult, the GAO believes that next-day destruction of NICS records \nwould likely obstruct the ability of law enforcement to retrieve \nfirearms from individuals who were mistakenly approved to purchase \nfirearms. Since its inception, NICS checks have prevented more than \n156,000 felons, fugitives and others not eligible to purchase a firearm \nfrom doing so. While not infringing upon any law-abiding citizen's \nability to purchase a firearm.\n  The retention of NICS records for a sufficient period of time is \nimportant. I am greatly concerned by the Attorney General's action and \nI support the ``Use NICS in Terrorist Investigations Act'' introduced \nby Senators Kennedy and Schumer. This legislation would codify the 90-\nday period for law enforcement to retain and review NICS data. The GAO \nletter provides further evidence that the Schumer/Kennedy bill is \ncommon sense legislation that deserves enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/18/senate-section/article/S2942-2", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ANDIE BUEL RETIRES AFTER 35 YEARS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

Madam President, as the end of the 200-2002 \nacademic year approaches, I rise to pay tribute to Dr. Donald N. \nLangenberg, who at the end of this month will retire as Chancellor of \nthe University System of Maryland, which for the past twelve years he \nhas served with great distinction.\n  In 1990, when Dr. Langenberg came to Maryland from the University of \nIllinois-Chicago, the University System of Maryland was still in the \nearliest stages of its formation. It was established in 1988 to bring \ntogether thirteen diverse institutions, each with a distinctive and \ndistinguished history, into a ``family'' dedicated to ``nurturing \nminds, advancing knowledge, elevating the human spirit and applying \n(our) talents to the needs of the citizens of Maryland.'' The purpose \nof the new system was to be nothing less than to ``achieve and sustain \nnational eminence and become a model for American higher education and \na source of pride'' for all the people of my State.\n  In short, Dr. Langenberg had his work cut out for him, but no one \ncould have been better suited to the challenge, by both temperament and \nexperience, than he. It was his task as the first Chancellor of the \nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago, established in the 1980s to bring \ntogether existing undergraduate, research and medical institutions, to \nguide the new university through its formative years; and he came to \nthat position from the National Science Foundation, where he had served \nas acting and deputy director.\n  Dr. Langenberg's academic background, however, was not in \nadministration but rather in physics. With degrees from Iowa State \nUniversity, the University of California at Los Angeles and the \nUniversity of California at Berkeley, he taught at the University of \nPennsylvania, where he also directed the Laboratory for Research on the \nStructure of Matter and served as Vice Provost for Graduate Studies and \nResearch. He has been a visiting professor at numerous institutions in \nthis country and abroad; his work on superconductivity has resulted in \nthe development of a new type of voltage standard, which is in use \nworldwide, and it led to the publication of a paper so frequently cited \nin other papers and journals that it is known as a ``citation \nclassic.'' Throughout his distinguished career, Dr. Langenberg has also \nmaintained the highest level of engagement in numerous professional \nassociations, for example as president and chairman of the board of the \nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science, AAAS, chairman of \nthe board of National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant \nColleges,\n\n[[Page S2943]]\n\nNASULGC, President of the American Physical Society, APS, chairman of \nthe President's Council of the Association of Governing Boards of \nUniversities and Colleges, AGB. He recently completed a decade's \nservice as a member of the University of Pennsylvania's Board of \nTrustees.\n  For the past twelve years the University System of Maryland has been \nthe beneficiary of the great breadth and depth of Dr. Langenberg's \nexperience, and above all from his abiding commitment to make our state \nsystem a model for higher education everywhere. The University System's \ncampuses have never been more vigorous than they are today. The schools \nof medicine and law are thriving, and so are programs designed for \nadults wishing to resume or continue their education. Under Dr. \nLangenberg's leadership the University System has developed new \nmeasures of accountability and productivity, which are in use not only \nin Maryland but at universities around the Nation. The K 16 Partnership \nfor Teaching and Learning, of which Dr. Langenberg was a founding \nmember, works to ensure continuity and coherence in Marylanders' \neducation, from kindergarten through the B.A. And in a State whose \nextraordinary diversity of human and natural resources is reflected in \nits public institutions of higher education, among them a major \nresearch university that is also one of the earliest land-grant \ncolleges, three historically black colleges, professional schools and \nindependent research institutes, he has played a leading role in \nbuilding the University System family. Each of its thirteen very \ndifferent member campuses determines its own focus and honors its own \ntraditions, while at the same time all collaborate to offer better \nopportunities for higher education to Marylanders of all backgrounds, \ntalents and persuasion.\n  Behind the formidable intelligence, zest for hard work, success in \nacademic administration and distinction as a scholar that Dr. \nLangenberg brought to his position as Chancellor of the University \nSystem of Maryland there has always been a clear and steady vision, \nwhich he himself has most eloquently described. First, he remarked in a \nspeech not long ago, ``As a Midwesterner, I have always had tremendous \nadmiration for great public universities because I know that they \nprovide opportunities that might not otherwise exist.'' And then, he \nobserved, ``much of his long and distinguished career ``has been about \ncreating linkages and partnerships, between our citizens and higher \neducation, between and among campuses, between higher education and \npublic schools, and between higher education and the business \ncommunity.'' For this he offered a compelling and moving explanation: \n``as the only child of deaf parents, I became my parents' translator \nand their link to the hearing and speak world.''\n  Maryland has been deeply fortunate to have Dr. Donald Langenberg at \nthe helm of its University System. I want to express my gratitude for \nall that he has accomplished, my congratulations on his retirement, my \ndelight in the decision he and his wife have made to stay in Maryland, \nand my best wishes for the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/18/senate-section/article/S2943-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         OUTSTANDING VOLUNTEER PERFORMANCES BY FLORIDA SENIORS\n\n Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, today I show my \nsupport for Paul Gagne of New Hampshire. His heroic actions, combined \nwith help from Jeffrey Morse, saved a woman and numerous animals. He \nput his life on the line to rescue others from a burning house.\n  In September of 2001, the two telephone technicians were working on a \ncable problem when they noticed smoke coming from a nearby house. They \nraced to the scene of the fire. Paul hurried to call the emergency \nrescue services, while Jeffrey used a garden hose to prevent the flames \nfrom spreading. Jeffrey then noticed a sign indicating that live \nanimals were living in the house, so he kicked down the door to the \nbuilding and retrieved a cat.\n  After the animal was brought to safety, the two men heard screams. \nPaul and Jeffrey entered the burning building and worked their way \nthrough the thick smoke to find a choking woman. The two men picked her \nup and carried her to safety. They returned for a final trip to ensure \neveryone had been rescued.\n  I commend the acts of Paul Gagne. It takes true courage and honor to \nput somebody else's life above one's own. I am confident that as long \nas we have people like Paul, our Nation will continue to be strong. New \nHampshire is proud to have such a dedicated citizen.

As a trained EMT, Ray answered a call \nfrom the New York City emergency authorities who desperately needed his \nsupport at Ground Zero. He was escorted to the scene, given rescue \nequipment, and immediately began to search for victims.\n  Ray searched for survivors and cleaned up rubble for about 72 hours, \ntaking little time to rest or eat. He encountered several near death \nexperiences, including nearly being crushed by the collapsing Liberty \nPlaza Building. He and another rescuer found two Port Authority \nofficers still alive.

A bill to hold accountable the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization and the Palestinian Authority, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, on behalf of the Senator from \nCalifornia and myself, I offer the Arafat Accountability Act. This act \nseeks to create conditions more conducive to stopping the senseless \nviolence and flow of innocent blood in the Middle East.\n  The act takes aim at the weakest link in ongoing efforts to negotiate \na political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict--PLO Chairman \nYasser Arafat. His leadership has been marked by repeated failures--\nfailure to forcefully denounce and terminate the spree of horrific \nhomicide bombings, failure to serve as a credible and reliable partner \nin peace, and failure to fulfill the aspirations of the Palestinian \npeople for stability, economic opportunity, and a viable homeland.\n  Instead, he has acquiesced to terror and violence. Documents seized \nduring recent counterterrorism operations on the West Bank reveal his \npersonal involvement in financing and supporting terrorism against \nIsraeli civilians. The successful interception of a cargo vessel from \nIran earlier this year--loaded with offensive weaponry destined for the \nPalestinian Authority--should have conclusively proven that Chairman \nArafat was, at best, a balky partner in peace, or, at worst, a foe of \nany meaningful reconciliation.\n  The terrorist attacks against Israel must come to an end. And they \nmust end on terms that safeguard the lives and livelihoods of innocent \nIsraeli and Palestinian civilians. Much like our war against the \nTaliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan, Israel is rotting out terrorist \ncells and destroying their networks.\n  It is no understatement that the Israeli military is undertaking its \noperations with precision and professionalism that no other army in the \nregion could exert.\n  The Arafat Accountability Act will not frustrate or derail the \nimportant efforts of the administration to secure a political solution \nto the ongoing strife. Rather, it places critical incentives to ensure \nthat Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority do not deliver a \nfatal blow to the prospects for peace.\n  Specifically, the act denies a visa to Arafat and other senior PLO \nofficials to travel to the United States, downgrades the PLO's \nrepresentative office here in Washington, restricts the travel of \nsenior PLO officials at the United Nations, and seizes the assets of \nthe PLO and the Palestinian Authority and Arafat in the United States. \nIt also requires the administration to report to Congress on any acts \nof terrorism committed by the PLO or its constituent elements.\n  Importantly, the bill provides the President with flexibility in \ndetermining the sanctions, but it is my expectation that they would \nremain in place until a cease-fire is achieved and the Tenet plan \nimplemented. These are the very same short-term goals that Secretary \nPowell has been trying to achieve over the last few days.\n  We should not forget that in 1993 Arafat himself committed the PLO to \n``a peaceful resolution of the conflict,'' so we are not holding Arafat \nto any higher standard than he established for himself already.\n  I would offer that Arafat should have listened more carefully to \nSecretary Powell when he said to the Nation and the world from the \nMcConnell Center for Political Leadership at the University of \nLouisville last year that solutions to this conflict ``will not be \ncreated by teaching hate and division, nor will they be born amidst \nviolence and war.''\n  I emphasize that it is not my intent to push this bill to a vote on \nthe Senate floor at this time. We should give the President and his \nadvisers more time to pursue their objectives in the region.\n  It is my intent, though, and the intent of the Senator from \nCalifornia, to send a powerful signal to Chairman Arafat and the \nPalestinian Authority that the Senate will not stand idly by while they \ntalk peace in English and practice terror in Arabic.\n  No progress toward a political solution to this conflict will be made \nuntil and unless Yasser Arafat forcefully, clearly, and repeatedly \ncondemns homicide bombings and other acts of terrorism against Israel \nand takes concrete measures to restrain Palestinian extremists.\n\n[[Page S2953]]\n\n  The bill we introduce today puts added pressure on Arafat and the PLO \nto be responsible and responsive partners in peace. There is no room \nfor further failure on Arafat's part. He must either lead his people \ntoward peace or get out of the way.\n  Let me close by commending President Bush and his administration for \ntheir superb conduct in the ongoing war against terrorism. They \ncertainly have my full support in this endeavor--be it in the West Bank \nor in Gaza or, for that matter, in Iraq.\n  My colleagues and I are looking forward to hearing from Secretary \nPowell when he appears before the Foreign Operations Subcommittee next \nweek.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky \nfor his work and leadership on this issue.\n  We are here because we believe any hope for peace in the Middle East \nmust begin with the complete renunciation of terrorism by the \nPalestinian Liberation Organization and a strong, unwavering commitment \nto bring such terrorism to an end.\n  We also believe that only with the leadership of the United States \ncan there be a peaceful settlement and resolution of issues in the \narea.\n  For the past 18 months, as the violence of the second Intifada has \nincreased, the United States has consistently called upon Yasser Arafat \nto halt the terrorism he pledged to end in the Oslo accords.\n  Unfortunately, Arafat has incited the violence and helped financially \nsupport the terrorists.\n  We now know that one of Arafat's top advisers is directly involved in \nfinancing the illegal weapons purchases and terror activities of the Al \nAqsa Brigade.\n  We now know, according to documents seized by the Israeli Defense \nForces, that Arafat was directly involved in efforts to illegally \nsmuggle more than 50 tons of arms into Israel from Iran a few months \nago.\n  We now know that Arafat has failed to confiscate weapons of terrorist \nsuspects.\n  We know he has failed to arrest and hold suspected terrorists and is \nharboring suspects in the assassination of an Israeli Cabinet official \nin his own headquarters in Ramallah.\n  In fact, much of the terrorism emanates from the heart of the PLO, \ncarried out by the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, composed of members of \nArafat's own Fatah faction.\n  Since the beginning of the year, 209 people have been murdered and \nmore than 1,500 injured in these suicide bombings. These are children, \nwomen, men--innocent civilians.\n  The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade claimed credit for numerous of these \nattacks, including on March 31, central Jerusalem, killing 3 people; \nMarch 3, killing 10 people in west Jerusalem; and January 31, when the \nfirst female bomber killed an elderly Israeli.\n  A document seized by the Israel Defense Forces in Ramallah, signed by \nArafat himself, approves funding for the Al Aqsa Brigades.\n  On February 3, Arafat wrote a New York Times op-ed opposing violence \nagainst Israel. Yet he declared a few days later, in Ramallah, that \n``we will make the lives of the infidels Hell'' and led a chant of ``A \nmillion martyrs marching to Jerusalem!''\n  And this past week, while Arafat spoke out against terrorism, his \nwife, in Paris, said she would be proud if she had a son who became a \nsuicide bomber.\n  I believe, sincerely, that this is not a leader who wants peace for \nhis people. In fact, I believe the suicide bombings have been precisely \ncalculated to destroy any chance for peace.\n  If these suicide bombers cannot be stopped, the situation is going to \ncontinue to deteriorate, Israel will have to continue to exercise its \nlegitimate right of self-defense, and the result will be full-scale \nmilitary conflagration.\n  Israel has done no less--and certainly no more--than what any country \nwould do to defend itself. There has been a lamentable loss of life in \nthe West Bank. And I grieve for it because I believe, very deeply, \nevery life--Israeli or Palestinian--has equal value.\n  But let us not forget that Israel's military operation has been one \nbased on specific intelligence information, with specific military \ngoals--to act directly against terrorists who before the start of the \noperation were carrying out daily suicide bombings against Israeli \ncivilians--and carried out with considerable restraint.\n  Certainly, Israel has not gone beyond what the United States and our \nallies have been doing in Afghanistan, or the United Kingdom in \nNorthern Ireland, or the bloody French campaign in Algeria--let alone, \nwhat Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, or Iran do on almost a daily \nbasis to quell dissent.\n  Does anyone doubt that a suicide bombing in Cairo, or Riyadh, or \nDamascus, or Beirut, or Paris would be met with the strongest of \nreactions, as was the 9-11 terrorist incident here?\n  There simply is no excuse for arming a teenage girl with bombs around \nher waist to blow up women and children. And this kind of terror is \nhappening over and over again.\n  So the time is now for this Senate to stand up, in a strong, unified \nvoice, to condemn the actions of Chairman Arafat and his PLO and the \nterrorism that has spawned.\n  Chairman Arafat has said one thing in English and another in Arabic. \nChairman Arafat fans the flames and incites the people.\n  We offer this bill, after witnessing the failure of efforts by \nMessrs. Tenet, Mitchell, Zinni, and, at least initially, Secretary \nPowell to break the deadlock largely because Chairman Arafat has not \nbrought to an end the suicide bombing and other acts of terrorism.\n  This legislation would require the President to report to Congress \nevery 90 days, detailing the acts of terrorism engaged in by the \nPalestinian Liberation Organization or any of its constituent elements \nand, based on that report, to designate the PLO or its constituent \nelements as terrorist organizations, or explain why not.\n  The legislation also finds that Chairman Arafat and the PLO have \nviolated his commitment to peace through the recent purchase of 50 tons \nof offensive weaponry from Iran; that they are responsible for the \nmurder of hundreds of innocent Israelis and the wounding of thousands \nmore since October 2000, and that they have been directly implicated in \nfunding and supporting terrorists who have claimed responsibility for a \nnumber of homicide bombings inside Israel.\n  Because of the failure by the Palestinian Liberation Organization to \nrenounce terrorism, the act would, A, downgrade PLO representation in \nthe United States to before Oslo; B, place travel restrictions on \nsenior PLO representatives at the United Nations; C, confiscate assets \nof PLO or Palestinian Authority or Chairman Arafat in the United \nStates; D, deny visas to Chairman Arafat or other officials of the PLO \nor the Palestinian Authority.\n  It is important to note that the President may, on a case-by-case \nbasis, waive this provision based on national security considerations.\n  The legislation presents a sense of the Senate outlining the first \nsteps needed to reach peace. First, the United States should urge an \nimmediate and unconditional end to all terrorist activities and \ncommencement of a cease-fire. Two, Arafat and the PLO should turn over \nto Israel for detention and prosecution those wanted by the Israeli \nGovernment for the assassination of Israeli Minister of Tourism, Mr. \nZeevi. Third, Arafat and the PLO should take broad and immediate action \nto condemn all acts of terrorism, including and especially suicide \nbombing, which has resulted in the murder of over 125 Israeli men, \nwomen, and children in the month of March alone and the injury of \nhundreds more; confiscate and destroy the infrastructure of terrorism, \nincluding weapons, bomb factories and materials, as well as end all \nfinancial support of terrorist activities; and to take positive steps \nto urge all Arab nations and individuals to cease funding terrorist \noperations and the families of terrorists.\n  Finally, the President of the United States, working with the \ninternational community, with Israel and the Arab States, should \ncontinue the search for a comprehensive peace in the region.\n  There is no question that there are serious differences to be \nreconciled between Israel and the Palestinian people and that only a \npolitical settlement can hopefully bring the violence in this region to \nan end. I believe the 1967 borders, borders which have the imprimatur \nof the United Nations, hold the key to a settlement. Despite serious \ndifferences about the refugee problem, ongoing security, and the status \nof Jerusalem, I believe peace can be\n\n[[Page S2954]]\n\nachieved through negotiation and agreement. But I know it cannot be \nachieved through violence.\n  The necessary first step is the end of the violence, the terrorism, \nand the suicide bombing. Once that is done, we are firmly convinced \nthat if leaders on both sides want peace, the rest can all be worked \nout.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Carnahan, and Mrs. \n        Feinstein):\n  S. 2195. A bill to establish State infrastructure banks for \neducation; to the Committees on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, the need to rebuild our Nation's \ncrumbling schools is clear. The National Center for Education \nStatistics estimates that it would cost $127 billion to repair, \nmodernize, and renovate U.S. schools. Fourteen million U.S. students \ncurrently attend schools that report a need for extensive repair. And a \nstudy by the American Society of Civil Engineers concludes that public \nschools are in worse condition than any other sector of our national \ninfrastructure.\n  And yet the Federal Government is doing far too little to help.\n  That is why I am introducing the Investing for Tomorrow's Schools Act \nof 2002. I am pleased to have Senators Clinton, Carnahan, and Feinstein \njoin with me as co-sponsors.\n  This legislation allows States to create ``infrastructure banks'' for \npublic schools and libraries. Modeled after State revolving funds, \nwhich have been used successfully to finance transportation projects, \nthese banks would offer low-interest loans to school districts for \nbuilding or repairing public schools, and to public libraries for \nbuilding or repairing libraries. As the loans are repaid, the bank \nfunds would be replenished, and the banks could make new loans to other \nschools and libraries. Once the banks got rolling, they would sustain \nthemselves, without any need for ongoing Federal appropriations.\n  After more than a decade of fighting to rebuild our Nation's \ndeteriorating schools, I am well aware that this bill is just one part \nof the solution. Two years ago, as the ranking member on the Senate \nLabor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I led the effort \nto provide $1.2 billion in grants to schools that urgently need \nrepairs. Last year, the Senate approved another $925 million on a \nbipartisan vote, but unfortunately that funding was eliminated during \nconference negotiations with the House.\n  I also introduced the America's Better Classrooms Act, which would \nprovide tax credits to subsidize $25 billion in new construction. That \nlegislation is still pending, and I am hopeful that it will succeed. \nThe Investing for Tomorrow 's School Act is the final piece of the \npuzzle.\n  If the nicest buildings our kids see in their hometowns are shopping \nmalls, sports arenas and movie theaters, and the most rundown place \nthey see is their school, what kind of signal are we sending? We can \nand must do better for our children. The Investing for Tomorrow's \nSchool Act should be a critical part of our strategy to improve \neducation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2195\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Investing for Tomorrow's \n     Schools Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) According to a 1996 study conducted by the American \n     School & University, $10,420,000,000 was spent to address the \n     Nation's education infrastructure needs in 1995, with the \n     average total cost of a new high school at $15,400,000.\n       (2) According to the National Center for Education \n     Statistics, an estimated $127,000,000,000 in repairs, \n     renovations, and modernizations is needed to put schools in \n     the United States into good overall condition.\n       (3) Approximately 14,000,000 American students attend \n     schools that report the need for extensive repair or \n     replacement of 1 or more buildings.\n       (4) Academic research has proven that there is a direct \n     correlation between the condition of school facilities and \n     student achievement. At Georgetown University, researchers \n     found that students assigned to schools in poor conditions \n     can be expected to fall 10.9 percentage points behind those \n     in buildings in excellent condition. Similar studies have \n     demonstrated improvement of up to 20 percent in test scores \n     when students were moved from a poor facility to a new \n     facility.\n       (5) The Director of Education and Employment Issues at the \n     Government Accounting Office testified that nearly 52 percent \n     of schools, affecting 21,300,000 students, reported \n     insufficient technology elements for 6 or more areas.\n       (6) Large numbers of local educational agencies have \n     difficulties securing financing for school facility \n     improvement.\n       (7) The challenges facing our Nation's public elementary \n     schools and secondary schools and libraries require the \n     concerted efforts of all levels of government and all sectors \n     of the community.\n       (8) The United States competitive position within the world \n     economy is vulnerable if America's future workforce continues \n     to be educated in schools and libraries not equipped for the \n     21st century.\n       (9) The deplorable state of collections in America's public \n     school libraries has increased the demands on public \n     libraries. In many instances, public libraries substitute for \n     school libraries, creating a higher demand for material and \n     physical space to house literature and educational computer \n     equipment.\n       (10) Research shows that 50 percent of a child's \n     intellectual development takes place before age 4. The \n     Nation's public and school libraries play a critical role in \n     a child's early development because the libraries provide a \n     wealth of books and other resources that can give every child \n     a head start on life and learning.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish the National Mormon Pioneer Heritage \nArea in the State of Utah, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, today it gives me great pleasure to \nintroduce for the Senate's consideration legislation establishing the \nNational Mormon Pioneer Heritage Area.\n  Spanning 250 miles, from the small town of Fairview, UT southward to \nour border with Arizona, the area encompassed by the National Mormon \nPioneer Heritage Area includes outstanding examples of historical, \ncultural, and natural resources shaped by the Mormon pioneers. The \nstory of the Mormon pioneers is one of the most compelling and \ncaptivating in our Nation's history. After traveling 1,400 miles from \nIllinois either by wagon or by pulling a handcart the pioneers came to \nthe Great Salt Lake Valley. Along the way, the pioneers experienced \nmany hardships including starvation, dehydration, exposure to the \nelements, Indian attacks, and religious persecution to name a few. Many \npeople died during their journey. Shortly after arriving in and \nestablishing Salt Lake City, Brigham Young dispatched pioneers to \nestablish communities in present day Idaho, Wyoming, Oregon, and other \nregions of Utah. The vast colonization effort in no way ended the \nhardship experienced by the pioneers. Throughout the area included in \nmy proposal are numerous stories of pioneers who perserved through \nchallenging circumstances. Communities such as Panguitch have Quilt \nDays every year to commemorate the sacrifice and fortitude of its \npioneers whose efforts saved the community from starvation in 1864. The \nQuilt Days celebration is a remembrance of an event known as the Quilt \nWalk, in which a group of men from Panguitch attempted to cross over \nthe mountains to Parowan, a community to the west, to procure food \nduring the community's first winter. Because of deep\n\n[[Page S2956]]\n\nsnows the pioneers were unable to trek across the mountains. Using \ntheir quilts, the pioneers formed a path which would support their \nweight and were able to reach Parowan, secure food, and return to \nPanguitch. There are other remarkable stories in the proposed heritage \narea that demonstrate the tenacity of the Mormon pioneers. At times in \norder to survive, the pioneers had to overcome major natural obstacles. \nOne such obstacle was the Hole-in-the-Rock. In 1880 a group of 250 \npeople, 80 wagons, and 1,000 head of cattle came upon the Colorado \nRiver Gorge. After looking for sometime to find an acceptable path to \nthe river, the pioneers found a narrow crevice leading to the bottom of \nthe gorge. Because the crevice was too narrow to accommodate their \nwagons, the pioneers spent six weeks enlarging the crevice by hand, \nusing hammers, chisels, and blasting powder, so wagons could pass. \nToday the Hole-in-the-Rock stands as a monument to the resourcefulness \nof the Mormon pioneers.\n  The National Mormon Pioneer Heritage Area will serve as special \nrecognition to the people and places that have contributed greatly to \nour Nation's development. Throughout the heritage area are wonderful \nexamples of architecture, such as the community of Spring City, \nheritage products, and cultural events, such as the Mormon Miracle \nPageant, that demonstrate the way-of-life of the pioneers.\n  This designation will allow for the conservation of historical and \ncultural resources, the establishment of interpretive exhibits, will \nincrease public awareness, and specifically allows for the preservation \nof historic buildings. This is a locally based, locally supported \nundertaking. My legislation has broad support from Sanpete, Sevier, \nPiute, Garfield, and Kane Counties. Furthermore, nothing in my \nlegislation affects private property, land use planning, or zoning.\n  I am very proud to introduce this legislation today. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues in the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources to pass this legislation this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN.\n  S. 2197. A bill to provide for the liquidation or reliquidation of \ncertain entries of roller chain; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, today I am introducing legislation whose \npurpose is to correct a gross injustice that has been carried out for \nmore than two decades by bureaucrats at the International Trade \nAdministration, ITA, and the U.S. Customs Service, Customs, against a \nsmall Oregon business, GS Associates, Inc., GS. What has been allowed \nto happen to this company at the hands of the federal government is a \nshocking and ultimately disturbing example of what can happen to \nordinary, hardworking Americans when an overzealous Federal bureaucracy \nis allowed to run horribly amok.\n  In 1973, imports of Japanese roller chain, not bicycle chain, \npotentially became subject to dumping duties, and in 1980, Congress \ninstructed the International Trade Administration, ITA, to conduct \ncomplete annual administrative reviews of outstanding dumping findings \nto determine whether any dumping duties should be assessed. But ITA \nfailed to complete its reviews on a timely basis. In fact, for my small \nOregon importer, GS, the ITA wasn't just a day or two late in reporting \nthe findings of its review of the company's Japanese supplier for \nshipments imported from April 1, 1981 through March 31, 1982, they were \nnine-and-a-half years late. When ITA finally got around to issuing a \nnotice regarding its administrative review on September 22, 1992, a \ncourt challenge was initiated by the Japanese supplier and a court \ndecision was rendered on July 11, 1995. Not surprisingly, ITA failed to \npublish notice of the court's decision in the Federal Register within \nten days, as required by law. That was in 1995. The year is now 2002, \nand ITA still has not published that notice. And as if all of this \nineptitude were not enough, ITA then failed to instruct Customs to \nbegin assessing dumping duties on and to liquidate GS Associates' \nshipments until the Spring of 2000. When Customs finally began \nassessing duties, they added on enormous amounts of interest, dating \nback almost 20 years, in sums that were two to three times greater than \nthe original dumping duty assessments. This outrageous pattern of \nconduct by the federal government threatens GS with bankruptcy.\n  The level of ineptitude displayed in this case by bureaucrats at ITA \nand the Customs Service is egregious bordering on negligence. \nLegitimate small businesses in this country should have the expectation \nthey will be treated fairly and forthrightly by their federal \ngovernment. ITA and the Customs Service deserve a very strong rebuke. \nGS Associates deserves to have its case resolved quickly and fairly, \nand that is the point of my legislation. It will liquidate once and for \nall the $1.7 million in duties and interest that have accumulated over \nthe past 20 years on these imports because of federal government \nnegligence.\n  I intend to work with the Finance Committee to assure that this \nmeasure is included in the legislation the committee is preparing on \ntemporary duty suspensions, and hope that the duty suspension bill will \nenable this Oregon company to be able to put this terrible experience \nbehind it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG:\n  S. 2199. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \npermit additional States to enter into long-term care partnerships \nunder the Medicaid Program in order to promote the use of long-term \ncare insurance; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Long-Term \nCare Insurance Partnership Act.\n  In the early 1990's, with support from a grant by the Robert Wood \nJohnson Foundation, four States, California, Connecticut, Indiana and \nNew York, initiated programs to create public-private long-term care \npartnerships to provide citizens with options for long-term care \ncoverage without having to spend down to Medicaid eligibility. However, \ncurrent law prohibits additional States from including asset protection \nin any public-private partnerships they may develop. Other States may \nset up the policies, but the beneficiaries receive no asset protection \nin the event they exhaust the long-term care insurance policies. They \nwould be forced to spend down to Medicaid levels, thereby removing the \nkey incentive behind the partnership program--asset protection.\n  Under the partnership program, States authorize the sale of approved \nlong-term care insurance policies that meet certain benefit \nrequirements. Individuals who purchase approved policies, would receive \na guarantee from the State that should their policy benefits be \nexhausted, the State would then cover the cost of their continuing care \nthrough Medicaid. The primary incentive for purchasing partnership \npolicies is asset protection.\n  In other words, the State Medicaid program would become a payer of \nlast resort rather than providing first-dollar coverage, in effect \nbecoming a long-term care ``stop-loss'' program.\n  The benefits of the program are significant for both seniors and \ngovernment: Individuals are encouraged to take responsibility for their \nown long-term care needs rather than relying on a State benefit. It \navoids forcing middle-class individuals to spend down to Medicaid \nlevels, but gives these same individuals the knowledge that the \ngovernment will be there if they need it. This program has been \nsuccessful in the goal of keeping people from needing to use Medicaid. \nUnder this program in four States, there are nearly 66,000 policies in \nforce and so far only 28 policyholders have exhausted their long-term \ncare insurance benefits and accessed Medicaid assistance. At a cost \naveraging $50,000 per year for long-term care services, the savings for \nState Medicaid budgets can be significant.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2199\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Long-Term Care Insurance \n     Partnership Program Act of 2002''.\n\n[[Page S2957]]\n\n     SEC. 2. PERMITTING ADDITIONAL STATES TO ENTER INTO LONG-TERM \n                   CARE PARTNERSHIPS TO PROMOTE USE OF LONG-TERM \n                   CARE INSURANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1917(b)(1)(C) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396p(b)(1)(C)) is amended--\n       (1) in clause (i), by striking ``shall seek adjustment'' \n     and inserting ``may seek adjustment''; and\n       (2) in clause (ii), by striking ``had a State plan \n     amendment approved as of May 14, 1993, which provided'' and \n     inserting ``has a State plan amendment approved which \n     provides''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 2200. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthat the parsonage allowance exclusion is limited to the fair rental \nvalue of the property; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, today I introduce legislation, along \nwith Senator Grassley, to clarify the tax treatment of the clergy \nhousing allowance. It is a very simple bill that confirms established \nInternal Revenue Service policy that has lacked the force of law. \nWithout this clarification, we risk losing a long-standing benefit that \nis terribly important to hundreds of thousands of ministers, priests, \nrabbis and other clergy all across America.\n  Since 1921, the Tax Code has allowed clergy to exclude from their \ntaxable income the value of housing provided to them, and since the \n1950's they have also been able to exclude a housing allowance provided \nfor the same purpose. This section of the Code is similar to one for \nemployer-provided housing for other taxpayers. The one for clergy is \nmuch simpler, in order to minimize the involvement of the Government in \nthe affairs of churches, that is, to keep the separation between Church \nand State.\n  The IRS has always interpreted this exclusion to be limited to the \nfair market rental value of the housing. They clearly stated that \nposition in 1971, but their statement lacked the force of law. Their \nposition has been challenged in Court, and the Court has said that it \nwas not clear that Congress meant to impose this limit. That is why we \nmust act.\n  The vast majority of clergy across America work very hard for very \nmodest pay. Especially in rural areas like we have in Montana, many \ncongregations are small, pay is low, and ministers are very dependent \nupon their churches providing or paying for their housing. A dispute \nover this issue has led to a controversial attempt by a panel of court \nof appeals judges to call into question the constitutionality of the \nexclusion. If the exclusion is lost, it will cost America's clergy $500 \nmillion each year. That may seem like a small amount of money compared \nto many of our tax bills that add up to billions, but it is a lot of \nmoney to those who are directly affected, and to the millions of \nAmericans in the congregations that they serve.\n  The House has passed similar legislation by a vote of 408 to 0. \nSenator Grassley and I will try to expedite passage of the legislation \nhere in the Senate.\n  It is good tax policy to keep a reasonable limit on the amount of \nthis deduction, as the IRS has done for decades. And it is good policy \nto make our intent crystal clear so that government involvement with \nreligious affairs is kept to a minimum. This bill will do both.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Burns, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Nelson \n        of Florida, and Mrs. Carnahan):\n  S. 2201. A bill to protect the online privacy of individuals who use \nthe Internet; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, today I rise to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation that will establish baseline requirements for the \nprotection of personal information collected from individuals over the \nInternet. This bill, the Online Personal Privacy Act, represents the \nwork of many months and important input from consumer groups, affected \nindividuals, and most importantly, many Senators on the Commerce \nCommittee. The origin of this emerging consensus position began to take \nshape at a Commerce committee hearing last summer that focused \ngenerally on whether there was a need for online privacy legislation. \nAt that time, members of the committee began to articulate the notion \nthat not all personal information is created equal. I agree. Some, \nhighly sensitive personal information, such as personal financial or \nmedical information or a person's religious beliefs are clearly more \nsensitive than other garden-variety types of information, such as a \npair of slacks that an individual may purchase. Since that hearing, and \nin numerous meetings with members of the Committee, we have worked hard \nto develop a balanced approach to Internet privacy regulation that \nrecognizes and builds upon best practices in the online community while \nestablishing a federal baseline standard for the protection of \nindividuals' privacy on the Internet.\n  Let me begin by expressing my gratitude to Senators Rockefeller, \nInouye, Breaux, and Cleland, who worked closely with me during the last \nCongress to advocate the need for strong online privacy protections and \nwho have agreed to be original cosponsors of this legislation. In \naddition, I would also like to particularly thank Senators Kerry, \nStevens, and Burns for their invaluable contributions throughout this \nprocess and their willingness to join with us in working to craft a \nworkable, bipartisan, consensus position on legislation that will \nprovide individuals with better controls over the use of their personal \ninformation while fueling the growth of e-commerce as consumer \nconfidence in the Internet spurs a significant increase in online \nactivity.\n  Some have argued that Americans' concerns about privacy no loner \nexist in the aftermath of September 11. But poll after poll \nconsistently demonstrates that the American people want companies they \npatronize to seek their permission prior to using their personal \ninformation for commercial profit. These concerns are heightened with \nrespect to the Internet, which, in a digital age, enables the seamless \ncompilation of highly detailed personal profiles of Internet users. \nAccordingly, fears about privacy have had palpable effects on the \nwillingness of consumers to embrace the full potential of the Internet \nand e-commerce.\n  Distrust of false privacy promises has sparked a rage of online self-\ndefense, especially the providing of false information by individuals. \nIndustry analysts estimate that between one-fifth to one-third of all \nindividuals provide false personal information on the Internet. This \nresponse is understandable given that consumers have few tools to \ndiscover whether their personal information is being disclosed. sold, \nor otherwise misused, and they have virtually no recourse.\n  Privacy fears are stifling the development and expansion of the \nInternet as an engine of economic growth. Because of consumer distrust, \nonline companies and services are losing potential business and \ncollecting bad data, blocking the Internet and its wide range of \nservices from reaching its full potential. The lack of enforceable \nprivacy protections is a significant barrier to the full embrace by \nconsumers of the Internet marketplace. According to a recent Harris/\nBusiness Week poll, almost two-thirds of non-Internet users would be \nmore likely to use the Net if the privacy of their ``personal \ninformation and communications were protected.''\n  Moreover, according to a recent Forrester study, online businesses \nlost nearly $15 billion, or 27 percent of e-commerce revenues, due to \nconsumer privacy concerns. Those numbers are significant in light of \nthe economic downturn and its disproportionate impact on the high-tech \nInternet sectors. Good privacy means good business and the Internet \neconomy could use a healthy dose of that right now.\n  Accordingly, our legislation offers a win-win proposition for \nconsumers and business: it will protect the privacy of individuals \nonline and provide online businesses with a new market of willing \ncustomers. While protecting the necessary business certainty of a \nsingle Federal standard.\n  Online companies have long argued that privacy regulations would \nhamper their ability to efficiently conduct business on-line and give \nconsumers the tailored buying experience they now expect from the \nInternet. Online\n\n[[Page S2958]]\n\nmerchants also touted self-regulation as sufficient privacy protection. \nWe know otherwise.\n  Privacy violations continue to make headlines: a major outcry erupted \nlast year after Eli Lilly disclosed a list of hundreds of customers \nsuffering from depression, bulimia, and obsessive compulsive disorder \nover the Internet. Moreover, just last week, a New York Times article, \n``Seeking Profits, Internet Companies Alter Privacy Policy,'' recounted \nhow Internet companies such as Yahoo had changed their privacy policies \nin order to require consumers to restate their privacy preferences even \nif they had previously withheld consent for the use and \ncommercialization of their personal information. Accordingly, these \ncompanies expanded their ability to use an individual's personal \ninformation for online and offline marketing purposes notwithstanding \nthat individual's prior policy preferences. Still other businesses \nconfound consumers with opaque privacy policies that begin with, ``Your \nprivacy is important to us,'' but in the subsequent legalese, outline a \nseries of exceptions crafted with double-negative verbs that allow \nvirtually any use of a consumer's information. Still other commercial \nweb sites fail to pass any privacy policy at all, safe in the knowledge \nthat they face virtually no legal jeopardy for selling personal \ninformation.\n  To be fair, some companies have taken consumer privacy seriously. \nEarthink launched a national television advertising campaign touting \nits policy of not selling customer information. U-Haul's web site \nsimply says: ``We will never sell or share our information with anyone, \nor send you junk mail, we hate that stuff, too.'' Companies like \nHewlett Packard, Intel, and Microsoft, giants of the high tech \nindustry, already provide individuals opt-in protection with respect to \ntheir personal information. But, in the final analysis, despite the \nbest of intentions and some successful efforts, reliance on self-\nregulation alone has not proven to provide sufficient protection. In \nits May 2000 Report to Congress, the Federal Trade Commission clearly \nrecognized this shortcoming having studied this issue diligently for 5 \nyears: ``Because self-regulatory initiatives to date fall short of \nbroad-based implementation of effective self-regulatory programs, the \nCommission has concluded that such efforts alone cannot ensure that the \nonline marketplace as a whole will emulate the standards adopted by \nindustry leaders. The Commission recommends that Congress enact \nlegislation that, in conjunction with continuing self-regulatory \nprograms, will ensure adequate protection of consumer privacy online.''\n  Our legislation aims to do just that.\n  Fundamentally, our legislation is built upon the five core principles \nof privacy protection identified by the Federal Trade Commission in its \n1995 report to Congress regarding online privacy: 1. Notice, 2. \nConsent, 3. Access, 4. Security and 5. Enforcement. Those principles \nare tried and true and formed the framework for the bipartisan \nChildren's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Which was hailed by \nindustry far and wide as a template for protecting children's personal \ninformation that is collected on the Internet.\n  The bill we introduce today takes a singular approach. It divides \nonline personal information into two categories: sensitive information \nand nonsensitive information. Sensitive information is narrowly \ntailored to include actual information about specific financial data, \nhealth information, ethnicity, religious affiliation, sexual \norientation, and political affiliation, or someone's social security \nnumber. Non-sensitive information is all other personally identifiable \ninformation collected online.\n  In this respect, the legislation is also similar to the two-tiered \napproach taken by the European Union in which companies are required to \nprovide baseline protections governing the use of nonsensitive \ninformation, and stronger consent protections governing the use of \nsensitive data. More than 180 American companies, including Staples, \nMarriott, Microsoft, Intel, Hewlett Packard, DoubleClick Kodak, and \nAcxiom, doing business in Europe have agreed to provide such \nprotections with respect to the personal data of European citizens. \nThey have signed up for the EU Safe Harbor and their names are listed \non the Department of Commerce's web site. Our bill simply asks these \nand other companies to provide similar protections for U.S. citizens.\n  First, with respect to notice and consent, the bill would require web \nsites and online services to post clear and conspicuous notice of its \ninformation practices. In other words, plainly state to individuals \nwhat you plan to do with their personal information. To the extent that \na web site collects sensitive information, it would also be required to \nobtain a consumer's affirmative consent, so-called ``opt-in'' consent, \nprior to the collection of such data. To the extent that a web site \ncollects only non-sensitive personal data, it would be able to collect \nsuch data for other uses as long as it provides individuals with an \nability to ``opt out'' of such uses and provides the consumer with \nactual notice at the point of collection, so-called ``robust notice'', \nwhich briefly and succinctly describes how the information may be used \nor disclosed.\n  Many Internet companies are doing this already. For example, on the \nsame page where an individual provides his or her personal information, \nthe web site for 1-800 Flowers states: ``You will be receiving \npromotional offers and materials from our sites and companies we own. \nPlease check the box below if you do not want to receive such materials \nin the future and do not wish us to provide personal information \ncollected from you to third parties.'' Similarly, NBC's website says \nthe following on the webpage where individuals register their personal \ninformation: ``As our customer, you will occasionally receive email \nfrom shopnbc.com about new services, features, and special offers we \nbelieve would interest you. If you'd rather not receive these updates, \nplease uncheck this box.'' It's as simple as that. And it provides the \nindividual the ability to make an informed choice at the critical point \nat which he or she is providing a company with personally identifiable \ninformation.\n  Next, our legislation requires companies to provide individuals with \nthe ability to find out what personal information a web site has \ncollected about them. While important, this right of reasonable access \nis not unqualified. Rather, it considers a variety of factors including \nthe sensitivity of the information sought by the consumer and the \nburden and expense on the provider in giving consumers access to their \npersonal information. In addition, the bill would permit online \ncompanies to charge individuals a reasonable fee to access their \npersonal data, as is similarly provided under the Fair Credit Reporting \nAct.\n  In addition, our bill requires that web sites adopt reasonable \nsecurity procedures to protect the security, confidentiality, and \nintegrity of personally identifiable information, just as Congress \nrequired in the Children's privacy legislation.\n  Moreover, the bill grants consumers important rights of redress. \nFirst, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general are \nempowered to take action. If the FTC collects civil penalties, the bill \ncreates a mechanism whereby those injured can petition to receive up to \n$200 of the award. For more serious violations involving sensitive \ninformation, the bill would additionally permit individuals on their \nown to pursue redress for damages in federal court.\n  Finally, in addition to following these fair information principles, \nthe legislation also takes the critical step of establishing a uniform \nfederal standard for online privacy protection by preempting State \nInternet laws. Inconsistent state regulation of privacy is already \ncausing problems for online businesses. Vermont has adopted ``opt-in \nlaws'' governing financial and medical privacy. In Minnesota, the state \nSenate has adopted ``opt-in'' online privacy legislation by a vote of \n96-0. In California, state privacy legislation is again moving through \nthe state legislature, offering the very real possibility that online \nbusinesses will sooner rather than later face the prospect of trying to \nbring their online operation into compliance with inconsistent state \nlaws.\n  Because new technologies make privacy protection a constantly \nevolving issue, the bill requires the FTC not only to implement the \nrequirements of the law, but further, to issue periodic reports about \nhow the law is working;\n\n[[Page S2959]]\n\nwhether similar privacy protections should apply offline or to pre-\nexisting data; whether standardized online privacy notices should be \ndeveloped; if a meaningful safe harbor should be constructed; and \nwhether privacy protection technologies in the marketplace such as P3P \ncan help facilitate the administration of the Act.\n  Consumer participation in cyberspace should not be conditioned on a \nwillingness to relinquish control over one's personal information. \nRather, for the medium to truly flourish, we must establish baseline \nconsumer protections that will eliminate the tyranny of convenience in \nwhich consumers are forced to choose between disclosing private, \npersonal information, or not using the Internet at all. Congress has a \nmoral obligation to protect American individual liberties, including \nthe right to better control the commercialization of one's own \npersonal, private information.\n  This bill is an important first step. The privacy protections in this \nlegislation will instill more confidence in people to use the Internet \nand create a consistent legal framework for online businesses. It will \nprovide better online privacy protections for consumers, better \ncommercial opportunities for businesses who respond to consumer privacy \nconcerns, and a better future for Americans who will embrace the \nInternet rather than fear it.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2201\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The right to privacy is a personal and fundamental \n     right worthy of protection through appropriate legislation.\n       (2) Individuals engaging in and interacting with companies \n     engaged in interstate commerce have a significant interest in \n     their personal information, as well as a right to control how \n     that information is collected, used, or transferred.\n       (3) Absent the recognition of these rights and the \n     establishment of consequent industry responsibilities to \n     safeguard those rights, the privacy of individuals who use \n     the Internet will soon be more gravely threatened.\n       (4) To extent that States regulate, their efforts to \n     address Internet privacy will lead to a patchwork of \n     inconsistent standards and protections.\n       (5) Existing State, local, and Federal laws provide minimal \n     privacy protection for Internet users.\n       (6) With the exception of Federal Trade Commission \n     enforcement of laws against unfair and deceptive practices, \n     the Federal Government thus far has eschewed general Internet \n     privacy laws in favor of industry self-regulation, which has \n     led to several self-policing schemes, none of which are \n     enforceable in any meaningful way or provide sufficient \n     privacy protection to individuals.\n       (7) State governments have been reluctant to enter the \n     field of Internet privacy regulation because use of the \n     Internet often crosses State, or even national, boundaries.\n       (8) States are nonetheless interested in providing greater \n     privacy protection to their citizens as evidenced by recent \n     lawsuits brought against offline and online companies by \n     State attorneys general to protect the privacy of individuals \n     using the Internet.\n       (9) The ease of gathering and compiling personal \n     information on the Internet, both overtly and \n     surreptitiously, is becoming increasingly efficient and \n     effortless due to advances in digital communications \n     technology which have provided information gatherers the \n     ability to compile seamlessly highly detailed personal \n     histories of Internet users.\n       (10) Personal information flowing over the Internet \n     requires greater privacy protection than is currently \n     available today. Vast amounts of personal information, \n     including sensitive information, about individual Internet \n     users are collected on the Internet and sold or otherwise \n     transferred to third parties.\n       (11) Poll after poll consistently demonstrates that \n     individual Internet users are highly troubled over their lack \n     of control over their personal information.\n       (12) Market research demonstrates that tens of billions of \n     dollars in e-commerce are lost due to individual fears about \n     a lack of privacy protection on the Internet.\n       (13) Market research demonstrates that as many as one-third \n     of all Internet users give false information about themselves \n     to protect their privacy, due to fears about a lack of \n     privacy protection on the Internet.\n       (14) Notwithstanding these concerns, the Internet is \n     becoming a major part of the personal and commercial lives of \n     millions of Americans, providing increased access to \n     information, as well as communications and commercial \n     opportunities.\n       (15) It is important to establish personal privacy rights \n     and industry obligations now so that individuals have \n     confidence that their personal privacy is fully protected on \n     the Internet.\n       (16) The social and economic costs of establishing baseline \n     privacy standards now will be lower than if Congress waits \n     until the Internet becomes more prevalent in our everyday \n     lives in coming years.\n       (17) Whatever costs may be borne by industry will be \n     significantly offset by the economic benefits to the \n     commercial Internet created by increased consumer confidence \n     occasioned by greater privacy protection.\n       (18) Toward the close of the 20th Century, as individuals' \n     personal information was increasingly collected, profiled, \n     and shared for commercial purposes, and as technology \n     advanced to facilitate these practices, the Congress enacted \n     numerous statutes to protect privacy.\n       (19) Those statutes apply to the government, telephones, \n     cable television, e-mail, video tape rentals, and the \n     Internet (but only with respect to children).\n       (20) Those statutes all provide significant privacy \n     protections, but neither limit technology nor stifle \n     business.\n       (21) Those statutes ensure that the collection and \n     commercialization of individuals' personal information is \n     fair, transparent, and subject to law.\n\n     SEC. 4. PREEMPTION OF STATE LAW OR REGULATIONS.\n\n       This Act supersedes any State statute, regulation, or rule \n     regulating Internet privacy to the extent that it relates to \n     the collection, use, or disclosure of personally identifiable \n     information obtained through the Internet.\n\n                   TITLE I--ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION\n\n     SEC. 101. COLLECTION, USE, OR DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY \n                   IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--An internet service provider, online \n     service provider, or operator of a commercial website on the \n     Internet may not collect personally identifiable information \n     from a user, or use or disclose personally identifiable \n     information about a user, of that service or website except \n     in accordance with the provisions of this Act.\n       (b) Application to Certain Third-Party Operators.--The \n     provisions of this Act applicable to internet service \n     providers, online service providers, and commercial website \n     operators apply to any third party, including an advertising \n     network, that uses an internet service provider, online \n     service provider, or commercial website operator to collect \n     information about users of that service or website.\n\n     SEC. 102. NOTICE AND CONSENT REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Notice.--Except as provided in section 104, an internet \n     service provider, online service provider, or operator of a \n     commercial website may not collect personally identifiable \n     information from a user of that service or website online \n     unless that provider or operator provides clear and \n     conspicuous notice to the user in the manner required by this \n     section for the kind of personally identifiable information \n     to be collected. The notice shall disclose--\n       (1) the specific types of information that will be \n     collected;\n       (2) the methods of collecting and using the information \n     collected; and\n       (3) all disclosure practices of that provider or operator \n     for personally identifiable information so collected, \n     including whether it will be disclosed to third parties.\n       (b) Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information Requires \n     Opt-in Consent.--An internet service provider, online service \n     provider, or operator of a commercial website may not--\n       (1) collect sensitive personally identifiable information \n     online, or\n\n[[Page S2960]]\n\n       (2) disclose or otherwise use such information collected \n     online, from a user of that service or website,\n\n     unless the provider or operator obtains that user's \n     affirmative consent to the collection and disclosure or use \n     of that information before, or at the time, the information \n     is collected.\n       (c) Nonsensitive Personally Identifiable Information \n     Requires Robust Notice and Opt-out Consent.--An internet \n     service provider, online service provider, or operator of a \n     commercial website may not--\n       (1) collect personally identifiable information not \n     described in subsection (b) online, or\n       (2) disclose or otherwise use such information collected \n     online, from a user of that service or website,\n\n     unless the provider or operator provides robust \n     notice to the user, in addition to clear and conspicuous \n     notice, and has given the user an opportunity to decline \n     consent for such collection and use by the provider or \n     operator before, or at the time, the information is \n     collected.\n       (d) Initial Notice Only for Robust Notice.--An internet \n     service provider, online service provider, or operator of a \n     commercial website shall provide robust notice under \n     subsection (c) of this section to a user only upon its first \n     collection of non-sensitive personally identifiable \n     information from that user, except that a subsequent \n     collection of additional or materially different non-\n     sensitive personally identifiable information from that user \n     shall be treated as a first collection of such information \n     from that user.\n       (e) Permanence of Consent.--\n       (1) In general.--The consent or denial of consent by a user \n     of permission to an internet service provider, online service \n     provider, or operator of a commercial website to collect, \n     disclose, or otherwise use any information about that user \n     for which consent is required under this Act--\n       (A) shall remain in effect until changed by the user; and\n       (B) shall apply to the collection, disclosure, or other use \n     of that information by any entity that is a commercial \n     successor of, or legal successor-in-interest to, that \n     provider or operator, without regard to the legal form in \n     which such succession was accomplished (including any entity \n     that collects, discloses, or uses such information as a \n     result of a proceeding under chapter 7 or chapter 11 of title \n     11, United States Code, with respect to the provider or \n     operator).\n       (2) Exception.--The consent by a user to the collection, \n     disclosure, or other use of information about that user for \n     which consent is required under this Act does not apply to \n     the collection, disclosure, or use of that information by a \n     successor entity under paragraph (1)(B) if--\n       (A) the kind of information collected by the successor \n     entity about the user is materially different from the kind \n     of information collected by the predecessor entity;\n       (B) the methods of collecting and using the information \n     employed by the successor entity are materially different \n     from the methods employed by the predecessor entity; or\n       (C) the disclosure practices of the successor entity are \n     materially different from the practices of the predecessor \n     entity.\n\n     SEC. 103.

Madam President, just last week I read an article that \ndescribed the practice of online companies placing prices on people's \npersonal information in order to raise revenue. When the Internet \nrevolution began, I do not believe anyone thought the buying and \nselling of our personal information would be where these companies \nwould turn when they began to experience difficulties in the financial \nmarkets. My constituents have expressed to me their concerns over such \npractices, and I have responded by co-sponsoring Senator Hollings' bi-\npartisan legislation to enact reasonable privacy standards on personal \ninformation gathered on-line.\n  In May 2000, the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, issued its third \nreport to Congress on the state of online privacy. Due to the fact that \nthere remained a great deal of concern by consumers over how their \ninformation is used by online companies, so much so that some consumers \nprovided false information or did not utilize the commercial aspects of \nthe Internet altogether, the FTC recommended legislation to establish \nonline privacy guidelines. Introduction of this legislation is a step \nin the right direction, and a step closer to the FTC's recommendation.\n  This bill calls for sensitive, personally identifiable information, \nsuch as health information, race, religion, and social security number, \nto be protected by requiring consumers to provide affirmative consent \nfor this information to be shared; in other words, they must ``opt \nin.'' Under our proposal, the treatment of non-sensitive, personally \nidentifiable information must be described through strict, robust \nnotice in plain English. After some consumers received their privacy \npolicies required by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, they thought it would \nbe easier to understand the tax code.\n  An important provision in the Hollings measure modeled on allowing \nconsumers to access their credit report information would allow online \nconsumers to access and correct any incorrect information companies may \nbe listing. Additionally, to monitor the effectiveness of this \nlegislation, the bill calls for the FTC to report to Congress on this \nmatter and to recommend any needed changes in its provisions.\n  I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation which I \nbelieve moves us in the right direction to actually grow the Internet \nand its capability for commerce by easing people's fears over how their \nnames, addresses, social security numbers and other important \ninformation will be secured. The Internet's possibilities are only \nbeginning to be realized. In the business world, it creates an easy way \nto share information and conduct transactions. However, if the \ninformation is personal in nature, I, along with many of my colleagues, \nbelieve people deserve and are indeed entitled to expect the \nopportunity to elect whether to have that information shared or not, \nand in all cases for it to be securely monitored. I am proud to lend my \nsupport to this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2205. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify the \nentitlement to disability compensation of women veterans who have \nservice-connected mastectomies, to provide permanent authority for \ncounseling and treatment for sexual trauma, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I introduce legislation today that \nwould help VA continue to meet the needs of veterans who experienced \nsexual trauma while serving in the military. This legislation would \nalso extend special compensation to women veterans whose service led to \nthe loss of all or part of a breast, and would help us understand \nbetter how well VA is meeting the health care needs of women veterans.\n  Almost a decade ago, the Committee on Veterans Affairs took a hard \nlook at\n\n[[Page S2964]]\n\nthe growing needs of women veterans in a hearing that helped VA improve \nits women's health care and services. Many studies grew from this \nhearing, including investigations that showed that women veterans are \neight times more likely to report having experienced sexual assault \nduring military service than women civilians of the same age.\n  In 1992, Congress authorized VA to provide counseling to women who \nexperienced sexual trauma during active military service. Two years \nlater, recognizing that sexual trauma is not limited to women, Congress \nexpanded VA's mandate to offer counseling and treatment to victims of \nsexual harassment or sexual assault without regard to gender. The \nVeterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act of 1999 broadened VA's \nresponsibilities toward victims of sexual trauma even farther, \nstrengthening outreach efforts and extending the programs through \nDecember 2004.\n  VA has worked, internally and with the Department of Defense, to \neducate health care professionals about the physical and emotional \nlegacies of military sexual trauma. Those who have endured such trauma \nneed counseling and appropriate treatment, both during and following \nservice. Although we must hope that education will eliminate sexual \nviolence from our forces, the sad reality is that the programs that VA \nhas established will continue to be needed. The legislation I introduce \ntoday would authorize VA to continue its counseling and treatment \nprograms for veterans who have experienced military sexual trauma \nbeyond 2004, so that veterans and health care professionals can depend \nupon these critical services.\n  The Committee on Veterans Affairs continues to await VA's report on \nrates of military sexual trauma among National Guard and Reservists, \nmandated in the Millennium Act and due in March 2001, to make a sound \ndecision on the need for counseling services among these forces who \nmight have experienced sexual trauma while on active duty for training.\n  Last year, Congress authorized VA to offer special monthly \ncompensation to women who had lost one or both breasts, including \nthrough surgical treatment, as a result of their military service. VA \nrecently issued regulations addressing this, which would require \ncomplete loss of a breast through simple or radical mastectomy in order \nto make a woman eligible for benefits. The intent of Congress in \npassing this legislation was to acknowledge that women who undergo such \nprocedures face physical, emotional, and financial challenges in \nreturning to health. The need for increased medical attention, and \nconcomitant impairment in daily activities, remains consistent, whether \nthe loss of a breast is complete or partial. Therefore, the legislation \nthat I offer here would extend benefits to women veterans who have lost \nhalf or more of a breast's tissue as a result of military service, \nrather than drawing an arbitrary clinical line for compensation.\n  According to the Veterans Health Administration, women veterans now \nmake up about 5 percent of enrolled veterans, a percentage that is \nexpected to double over the next two decades. We must ensure that women \nveterans enjoy access to the best possible health care, including for \ngender-specific medical conditions, in the most appropriate setting. \nOne of the challenges that Congress and VA face in assessing how well \nthe needs of women veterans are being met is understanding exactly what \nservices women veterans require, and whether these are being offered by \nVA's medical facilities.\n  Many of the advances VA has made in improving women's care and \nservices has resulted from the hard work of the Women Veterans \nCoordinators who work within VA's medical centers. These coordinators \nassist women veterans who seek VA medical care, and help VA understand \nwhich needs still go unmet, frequently as a collateral portion of their \njobs, while facing many competing demands on their time. As VA health \ncare evolves from a primarily hospital-based system to a network of \noutpatient clinics, women veterans coordinators face an even more \ncomplex set of tasks and a shifting geography of care.\n  Women veterans increasingly receive care within general outpatient \nclinics rather than in women's clinics, an issue of special concern as \nwomen may comprise only a tiny part of the caseload for VA's general \npractitioners, unlike the private sector where women make up half or \nmore of a doctor's patients, resulting in less expertise in women's \nhealth. The legislation I offer here would request a report on how many \nclinics and health care teams remain dedicated specifically to the \nneeds of women veterans, and how many hours per week Women Veterans \nCoordinators can allocate to serving women veterans.\n  In 1983, Congress responded to the needs of the growing number of \nwomen veterans by establishing the Advisory Committee on Women \nVeterans. This committee advises the Secretary of VA on the adequacy of \nprograms for women veterans, and helps ensure that women veterans have \nthe same access to services and benefits as their male counterparts. \nEarly this year, the Secretary renewed the charter for the Advisory \nCommittee on Women Veterans. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nacknowledging both the Secretary's decision to foster this essential \nvoice, and the service of the men and women who share their time and \nexperience with VA on behalf of all women veterans. Together, VA and \nthe advisory committee have worked to be sure that VA can offer women \nveterans the services they need and the respect they have earned.\n  I ask that the text of the bill and a list of the membership of the \nAdvisory Committee on Women Veterans be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2205\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to permit an individual to be treated by a health \ncare practitioner with any method of medical treatment such individual \nrequests, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, last year I introduced S. 1378, the \nAccess to Medical Treatment Act of 2001. This bill would allow patients \nto use certain alternative and complementary therapies not approved by \nthe FDA.\n  Alternative therapies constitute an increasingly accepted part of \nmedicine. At the National Institutes of Health's Office of Alternative \nMedicine, scientists are working to expand our knowledge of alternative \ntherapies and their safe and effective use. Additionally, more \nAmericans are turning to alternative therapies in those frustrating \ninstances in which conventional treatments seem to be ineffective in \ncombating illness and disease.\n  The Access to Medical Treatment Act support patient choice while \nmaintaining important patient safeguards. It allows individuals, \nespecially those who face life-threatening afflictions for which \nconventional treatments have proven ineffective, to try an alternative \ntreatment. This is a choice rightly made by patients.\n  Treatments covered under the Access to Medical Treatment Act must be \nprescribed by an authorized health care practitioner. The practitioner \nmust fully disclose all available information about the safety and \neffectiveness of any medical treatment, including questions that remain \nunanswered because the necessary research has not been conducted. The \nbill includes detailed informed consent requirements.\n  The bill carefully restricts the ability of practitioners to \nadvertise or market unapproved drugs or devices or to profit \nfinancially from prescribing alternative treatments. This provision was \nincluded to ensure that practitioners keep the best interests of \npatients in mind and to retain incentives for seeking FDA approval.\n  The bill also protects patients by requiring practitioners to report \nany adverse reaction that could potentially have been caused by an \nunapproved drug or medical device. If an adverse reaction is reported, \nmanufacture and distribution of the drug must cease pending an \ninvestigation. If it is determined that the adverse reaction was caused \nby the drug or medical device, as part of a total recall, the Secretary \nof the Department of Health and Human Services and the manufacturer \nhave the duty to inform all health care practitioners to whom the drug \nor medical device has been provided.\n  While I believe that S. 1378 would give patients important new \nchoices in health care while maintaining strong consumer protections, \nthere has been little discussion or attention given to the issue. \nMeanwhile, some advocates of greater access to alternative therapies \nhave urged me to reintroduce a version of the Access to Medical \nTreatment Act similar to the one I and 13 other senators introduced \nduring the 105th Congress in an effort to stimulate further discussion \nof this important policy issue. This measure includes less detail than \nS. 1378 but embodies the same goal of making alternative treatments \nmore available to patients who want them.\n  I continue to believe that S. 1378, with its detailed informed \nconsent and practitioner reporting requirements, is the version of the \nAccess to Medical Treatment Act that provides the appropriate vehicle \nfor legislative debate, and I am hopeful that the bill Senators Harkin, \nGrassley, and I are introducing today will generate momentum to get \nthat debate started.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2209. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide an \nadditional program of service disabled veterans' insurance for \nveterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I am tremendously pleased to \nintroduce legislation that would establish a new service-disabled \nveterans life insurance program. Named in honor of Robert Carey, former \nDirector of the Philadelphia Regional Office and Insurance Center until \nhis untimely death in 1990, this bill will improve enormously the life \ninsurance options available to those veterans who are unable to \npurchase commercial policies because they became disabled in service to \nour Nation. I look forward to its swift passage.\n  Since 1919, the Department of Veterans Affairs has provided life \ninsurance for servicemembers and veterans in various amounts and with \nvarying degrees of success, but with the overarching purpose of \nproviding them with an insurance benefit comparable to the commercial \ncoverage that they are unable to purchase due to their service in the \nArmed Forces. Unfortunately, as described in the Department of Veterans \nAffairs' Program Evaluation of Benefits for Survivors of Veterans with \nService-connected Disabilities, which was released last May, the \ncurrent Service-Disabled Veterans Insurance, or SDVI, program does not \nsufficiently fulfill this purpose. .\n  The SDVI program insures service-disabled veterans who, but for their \nservice-connected disability, would be eligible for commercial life \ninsurance. The basic policy currently provides up to $10,000 in \ncoverage. Veterans who are deemed totally disabled are eligible for an \nadditional $20,000 in supplemental coverage and may apply to have the \npremium on their initial $10,000 policy waived.\n  However, according to VA's report, the current SDVI program uses \nmortality tables from 1941 to determine the premiums paid by its \npolicyholders. This has led to premiums nearly four times greater than \nthose paid by non-veterans. While SDVI policyholders would generally \nexpect to pay somewhat higher premiums, many veterans still cited this \nextremely high cost as a major reason for not purchasing an SDVI \npolicy. In light of this fact, it is not difficult to understand why \nonly 3.5 percent of those eligible actually take advantage of the \ncurrent SDVI program.\n  Also cited as a reason for non-participation was the limited benefit \navailable under the current SDVI program. According to VA's report, the \ntypical private sector employee possesses a life insurance policy two \nto three times his or her annual income, and most financial planners \nrecommend even more coverage than that. However, half of all SDVI \nbeneficiaries report receiving less than $15,000 in total insurance \nbenefits from the loss of a loved one. On average, only $9,000 of this \ncomes from their SDVI policy. Forty percent of all SDVI beneficiaries \nsole source of income are the benefits provided by VA. Their lack of \nother coverage, combined with the very limited benefit currently \navailable through the current SDVI program, leaves disabled veterans \nwoefully under-insured. We simply cannot accept this situation.\n  This bill would create a new life insurance program for service-\ndisabled veterans offering as much as $50,000 in coverage at a price \ncomparable to that\n\n[[Page S2966]]\n\nof commercial coverage. It would also bring the premiums charged under \nthe current SDVI program more in line with commercial policies by \nupdating the mortality tables VA uses to set its rates.\n  The motto of the Department of Veterans Affairs is ``To care for him \nthat has borne the battle and for his widow and orphan.'' By \nintroducing the ``Robert Carey Service-Disabled Veterans Insurance Act \nof 2002,'' I propose that we take yet another step toward fulfilling \nthe obligation embodied in those words, and I encourage my colleagues \nto join with me in supporting this very important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2209\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the International Financial Institutions Act \nto provide for modification of the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor \nCountries (HIPC) Initiative; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I rise today, along with my colleague, \nSenator Santorum, to introduce legislation to reform the way we provide \ndebt relief for the poorest nations of the\n\n[[Page S2967]]\n\nworld. We are joined in this effort by Senators Kerry, Frist, Sarbanes, \nChafee, and DeWine.\n  Earlier today, our friends from the House, Chris Smith, John LaFalce, \nSpencer Baucus, Maxine Waters, Barney Frank met with us to announce the \nintroduction of companion legislation on their side of the Hill.\n  Looking around at that group of people, it would be fair to wonder \nwhat we all have in common. Some days, not much. Today, however, what \nwe have in common is a shared concern about the fate of the men, women, \nand children in the poorest countries of the world.\n  It is true that the war on terrorism has brought home to us more \nclearly than before that conditions of grinding poverty in the rest of \nthe world are ignored at our peril. Common sense tells us that our \nnational security is at risk in a world where millions of people have \nlittle to live for, and are ripe for the seductions of radical, even \nviolent action against the desperate conditions they face every day.\n  As Tom Friedman has said in another context, if you don't visit the \nbad neighborhoods, they will visit you.\n  But that cannot be the only reason that we all share a concern about \npoverty in the underdeveloped countries of the world. All of the \nworld's great religions charge us to look after each other, and show \nspecial concern for those who need it most.\n  Common decency recoils at the conditions of disease and deprivation \nfaced by others while we are so blessed with abundance here.\n  Common sense, and common decency. That is what brought us all \ntogether today.\n  Few things offend both common sense and common decency more than the \nsituations faced by the poor countries of the world who lack the \nresources to provide the most basic public health care and the most \nbasic education, but yet still send money to the international \nfinancial institutions established by the wealthiest nations of the \nworld.\n  They send two billion dollars a year here to Washington, home of the \nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and to the regional \ndevelopment banks around the world, to pay interest on loans they have \ntaken out over the years, money that they desperately need for basic \nhuman services.\n  We set up those institutions to promote conditions for global \neconomic growth and stability, and to promote economic development. And \nthey do many good things. But the blessings that came when those loans \nwent out to poor countries in many cases have turned into a curse. Now \nmany of those countries are stuck in a debt trap, where payments to \nsimply service the interest on those loans weaken their ability to \nprovide the kind of essential public services needed for basic human \nexistence, much less sustainable economic growth.\n  Tragically, most of the countries with the greatest debt burdens are \namong the worst victims of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The resources needed \nin African countries in the fight against HIV/AIDS are already beyond \ntheir reach. The burden of debt makes that fight even harder.\n  Two years ago, the United States joined with the other members of the \nIMF and the World Bank to reduce the debt burdens of the Heavily \nIndebted Poor Countries. The world's churches led that fight, the \nJubilee 2000 fight, to undo some of the harm done by this cycle of \ndebt. I was proud to be part of that effort.\n  The result was a real improvement in the debt situation of many \ncountries. Our experience with that program shows that the money we \nfree up with debt relief really does go for the important services the \npoor citizens of these countries really need.\n  As a matter of fact, about 40 percent of the debt savings in those \ncountries is going for education, and 25 percent for health care.\n  But realistically, these countries will still be stuck in a debt trap \nfar into the future.\n  In fact, just this week the Bank and the Fund honestly admitted that \nunder the current formula, many countries will simply not reach a \nsustainable level of debt. James Wolfenson, President of the World \nBank, has said that he is considering deeper debt relief to achieve the \ngoals of the existing HIPC program. The legislation I am introducing \ntoday with Senator Santorum will make success under that HIPC program \nmore likely.\n  Specifically, for the many countries facing a public health crisis, \nsuch as the HIV/AIDS epidemic, we say that no more than five percent of \ntheir budgets should go to service their debt to the international \nfinancial institutions. For those who do not face such a crisis, debt \nservice should exceed no more than ten percent of their budget.\n  While the existing HIPC program sets a sustainable level of debt at \n150 percent of a country's income from exports, our bill says that it \nis also important to measure the debt burden against a country's \nbudget, as well. That's the best way to see the real impact on a \ncountry's ability to meet its own pressing domestic needs.\n  In fact, given the deep problems the eligible nations have with \ntrade--most of them export basic commodities whose prices have been \ndeclining--using export income should not be the sole basis for \ndetermining their ability to pay. The HIPC program currently assumes \nthat the eligible countries will enjoy much higher growth in that \nexport income than they have ever been able to achieve. That is a \nformula for disappointment.\n  Deeper debt relief, more sustainable debt levels, measured by a \ncountry's actual ability to pay as a share of its budget, that is what \nour legislation would establish as the U.S. negotiating position at the \nBank and the Fund. If those reforms are adopted, an additional billion \ndollars a year of debt service will be lifted from the poorest nations.\n  This weekend, the Bank and the Fund will be meeting here in \nWashington, and I expect those very issues will be under discussion. \nThe legislation we are introducing today offers a way to achieve the \noriginal goals of debt relief, and the goals of our own foreign policy \nin the developing world.\n  Common sense, and common decency, should help us find some common \nground to achieve those goals. The broad coalition of support this \nlegislation already enjoys tells me that we can succeed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself and Mr. Cleland):\n  S. 2211. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to apply the \nadditional retired pay percentage for extraordinary heroism to the \ncomputation of the retired pay of enlisted members of the Armed Forces \nwho are retired for any reason, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the \nHeroism Pay Equality Act. This legislation will restore fairness and \nequality to our country's retired military reservists who have been \ncited for extraordinary heroism, by affording them the same \nentitlements offered to their active component counterparts. Current \nlaw awards members with between 20 and 30 years of service who have \nbeen cited for extraordinary heroism in the line of duty an additional \n10 percent to their retirement pay for their heroic acts. Typically, \nthis equates to a service member who has received the Medal of Honor, \nthe Distinguished Service Cross, or the Navy Cross. Yet a service \nmember who has been awarded one of these medals, and whose retirement \neligibility was achieved in the Reserves, is not recognized with the \nsame benefit.\n  This bill erases this injustice, and is offered in the spirit of \nfairness to the total force. The United States is increasingly reliant \non the Reserve component of the armed service to meet the challenges \nthat face our military. Reserve and National Guard units have served \nwith distinction in Bosnia, Kosovo, the Middle East, and are doing so \ntoday in Afghanistan and countless locations across the United States \nas part of our global war on terrorism. The additional pay for heroic \nacts is awarded for the act itself and has nothing to do with the \ncomponent in which retirement eligibility was achieved. Thus, to honor \nour Nation's military reservists, I urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation, which \nSenator Cleland and I are introducing today, be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S2968]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2211\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a direct line of authority for the \nOffice of Trust Reform Implementations and Oversight to oversee the \nmanagement and reform of Indian trust funds and assets under the \njurisdiction of the Department of the Interior and to advance tribal \nmanagement of such funds and assets, pursuant to the Indian Self-\nDeterminations Act and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, today I am introducing a discussion bill \nintended to provide the basis for further reform of the administration \nand management of the assets and funds held by the United States in \ntrust for federally recognized Indian tribes and individual Indians. \nI'm pleased to be joined by my two distinguished colleagues from South \nDakota, Senators Daschle and Johnson.\n  As a result of over 300 treaties and an extensive course of dealings \nbetween the United States and Indian tribes, the Federal Government \nholds the legal title to lands held in trust for Indian tribes and \nindividual tribal members. The revenues derived from the use of these \nlands and the resources found on trust lands, along with the proceeds \nfrom claims that have arisen from the wrongful taking or the loss of \nuse of the assets, comprise the funds that are held in trust by the \nUnited States for the benefit of individual Indians and Indian tribes.\n  Today, the United States maintains approximately 1,400 trust fund \naccounts for 315 Indian tribes with funds in excess of $2.6 billion, \nand over 260,000 individual Indian money, IIM, accounts with about $400 \nmillion in funds. Approximately 45 million acres of land are held in \ntrust by the United States for the benefit of Indian tribes and about \n11 million acres are held in trust for individual Indians. These lands \ncontain vast amounts of minerals, coal, oil and gas, water, forest \nresources, and agricultural resources.\n  These funds, lands, and resources comprise the trust estate held by \nthe United States for the benefit of tribes and individual Indians. The \nInterior Department distributes leasing and sales revenues of $300 \nmillion per year to more than 225,000 individual Indian money accounts \nand about $800 million a year to the 1,400 tribal accounts. It manages \nincome from more than 100,000 active leases for tribes and individual \nIndians.\n  Indian tribes depend on the revenues from these trust assets to \nprovide basic governmental services. IIM account holders are often \nliving at, or near, the poverty level, and they rely on these revenues \nfor basic essentials such as housing, food, and transportation. The \nmanner in which trust assets and trust funds are managed by the \nDepartment has very real impacts on the lives of hundreds of thousands \nof Indian people every day. All too often, those impacts are not \npositive.\n  The administration and management of individual Indian trust assets \nand funds are extremely difficult due to the problem of fractionated \nheirship of lands that are a continuing legacy of the misguided and \ndiscredited allotment policies of the late nineteenth and early \ntwentieth centuries. Today, the Department and individual Indians are \nleft with the nightmare of 1.4 million fractional interests of two \npercent or less involving 58,000 tracts of individually owned trust and \nrestricted lands, each of which requires administration and often \nprovides nothing but frustration in return for all involved. For some \nof these accounts, it may cost more to print and mail statements \nannually than the assets themselves are worth. A lasting solution needs \nto be found that reconsolidates these assets under Indian ownership.\n  Many of my colleagues are familiar with the never-ending stream of \nGAO reports, news accounts, and hearings detailing the deplorable \nhistory of the Federal effort to manage these trust funds. Far less is \nknown about the condition of trust assets and the history of their \nmanagement. However, it doesn't take very long to recognize that the \nproblem of mismanagement extends far beyond trust funds to the lands \nand resources that generate most of the funds. The Interior Department \ncannot provide accurate information on the number of leases on Indian \nlands for any purpose or the amount of revenues that should be \nattributed to any parcel of trust land despite repeated attempts to \ndevelop the necessary database and record keeping systems. In addition, \nthe records for some lands and trust accounts have been lost or \ndestroyed for entire time periods.\n  In 1994, the Congress enacted the American Indian Trust Fund \nManagement Reform Act. This law was intended to bring about a series of \nmajor reforms in the management of Indian trust funds and assets under \nthe auspices of a Special Trustee in the Interior Department. Some \npositive changes have occurred. Most trust account holders now receive \nregular statements on their accounts. Most of the revenues derived from \nIndian trust assets are now posted to the correct account in a \nreasonable period of time.\n  However, the major structural reforms that were called for in the \n1994\n\n[[Page S2969]]\n\nAct have not been achieved. It is still not possible to tell with \ncomplete certainty what tribal lands and resources are leased and what \nrevenues are generated from all tribal lands and resources. The \noriginal intent of the 1994 Act was for the Special Trustee to go out \nof business after completing a plan for the restructuring of the day-\nto-day management of tribal and individual trust funds and assets.\n  The Special Trustee did develop a plan that called for the creation \nof a government sponsored enterprise to take control of the entire \nIndian trust estate and manage it. The tribes and individual \nbeneficiaries of the trust were nearly unanimous in their condemnation \nand rejection of this plan.\n  The 1994 Act also established a procedure through which tribes can \nwithdraw their trust funds from federal trust and manage them directly. \nOnly a few tribes have taken this course. The Interior Department has \nnot encouraged tribes to withdraw their funds and the tribes have been \nreluctant to do so for the simple reason that the federal trust is \nterminated by the act of withdrawing the funds. Anyone who is familiar \nwith the devastation brought about by the various efforts over the \nyears to terminate the unique relationship between the tribes and the \nFederal Government will not be surprised by the lack of success in the \nimplementation of this part of the 1994 Act.\n  The 1994 Act also called for the completion of audits of all \nindividual and tribal trust fund accounts. After years of effort and \nthe expenditure of millions of dollars, in 1997, the Interior \nDepartment finally provided the tribal account holders with a \n``reconciliation'' of their accounts. These reconciliation reports only \ncovered a small fraction of the years the accounts have been maintained \nand the reports were not audits as was required by the 1994 Act. Some \ntribes accepted the results of the reconciliation of their accounts. \nMost did not. None of the IIM accounts were reconciled and have not \nbeen to this day, despite the requirements of the 1994 Act. There are \nno plans to comply with the mandate of the 1994 Act for an actual \naccounting for any of the trust fund accounts. Conducting such an \naccounting would be difficult due to the lack of records. But it can be \naccomplished and every reasonable effort should be made to make sure \nthis important work gets done soon.\n\n  Last fall, Secretary Norton unveiled a proposal to take all of the \ntrust fund and asset management functions out of the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, in order to vest them in a new Bureau of Indian Trust Asset \nManagement, BITAM. This proposal is estimated to have a price tag of \nabout $300 million in its first year or two.\n  Secretary Norton's proposal was intended to respond to the short-\ncomings of the 1994 Act and the orders of Judge Lamberth in the Cobell \nv. Norton litigation that has been in the Federal District Court for \nthe District of Columbia since 1997. This litigation involves the \nindividual trust accounts and seeks an accounting of the funds managed \nby the Departments of the Interior and Treasury since 1887. Past \nfailures to reconcile accounts led to contempt orders against former \nSecretaries Babbitt and Rubin. Judge Lamberth is currently considering \ncontempt orders against Secretary Norton and Assistant Secretary \nMcCaleb for actions they have taken or have failed to take with regard \nto these trust funds and for misleading the court about what is \nactually being done.\n  Indian leaders across the country have condemned Secretary Norton's \nproposal to establish BITAM and have since offered a variety of \nalternative proposals. As I understand it, while the Secretary is \nworking with tribal leaders to evaluate different options proposed by \nthe tribes, the BITAM proposal remains the Department's preferred \noption.\n  Representatives of the Tribes have been working on a range of \npossible reforms through a special Task Force established by Secretary \nNorton at their request. We have been in contact with members of the \nTask Force and am somewhat heartened by the fact that they believe they \nare making real progress toward meaningful reforms. The bill we are \nintroducing is not intended to undermine that process, but will \nhopefully assist it. In any event, we must give careful consideration \nto the recommendations the Task force ultimately develops and try to \nact on them at the appropriate time. I believe Senators Daschle and \nJohnson would join me in urging the Department to continue to work with \nthe Task Force as it completes its work in the months ahead.\n  Even as we monitor these developments, I, and many others in \nCongress, continue to be concerned about the future management of trust \nfunds and assets. We believe that further reform is necessary and that \nit must comport with the Interior Department's trust responsibility at \nthe same time that it advances the self-determination policies that \nhave been so successful in the past 30 years. The status quo is simply \nnot acceptable.\n  Just to reinforce our intent, the bill we are introducing today is \nnot intended to be the ultimate solution to the problems that have been \nrevealed in the management of the trust funds and trust assets. \nHowever, we believe it critical to the on-going reform process to \nintroduce a bill that focuses on two elements that are important to \nachieving a lasting reform in the management of these funds and assets.\n  First, the bill will establish a direct line-of-authority over the \nmanagement of the trust funds and trust assets at the highest levels \nwithin the Department. Judge Lamberth, and other oversight agencies \nsuch as the General Accounting Office, have lamented the lack of \naccountability in the Interior Department and strongly recommended the \ndesignation of one official who will ultimately be responsible for the \nmanagement of the trust funds and assets.\n  This bill addresses this issue by establishing the Office of Trust \nManagement and Reform in the Department of the Interior. This office \nwill be under the authority of a Deputy Secretary who will report \ndirectly to the Secretary and who will oversee the work of the \nAssistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, the special Trustee, the \nDirector of the Minerals Management Service and the Director of the \nBureau of Land Management with regard to trust funds and trust assets.\n  I am certain that many of my colleagues who are concerned about this \nissue will join me in ensuring that candidates nominated by the \nPresident for the Deputy Secretary position are not only qualified in \nfinancial management, natural resource management, and federal Indian \npolicy, but also are widely supported by the tribal community.\n  The new Deputy Secretary will be the person ultimately responsible \nfor the overall management of these funds and assets. The Deputy \nSecretary will have the authority to require the Special Trustee and \nthe Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, along with the Directors of \nthe Bureau of Land Management and the Minerals Management Service, to \ntake the steps necessary to put into place the changes needed to ensure \nthe proper administration and management of the trust funds and assets. \nThe Deputy Secretary will be appointed by the President, subject to the \nadvice and consent of the Senate, for a term of six years and may only \nbe removed for cause. This should give the Deputy Secretary the \nindependence necessary to bring about meaningful reform, while still \nensuring accountability.\n  The current Tribal task force working with the Secretary is \nconsidering a structure for the management of Indian affairs that would \nelevate all of the current responsibilities of the Assistant Secretary \nfor Indian Affairs, the Special Trustee, and the Deputy Commissioner, \nto the Deputy Secretary level in the Department. We look forward to \nlearning more about the scope of the Task Force proposal and its costs \nor cost savings. As necessary, this bill can be modified to accommodate \nsuch a proposal if the Task Force concludes that doing so would be \nappropriate.\n  This Task Force has served an important role to the tribes in working \nwith the Department on these matters and many would like to see its \nfunction continue as a collaborative component to the Department's \nmanagement. In order to ensure a continuing role for the tribes in the \nday-to-day activities of the Department with respect to the management \nof the trust funds and the trust assets, this bill amends the 1994 Act \nto provide that the advisory board\n\n[[Page S2970]]\n\nthat was established to assist the Special Trustee will be \nreconstituted and continue as an advisory board for the Deputy \nSecretary. The composition of the advisory board is broad enough to \nenable the Deputy Secretary to include members with expertise in the \nareas of trust fund management, investment, and related \nresponsibilities of the Deputy Secretary.\n  The other major feature of the bill is the focus on the successful \npolicy of self-determination. Any fair review of Federal Indian policy \nover the course of the last century will point to the policies of \ntermination and assimilation through allotment as abject failures. Many \nof the most intractable problems the tribes and federal policy makers \nwrestle with today stem from the wreckage caused by these misguided \npolicies of the past.\n  On the other hand, the policy of self-determination, which was first \nproposed by President Nixon in 1971, has shown itself to be the single \nmost successful Federal Indian policy in the history of our Nation. The \nreasons for this success are many, but the core reason is one we can \nall recognize and relate to: self-determination involves Indian people \ndirectly in identifying and defining the problems facing the tribes, \nand more importantly, it empowers them to implement the solutions they \nknow will work best. Putting it in slightly different terms, the self-\ndetermination policy recognizes the fact that the government closest to \nthe people is the best government to recognize and resolve local \nproblems. Indian policy made by the Federal Government for the Federal \nGovernment has never worked and never will work. Indian policy made by \nthe tribal governments with appropriate Federal assistance has shown \nthat it does work.\n  Portions of the 1994 Act and Secretary Norton's BITAM proposal have \nsome things in common. In varying degrees, both are attempts by the \nFederal Government to make Indian policy for the federal government. \nNeither provides a proper role for tribal governments. This bill \nprovides a framework by which tribes can become more involved in the \nday-to-day management of their trust assets and trust funds through the \nIndian Self-Determination Act. It does not dismantle the BIA. It does \nprovide a foundation for the tribes, the Department, and the Congress \nto develop and implement meaningful reform over the next several years. \nEvery major provision of this bill is based on solutions that have been \nproposed by the tribes.\n  The bill builds on the concept of beneficiary co-management of trust \nfunds and assets. This is not a new idea. It was advanced by the tribes \nin the 1980's and 1990's. It is embodied in the Indian Forest Resources \nManagement Act that Congress enacted in 1990 and the Indian \nAgricultural Resources Management Act enacted in 1994. It is implicit \nin the Indian Self-Determination Act and it is a proven formula for \nprogress.\n  This bill does not deal with the issues of the past. It does not \naddress concerns about claims for past mismanagement. It does not deal \nwith the need for an accounting of tribal and individual trust funds. \nIt does not deal with the condition of the trust lands and assets. \nThese are all very serious matters.\n  My purpose is not to avoid these issues or indicate any disregard for \nthem. Rather, we are simply trying to find a way to move forward on a \nmore constructive basis. Representatives of the tribes have been \nworking on a way to move forward on these issues a more constructive \nbasis. We must give careful consideration to the recommendations they \ndevelop and try to act on them at the appropriate time.\n  Both the House and the Senate recently passed S. 1857 to deal with \nthe statute of limitations on past claims for mismanagement of the \ntribal trust funds. Judge Lamberth is considering remedies for \nmismanagement of the individual Indian trust funds. Secretary Norton \nhas established the Office of Historical Trust Accounting to try to \nproduce an accounting for the individual funds. We need to monitor all \nof these efforts and be prepared to enact additional legislation if \nnecessary and if sought by the tribes.\n  We are hopeful that we can build on the modest successes realized \nunder the 1994 Act by providing greater accountability in the \nDepartment of the Interior and recognizing the fact that the tribes \nmust be involved as active participants in the management and \nadministration of the trust funds and assets without the threat of \ntermination of the trust responsibility. It took over 100 years to \ncreate the problems we now confront with the Indian trust funds and \nassets. The Indian people did not create these problems. The Federal \nGovernment did. It is going to take many more years to resolve the \nproblems. The 1994 Act was a step in the right direction. We believe \nthis bill can lead to further progress through greater accountability \nand direct involvement of those who have the most at stake, the tribes \nand Indian people.\n  Once again, Senators Daschle, Johnson and I propose this legislation \nas a vehicle for discussion for all those concerned with ending decades \nof mismanagement of Indian trust funds and trust assets. We look \nforward to receiving comments on this legislation and call on our \nfriend, the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, to use this \nbill as the basis for hearings on these matters when the committee is \nprepared to do so.\n  I ask that the bill and a section-by-section summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2212\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The existing responsibilities of the Assistant \n     Secretary for Indian Affairs and the Special Trustee would \n     not be affected by the duties of the Deputy Secretary, except \n     that each will be required to report to the Deputy Secretary \n     on matters involving trust funds and trust assets.\n       This section also provides for the establishment of the \n     Office of Trust Reform Implementation and Oversight which \n     shall be headed by the Deputy Secretary and which will be \n     responsible for the supervision of the day-to-day activities \n     of the Assistant Secretary, the Special Trustees, the \n     Director of the Bureau of Land Management and the Director of \n     the Minerals Management Service in their administration of \n     management of any Indian trust funds or assets, consistent \n     with the provisions of Title II of the Act, as amended.\n       The duties of the Office of Trust Reform include: \n     authorization to require the development and maintenance of \n     an accurate inventory of all trust properties, funds and \n     other assets; ensure the prompt posting of revenues derived \n     from trust funds, properties and assets; ensure that trust \n     fund account holders receive monthly statements; ensure that \n     trust fund accounts are audited at least once a year or more \n     frequently if necessary; ensure that the Secretary receives \n     current and accurate information relating to \n     the administration and management of trust funds, \n     properties and assets; provide for regular consultation \n     with trust fund account holders to ensure the greatest \n     return on trust assets and properties for the trust \n     account holders; and enter into contracts and compacts \n     under the Indian Self-Determination Act to provide for the \n     management of trust assets and funds by Indian tribes.\n       Such sums as maybe necessary are authorized to be \n     appropriated to carry out the provisions of Section 307 of \n     the Act.\n       Paragraph (c) of Section 2 amends Section 306 of the 1994 \n     Act to reconstitute the Advisory Board for the Special \n     Trustee as the Advisory Board for the Deputy Secretary.

The Board will not be subject to the Federal Advisory \n     Committee Act.\n       Paragraph (d) of Section 2 sets forth conforming amendments \n     to Section 302 and Section 303 of the 1994 Act.\n\n\n        Section 3. Indian Participation in Trust Fund Activities\n\n       Section 3 amends the 1994 Act by striking Sections 202 and \n     203 of the Act relating to the withdrawal of trust funds and \n     the termination of the trust responsibility. It inserts a new \n     Section 202 to provide for the development and implementation \n     of Indian Trust Fund and Trust Asset Management and \n     Monitoring Plans by the Secretary and Indian tribes pursuant \n     to the Indian Self-Determination Act. Indian tribes are to be \n     afforded broad discretion in designing and carrying out the \n     planning process. Funds and assets held in trust for multiple \n     individuals may be included in a Tribal Plan with the consent \n     of a majority of the individuals who hold an interest in any \n     such assets or funds.\n       If a Tribe chooses not to develop or implement a plan, the \n     Secretary is required to do so in close consultation with the \n     affected Tribe.\n       Each plan is required to: determine the amount and source \n     of funds held in trust; identify and prepare an inventory of \n     all trust assets; identify specific tribal goals and \n     objectives; establish management objectives for the funds and \n     assets held in trust; define the critical values of the \n     Indian tribe and provide identified management objectives; \n     use existing surveys, reports and other research from Federal \n     agencies, tribal community colleges and land grant \n     universities; and, be completed within three years after the \n     start of activity to establish a plan.\n       Approved plans will govern the management and \n     administration of funds and assets held in trust by the \n     Secretary and the Indian Tribes. The development and \n     implementation of a plan by an Indian Tribe or the Secretary \n     does not require the termination of the trust responsibility \n     and shall not be construed or deemed to constitute a \n     termination of the trust status of the assets or funds that \n     are included in or subject to the Plan. An Indian tribe shall \n     not be liable for waste or loss of a trust asset or trust \n     funds if it is acting in accordance with an approved plan.\n       The Secretary is required to conduct all trust fund and \n     trust asset management activities in accordance with tribal \n     law and to provide assistance in the enforcement of tribal \n     law unless doing so is prohibited by Federal law or would be \n     contrary to the trust responsibility of the United States. \n     The Secretary may waive any regulations or administrative \n     policies of the Department of the Interior that are in \n     conflict with Tribal law or an approved plan unless such a \n     waiver would constitute a violation of a Federal statute or \n     judicial decision or would conflict with the Secretary's \n     trust responsibility.\n       This Section of the Act does not constitute a waiver of the \n     sovereign immunity of the United States or authorize Tribal \n     justice systems to review actions of the Secretary. Nothing \n     in this Section shall be construed to diminish or expand the \n     trust responsibility of the United States toward Indian trust \n     funds and assets held in trust.\n       Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment, and \n     annually thereafter, the Secretary is required to file a \n     report with the Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate and \n     the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives.\n       The report shall detail: the efforts of the Department to \n     implement this Section; the nature and extent of the \n     consultation between the Department, Tribes and individual \n     Indians with respect to the implementation of this section; \n     and, any recommendations of the Department for further \n     changes to the Act, along with a record of the Department's \n     consultation with Tribes and individual Indians regarding \n     such recommendations.\n\n\n                         section 4. regulations\n\n       Section 4 requires the Secretary to promulgate regulations \n     for the implementation\n\n[[Page S2973]]\n\n     of the amendments to the Act within one year after enactment, \n     with the full and active participation of the Indian tribes \n     that have trust funds and assets held by the Secretary.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, today I am joining with Senators John \nMcCain and Tim Johnson to introduce a legislation that is intended to \nfocus attention on the need to address and correct the longstanding \nproblem of inefficient management of the assets and funds held by the \nUnited States in trust for federally recognized Indian tribes and \nindividual American Indians.\n  Indian Country has faced many challenges over the years. Few, \nhowever, have been more important, or more difficult, than ending the \nmismanagement of the Indian trust fund and restoring integrity to this \nadministrative process.\n  For over 100 years, the Department of Interior has managed a trust \nfunded with the proceeds of leasing of oil, gas, land, and mineral \nrights for the benefit of Indian people. Today, the trust fund may owe \nas much as $10 billion to as many as 500,000 Indians.\n  To give some perspective, the 16 tribes of the Great Plains in South \nDakota, North Dakota, and Nebraska comprise 10 million acres of trust \nlands representing over one-third of the trust accounts. Many enrolled \nmembers of the nine South Dakota tribes have trust accounts.\n  How these trust funds have been and will be managed is being \nlitigated in Cobell versus Norton, and the resolution of this lawsuit \nwill have far-reaching implications throughout Indian country. It is \nimpossible not to evaluate potential solutions in the context of this \nlawsuit.\n  There is clear consensus in Indian Country that the current \nadministration of the trust fund is a failure. The daunting question \nhas always been how to reform it.\n  Last fall, the Secretary of the Interior unveiled plans to reorganize \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA and segregate the oversight and \naccounting of trust-related assets in a new Bureau of Indian Trust \nAsset Management, BITAM. In testimony before the U.S. District Court, \nshe acknowledged that, ``We undoubtedly do have some missing data--and \nwe are all going to have to find a way to deal with the fact that some \ninformation no longer exists.''\n  The Secretary's controversial reorganization proposal was presented \nto the court in a hasty effort to avoid being held in contempt of court \nwith minimal consultation with the tribes or individual Indian account \nholders, not to mention Congress. In South Dakota, tribal leaders \ncommunicated to Tim Johnson and me their concern that the Secretary's \nsolution appeared to be a fait accompli, conceived without meaningful \nparticipation of the stakeholders most directly affected by it. They \nfelt strongly that this proposal should not be implemented without \nfurther consultation with the tribes.\n  Earlier this year, in the face of administration assurances that its \nreorganization plan was not set in stone, the Interior Department \nrequested that $200 million from the BIA and $100 million from the \nOffice of the Special Trustee, be reprogrammed to ``a single \norganization that will report to the Secretary through an Assistant \nSecretary, Indian Trust.'' This contradiction set off red flags in \nCongress, and a clear and direct message was sent to Secretary Norton \nby Senators Inouye, Campbell, Byrd, Johnson and others that no action \nshould be taken to implement her proposed reorganization plan \nadministratively.\n\n  Given these developments, Senators McCain, Johnson, and I felt that \nCongress should be more assertive in forcing discussing about what role \nCongress might play in ensuring that tribes and individual Indian \naccount holders have a voice on shaping trust reform policy. It is our \nhope that this bill will stimulate better dialogue among the Congress, \nthe Interior Department, and Indian Country on this problem.\n  With that goal in mind, the bill has been reviewed by representatives \nof the Great Plains tribes at a meeting in Rapid City. Mike Jandreau, \nchairman of the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, has been an effective advocate \nand champion of trust reform, not only for his tribe, but also for all \nIndian people. Mike and Flandreau-Santee Sioux Tribal chairman and \nGreat Plains Tribal chairman's association president, Tom Ranfranz led \na very impressive and productive working session with tribal leaders \nfrom South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Montana, and Wyoming that \nboth raised awareness of the stakes of this issue and built support for \nthe bill that is being introduced today.\n  I commend the willingness of these participating tribal leaders to be \na part of a public process that will hopefully not stop until Indian \ncountry feels comfortable with a final product they create. The McCain-\nJohnson-Daschle bill is intended to be a starting point for promoting \ngreater understanding of what needs to occur to achieve meaningful \ntrust reform.\n  At this point, I would like to share with my colleagues some initial \nobservations on this proposal that were raised yesterday by \nparticipating South Dakota treaty tribes and tribes of the Great Plains \nand Rocky Mountain regions. These comments demonstrate how thoughtfully \nIndian leaders are approaching the trust problem, and I fully expect \nthat their suggestions will be considered and incorporated as the bill \nmoves through the committee process.\n  The following issues are of great importance to the Great Plains \nTribal Chairman's Association.\n  Providing the Deputy Secretary with sufficient authority to ensure \nthat reform of the administration of trust assets is permanent; They do \nnot believe the bill at present gives the Deputy Secretary the full and \nunified authority needed.\n  Including cultural resources as a trust asset for management \npurposes.\n  Incorporating the Office of Surface Mining and Bureau of Reclamation \nand other related agencies within the Department of Interior and the \nFederal government under the purview of the Deputy Secretary.\n  Assuring that the legislation not infringe on tribal sovereingnty by \ninterfeering with tribal involvement in the management of individual \ntrust assets or tribal assets, or both.\n  Maintaining the Bureau of Indian Affair's role as an advocate for \ntribe.\n  Maintaining current levels of Bureau of Indian Affairs employment.\n  Applying Indian employment preference to all positions created by the \nlegislation.\n  Providing in law that Bureau of Indian Affairs funds not be used to \nfund the Deputy Secretary appointed by the legislation.\n  Stressing the importance of appropriating adequate funding allow \nreform to succeed.\n  Reflecting in the legislative history that much of the funding needed \nfor real trust reform be allocated at the local agency and regional \nlevels of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  Placing more tribal representatives, including tribal resources \nmanagers, from the various Bureau of Indian Affairs regions on the \nadvisory board to the Office of Trust Reform.\n  The issues of trust reform and reorganization within the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs are nothing new to us here on Capitol Hill, or in Indian \nCountry. Collectively, we have endured many efforts, some well \nintentioned and some clearly not, to fix, reform, adjust, improve, \nstreamline, downsize, and even terminate the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nand its trust activities.\n  These efforts have been pursued in both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. Unfortunately, they have rarely sought meaningful \ninvolvement from tribal leadership, or recognized the Federal \nGovernment's treaty obligation to tribes.\n  Both meaningful consultation and acceptance of tribal status are \ncritical if we expect to find a workable solution to the very real \nproblem of trust management. The bill Senators McCain, Johnson, and I \nare introducing today reflects this conviction.\n  There is no more important challenge facing the tribes and their \nrepresentatives in Congress than that of restoring accountability and \nefficiency to trust management. And nowhere do the bedrock principles \nof self-determination and tribal sovereignty come more into play than \nin the management and distribution of trust funds and assets.\n  This measure recognizes that the only effective long-term solution to \nthe trust problem must be based on government-to-government dialog. I\n\n[[Page S2974]]\n\nbelieve the discussion the bill generates will not only provide the \ncatalyst for meaningful tribal involvement in the search for solutions \nbut also form the basis for true trust reform. I look forward to \nparticipating with tribal leaders in pursuit of this important \nobjective.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenator John McCain and Senator Tom Daschle, as sponsors of the Indian \nTrust Asset and Trust Fund Management and Reform Act of 2002. This \nlegislation we are introducing today is intended as simply the first \nstep in the legislative process as we continue to work closely with \ntribes to address the need for further reform of the management of the \ntrust funds and assets that have been mismanaged for decades. I am \nhopeful that by taking this action today, we will begin to further the \ndiscussion of this critical issue, knowing full well that there will be \nongoing consultation and input from tribal leaders and tribal members \nall across the country.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, the issue of trust fund \nmismanagement is one of the most urgent problems we are faced with in \nIndian Country. Of all the extraordinary circumstances we find in \nIndian Country, and especially in South Dakota, I do not think there is \nany more complex, more difficult and more shocking than the \ncircumstances we have surrounding trust fund mismanagement.\n  This problem has persisted literally for generations, and continues \ntoday. Administrations of both political parties have been inadequate \nin their response, and the level of direction and the resources \nprovided by Congresses over past decades has also been sadly \ninadequate. The Federal Government, by law, is to be the trustee for \nNative American people. When the Trust Fund Management Act of 1994 was \npassed, I was hopeful that this accounting situation would at last be \nremedied. Unfortunately, this has not been the case.\n  Last year's attempt by Secretary Norton and the Department of the \nInterior to address this ongoing problem has also fallen far short of \nwhat is needed. In fact, Indian leaders all across the country widely \nopposed the plan released by the Secretary last November to create a \nnew Bureau of Indian Trust Asset Management, BITAM. Unfortunately, the \nSecretary released the Department's plan without seeking input and \nconsulting with the very people who are supposed to benefit from these \ntrust fund accounts.\n  Many tribal leaders have offered counter proposals to the \nDepartment's plan, however, Secretary Norton continues to stand behind \nand defend BITAM as the best alternative to addressing this problem. I \nbelieve it is now time for Congress to attempt once again to make real \nprogress on this issue. As I stated earlier, the bill my colleagues and \nI have introduced today is not intended to be a final product, but \nrather the beginning of a process that will lead to further \nimprovements, revisions and refinements based on the continued input of \ntribal leadership.\n  One of the main provisions of our legislation is to establish the \nposition of a Deputy Secretary for Trust Management and Reform in the \nDepartment of the Interior. The Deputy Secretary will be appointed by \nthe President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a term of \n6 years and may only be removed for cause. The Deputy Secretary will \nreport directly to the Secretary and will be responsible for the \noversight of all trust fund and trust asset administration and \nmanagement, including consultation with Indian tribes. It is my hope \nthat the Deputy Secretary is provided the adequate authority to \nadminister the trust assets and to ensure that reform of the \nadministration of trust assets is permanent.\n  In addition, we must maintain and strengthen the integrity of \nservices of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA, as the primary agency \nproviding trust services directly to tribes. This reorganization should \nnot by any means diminish the BIA in it's role as advocate for tribes \nand must include the necessary funding to allow for real trust reform \nto be implemented at the regional and agency levels.\n  We have already benefitted from the input of the many tribal \nofficials in South Dakota, including the input of the Great Plains \nTribal Region and Montana Wyoming Tribal Leaders' Council. I would like \nto take this opportunity to thank Mike Jandreau, chairman of the Lower \nBrule Sioux Tribe and a member of the Interior Department's Tribal Task \nForce, as well as Tom Ranfranz, president of the Flandreau Santee and \nchairman of the Great Plains Tribal Chairman's Association for their \nadvice and counsel as we attempt to address the many challenges facing \ntrust reform. Their important insight into the trust fund management \nissues and their leadership, along with the other tribal chairs in the \nGreat Plains and Rocky Mountain Regions who have been very helpful to \nme as we to address the shortcomings of the Department's plan and try \nto find a legislative approach that will finally begin to improve this \nsituation,.\n  Madam President, I have high hopes that this issue may finally be \nlaid to rest. It is crucial that the first Americans of this proud \ncountry be treated with the dignity and respect that has been so sadly \nlacking for far too long. This legislation provides a new foundation \nfrom which we may once again begin to rebuild the trust that the U.S. \nGovernment has, in the eyes of the Indian people, let crumble into the \nrubble of a bureaucratic maze.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself,\n  Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Schumer, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2214. A bill to provide compensation and income tax relief for the \nindividuals who were victims of the terrorist-related bombing of the \nWorld Trade Center in 1993 on the same basis as compensation and income \ntax relief is provided to victims of the terrorist-related aircraft \ncrashes on September 11, 2001; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, today along with Senators Torricelli, \nSchumer and Clinton, I am introducing legislation to ensure that the \nfamilies of the victims of the 1993 World Trade Center terrorist \nbombing receive the same compensation for their devastating losses as \nthose whose loved ones perished in the horrific attacks of September \n11. They too deserve aid in rebuilding their lives and it is up to \nCongress to make certain their needs are met and their losses \nacknowledged. I am pleased to join my colleague Representative Robert \nMenendez of New Jersey, who has introduced this legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  On February 26, 1993, a car bomb exploded on the second level of the \nWorld Trade Center parking basement. The blast injured over 1,000 \npeople working in the towers and left 6 individuals dead. Among those \nlost was 57-year-old William Macko of Bayonne, NJ.\n  I recently met with the Macko family to discuss their loss and their \nstruggle for recovery. Though it has been nearly a decade since \nWilliam's death, it is clear that they are still suffering from the \nunimaginable pain of his loss. And as though this tragedy is not enough \nfor them to bear, the family was dealt yet another blow when Carol, \nWilliam's widow, was diagnosed with cancer just nine months after \nlosing her husband.\n  Congress has responded with tremendous generosity to the tragedy of \nSeptember 11, creating a Victim Compensation Fund to compensate those \ninjured and the families of those deceased for economic and non-\neconomic losses, as well as providing substantial Federal income tax \nrelief.\n  These programs should also be made available to those who lost loved \nones in the World Trade Center bombing of 1993. They too should be \ncompensated for the unbearable pain and sorrow they endured at the \nhands of terrorists. That is why I am introducing the 1993 World Trade \nCenter Victims Compensation Act, which would include those injured or \nkilled in the 1993 bombing in both the Victim Compensation Fund and \nVictims Tax Relief.\n  When I met with the Macko family, they asked that William's death not \nbe forgotten or dismissed. They asked for Congress to ensure that their \nsuffering and that of the other families who lost loved ones on that \ncold February day be recognized as well. Their request was clear and \nsimple, and we must not let them down.\n  I urge my colleagues to show their support for these families and \ncosponsor this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Santorum):\n\n[[Page S2975]]\n\n  S. 2215. A bill to halt Syrian support for terrorism, end its \noccupation of Lebanon, stop its development of weapons of mass \ndestruction, cease its illegal importation of Iraqi oil and by so doing \nhold Syria accountable for its role in the Middle East, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, today Senator Santorum and I are proud \nto introduce the Syria Accountability Act, a bill that will ensure that \nSyria is held accountable for its actions in the Middle East and for \nits support of international terrorism.\n  As a state-sponsor of terrorism, Syria has supported and provided \nsafe haven to several terrorist groups, such as Hizballah, Hamas, and \nthe Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. This is in violation \nof U.N. Security Council resolutions that call on U.N. member states to \nrefrain from providing any form of support, active or passive, to \nentities or persons involved in terrorist acts.\n  Syria is also in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions that \ncall for the sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon. More \nthan 20,000 Syrian troops and security personnel occupy much of the \nsovereign territory of Lebanon and it is time for them to leave.\n  The legislation we are offering today would expand sanctions on Syria \nuntil the President certifies that Syria has met four conditions.\n  First, that it does not support international terrorist groups;\n  Second, that it has withdrawn all military, intelligence, and other \nsecurity personnel from Lebanon;\n  Third, that it has stopped developing ballistic missiles and has \nstopped the development and production of biological and chemical \nweapons; and\n  Fourth, that it no longer in violation of relevant U.N. Security \nCouncil Resolutions.\n  To give maximum flexibility to the President, we have included a \n``menu'' of sanctions for the President to choose from and a provision \nthat would waive sanctions should the President find that it is in the \nnational security interest of the United States.\n  I hope my colleagues can support this legislation and ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2215\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Syria Accountability Act of \n     2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On September 20, 2001, President George Bush stated at \n     a joint session of Congress that ``[e]very nation, in every \n     region, now has a decision to make . . . [e]ither you are \n     with us, or you are with the terrorists . . . [f]rom this day \n     forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support \n     terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile \n     regime''.\n       (2) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 \n     (September 28, 2001) mandates that all states ``refrain from \n     providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities \n     or persons involved in terrorist acts'', take ``the necessary \n     steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts'', and \n     ``deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support, or \n     commit terrorist acts''.\n       (3) The Government of Syria is currently prohibited by \n     United States law from receiving United States assistance \n     because it is listed as state sponsor of terrorism.\n       (4) Although the Department of State lists Syria as a state \n     sponsor of terrorism and reports that Syria provides ``safe \n     haven and support to several terrorist groups'', fewer United \n     States sanctions apply with respect to Syria than with \n     respect to any other country that is listed as a state \n     sponsor of terrorism.\n       (5) Terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, the \n     Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the \n     Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command \n     maintain offices, training camps, and other facilities on \n     Syrian territory and operate in areas of Lebanon occupied by \n     the Syrian armed forces and receive supplies from Iran \n     through Syria.\n       (6) United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 \n     (September 17, 1982) calls for ``strict respect of the \n     sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political \n     independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive \n     authority of the Government of Lebanon through the Lebanese \n     Army throughout Lebanon''.\n       (7) More than 20,000 Syrian troops and security personnel \n     occupy much of the sovereign territory of Lebanon exerting \n     undue influence upon its government and undermining its \n     political independence.\n       (8) Since 1990 the Senate and House of Representatives have \n     passed seven bills and resolutions which call for the \n     withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon.\n       (9) Large and increasing numbers of the Lebanese people \n     from across the political spectrum in Lebanon have mounted \n     peaceful and democratic calls for the withdrawal of the \n     Syrian Army from Lebanese soil.\n       (10) Israel has withdrawn all of its armed forces from \n     Lebanon in accordance with United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 425 (March 19, 1978), as certified by the United \n     Nations Secretary General.\n       (11) Even in the face of this United Nations certification \n     that acknowledged Israel's full compliance with Resolution \n     425, Syria permits attacks by Hizballah and other militant \n     organizations on Israeli outposts at Shebaa Farms, under the \n     false guise that it remains Lebanese land, and is also \n     permitting attacks on civilian targets in Israel.\n       (12) Syria will not allow Lebanon--a sovereign country--to \n     fulfill its obligation in accordance with Security Council \n     Resolution 425 to deploy its troops to southern Lebanon.\n       (13) As a result, the Israeli-Lebanese border and much of \n     southern Lebanon is under the control of Hizballah which \n     continues to attack Israeli positions and allows Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guards and other militant groups to operate \n     freely in the area, destabilizing the entire region.\n       (14) The United States provides $40,000,000 in assistance \n     to the Lebanese people through private nongovernmental \n     organizations, $7,900,000 of which is provided to Lebanese-\n     American educational institutions.\n       (15) In the State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, \n     President Bush declared that the United States will ``work \n     closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state \n     sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and \n     deliver weapons of mass destruction''.\n       (16) The Government of Syria continues to develop and \n     deploy short and medium range ballistic missiles.\n       (17) The Government of Syria is pursuing the development \n     and production of biological and chemical weapons.\n       (18) United Nations Security Council Resolution 661 (August \n     6, 1990) and subsequent relevant resolutions restrict the \n     sale of oil and other commodities by Iraq, except to the \n     extent authorized by other relevant resolutions.\n       (19) Syria, a non-permanent United Nations Security Council \n     member, is receiving between 150,000 and 200,000 barrels of \n     oil from Iraq in violation of Security Council Resolution 661 \n     and subsequent relevant resolutions.\n       (20) Syrian President Bashar Assad promised Secretary of \n     State Powell in February 2001 to end violations of Security \n     Council Resolution 661 but this pledge has not been \n     fulfilled.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Government of Syria should immediately and \n     unconditionally halt support for terrorism, permanently and \n     openly declare its total renunciation of all forms of \n     terrorism, and close all terrorist offices and facilities in \n     Syria, including the offices of Hamas, Hizballah, the Popular \n     Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front \n     for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command;\n       (2) the Government of Syria should immediately declare its \n     commitment to completely withdraw its armed forces, including \n     military, paramilitary, and security forces, from Lebanon, \n     and set a firm timetable for such withdrawal;\n       (3) the Government of Lebanon should deploy the Lebanese \n     armed forces to all areas of Lebanon, including South \n     Lebanon, in accordance with United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982), in order to assert the \n     sovereignty of the Lebanese state over all of its territory, \n     and should evict all terrorist and foreign forces from \n     southern Lebanon, including Hizballah and the Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guards;\n       (4) the Government of Syria should halt the development and \n     deployment of short and medium range ballistic missiles and \n     cease the development and production of biological and \n     chemical weapons;\n       (5) the Government of Syria should halt illegal imports and \n     transshipments of Iraqi oil and come into full compliance \n     with United Nations Security Council Resolution 661 and \n     subsequent relevant resolutions;\n       (6) the Governments of Lebanon and Syria should enter into \n     serious unconditional bilateral negotiations with the \n     Government of Israel in order to realize a full and permanent \n     peace; and\n       (7) the United States should continue to provide \n     humanitarian and educational assistance to the people of \n     Lebanon only through appropriate private, nongovernmental \n     organizations and appropriate international organizations, \n     until such time as the Government of Lebanon asserts \n     sovereignty and control over all of its territory and borders \n     and achieves full political independence, as called for in \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 520.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States that--\n       (1) Syria will be held responsible for all attacks \n     committed by Hizballah and other terrorist groups with \n     offices or other facilities in Syria, or bases in areas of \n     Lebanon occupied by Syria;\n\n[[Page S2976]]\n\n       (2) the United States will work to deny Syria the ability \n     to support acts of international terrorism and efforts to \n     develop or acquire weapons of mass destruction;\n       (3) the Secretary of State will continue to list Syria as a \n     state sponsor of terrorism until Syria ends its support for \n     terrorism, including its support of Hizballah and other \n     terrorist groups in Lebanon and its hosting of terrorist \n     groups in Damascus, and comes into full compliance with \n     United States law relating to terrorism and United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 1373 (September 28, 2001);\n       (4) the full restoration of Lebanon's sovereignty, \n     political independence, and territorial integrity is in the \n     national security interest of the United States;\n       (5) Syria is in violation of United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982) through its \n     continued occupation of Lebanese territory and its \n     encroachment upon its political independence;\n       (6) Syria's obligation to withdraw from Lebanon is not \n     conditioned upon progress in the Israeli-Syrian or Israeli-\n     Lebanese peace process but derives from Syria's obligation \n     under Security Council Resolution 520;\n       (7) Syria's acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and \n     ballistic missile programs threaten the security of the \n     Middle East and the national interests of the United States;\n       (8) Syria is in violation of United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 661 (August 6, 1990) and subsequent \n     relevant resolutions through its continued purchase of oil \n     from Iraq; and\n       (9) the United States will not provide any assistance to \n     Syria and will oppose multilateral assistance for Syria until \n     Syria withdraws its armed forces from Lebanon, halts the \n     development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction and \n     ballistic missiles, and complies with Security Council \n     Resolution 661 and subsequent relevant resolutions.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Res. 246\n\n       Whereas the USS Pueblo, which was attacked and captured by \n     the North Korean Navy on January 23, 1968, was the first \n     United States Navy ship to be hijacked on the high seas by a \n     foreign military force in over 150 years;\n       Whereas 1 member of the USS Pueblo crew, Duane Hodges, was \n     killed in the assault while the other 82 crew members were \n     held in captivity, often under inhumane conditions, for 11 \n     months;\n       Whereas the USS Pueblo, an intelligence collection \n     auxiliary vessel, was operating in international waters at \n     the time of the capture, and therefore did not violate North \n     Korean territorial waters;\n       Whereas the capture of the USS Pueblo resulted in no \n     reprisals against the Government or people of North Korea and \n     no military action at any time; and\n       Whereas the USS Pueblo, though still the property of the \n     United States Navy, has been retained by North Korea for more \n     than 30 years, was subjected to exhibition in the North \n     Korean cities of Wonsan and Hungham, and is now on display in \n     Pyongyang, the capital city of North Korea: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) demands the return of the USS Pueblo to the United \n     States Navy; and\n       (2) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit copies \n     of this resolution to the President, the Secretary of \n     Defense, and the Secretary of State.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, I am pleased to introduce this \nresolution which recognizes and demands that the government of North \nKorea return the ship the USS Pueblo to the United States Navy.\n  On January 23, 1968, while in international waters, the USS Pueblo \nwas attacked and illegally captured by the North Korean Navy. This \nengagement marked the first time in over 150 years a United States Navy \nship was hijacked on the high seas by a foreign military force. This \nnaked act of aggression resulted in 82 crew members being held in \ncaptivity as Prisoners of War for eleven months in inhumane conditions \nwith one casualty, Duane Hodges who was killed during the initial \nassault. On December 23, 1968, the USS Pueblo crew was finally \nreleased. At the time of its capture, the USS Pueblo was operating as \nan intelligence collection auxiliary vessel, and did not pose a threat.\n  According to the Navy Department Office of the Chief of Naval \nOperations Ships' Histories Section, the name USS Pueblo has enjoyed a \nlong and proud history prior to January 23, 1968. Currently, the \nenvironmental research vessel USS Pueblo, AGER-2, is the third ship of \nthe fleet to bear the name of the City and County of Pueblo, CO. \nOriginally the armored cruiser Colorado was renamed the Pueblo in 1916 \nwhen a new battleship named Colorado was authorized. That ship served \nfrom 1905 to 1927. The second vessel named the Pueblo, PF-13, was a \ncity class frigate which proudly served from 1944 to 1946. She was \nlater sold to the Dominican Republic where she serves today. The third \nand current PUEBLO, AGER-2, was built by the Kewaunee Shipbuilding and \nEngineering Corporation, Kewaunee, WI. A general purpose supply vessel \ndesigned especially for service in the U.S. Army Transportation Corps, \nshe was launched 16 April 1944 and later redesignated as an \nenvironmental research vessel.\n  To date, the capture of the USS Pueblo has resulted in no reprisal \nagainst the government or people of North\n\n[[Page S2977]]\n\nKorea and although the USS Pueblo still remains property of the United \nStates Navy, the North Korean Government displays it as a traveling \nmuseum in the North Korean cities of Wonsan and Hungham, and is now on \ndisplay in Pyongyang, the Capital city of North Korea. This is \nunacceptable to me and a number of my colleagues. At issue here, isn't \nthe value of the ship. At issue is the honor of America and the record \nof those who proudly served and were illegal captives by North Korea, a \nnation which seeks the destruction of America.\n  I stand with my fellow legislators back home in the Sixty-third \nColorado State General Assembly in demanding the return of the USS \nPueblo to the United States Navy.\n  I urge my colleagues here in the U.S. Senate to join me in supporting \npassage of this important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/04/18/senate-section/article/S2977-1", "month": "04", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3142.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 347, H. Con. Res. 243.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 243) expressing the \n     sense of the Congress that the Public Safety Officer Medal of \n     Valor should be presented to the public safety officers who \n     have perished and select other public safety officers who \n     deserve special recognition for outstanding valor above and \n     beyond the call of duty in the aftermath of the terrorist \n     attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today in the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwe passed en bloc by unanimous consent three Sense of Congress \nresolutions introduced by Representative Joe Crowley, Senator Tom \nHarkin, and Senator Ted Stevens, respectively, to honor the police \nofficers, firefighters and emergency personnel who responded to the \nterrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. I am pleased that the full \nSenate is now taking up these resolutions for final passage.\n  I thank Senator Schumer, and, in particular, the Fraternal Order of \nPolice and its president, Steve Young, for their leadership and strong \nsupport for honoring the fallen September 11 first responders.\n  There were so many examples of bravery and courage on September 11 \nand there is no doubt that the extraordinary heroism of our police \nofficers,\n\n[[Page S2990]]\n\nfirefighters and emergency personnel should be recognized.\n  Last year, I was proud to work with Senator Stevens, Senator Hatch \nand other members of the committee to enact legislation, which I \ncosponsored, to authorize the President to award and present the Medal \nof Valor to public safety officers, upon the selection and \nrecommendation of the Medal of Valor Review Board, for extraordinary \nvalor above and beyond the call of duty.\n  Well before the terrorist attacks, Congress and the President decided \nthat the award would have the most meaning if firefighters and police \nand other public safety officers themselves--the peers of those who \nwill be honored--made the selections of candidates.\n  All 11 members of the Medal of Valor Review Board have now been \nappointed and the Board met for the first time last month. I have full \nfaith that the Medal of Valor Review Board members will work quickly to \naward the Medal of Valor to their fellow public safety officers \ninvolved in the September 11 terrorist attacks. As chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, I certainly support awarding the Public \nSafety Medal of Valor to the fallen heros of September 11.\n\n  Since my time as a Chittenden County States' Attorney in Vermont, I \nhave taken a keen interest in law enforcement in my home State and \naround the country. Vermont has the reputation of being one of the \nsafest states in which to live, work and visit, and rightly so. In no \nsmall part, this is due to the hard work of those who have sworn to \nserve and protect us. We should do all we can to support and protect \nthem and all public safety officers nationwide.\n  I am proud of my legislative record in support of the public safety \nofficers in Vermont and the Nation. For example, Senator Campbell and I \nauthored the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Acts of 1998 and 2000 \nto create and then expand the $25 million Department of Justice program \nto provide grants to law enforcement officers to buy bulletproof vests. \nThis grant program has funded almost 1,000 lifesaving vests for Vermont \nofficers and more than 300,000 vests for officers across the country.\n  Specifically in response to the terrorists attacks of September 11, I \nnegotiated a retroactive $100,000 increase in the total benefit under \nthe Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program as part of the USA PATRIOT \nAct. Congress needed to act immediately to provide much-needed relief \nfor the families of the brave men and women of law enforcement who \nsacrificed their own lives for their fellow Americans. Although an \nincrease in the PSOB benefits can never be a substitute for the loss of \na loved one, it was the right thing to do for the families of our \nfallen heros. In addition, I helped draft legislation to create the \nSeptember 11 Victims Compensation Fund to provide fair and quick \ncompensation to terrorist victims and their families.\n  I look forward to continuing to work in a bipartisan manner with my \nSenate colleagues on legislation to support our Nation's public safety \nofficers who put their lives at risk every day to protect us.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution and the preamble be agreed to, en bloc; that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements \nrelating to the concurrent resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
