Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6464]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I just want to say at the outset of \nthis debate that this is not a new legislative proposal. We have had \nvery extensive debates on the provisions which are included in the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We have had good debates on the provisions \nwhen we passed the Frist bill about 2 years ago. And we had additional \nkinds of debates when we took up the Norwood-Dingell bill a little over \na year ago. These matters have been before the Senate. They are matters \nthat have been discussed repeatedly in this Chamber by a number of us \nover a very considerable period of time.\n  We want to point out at the outset of this debate, that the kinds of \nalterations, adjustments and changes that were made over the weekend \nwere basically technical in nature. I went through those yesterday with \nthe Senator from North Carolina. Maybe later in the day, if it is \nnecessary, I might go through them again. But again, they were \nbasically clarifications in response to questions that were raised \nabout different language interpretations of the bill. These were issues \nthat have been raised by the White House, and those who were opposed to \nthe legislation. I think the most recent changes help clarify the \nlanguage in our bill.\n  As we have said all along, we are always interested in hearing ideas, \nsuggestions and recommendations, as long as they are consistent with \nthe fundamental purpose of the legislation. Our purpose is protecting \npatients, and also assuring accountability by HMOs and insurance \ncompanies that are making medical decisions and, too often, overruling \ndoctors, nurses, and trained personnel.\n  So I know there are some concerns. But the way to deal with those \nkinds of concerns is to engage in debate on these issues. I think if \nyou look at the Frist bill, you will find that it tracks, at least in \ntitles, the Norwood-Dingell and the McCain-Edwards legislation. \nHowever, the Frist bill creates numerous loopholes, which I think fails \nto respond either to the President's desire to make sure that all \nAmericans are covered. We will have a chance during the day to point \nout some of those differences between their bill and ours.\n  We are facing a situation where there are many of us, a majority in \nthe Senate, who are in strong support of the McCain-Edwards \nlegislation. On the other side there are those who don't want any \nlegislation and a small group who prefer the Frist-Jeffords-Breaux \nprovision. We will work our way through it. That is the way the Senate \nfunctions. We welcome the opportunity.\n  I note the presence of my friend and colleague, Senator Edwards. He \nand I plan to be here the whole day. We are in the Chamber ready to \ndeal with either amendments or to try to clarify provisions for those \nMembers who fail to understand them. We are also here to point out, in \nthe case of Breaux-Frist, how we think the McCain-Edwards bill provides \nbetter protections for American families. We are glad to do that as \nwell.\n  That is the framework. We are starting out on day 2. We are glad this \nbill is before the Senate, even though we will wait until tomorrow for \nthe first amendments. I am heartened by the strong resolution of our \nleader, Senator Daschle, in committing us to the conclusion of this \nlegislation prior to the Fourth of July recess.\n  Americans have waited too long. They have waited over 5 years for a \nstrong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. This issue has been \nstudied and studied to death. It is time for action. The Senate's \nfailure to take action results in too many of our citizens--too many \nchildren, too many women, too many seniors, too many families--being \nharmed today and experiencing additional kinds of pain and suffering.\n  It is within that framework that we will hopefully move ahead today.\n  It is time to pass the Patient Protection Act. Every doctor knows it. \nEvery nurse knows it. Every patient knows it. The American people know \nit. And in their heart, every Senator knows it, too. Often today \nmanaged care is mismanaged care. It is long past time for Congress to \nact to end the abuses by the HMOs. Too often insurance company \naccountants are making the medical decisions instead of doctors and \npatients. It is long past time for Congress to assure that the medical \ncare is based on a patient's vital signs, not an insurance company's \nbottom line.\n  The first proposal to do so was introduced in early 1997. We are now \nin the fifth year of consideration of this essential reform. Patients \nare still suffering, even dying, because of our inaction. Every day the \nCongress fails to act, an intolerable additional cost is imposed on \npatients and their families.\n  A survey by the School of Public Health at the University of \nCalifornia found that each and every day, 50,000 patients go through \nadded pain and suffering because of the actions of their health plan, \n35,000 patients have needed care that is delayed or denied, 35,000 \npatients have a referral delayed or denied, 31,000 patients are forced \nto change doctors, and 18,000 patients are forced to change \nmedications. A survey of physicians by the Kaiser Family Foundation and \nthe Harvard School of Public Health found similar results. Every day, \ntens of thousands of patients suffer serious declines in their health \nas a result of the action or inaction of their health plan.\n  Whether the issue is diagnostic tests, specialty care, emergency room \ncare, access to clinical trials, availability of needed drugs, \nprotection of doctors who give patients their best advice, or women's \nability to obtain gynecological services, too often HMOs and managed \ncare plans put profits ahead of patients.\n  The issue is clear: Does the Senate stand with powerful HMOs or with \nAmerican families? Do we stand for protecting patients and their \ndoctors or protecting insurance company profits?\n  There is only one reason this legislation did not pass years ago. It \nis because of the tens of millions of dollars the insurance companies \nand their allies have lavished on lobbying, campaign contributions, and \nmisleading advertising. Now is the time to say that the health of every \nAmerican family is a public trust, not a commodity for sale to the \nhighest bidder.\n  The need for prompt action on patient protections is great because \nthe dishonor roll of those victimized by HMO abuses is so long and \ngrowing.\n  A baby loses his hands and feet after a medical emergency because his \nparents believe they have to take him to a distant hospital emergency \nroom covered by their HMO rather than the hospital closest to their \nhome.\n  A Senate aide suffers a devastating stroke which might have been far \nmilder if her HMO had not refused to send her to an emergency room. \nEven now, the HMO refuses to pay for her wheelchair.\n  A woman is forced to undergo a mastectomy as an outpatient instead of \nwith a hospital stay as her doctor recommended. She is sent home in \npain with tubes still dangling from her body.\n  A doctor is denied future referrals of patients by an HMO under a \nmanaged care plan because he has told a patient about an expensive \ntreatment that could save her life.\n  The parents of a child suffering from cancer are told that lifesaving \nsurgery should be performed by an unqualified doctor who happens to be \non the plan's list, rather than by a specialist at the local cancer \ncenter equipped to perform the operation.\n  A woman with advanced cervical cancer is denied the opportunity to \nparticipate in a clinical trial that could save or prolong her life.\n  A child with cystic fibrosis is denied the opportunity for treatment \nat a center with the expertise to treat the disease.\n  A teenager with a seriously injured hand is told by his insurance \ncompany that they will pay for an amputation, but not the more \nexpensive reconstructive surgery that could provide a normal life.\n  A woman with a relatively minor leg injury ends up losing her leg \nbecause her insurance company persistently delays and denies adequate \ncare.\n  Our legislation corrects all of these problems and many more. It \ntakes HMOs and insurance company accountants out of the practice of \nmedicine and returns decision making to patients and doctors where it \nbelongs. Our proposal guarantees patients the rights that every \nhonorable insurance company already grants, and it provides an \neffective and timely means to enforce these rights. These protections \nare basic aspects of good health care\n\n[[Page S6465]]\n\nthat every family believes they were promised when they purchased \nhealth insurance and paid their premiums.\n  Virtually all of the patient protections in this legislation are \nalready available under Medicare. They have been recommended by the \nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners and the President's \nAdvisory Commission. They have also been proposed as voluntary \nstandards by the managed care industry itself through its trade \nassociation. In fact, most of them are features of the patient \nprotection legislation enacted under Governor George Bush in Texas.\n  Patients should have the right to see a specialist, if they have a \ncondition serious enough to require specialty care.\n  No parent should be told that their child with cancer has to be \ntreated by an HMO physician who lacks the expertise needed to treat the \nchild effectively.\n  Patients should have the right to the prescription medicine their \ndoctor says they need. They should not be told that they have to settle \nfor the second best medication for their condition or suffer \nunnecessary side effects or pay more because the most up-to-date drug \nis not accepted by the HMO.\n  Patients should have the right to go to the nearest hospital when \nthey have symptoms of serious illness.\n  They should have the right to continuing emergency care after their \ncondition is initially stabilized. Medicare patients have these rights, \nand other Americans should have them, too.\n  Patients should have the right to participate in a clinical trial if \nit offers the best hope for a cure or improvement of a serious or fatal \nillness.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Would the Senator talk briefly about the number of \nAmericans who are being affected by us not having already passed this \nlegislation, and whatever delay may occur in the debate of this bill?\n  I know the Senator has been involved in this issue for many years \nnow. He has heard all of the HMO horror stories, about what HMOs have \ndone to people around the country. But some of the Americans listening \nto this debate may not be aware, as the Senator is, of how many people \nare affected on a daily basis, on a weekly basis, on an annual basis. \nAs we go forward with the debate on this bill, could the Senator talk \nabout that issue first, and then I have a couple of other questions I \nwould love to ask.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite right about the fact that every day \nwe delay this legislation, thousands of Americans suffer.\n  The California study says that 50,000 Americans a day are suffering \nas a result of delay or treatment. They would not be suffering if this \nlegislation were passed. And 35,000 families are being turned down by \nHMOs today for specialty care that they otherwise would have for their \nchildren, their parents or another loved one.\n  Close to 20,000 are taking alternative medicines and not taking the \nprescription drugs that their doctor says are needed but are not on the \nformulary of the HMO. The HMO only allows patients to take these \nalternative drugs. In many instances, patients take their alternative \ndrugs and have two or three adverse reactions before they will come \nback to the drug that is actually prescribed by the doctors.\n  So every day that goes on, American families are suffering.\n  I might mention to the Senator the point made on this chart. This is \nfrom the Kaiser Family Foundation and the School of Public Health up at \nHarvard, July 1999. Doctors know that congressional delays mean patient \nsuffering. This chart indicates the number of doctors each day seeing \npatients with a serious decline in health from plan abuse. These 14,000 \ncases represent the number of doctors who every day see denied coverage \nof recommended prescription drugs.\n  So 14,000 doctors have said they prescribed prescription drugs and \nthey were denied, 10,000 doctors were denied the diagnostic tests that \nthey believe were necessary in order to make an effective evaluation, \n7,000 doctors claim they were denied the opportunity for specialty \ncare, and 6,000 were denied overnight hospital stays. And 6,000 were \ndenied referrals for mental health or substance abuse. The list goes \non.\n  Those are two very important studies that make a very powerful case \nregarding how American patients are suffering. An additional study from \nthe doctor's point of view came to a virtually identical conclusion--\nthat patients are suffering every day as a result of HMO abuses.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. This information is so important to this discussion. Is \nthe Senator saying that as of the time of this study in 1999, 14,000 \ndoctors a day are being overruled by HMOs when they recommend \nprescription drugs? In other words, a patient comes into the doctor, \nwho has training, experience, and expertise, and the doctor recommends \nthat a patient needs prescription medication, and 14,000 doctors a day \nare being overruled by the HMO? Is that what the Senator's \nunderstanding is?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. That is what is \nhappening regarding prescription drugs, and that includes the tests \nthat are necessary and the specialists that are necessary.\n  The point I want to mention here, as the Senator was inquiring, is \nthe importance of patients' rights to participate in a clinical trial. \nI think this is one of the most important guarantees that should be a \npart of this legislation. Unfortunately, we had a full debate on this 2 \nyears ago in the Senate, and the Senate rejected ensuring patients \naccess to clinical trials.\n  What we agreed to was a 2-year study of whether clinical trials are \neffective. That was under the Frist bill that eventually passed this \nbody.\n  I am wondering whether the Senator would agree with me that we are in \nthe time of doubling appropriations for the NIH budget. We are in the \ncentury of the life sciences. We can't pick up a newspaper any single \nday and not see medical breakthroughs. It is one of the most exciting \ntimes in medical history, with the progress that has been made on the \nhuman genome, the sequencing of genes and the explosion of different \nknowledge that is out there. We are going to see the development of all \nof this knowledge now in the laboratories.\n  I ask whether the Senator would not agree with me that in order to \nget it from the laboratories to the bedside, it has to be tested. It \nhas to have clinical trials. This is a time of enormous potential for \nreducing the kinds of pain and anxiety that disease and illness bring. \nWe can even reduce the demand on resources over a period of time. We \nknow, for example, that if we were to develop some kind of cure for \nAlzheimer's, half the nursing home beds in Massachusetts would be empty \nthis afternoon. Half of them would be empty. And there is important \nprogress. But it isn't going to get out there unless we have the \nclinical trials.\n  Finally, as the Senator understands, insurance companies have over a \nperiod of time continued--when a patient needed the clinical trial--the \nordinary expenses that were attendant to it. The clinical trial would \npick up the additional kinds of expenses. They didn't go to great \nadditional expenses. But even that kind of responsibility is being \nrejected now by the HMOs. The number of clinical trials is going down \nand threatening not only the well-being and security of the people who \nare in those HMOs, but the well-being of the rest of the people in our \nsociety.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Would the Senator address two questions, please.\n  First, the fact that the HMOs are denying and not covering patients \nneeding and having access to clinical trials--would he first talk a \nlittle about, from his experience and from talking to constituents, \nwhat impact that has on the country moving forward in the field of \nmedicine for all of the American people, so we can continue to be the \nworld leader that we have been in the past in advancing medicine in the \nareas such as Alzheimer's?\n  Second, would the Senator talk briefly about the difference between \nthe McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill on access to clinical trials and the \ncompeting Frist bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I will. This is enormously important. Let's look \nat what clinical trials have meant in recent times. We have made the \ngreatest progress in addressing the challenges that children face with \ncancer.\n  Listen to this. We have 70 percent of children with cancer treated \nthrough\n\n[[Page S6466]]\n\nclinical trials. This is the area where we have seen dramatic progress \nmade. In the last 10 years, it has been miraculous. There is still a \nlong way to go, but regarding children's cancer, we have made \nprogress. Yet less than 3 percent of adults with cancer are enrolled in \nclinical trials. We have made some progress in the area of the adult \ncancers, but that number is in danger of decline.\n\n  Until recently, the health insurance companies routinely paid for the \ndoctor and hospital costs associated with a clinical trial. In 1998, \nthe CBO found that approximately 90 percent of health insurance \ncompanies reimbursed for their patient costs, but HMOs are quickly \nreversing that lifesaving policy. Many of the HMOs are refusing to \nallow their patients to participate, leaving them with few \nalternatives.\n  I want to give the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Edwards, a quick \nanecdote. One of the important cancer centers is the Lombardi Center, \nnamed after one of the great football coaches, Vince Lombardi. Most \npeople in the Washington area are familiar with that center.\n  Our committee had a hearing at which the director of that center was \npresent. He told us they had to hire more and more people to deal with \nthe insurance companies to persuade the insurance companies to let \nwomen who had breast cancer and other cancers participate in these \nlifesaving trials.\n  That was their big new expense; not trying to treat more people, not \nexpanding the facility, not bringing the benefits of their research and \nbreakthroughs to other people, but to hire more people to tangle with \nthe insurance companies. They had to do this because, for the most \npart, women were being turned down, even though the possibilities for \ntheir recovery were significant.\n  As the Senator knows, under his bill, the McCain-Edwards bill, they \nstill have to meet certain requirements. There has to be the likelihood \nof progress within the clinical trials. There are protocols that have \nbeen established by the FDA and NIH. They have to qualify in these \nareas. There are requirements that have to be met.\n  We must protect vulnerable populations with these diseases, people \nwho have the hope of being freed of the shackles of sickness. These \nprotections are included in the Edwards-McCain bill. The Frist bill \nleaves the door ajar but not very much ajar. It allows HMOs to continue \nto resist applications for clinical trials, resistance that can last as \nlong as 7 or 8 years.\n  As all of us understand, these are timely occasions. Individuals have \nto be enrolled in these clinical trials in a timely way to benefit.\n  When laying these two proposals side by side, one would have to say \nthat under our proposal the guarantee is there, as it has been \nhistorically. And on the other side one would say that there are \nsignificant roadblocks and hazards that are being placed in the way of \nqualified patients to participate in the trials.\n  Madam President, I believe I have consumed most of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \ncorrect. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I look forward to continuing this \ndiscussion during the course of the day. It is important during this \nday to point out exactly what is before the Senate.\n  There are those who favor no HMO bill, and there are those who favor \nan alternative. It is important Members understand exactly the \nprotections that are in the Edwards and McCain legislation, which I \nthink are the types of protections that are in the best interest of the \npatient and are the result of a great deal of review. These protections \nhave the very strong support of the medical profession.\n  We will have that opportunity later in the day. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, we are alternating approximately every 30 \nminutes. It is an opportune time because we have present two of the \nprincipals of the bill that we will be debating over the next several \nweeks. They just addressed many of the points in their plan.\n  There have been two bipartisan--ours is tripartisan--Patients' Bill \nof Rights bills introduced in the Senate, and I think it will be useful \nto contrast the two bills as we go forward to educate our colleagues \nbut also to educate people who may be watching this debate so they may \nunderstand what we are all trying to accomplish, and that is to produce \na strong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights that will benefit \npatients by strengthening the doctor-patient relationship, restoring \ntrust to our health care system and making sure patients really are \nprotected. In many ways, the whole swing has gone too far towards \nmanaged care. That pendulum has to swing back. How far it should swing \nback is a balancing act.\n  Both of these bills attempt to do that and I, of course, believe the \nFrist-Breaux-Jeffords bill does it in a much more balanced way, in a \nway that ensures that patient protections are appropriate and ensures a \nstrong appeals process and legal remedies if the appeals process is \nunsatisfactory.\n  I begin by outlining what our bill attempts to achieve. It goes back \nto the principles that the President of the United States, President \nBush, introduced several months ago. I applaud his leadership and \ncommitment to a strong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The principles he outlined were, No. 1, patient protections should \napply to all Americans. That is important because, if we have certain \nrights, we want them to apply broadly. However, the breakdown in the \ndiscussion is: Is it the Federal Government that specifically defines \nthe wording that applies to all Americans or do we respect what \nGovernors and State legislatures have already been doing to address \nissues such as prohibiting gag clauses, ensuring access to specialists \nand access to emergency room care, and ensuring access to something my \ncolleagues were just talking about--clinical trials.\n  A lot of States have not addressed clinical trials. If they have not \naddressed it, what should our response be? Does the Federal Government \ncome in and say: You have to address it the way we say or can they \naddress it the way Tennessee might best address it?\n  The President also said patient protection should be comprehensive. \nAgain, there has been a lot of debate in the last 24 hours on \nliability, employers, and a little bit on scope. There are patient \nprotections in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill and in the McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy bill. The protections are similar and all the media are \nsaying they are exactly alike. They are not exactly alike. There are \nsome things in their bill not in our bill. Some areas of their bill go \nfurther than ours. Clinical trials is an example.\n  Clinical trials, as we all know, are critically important, and they \nare in both bills. However, the cost in their bill is higher than in \nour bill because they include thousands of clinical trials that we did \nnot include. Again, we can debate whether that is appropriate or not as \nwe go forward. I will go through those lists of protections shortly.\n  Third, the President said patients should have a rapid medical review \nprocess for denial of care. Both bills do that pretty well. Again, our \nbill has a more efficient process. The timelines are clearly defined.\n  The President's fourth principle is that the review process should \nensure doctors are allowed to make medical decisions and patients \nreceive care in a timely manner.\n  The fifth principle of the President is that Federal remedies should \nbe expanded to hold health plans accountable. This is an issue of real \ndebate. We believe that, since this is a new cause of action, it should \nbe a Federal cause of action and should go principally through Federal \ncourts.\n  However, the bill on the other side, the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, \nlooks at both State court and Federal court and allows patients to go \nback and forth between Federal and State courts. This raises a concern \nwith the issue of forum shopping. Trial lawyers have an incentive to \nmake money with this new Patient's Bill of Rights, and there is the \nfear that there will be shopping among the various courts.\n  The sixth principle of the President is that patient's rights \nlegislation should encourage employers to offer health care. We talked \nabout that yesterday. Everybody has to realize this bill is going to \ncost hundreds of billions\n\n[[Page S6467]]\n\nof dollars in addition to whatever will be paid for health care over \nthe next 10 years. These rights have a cost, a price to pay. That price \nis hundreds of billions of dollars. Whoever is listening will be paying \nit. It may be shared, and we may divide it by 260 million citizens, but \nit will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. That is why we should not \nrush through the bill too quickly without adequate debate on each and \nevery one of the issues. There is an urge to debate it, get it through, \nand pass it in a week or a week and a half. Remember, this will drive \ncosts up markedly, no matter what bill passes, and the higher you drive \nthe cost, the higher the premiums, the higher the number of uninsured \nin this country. We care about the uninsured and have to be careful \nabout how high we drive those costs.\n  Those are the six principles put forth by the President of the United \nStates.\n  Senator Breaux, Senator Jeffords, and I have put together a bill that \nembodies these strong patient protections and fulfills each one of \nthose principles put forth by the President.\n  No. 1, our bill, written in a nonpartisan way, is actually a \ntripartisan bill. It protects all Americans, while giving the \nappropriate deference to States. If a State has already addressed gag \nclauses in the way they think is appropriate, the Governor has signed \noff on it, the State legislature and elected representatives have \nagreed to it, we do not believe that we in the Congress need to mandate \nthat they say almost the exact words that we dictate, which causes them \nto go back and redefine what they have done and bring back an issue \nthey may have addressed.\n  No. 2, we guarantee comprehensive patient protections. We guarantee \nemergency room coverage. We guarantee in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill \naccess to specialty care. We guarantee direct access to OB/GYNs. \nPediatricians can be the primary care physician. We prohibit a \nrestrictive formula for prescription drugs. We ban gag clauses. We \nprohibit provider discrimination. We provide access to clinical trials \ncoverage, and continuity of care--if your care for some reason is \nterminated and you are pregnant, or towards the end of life, these \nissues, it will be continued.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Because I have not had the opportunity to lay out the \nbill, let me lay it out. Senator Breaux is on the floor. We will have \ntime to debate this. I would love to do it, but this is the first time \nwe have had the opportunity to lay out the bill, if that is all right.\n  No. 3, we require health plans to provide consumers with \ncomprehensive information about their new rights. We provide all the \nnew rights, but we need to make sure the consumer, the patient, \nreceives them in a way that they can truly understand. That is \naccomplished in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill.\n  No. 4, we ensure a rapid independent external review. If there is \ndisagreement on the patient protections, you need to go both internally \nand externally and have an independent, unbiased physician make that \nfinal decision.\n\n  No. 5, doctors--not HMOs, not health plans--need to make medical \ndecisions.\n  No. 6, we hold health plans accountable through expanded Federal \nliability. Both bills expand the liability to hold these HMOs \naccountable. Yes, we believe if HMOs create injury or harm, in essence, \nsomething unjust, you should be able to hold them accountable and \nliable, and you should be able to sue your HMO.\n  No. 7, we protect employers from costly, unnecessary litigation. We \ndebated that yesterday and will continue to debate that. We will argue \nthat the bill on the opposite side opens the door to frivolous \nlawsuits. Clearly, we do certain things to try to prevent unnecessary, \nfrivolous, costly lawsuits but at the same time hold the health plans \naccountable and allow the health plans, not the employers, to be sued.\n  No. 8, we protect doctors from new lawsuits. The bill introduced \nThursday, the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, included some improvements \nfrom the version of the bill on the floor until that time. Clearly, as \nan agent of the plan, doctors could be sued. A lot of doctors did not \nrealize that and will look at the new writings and the new bill they \nintroduced Thursday.\n  No. 9, we make litigation the last resort. We go to the court as the \nlast resort. They go to the courts much earlier, as a first resort.\n  No. 10, we protect the role of State courts in holding health plans \naccountable for quality and treatment decisions. We do not preempt \nState court. In Texas, if there is a lawsuit for a quality or treatment \nissue, it can still continue. It is very specifically written in our \nbill. It is for that new cause of action, a product of this \nlegislation, that we take to Federal court.\n  I will turn to the other principles shortly. What are the differences \nbetween these two bills? What I just outlined and in the first column \nof this chart is the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill. In the second column \nis the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill. The first line is protections \napplying to all Americans. Both bills achieve that.\n  Deference to State laws: We achieve it; they do not. They basically \nsay, here are the patient protections. You have to have these on the \nbooks or pass them essentially the way we wrote them.\n  Support State regulation of health insurance: Again, we defer to this \n60-year history of health insurance primarily being the State's \nresponsibility in terms of actual coverage.\n  Comprehensive protections such as emergency room specialists and \nclinical trials: There is a check in both columns. Both do it well.\n  Independent medical review: Both do it well.\n  Independent medical experts making medical decisions: Both do it \npretty well.\n  Avoid slow and costly litigation. We address it. They do not.\n  Holds health plan accountable in Federal court: Yes, we go to Federal \ncourt. They go to Federal court for some contract issues but \nprincipally allow people to go to State court.\n  Protect employers from unnecessary, costly law lawsuits: We will have \ntime to debate that, but we do that; they do not.\n  Reasonable limits on damages: We talked about that yesterday. They do \nnot have those limits.\n\n  President Bush said he will pass our bill as written into law, and he \nwill not pass their bill as written into law.\n  With that, I defer to the Senator from Louisiana to comment. Both \nSenator Breaux and Senator Jeffords are present. I would love to hear \nfrom them over the next 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee for his opening comments outlining what is the essence of the \nFrist-Breaux-Jeffords bill. I point out the obvious; it is the only \ntripartisan bill that has been introduced in this Chamber dealing with \nthis issue. We have had bipartisan bills introduced, and I congratulate \nthe author, but there is only one bill that has the support of \nindependents, Democrats, and Republicans, as well, and that, of course, \nis the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords legislation.\n  I have come to respect all Members engaged in this debate because I \nthink we all have the same goals, and in many cases we all have \napproached the solution to the problem in a very similar fashion--not \nidentical but very close to being almost the same approach.\n  I was struck yesterday by a number of our colleagues who were talking \nabout the Senator from New York, the senior Senator, Mr. Schumer, and I \nthink the junior Senator from New York was engaged in talking about \nindividual patients, children who have suffered damages because of \ndenial of access to care that is medically necessary.\n  I thought the points they made were well taken. I don't have any \ndisagreement with the points made. I have no disagreement that these \ncases should have someplace they can go to ensure the coverage for \nthese individuals, children, elderly, and average citizens, which is \nneeded and determined to be medically necessary. We have come a long \nway. I think this Congress in general is in agreement that patients \nshould have federally guaranteed rights that are enforceable through a \nprocess of internal and external appeals, to get a quick decision that \nis good for the patient and good for society. If those appeals \nprocesses do not work, there should be access to the\n\n[[Page S6468]]\n\ncourts to enforce these rights that all Americans should have under \ntheir health care plans. Indeed, if damage is done, there should be an \nopportunity for patients to recover damages.\n\n  We basically agreed on the rights the Federal Government should \nguarantee. Senator Frist went over those rights. They are very similar \nin both plans. I think theirs probably covers a few more protections \nfor what I would term the providers as opposed to protections for \npatients, which is what we essentially are talking about. But given \nthat, we are very similar in the things we say should be guaranteed to \nAmericans when they have health insurance. OB/GYN access for patients \nis guaranteed. Access to specialists is there. Breast cancer treatment \nplans must be covered. Clinical trials are available. There is \ncontinuity of care and emergency room access. There are no gag rules. \nThere are point-of-service provisions. These are things we have in \ncommon in both plans.\n  Congress has agreed there should be certain patients' rights on which \nthey can depend, that are enforceable, and if they are not provided, \ndamages can be provided to compensate the injured parties. We both \nagree that one methodology of handling the enforcement of these rights \nis through an appeals process, through an internal and external appeals \nprocess.\n  One of the few things, interestingly, that works in the Medicare \nProgram is, when a Medicare patient, a senior, is denied care, there is \nan internal and external appeals process that occurs very quickly. What \nwe try to do is not give patients access to courts but access to health \ncare. The fastest and best way to do it is through an appeals process \ninternally, as we provide in this legislation, which requires the \ncompany that denies the care to review that decision. They have to do \nit in a very short timeframe, a matter of hours. If the patient still \nis denied care, there should be some kind of access to an external \npanel of independent professionals, medical professionals who will take \ncare of looking at it independently of what the HMO did.\n  We have both agreed the external appeal should be independent. The \nquestion is, How do you do that? Both of them I think require--ours \ndoes--that HMOs are responsible for entering into a contract with \nindependent professionals who are in fact going to look at these cases \nand handle the external appeals.\n  I do not know, if you require the HMO to enter into a contract, how \nthey are not going to be involved in helping to select the independent \nreviewers. That is something I think that has to be done. If they are \ngoing to enter into a contract to pay for the people who are going to \ndo the independent review, how can they not be involved in the \nselection? We can talk about that. I think we both agree the external \nreview panel should be totally independent of the HMO. I think both \nsides say the HMO has to pay for them. Then how do you guarantee their \nindependence?\n  We can work on that, but I think we are both in agreement that the \nexternal review people should have no connection to the HMO, although \nwe both require the HMO pay for them. How we handle that I think is \nopen, but I think we both agree they should be totally independent of \nthe HMO, as much as humanly practicable that we can devise a plan that \nwill in fact do that.\n  Another problem you will hear a lot of talk about, that I think will \nbe subject to amendments, is both sides say we don't want the employer \nto be sued if the employer is not involved in medical decisionmaking. \nWe agree with that. I think this side and the other side agree with \nthat premise as well.\n\n  The problem with the approach of the other side, in the sense of how \nthey protect employers, is finding an area that would be protected \nactivities by the employer which would not cause them to be liable for \nany decisions. The concern many employers have is that doesn't prevent \nlitigation against employers, where they would have to come in and \nprove they have not done anything that is wrong. I think employers were \nlegitimately concerned about being sued for things and then they would \nhave to come in and show they were not guilty.\n  Our approach is a little different. I think it is a better approach. \nIt says employers can select a designated decisionmaker who will make \nthe medical decisions, and if they do that, the employer cannot be \nsued. They don't have to come into court and defend themselves for \nsomething they never did in the first place because the designated \ndecisionmaker, which in most cases would be the insurance company, is \nthe entity which should be sued for making the wrong decision. I think \nour approach in that area is a better approach.\n  The final point: We both have a convoluted system with regard to \nwhere you file suit. In their bill you can file for some things in \nFederal court and some things in State court. And guess what. In ours \nyou can sue for some things in State court and some in Federal court. \nWe are amending ERISA. It is a Federal statute creating Federal rights. \nAnytime you litigate under existing ERISA rules, you litigate in \nFederal court. Therefore, if you expand rights under ERISA by amending \nit to include a designated set of Federal rights, the proper forum is \nthe Federal court, not 50 different State forums.\n  I know my good friend from North Carolina suggested lawyers may have \na problem finding a Federal court. That is a slight exaggeration. But \nthere is no lawyer I know of who has any difficulty getting into \nFederal court. They do it on a regular basis very successfully, and I \nam glad they do.\n  So we have suggested if you are going to file litigation after the \nappeals process to enforce Federal rights that are passed by the \nCongress and signed into law by the President, it should be in Federal \ncourt. If you are going to sue on the existing State medical \nmalpractice laws, the proper forum for that to be litigated is in the \nState courts. That is where it traditionally has been. It is a right \nthat exists today in State court. If you are going to sue a company for \nmedical malpractice, a doctor or hospital for medical malpractice, you \nwill continue to do it in State courts as is the current situation.\n  I want to make sure we get something that can become law. If we enact \na bill the President will not sign, we have not given the patients in \nthis country one single benefit. We have given them perhaps a good \npolitical argument, but we have not created any legal rights for them \nto enforce when they need medical help and assurances their rights will \nbe protected. Therefore, what I am trying to do in offering this, along \nwith my two colleagues, is to try to create something that can actually \nbecome law.\n  I tell you, I would not lose sleep if the Kennedy-McCain-Edwards bill \npassed. My concern is not that. My concern is that it cannot become \nlaw. Therefore, as legislators, we want to enact something that can \nactually become law. We have offered a compromise which I think, No. 1, \neven from their perspective, could give at least 95 percent of what \ntheir legislation does in terms of protecting patients. But it gives \n100 percent more of what theirs would do if theirs cannot be signed \ninto law. That is just a bottom line as far as being pragmatic and as \npractical as I possibly can be, to say look, this is something that can \nbecome law. I think it can pass, and I think it will be signed into law \nif it reaches the President's desk. The opposite is true for their \nversion which the President has said time and time again he will not \nsign.\n\n  We can argue whether that is a good decision on his part or not. I am \nsure they think it is the right decision; others would disagree with it \nstrongly. I think we have offered something that can become law that \ndoes address the concerns that have been articulated in the Senate and \nin the other body for a long period of time. It is time to reach an \nagreement that can actually become the law of this land.\n  I yield any time I may have remaining.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I understand we have 7 minutes on our \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I join my colleagues in explaining and \nhopefully alleviating the concerns of Members with respect to the \nquestion of malpractice and lawsuits.\n\n[[Page S6469]]\n\n  I am probably the only one who was here back when ERISA was written. \nERISA was dealing, not with these kind of parties but with pensions. \nBut it was realized that employers need a common place to go to make \nsure, when they have their pension plan, there is just one jurisdiction \nthat can take care of the complications and legal aspects. The decision \nthere was to make it the Federal court to have exclusive jurisdiction.\n  We are still involved, in this case, with employers. Again, it is a \ndifferent issue from pensions, but it is a very important one for \nemployers. From World War II on, because of some special provisions for \ngetting advantages to businesses being able to provide health insurance \nwhich would be nontaxable, it has been quite advantageous for employers \nto provide health care. We do not want to disturb that.\n  In order to not disturb that, we should follow what happened in the \npension area, and that is to make sure there is uniformity of decisions \nacross this country when we get involved with whether or not an \nemployer would be found liable under the circumstances. We want to \ndistinguish that from the malpractice suits with which we are involved \nmost of the time.\n  I guess people get to thinking, as we talk here, that we are talking \nabout the malpractice situation.\n  The malpractice suits because of doctors performing improper care, or \nnurses, or even the overall operation by not giving the proper medical \ncare is one situation. That goes to State courts. If one is only \ntalking reserving for the Federal courts as to whether or not there \nreally was a decisionmaker who was properly put in place, or other \noperations totally outside of the delivery of health care, it is a very \nsmall and narrow area where you are limited to Federal courts. That is \nbecause you have to have uniformity. That is because, if an employer \nhas a business all across this Nation, the employer doesn't have to \nworry about 50 different jurisdictions as far as where the law applies.\n  The same is true for pension plans. One Federal rule should apply in \nthose very rare situations where there is a dispute over how much \ncontrol there is and whether the business had control over the \noperation of the medical side.\n  I want to make sure it is clear. For the ordinary case where there is \na problem of care, all of those will go to State courts. All we are \ntalking about is this very limited area where the jurisdiction will be \nin the Federal court only.\n  I want to straighten that out because I think people are concerned \nabout not being able to go through the court in their hometown where \nthe doctor is practicing. That is absurd. I think it is important we \nunderstand that.\n  The best way to make sure we have good care is to make sure we have a \nclear idea of where these laws are going and how they are handled in \nthe court system.\n  There is really little difference in our bills, if any. I don't \nunderstand what the arguments are with respect to the malpractice \nsituation, as our plan and their plan are very similar in that regard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank Senator Breaux and Senator Jeffords \nfor their outstanding participation in putting together the Frist-\nBreaux-Jeffords Bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights of 2001. This is a \nbill that we have jointly worked on aggressively over the last several \nyears. It is a bill that we regard as a balanced approach to this whole \nissue of patient protections--making sure that patients get the care \nwhen they need it, fixing the system itself, and making sure the \nprotections of the rights are there, but also making sure it is done in \na prospective way; and then, if the system fails, or if it breaks down, \nproviding appropriate access to legal remedies that make the patient \nwhole.\n  That is our approach. It is a balanced approach. I believe that is \nwhy it has been endorsed by the President of the United States. It \nmeets the principles that he has set forth.\n  Many times, as it has been discussed, someone will ask: Well, did any \nother provider groups or physician groups support the Frist-Breaux-\nJeffords bill? The answer is yes.\n  I list the following organizations so people will know that we have \nlistened to the consumers and to the patients as well as the \nproviders: American College of Surgeons; the Society of Thoracic \nSurgeons; American College of Cardiology; American Society of \nAnesthesiologists; American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy; \nAmerican Society of Clinical Pathologists; American Academy of \nDermatology Association; American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons; \nAmerican Association of Neurological Surgeons; American Urological \nAssociation, Inc.; American Association Clinical Pathologists; American \nCollege of Emergency Physicians; American Society of Cataract and \nRefractive Surgery; and the American Physical Therapy Association.\n\n  I point that out only because people will say these are the groups \nthat support each of our bills.\n  I think that is very important. These are the groups to which we have \nbeen able to explain our bill. They have endorsed our particular bill. \nWhat is most important, however, is the policy beneath the legislation \nand the rhetoric that we often hear in this chamber.\n  These groups have looked at our bill, and they agree that it is a \nbalanced bill that keeps the interests of the patient first and \nforemost.\n  I, again, thank Senators Jeffords and Breaux for their tremendous \nwork and for the work of their staffs in putting together our bill as \nwe go forth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next block of time is controlled by the \nmajority.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee, and the Senators \nfrom Louisiana and Vermont for their remarks and for their work on this \nissue.\n  I did not hear all of the groups that the Senator from Tennessee just \nread, but the majority of those groups also support our bill.\n  The bottom line is there is a handful of groups that support both \nbills. Then there are over 600 consumer groups and medical groups, \nincluding the American Medical Association, that support our bill. \nThere is a reason for that, which I will discuss in a few minutes.\n  From the start to the finish of these two bills that were analyzed \nside by side, there are significant differences throughout the bills. \nIn every place there is a difference. In every single place their bill \nsides with the HMOs and our bill sides with the patient and doctors.\n  That is the reason all of these consumer groups, all of these health \ncare groups, and the AMA support our bill and do not support their \nbill.\n  It is not an accident. These are people who have been fighting for \npatient protection and putting health care decisions in the hands of \ndoctors and patients for many years. They believe deeply in this issue. \nThey have looked at these two bills side by side. They understand that \nthere is significant and important differences that aren't abstract. \nThere are differences that affect the lives of thousands and thousands \nof families and patients all over the country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes. I will.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we were just talking about one such \nprotection that I think is of concern to families all over this \ncountry; that is, the clinical trials.\n  As I understand it, just to repeat, our bill has the right to \nparticipate in clinical trials without discrimination. The patient may \nnot be denied the right to participate in an approved clinical trial if \nthey or their physician can show that they can be appropriate \nparticipants in that trial. We have the right to coverage for routine \ncosts associated with clinical trials, and we have the right to \nparticipate in all federally funded or federally approved clinical \ntrials.\n  The other side delays the immediate coverage for routine costs with \nclinical trials, and the bill has a lengthy negotiated rulemaking \nprocess to establish standards for the routine costs that may be \ncovered--a process that may well result in an effective date for \ninsurers as late as January 2007, which adds a 6-year delay.\n  The current Medicare benefit was carefully crafted and fully vetted\n\n[[Page S6470]]\n\nthrough the Federal rulemaking. In addition, the Institute of Medicine \nhas also released a comprehensive study by experts in the field \nrecommending Medicare coverage for routine costs.\n  Furthermore, managed care plans that offer the Medicare+Choice option \nare already required to adhere to the current definition of routine \ncosts. Effectively, we have the clinical trial and the patients \nprotected.\n  In theirs, they don't even follow the Medicare system, which in terms \nof cost as a result clinical trials, would be very much deferred. As I \nunderstand, theirs does not cover the FDA-approved clinical trials. I \ndo not understand that either because it is in the FDA where the \npharmaceutical companies are working through these breakthrough drugs \nwhich offer enormous kinds of promise.\n\n  So, as the Senator knows, it is important to look at the fine print \non these issues in terms of the protections. I just think we have \nworked with our good friends--and they are good friends, Senator Frist \nand Senator Breaux and Senator Jeffords--and we want to try to find \ncommon ground to work on this because the differences between us are \nsmall compared to those who do not want any bill at all. We want to try \nto reduce those differences.\n  It is important to note that it isn't just on the issues of \nliability, of which the Senator from North Carolina spoke, but that he \nhas concern, as do I, about the protections--whether they provide the \nrange of protections he thinks the patients need.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator his questions and comments. He is \nexactly right. There is a difference on the issue of clinical trials in \nthe two bills. I think the Senator from Tennessee suggested the same in \nhis remarks. But there are differences throughout the bill, starting \nwith the issue of coverage and how you determine whether States opt out \nor do not opt out of the protections in the bill. There is a difference \nin the access to specialists outside the plan. There are differences \nbetween the two bills. There are differences, as the Senator just \npointed out, in access to clinical trials, and as the Senator from \nTennessee pointed out a few moments ago.\n  There are differences in the independent review process. We \nspecifically say that neither the HMO nor the patient can have any \ncontrol over the body that picks the reviewing panel or the reviewing \npanel.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I will, yes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I am trying to understand the differences between our two \nbills on that particular point. We both say the external review panel \nshould be independent. I think we say that the HMO has to contract with \nthese external review people. I think you have been saying they have to \nhave a contract with an HMO to do the same thing. So what is the \ndifference?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Reclaiming my time, the difference is, we have specific \nlanguage in our bill that says neither the HMO nor the patient can have \nany relationship or any control over who is the group who picks the \nreviewing panel, No. 1, or the reviewing panel itself. Their bill is \nsilent on that specific issue.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. If I could continue, this may be an issue on which, \nworking together, we may be able to resolve our differences. There has \nbeen some discussion----\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. If I could finish, then I will be happy to yield. There \nwas a discussion yesterday in this Senate Chamber about the issue of \nemployer liability. The Senator from Tennessee suggested, a few minutes \nago, he thought the intent of both bills was to protect employers from \nliability. I agree with that. I know that is the intent of our bill. \nAnd I know, from my discussions with the Senator from Tennessee, that \nis the intent of his bill. We have gone about it in different ways.\n  We believe our bill in fact protects employers. We believe our bill \nis totally consistent with the President's principles, to which the \nSenator from Tennessee made reference earlier. The President, in his \nprinciples, specifically said employers should not be subject to \nlawsuits--I don't have the language in front of me, so I am \nparaphrasing--unless they actively engage in making medical decisions.\n\n  That is exactly what we intend our bill to do and we believe our bill \ndoes; that employers are protected from lawsuits unless they in fact \nmake medical decisions.\n  Having said that, this is another issue on which I think we should \ncontinue our discussion because, particularly given the fact that both \nsides want to protect employers from liability and want to protect \nemployers from lawsuits, if there is a better and more effective way to \ndo that, which is also fair to patients, we should explore that. I \nthink that is worthy of further discussion as we go forward.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Back on the point, I am glad we are having this \ndiscussion on trying to narrow the differences.\n  Back to the external review panel, we both agree, if it goes to an \nexternal review panel for a decision of whether something is medically \nnecessary or not, that the people making that decision on this external \nreview panel should be independent of the HMO. But my understanding of \nthe Senator's bill is that the HMO would enter into a contract with \nthese independent reviewers in order to have them review the decision.\n  My question is, Who selects with whom the HMO is going to contract? \nIs it that the HMO has to enter into a contract to pay the external \nreview people, and they have to enter into a contract with somebody? \nWho picks the somebody?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. That is a fair question. Let me respond to the Senator's \nquestion, and then I want to go back to talking about the bill \nspecifically.\n  What our intention is in our bill is to provide an objective third \nparty who chooses who the group is, who contracts and actually selects \nthe review panel, and then chooses the review panel.\n  The Senator will recall, in previous bills that have been talked \nabout and debated in this Senate Chamber, that has been one of the \nmechanisms used so that you do not have the HMO actually involved in \ncontracting either with the group that is choosing the review panel--I \nthink it is important to talk about both because they are both \ninvolved--or the review panel itself.\n  As a practical matter, the HMO is not likely to be choosing the \nactual review panel because much more likely, in real life terms, as \nthe Senator knows, they would contract with a group that would choose \nthe review panel.\n  What we want, and is the whole intention of our bill--and we think \nthis is a very significant difference between the bills--is we do not \nwant the HMOs--other than the fact that the HMO, I think in both bills, \nis responsible for the cost--we do not want the HMOs being able to have \ncontrol either over the group that chooses the review panel or over the \nreview panel itself.\n  I think that is an important distinction between these two bills \nbecause the way this process works, both bills are structured--with the \nexception of this difference that the Senator from Louisiana and I have \njust discussed--exactly the same way to avoid cases going to court.\n  There has been a lot of rhetoric on the opposing side that our bill \nwill stimulate and foster frivolous lawsuits. The truth of the matter \nis, our bill does exactly what their bill does to try to avoid cases \ngoing to court.\n\n  Experience has proven, both in California and in Texas, that when you \nuse that structure, which is that an HMO denies treatment, an HMO \ndenies coverage, the first step is to go to an internal review within \nthe HMO. If that is unsuccessful, the second step is to go to a truly \nindependent third party review. If that is unsuccessful, and if the \npatient in the interim has been injured as a result of the HMO's \nbehavior, then the case can be taken to court--the two States where \nthat process has been used--and I again will say the structure is the \nsame in both bills, the difference being we prohibit the HMO's \ninvolvement in the selection of the independent review process.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. If I can finish, I will be happy to yield. In the two \nplaces\n\n[[Page S6471]]\n\nwhere that system has been used before, which is in California and \nTexas, very few lawsuits have been filed. They are two of the biggest \nStates in the country, some would argue two of the most litigious \nStates in the country. They have a system similar to ours, and actually \nsimilar in structure to theirs. In both cases, what has happened is \nthat the vast majority of the hundreds and hundreds of claims that have \nbeen filed--an HMO denies a claim, the claim then goes to internal-\nexternal review--the vast majority of those cases have been resolved by \nthe appeals process.\n  That is what we mean when we say our bill is structured to avoid \ncases going to court. In fact, in most cases it is in the best \ninterests of the patient to get the care and to get it as quickly as \npossible. That is the reason for the internal review process. That is \nthe reason for the external review process. That is the process we used \nin our bill. It is the process they used in their bill.\n  Unfortunately, in some cases, if an HMO arbitrarily or intentionally \ndenies care to a patient--and we have all heard the stories in this \nChamber--when that occurs, in some cases a child or a family or a \npatient can be injured as a result.\n  If that occurs, then that child or family can take their case to \ncourt. That is what has been done in Texas. That is what has been done \nin California. What we have found is what common sense would tell us, \nwhich is that the system works.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I will.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I am trying to nail down this point on the independent \nreview. I am trying to do this one point at a time because we have so \nmany points out there. It is my understanding both our bills have the \nHMO paying for the independent reviewers. Both of them enter into a \ncontract with people who are going to have an independent review. \nTherefore, in a sense, in both bills the independent reviewer really \nworks for the HMO in the sense that the HMO is going to enter into a \ncontract for their services. The HMO will have to pay for those \nservices. Both bills require that.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. That is correct.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The issue is, this should not be an insurmountable task \nfor us to reach agreement on how we select the people who are going to \ndo it. Somebody has to make the selection. I don't know that you have \nanother creature out there who goes out into the world and says: Pick \nreviewer A versus reviewer B. Somebody has to pick who the independent \nreviewers are. In both bills the HMO pays for them. It is just a \nquestion on how they are selected. Our bill says they should be \nindependent reviewers, and I think there are a lot of companies that do \nthat type of work. The Senator from North Carolina probably knows it \nfar better than I in his practice of law. But there are groups which \nare totally independent that offer their services to do this.\n  Isn't there a way that the two bills can reach agreement on how we \nselect the independent reviewers? The HMOs in both bills are going to \npay for the services. It is just a question of how we select them. I \nwant them to be as independent as they possibly can.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Louisiana. \nFirst of all, he made reference to a creature selecting who the review \npanel is going to be. We don't want that creature to be the HMO.\n  Looking specifically at the language of our bill, I am looking at \npage 54 of the bill, it reads:\n\n       No such selection process under the procedures implemented \n     by the appropriate Secretary may give either the patient or \n     the plan or issuer any ability to determine or influence the \n     selection of a qualified external review entity. . . .\n\n  I have a question for the Senator. My question is, This language \nspecifically prohibits anybody involved in the process from determining \nor influencing the selection of a qualified external review entity; \nwould the Senator agree to this language?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Let me answer that with a question.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator agree to this language?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Let me answer it with a question. Does that language \nprohibit the HMO from paying the salaries of the independent reviewers? \nIs that not influencing the independent reviewers? If the HMO, under \nyour bill, pays for the services of the independent reviewers, is that \nnot influence over their decision?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I just read the Senator exactly what the language says.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I appreciate that. But it says you can't influence the \nindependent reviewer. Under your bill, the HMOs are paying the salaries \nfor the services of the reviewer. Is that not influence?\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. My question to the Senator is, If you say you agree with \nus conceptually about this, and we have specifically said that no such \nselection process implemented by the appropriate Secretary may give \neither the patient or the plan or issuer any ability to determine or \ninfluence the selection of a qualified external review entity, would \nyou agree to that language?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I agree with the principle, but who makes the selection? \nThat is why I used the word ``creature.'' What entity picks the group \nthe HMO has to contract with?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. The Secretary sets up a process by which the selection \nof the independent review panel is done and by which the selection of \nthose people who are eligible for the independent review panel is done. \nThe Secretary is responsible for doing that.\n  My point to the Senator is, his bill doesn't say this. By the way, \nneither the HMO nor the doctor nor the patient can play any role in \nthat process. If the Senator agrees with us on that concept, would he \nagree with the language I just read to him?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I think we may be close to reaching agreement. If we \ncan't solve this problem, we might as well shut down this place; we \nwill never solve any problem. This is a small problem in comparison \nwith other issues we are going to be faced with in conference.\n  Let me ask if the Senator suggests that HHS or the Federal Government \nhas an approved list of independent arbitrators.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. It is actually the Labor Secretary.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The Labor Secretary would have an approved list of \nindependent reviewers and they would publish that approved list and \nallow that there be an approved list of independent reviewers that the \nSecretary of Labor would designate as being independent review people \nor organizations that do that type work. And then somebody has to pick \nfrom among that list. They may have 20 different groups that do that on \nthe list. Then somebody has to enter into a contract with one of those.\n  In both of our bills, it is the HMO that has to enter into the \ncontract. Is it inappropriate to allow the HMO to pick from a selected \napproved list by the DOL?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Reclaiming my time, first of all, I thank the Senator \nfor this discussion. I hope we will be able to continue to talk about \nthis. My concern is that we specifically say and designate that the \nSecretary of Labor shall set up a process by which these people are \nidentified. That process is required by law to not allow any of the \npeople involved in the process, which is only fair, to have any control \nor any influence over who ends up on the panel. We don't set up a \nspecific process. We give the Secretary of Labor the responsibility for \ndoing that.\n  My point, in response to the Senator's question--then I will go back \nto the other issues I need to talk about--is that we deal with this \nissue. He doesn't.\n  I think it is critically important--I am happy to continue working \nwith the Senator--that when you have an independent review, when you \nhave a second appeal after the HMO internally has denied the claim, \nthat whoever is conducting that review and whoever is on that panel not \nhave any connection with the patient, with the doctor, or, probably \nmost importantly, with the HMO. That is the only way we are going to \nget a fair and impartial review panel.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a final question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I am trying to resolve this point. It is not \nirresolvable. You suggest that the Department of Labor comes up with an \napproved list of independent external review people. It could be \nseveral groups or several individuals who would be in a selected\n\n[[Page S6472]]\n\ngroup of independent reviewers. When that is done, the next step is \nthat somebody has to pick the one for this particular case that is at \nissue. It is either going to be the HMO that has to enter into the \ncontract or the Department of Labor that is going to have to select the \none that is going to be used in every one of these procedures.\n  It seems to me at that point, if the DOL has selected a group of \nimpartial reviewers, that there is nothing wrong with having the HMO \npick one of them to enter into a contract with because it is from an \napproved list and it has to come from that approved list. Is that bad?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Reclaiming my time, responding specifically to the \nSenator's question, what we actually do--I hate to have to keep \nrepeating this--we deal with this issue. You don't. What we do in this \nbill is we give the Secretary of Labor responsibility for setting up \nthe process. We don't say to the Secretary of Labor: You identify this \ngroup of reviewers or these people who are eligible for the review \npanel. Instead, what we do is give the Secretary of Labor \nresponsibility for setting up the process. But in setting up the \nprocess, the Secretary is required to not allow any of the people \ninvolved to be able to influence who is on the panel and who is \ninvolved.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator's questions. I hope we can \ncontinue to talk about this. It sounds to me as if he is genuinely \nconcerned and interested in trying to resolve the issue. We appreciate \nthat, but at this moment we don't have a specific solution to this \nissue, and we are happy to continue to talk about it. But we believe \nvery strongly--it is the reason we address it in the bill--that the HMO \nand the people involved should have no role; instead, we should have an \nimpartial process. Just like you want an impartial jury, you have an \nimpartial review process.\n  Now, Mr. President, if I can go back to the overall issue of the \nbill, and then I want to talk about a particular patient. First, we do \nwant to make it clear to the American people who are listening to this \ndebate that there is a lot of media coverage that suggests that \naccountability, or taking HMOs to court, is the only major difference \nbetween the bills. There are major differences from start to finish--on \ncoverage, on access to specialists outside the plan, on access to \nclinical trials, as the Senator from Massachusetts suggested a few \nminutes ago, and on a truly independent review so the decision of the \nHMO can be reversed, as the Senator from Louisiana and I discussed.\n  Finally, the issue of accountability. There are two goals in our \nlegislation, and we believe they are met. One is to provide real and \nmeaningful patient protection--to put the law on the side of patients \nand doctors so that the health care decisions are being made by the \nfamilies affected by them and by the people who have the training and \nexperience to make them--the health care providers--and not by some \nbureaucrat sitting behind a desk working for an insurance company.\n  Second is to treat HMOs as everyone else. The problem is that some \npeople would suggest that we should help maintain the existing \nprivileged status of HMOs. HMOs are virtually the only entity in \nAmerica that cannot be held accountable. Their decisions can't be \nreversed; they can't be appealed; and they can't be taken to court. \nWhen they deny coverage, the families are stuck with what they did. We \nwant to simply treat HMOs as every individual American, every small \nbusiness, every large business; they should be treated the same.\n  If my colleagues think differently about that, and if they believe \nHMOs are privileged citizens and they ought to be able to maintain some \nof the privileged status they have today, they will have to make their \ncase. I believe the American people believe that HMOs should be treated \njust like the rest of us.\n  I said earlier that these debates are not abstract and academic; they \nare real. They affect people's lives. I want to tell the story today \nabout a young man named Gary Wemlinger and his wife Jerrie who live in \nmy State, in Kernsville, NC. Gary, unfortunately, was diagnosed with \nkidney cancer some time ago. Specialists at Duke University Cancer \nCenter have told Gary that surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy will \nnot help him. In other words, his life cannot be saved by those \ntreatments.\n  In this photograph are Gary and his wife and his five beautiful \nchildren. What they have told him is the only chance he has for \nrecovery and to be able to spend more time with his family is to have a \nprocedure called a stem cell transplant.\n  Now, what we know medically is that stem cell transplants have saved \nmany lives across this country of patients with cancer. But because \nthis is a fairly new treatment, and particularly for Gary's particular \nkind of cancer, the insurance company has said that it is experimental \nand, therefore, they won't pay for it. They have refused specifically \nto pay for it.\n  As you would expect, the people around Gary--his family, friends, \nneighbors, people in the community--have pitched in and they are \nworking very hard to try to raise the money for Gary to have this stem \ncell transplant that he so desperately needs. They are having a very \nhard time coming up with the amount of money that it would cost. This \nis a perfect example of the effect that the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill \ncan have.\n\n  Under our bill, when Gary needs this stem cell transplant--and his \nmedical doctors at Duke University Cancer Center believe he does--the \ninsurance company not only would be required to give him more serious \nconsideration initially, but once the decision was made not to pay for \nthe care, he would have the right to go to a truly independent medical \nreview board to get that decision reversed. That medical review board, \nmade up of doctors, would consider, among other things, the \nrecommendations of the cancer specialist at Duke University Medical \nCenter who would tell them that the only way Gary's life would be saved \nis through this stem cell transplant. Otherwise, these other \ntraditional therapies--radiation, chemotherapy, and other surgeries--\nwill not save his life.\n  This is a perfect example of a man and his family who would be \ndramatically affected if the law were on his side, on his family's \nside, instead of being on the side of the big HMOs.\n  We can talk about this a lot. There was a quote today in one of the \nnewspaper stories--which we will make reference to later as the debate \ngoes on--from the HMO lobbying group saying that they are prepared to \nspend whatever is necessary to stop the legislation from passing. They \nhave already spent many millions of dollars and they will continue to \nspend millions of dollars, and they have been doing it for years. They \nwant to keep their privileged status.\n  I will tell you who is not spending millions of dollars in this \ndebate. Gary and his family are not spending millions of dollars. They \nhave only us to count on--the people who are in this body and the \npeople down the street on Pennsylvania Avenue. That is who they are \ncounting on, the people they sent to represent them in Washington, DC. \nYou won't see a television ad about this family. You won't see this \nfamily spending millions of dollars. Instead, you will see their \nfriends and neighbors and members of their community trying desperately \nto raise the money that the HMO won't provide.\n  The point is there are clear lines in this debate. While we want very \nmuch to work with our colleagues to find a bill that can pass the \nSenate, pass the House, and will be signed by the President ultimately, \nwe have to make a decision. We have to make a decision about whether we \nstand with the big HMOs or whether we stand with patients such as Gary \nand their families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I understand that the next 30 minutes is \nunder our control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania--he understands \nthe situation. The Senator from Wisconsin needs how much time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. About 6 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Would the Senator yield to the Senator from Wisconsin?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield, I will withhold our half \nhour and have his time come out of the next half hour on the Democratic \nside.\n\n[[Page S6473]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time of \nthe Senator from Wisconsin be taken from the next 30 minutes after the \n30 minutes on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I certainly thank the Senator from \nTennessee and the Senator from Pennsylvania for the courtesy in \nallowing me to speak at this point.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the importance of passing \na meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights that will provide patients access \nto the health care that they need. A real Patients' Bill of Rights is \nabsolutely vital to protecting the quality of health care for all \nAmericans.\n  I would like to make my colleagues aware of what I have been hearing \nfrom Wisconsinites about the importance of protecting patients' rights. \nAt my listening sessions across Wisconsin, I often hear about the grim \nreality that the American health care system is no longer controlled by \nthose who best understand how to treat patients--our physicians.\n  Instead, managed care companies, primarily HMOs but also other health \ninsurance providers, have become so involved in the business of health \ncare that they control nearly every aspect of health care including \nwhere care is provided, and by whom. Of greatest concern to me is that \nthese managed care organizations can decide whether that health care \ncan be provided at all--they make the key medical decisions.\n  In other words, regardless of whether that care is determined to be \nmedically necessary by the physician who is treating you, managed care \nadministrators can override your doctor's medical decisions and refuse \nto cover the care that you need.\n  How does this happen? Well, managed care companies control costs by \nlimiting supply--screening of the health care providers its enrollees \nare permitted to see, requiring patients to go through insurance \ncompany gatekeepers prior to seeing a specialist, tracking physician \nproactive patterns to ensure that doctors are complying with HMO's \ncost-control efforts.\n  Some HMOs go so far as to impose a gag-rule on doctors, prohibiting \nphysicians in their system from discussing treatment options that the \nHMO administrators deem too expensive.\n  I want to highlight two aspects of this legislation that are \nimportant examples of the need to ensure access to vital medical \ntreatment--access to live-saving prescription drugs and clinical \ntrials.\n  Perhaps nowhere has there been more advancement in medical technology \nthan in prescription drugs. They provide patients with cures to life-\nthreatening diseases, and are vital to restoring a patient back to \nhealth.\n  Unfortunately, some HMOs limit the type and amount of medications to \ncut down on their cost. While I understand that these costs lead to \nsavings in our health care system, we must ensure that patients can get \nthe drugs if they truly need them.\n  I commend Senators McCain, Edwards, and Kennedy for reaching a middle \nground in the tug of war between cost control and access. Congress must \npass legislation that ensures that physicians and pharmacists \nparticipate in the decision making process of who has access to \nprescription drugs. Congress must not forget in this debate that this \ninput is vital for those with allergies to a given medicine. We must \nremember that we are considering a lifesaving measure for those who \nhave found ineffective the prescription drugs that the health plan \nauthorizes.\n\n  Another vital provision of this legislation is that it protects the \nrights of patients who want to participate in lifesaving clinical \ntrials. The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill would ensure that routine \nhealth care costs associated with participation in clinical trials \nwould provide all patients with reasonable access that could \npotentially save their lives.\n  Health insurance and managed care plans must encourage good science \nand help define quality care by reimbursing routine patient care costs \nfor those with life threatening diseases who wish to participate in \napproved clinical trials.\n  Right now only 3 percent of adult cancer patients are enrolled in \nclinical trials and lack of insurance reimbursement is often a major \nobstacle to their participation. We must remedy this problem, and under \nthe McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, Congress can do just that.\n  These patient protections ought to be part of the deal when you \nenroll in health insurance. These are pretty basic concerns, Mr. \nPresident, concerns that I think may get lost in all the political \nrhetoric.\n  When we speak about protecting patients' rights, I want to be clear \nthat we are talking about how to make sure that corporate cost-control \nconcerns don't result in people being denied the care that they need.\n  What we need is some thoughtful, reasoned debate and deliberation of \nthe proposals, not stonewalling and stalemates. I hope that we can work \ntogether to craft bipartisan legislation that makes the difference in \nthe lives of patients across America.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the Senators from Tennessee and \nPennsylvania for their courtesy, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to comment for 1 minute on a \nstatement made earlier on clinical trials to clarify it for people who \nare following the debate. We are going to have the opportunity to \ndebate hopefully each of these patient protections to refine and \nimprove them. Both the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords and the Edwards bill have \nclinical trials addressed as a patient protection, as a right of a \npatient to have access to clinical trials if they are in employer-\nsponsored health care.\n  We do have to be very careful about coverage of clinical trials. What \nwe started with was trying to figure out how many clinical trials are \ngoing on today.\n  Under the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, we include coverage by the \nVeterans' Administration clinical trials, all the clinical trials in \nthe National Institutes of Health, and Department of Defense clinical \ntrials. The issue is on the FDA, and the FDA obviously does wonderful \nclinical trials.\n  One concern we need to address is how many clinical trials is the FDA \ndoing. I was going to ask the Senator from North Carolina earlier how \nmany clinical trials are there in the FDA. Since we are taking people's \nmoney to pay for it, we need to know how much it is going to cost.\n  It is unclear at this juncture, and we need to work together to see \nhow many there are. In fact, we do not know today how many FDA clinical \ntrials are being conducted as part of FDA protocol.\n  We know the Center for Drug Evaluation, at the end of calendar year \n2000, had 11,838. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research has \n2,869. The Center for Devices and Radiological Health has 1,084. We \nknow there may be some 16,000 clinical trials. Until we understand how \nmany clinical trials, because these clinical trials cost, there is an \nincremental cost to these clinical trials, before we pass a law and say \nlet's cover everything, since we all know adding incremental costs \nultimately translates down to the uninsured, we need to know what these \ncosts are.\n  Until we get a better feel--and I have been working for a long time \ntrying to find out. I know NIH has 4,200 clinical trials extramurally \nand intramurally; 1,800 are cancer-related trials. The Department of \nDefense--we are looking at the number of clinical trials. The VA has \n162 clinical trials, 30 of which are with partners; and 729 extramural \nVA-funded clinical trials, for a total of about 891.\n  I do not know how many FDA clinical trials are out there or what the \ncost actually is. We need to look at that sometime in the debate.\n  I understand we have 30 minutes on our side, and I yield to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania for such time as needed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I \nthank him in particular for his excellent work in this area. He is a \ngreat leader and obviously an authority, somebody who understands the \nissue better than any of us in this Chamber. I appreciate his \nwillingness to be fully engaged and participate in crafting a\n\n[[Page S6474]]\n\nbill that will solve the problems of the health care system today and, \nfrankly, a bill that will be signed by this President and enacted into \nlaw.\n  That is the balancing act which people need to come to this Chamber \nand pay attention to.\n  To start, No. 1, I am certainly for a Patients' Bill of Rights, and I \nhave worked for the past couple of years as a member of the health care \ntask force on our side of the aisle to craft a Patients' Bill of \nRights. I feel very strongly there are protections that need to be \nplaced into Federal law for those people who are covered by plans that \nare regulated by the Federal Government. They do not currently have \npatient protections.\n  When I first got into this now over 3 years ago, the state of play in \nhealth care was a little different than it is today. We had some issues \nthat were hot-button issues. Maybe 4, 5 years ago, the issue of gag \nclauses was a big deal. I think everyone now pretty much agrees--even \nthough there is language in the bills that outlaws them--they are gone; \nthey are not around anymore. Most States, 5 years ago, had not really \ntaken this issue up and gotten involved in the area of patient \nprotections. Since that time, every State in the country has at least \ndebated, and almost all of them have passed, some form of patient \nprotection to cover regulated and sponsored plans of the State. We have \na little different state of play with respect to the landscape of who \nis and who is not protected.\n  Clearly, now the only participants in health insurance in this \ncountry who are not protected with any patient protections are those \nwho come under the ERISA plan, or federally sponsored plans. All the \nothers have some sort of State regulation to take care of their \nconcerns because they are State-regulated products; they are products \napproved and authorized by the State and State insurance commissioners, \nGovernors, and on down.\n  When it comes to the Federal plans, we need to look at and I am \nstrongly in favor of inserting some patient protections for these \nfederally sponsored plans, called ERISA plans. It is over 100 million \npeople. It is not a small amount of people. That is from where we need \nto start.\n  The second thing we need to look at is the differences where we began \nto take this up 3, 4, 5 years ago and where we are today. A few years \nago we thought we had health inflation under control. We were looking \nat rates of growth in health care costs that were slightly above the \nrate of inflation. As a result of some of the dynamics in the private \nhealth care system, we were settling down, and it looked like we had \nreined in costs in health care. We were being rather ambitious about \nhow we can provide patient protections and not worried about the impact \nof costs on the system.\n  That is a little different today. Today we are looking at double-\ndigit increases in health care premiums. I was with an employer \nyesterday who told me his health insurance premiums over the past 2 \nyears have gone up 42 percent. That, according to some other friends of \nmine with whom I have talked in Pennsylvania, is not unusual. Health \ncare costs are skyrocketing again.\n  The question is, What do we do here that impacts this system? I \nalways say with respect to anything we do in Washington, DC, first and \nforemost, is do no harm. We want to do good things. We want to make \nsure the state of play in America with respect to getting health \ninsurance and good quality health insurance is always to enhance that \nability, not detract from it.\n  One of the major concerns I have with the legislation before us today \nis what it will do to increasing costs of health insurance. At a time \nwhen we have 44 million uninsured, I believe that is the No. 1 problem \nin health insurance in America. We can talk about one bill covering 56 \nmillion people and one bill covering 170 million people and one \ncovering 180 million people. None of them covers the 44 million people \nwho do not have insurance.\n  If we want to look at what the real problem is in America, it is the \n44 million people who do not have any health insurance. There is not \none thing in this bill that helps any of those people.\n  The Congressional Budget Office and others looked at this and \ndetermined this legislation will take the 44 million people and turn it \ninto over 45 million people. All it will do is add to their ranks. If \nmisery loves company, this bill helps because it will add to the \nmisery. It will take 44 million people and make them 45 million people \nwith the increased costs in this bill. I would argue, given the \nemployer liability provisions in this bill, that 45 million is just the \nbeginning of the increase in uninsured. We may very well go from 44 \nmillion to 45 million if the employer provisions pass. I don't think \nthese provisions will be signed into law because, thankfully, the \nPresident said he would veto the bill.\n\n  If for some reason the employer liability provision passes, it will \nopen the avenue for lawyers to get in there and sue employers that \nprovide insurance to their employees. No good deed goes unpunished, as \nthey say, so we have employers who go out and provide insurance to \ntheir employees, and we would punish employers for doing that if we in \nthe Senate allow them to be sued simply for providing insurance for \ntheir employees. To me, that is not just going to increase the \nuninsured, as some say who have studied the bill, from 44 million to 45 \nmillion, but from 45 to 88 or 120 or whatever the case may be. We will \nhave massive uninsured. Employers will be crazy, if they are in the \nbusiness of making, say, podiums, to allow themselves to be sued by \nlawyers because they provide health insurance to employees.\n  This is a very serious issue, the issue of access. I hope, and I \nbelieve, there will be amendments offered over the next week or two--\nhowever long we are on the bill--that will do something about access to \ninsurance. If we walk out of this Chamber with our arms raised, saying \nwe have helped patients, and we have done nothing but add to the ranks \nof the uninsured, it is a hollow victory; we have done nothing for the \nNo. 1 problem in health care, not just to the 44 million who do not \nhave insurance, but to all the people who do have insurance and have to \npay higher insurance premiums to pay for the 44 million people who end \nup at the hospital because they don't have insurance and don't get the \nprimary care that they should at the appropriate time.\n  Currently, we take care of hospitals that provide uncompensated care \nfor those without insurance coverage. In my major cities--Philadelphia, \nPittsburgh, Harrisburg--hospitals are financially strapped because of \nthe high number of people who come through the door who don't have \ninsurance and have to be taken care of, and are willingly taken care of \nby the nonprofit hospitals. Again, it is uncompensated. What do they \ndo? They lose money. They cannot pass it all over to the insurance \nbecause the insurance will not pay for it. This is a huge problem. \nThere is nothing in this bill that takes care of this problem except, \nas I said before, if misery loves company, we add more to the uninsured \nas a result of this bill. That is not solving the fundamental problem \nin health insurance.\n  When we offer amendments, I hope we can get bipartisan support for \nsome tax provisions that will increase the number of insured in this \ncountry, that will deal with the No. 1 problem facing America in the \narea of health insurance. That is, frankly, the almost embarrassing \nsituation of having that many people on the uninsured lists.\n  We have a lot of other issues with which I believe we need to deal. \nOne of the things I am hopeful we will offer is an expansion of medical \nsavings accounts. It is a pilot program right now. I would love to see \nthat program expanded to give real choice to people in the private \nhealth insurance system, to give them the opportunity to manage their \nown health insurance needs, to be able to provide for themselves and \ntheir family, and do so in a way that they have maximum choice, maximum \nflexibility. That should be included. Giving people choices, giving \npeople coverage, giving people flexibility--these should be the \nhallmarks of this discussion, not driving up costs and increasing the \nuninsured and having lawyers replace doctors as decisionmakers, No. 1; \nand, No. 2, these lawyers' fees siphon a tremendous amount of money out \nof the health care system.\n\n  There are scarce resources, and this bill is overloaded with rights \nto sue not just HMOs--we can debate that. I am willing to discuss what \nwe can do as far as suing HMOs. However, I am not willing to discuss, \nto be very honest, allowing employers to be sued. What are the \nconsequences of employer liability?\n\n[[Page S6475]]\n\n  Any employer should think about it. Would you allow your business, \nfor which you sweated hard and perhaps built as a family business, or a \nbig corporation, would you allow your corporation to be liable to suit \nsimply because you provided a health benefit to your employees that has \nnothing to do with your business? If you did, my guess is, if you were \na big corporate CEO, you would be fired. No shareholder in their right \nmind would want their company, their investment, to be wiped out by a \ngroup of employees who were unhappy with the health care coverage the \nemployer provided. That is not their business. Their business is making \npodiums or printing paper or generating electricity. It is not \nproviding health care to their employees. So it is one thing to be sued \nfor the products you make or the services you provide. That comes with \nthe business. But you shouldn't be liable for suit for benefits you \nprovide to your employees. If you are liable for suit, you simply must \nget out of the business of providing health insurance to your \nemployees. The impact on the number of uninsured in this country will \nbe profound.\n  I will shortly yield to the Senator from Arkansas, and I am \ninterested to hear what he says. The No. 1 thing to understand in \ndealing with this issue is, first, do no harm. If we look at the \ngreatest problem in the health care system, it is the number of \nuninsured in America. And the greatest harm this legislation will \ncreate is to explode that number. That is not a victory for patients. \nThat is not putting patients first. That is putting lawyers first, \nputting litigation first. It is not putting mothers and fathers and \nchildren who need and want affordable health insurance first. It is not \nputting these people first who are saying they need these procedures. \nTaking insured people who have a problem with their HMO and turning \nthem into uninsured people is not helping them. Taking someone who has \na problem with their insurance company and turning them into someone \nwho is no longer covered is not helping them. That is not putting \npatients first.\n  What we want to do is put patients first, make sure there are \nadequate protections in the law, but not create a system where we will \nsimply destroy the private health insurance system in this country. \nThat is what this bill does. We, hopefully, can fix it. We will have \namendments to fix it. There is a lot in common with these bills, but we \nhave to fix the things that are the most egregious, and hopefully over \nthe next week or two we will be able to do that.\n  Mr. FRIST. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The Senator spelled out frivolous lawsuits, unnecessary costs, \nunnecessary mandates through micromanagement drive up the costs of \npremiums and it falls on the shoulders of the working poor who cannot \nafford the insurance. That is where the uninsured come in. I take it a \nstep further: Frivolous lawsuits increase costs, loss of insurance, the \nuninsured--that translates to less care, a lower quality of care. It is \nnot just the number of uninsured, it is the impact of being uninsured \ntoday. That is something on the floor we will have time to debate over \nthe next several weeks.\n  I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership \non this issue, his expertise and knowledge. We are fortunate, indeed, \nto have someone with his knowledge of this issue as part of our \ninstitution.\n  I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Pennsylvania. \nHe is absolutely right. I served on the conference committee on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights for more than a year. We wrestled with these \nissues. There was broad consensus that we need a Patients' Bill of \nRights. I agree; we need to have a Patients' Bill of Rights. We need to \nhave a set of legislatively codified protections for those who are in \nmanaged care systems in this country.\n  Where we had a problem was in the area of the lawsuits, the \nliability, the right to sue, and how broad should be that right to \nsue. While we have broad consensus in this body and in this country \nthat there should be a Patients' Bill of Rights, there is also a \ngrowing understanding that if we do this wrong in the next few weeks, \nall we will do is move hundreds of thousands, if not indeed millions, \nof people out of the ranks of those who enjoy the protection of health \ninsurance from their employer into the ranks of the uninsured. That is \nthe risk we take and we better do this job right.\n\n  The Kennedy-McCain bill ignores what I believe is the most important \npatient protection of all and that is access to affordable health \ninsurance. They do absolutely nothing to move those 44 million people, \nwho today in this country do not have health insurance, into a \nsituation in which they are covered. This bill does not address that at \nall.\n  While we may agree we need patient protections for those in HMOs, we \nneed to be very careful that in enacting those patient protections we \ndo not even exacerbate the problem of the uninsured in this country. \nThe CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, has found the Kennedy-McCain \nbill would raise health insurance premiums by at least 4.2 percent and \ncause nearly $56 billion in lost wages over 10 years.\n  That 4.2 percent, somebody says that is not much; that is about \ninflation, isn't it? That is on top of the 10-percent to 13-percent \nincrease in health insurance premiums this year, which is the third \nconsecutive year of annual premium increases in that range. In fact, in \nthe year 2000, premiums increased 12.4 percent; in 2001, premiums are \nprojected to increase 12.7 percent; and in 2002, premiums are projected \nto increase 12.5 percent.\n  We are adding on top of that premium increase another 4.2 percent, as \nprojected by the CBO. I think that is a very conservative estimate, \n4.2, so we are making that problem even more severe. The Barents Group \ndata shows for every 1-percent increase in health insurance premiums, \n300,000 Americans will lose their health insurance. What that means is \nthe Kennedy-McCain bill could cause as many as 1.3 million Americans to \nlose their health care, according to the CBO. If the CBO is wrong and \nthey are understating it, as I believe they may well be, instead of 1.3 \nmillion Americans losing their health care, it could go considerably \nhigher.\n  There are 44 million uninsured Americans in our country now. So the \nKennedy-McCain bill does nothing to make health insurance more \naffordable. Instead, it pushes the number of uninsured to even higher \nlevels, from 44 million to 45 million, 46 million, or more.\n  This is the question I pose to my colleagues: What good are patient \nprotections when 45 million people cannot enjoy them? What good will \nthis bill do for the 45 million who do not even have health insurance \ntoday? I will tell you, it does no good at all.\n  Claims that the Kennedy-McCain bill covers all Americans is the \nbiggest hoax being perpetrated in this debate today. This bill does not \ncover all Americans. This bill does absolutely nothing for the millions \nof Americans who cannot afford health insurance. We will do a \ndisservice to this country, a disservice to the health care system in \nthis country if, while addressing patient protections, we do not also \naddress access. I will be offering amendments to that end. I hope my \ncolleagues will be as well.\n  Dealing with the issue of liability, Kennedy-McCain supporters keep \ntelling the American public their bill protects employers from lawsuits \nand that it caps damages at $5 million. Let's be very candid; let's be \nvery honest about this. This cap only applies to punitive damages in \nFederal court. What Kennedy-McCain proponents fail to mention is that \nemployers can be sued for unlimited economic damages in Federal court, \nunlimited noneconomic damages in Federal court, unlimited punitive \ndamages in State court, unlimited economic damages in State court, \nunlimited noneconomic damages in State court, and damages through \nunlimited class action lawsuits under both Federal and State laws. That \nis what, according to the CBO, is the second major component of the \ncost increases that are going to occur to health premiums across this \ncountry.\n\n  I further point out there is really no exhaustion of the appeals \nprocess required. Though the bill says there is,\n\n[[Page S6476]]\n\nthe exceptions swallow up the rule. Kennedy-McCain requires a patient \nto file a request for external review within 100 days after the \ninternal review. Nevertheless, Kennedy-McCain allows a patient--this is \nso important--to go right to court on the 181st day without even having \ngone through the appeals process by claiming that they just discovered \nan injury.\n  It makes sense, then, if you think the insurance company, the HMO, \nhas made a wrong decision and they have been inappropriate in the \ndecision they have made, that you have an expedited internal appeal of \nthat decision. We all agree upon that. It is also logical and \nconsistent, and I think there is a consensus that there should also be \nan option to go to an external appeal, to an independent medical expert \nreviewer to look at the case and make a determination as to who is \nright.\n  If we are really concerned about health care being provided for the \npatient, we should require that the internal and external appeal \nhappen, happen quickly, and those appeals be exhausted before there is \never a right to sue. The goal should not be let's see if we can get to \ncourt to see who can get the dollars. The goal should be to ensure the \npatient is getting the health care they deserve. By allowing a patient \nto simply wait until 180 days have expired and then to simply allege \nthey only now discovered the injury and to go directly to court without \never having gone through an internal appeal, without ever having gone \nthrough an external appeal, is to open the floodgates to lawsuits.\n  Look at the original bill on page 149. You will see that exception is \nclearly there. This loophole allows an employer to be taken to court 5 \nyears, 10 years, 15 years after its health plan denied a claim for a \nbenefit without ever having gone through an external, independent, \nmedical review process.\n  What is the result? The result is that if Kennedy-McCain passes as it \nis now written, we will threaten the very employer-provided health \ninsurance system that has served our country well. Maybe that is the \ngoal. Maybe, instead of patient protections, the real goal in this \nlegislation is to swell the ranks of the uninsured and then come back \nand say: Look at our huge problem. We have to address this again.\n  I hope that is not the goal of those who are pushing this lawsuit-\ngeared so-called Patients' Bill of Rights. Employers will be sued even \nif they are upheld by the independent medical reviewer's determination \nunder the Kennedy-McCain bill.\n  Kennedy-McCain is, in fact, a trial lawyer's dream. It is a trial \nlawyer's bill of rights. New lawsuits under Kennedy-McCain have \nabsolutely nothing to do with ensuring that patients get quick access \nto needed care. According to the Urban Institute, medical malpractice \nclaims take an average of 16 months to file, 25 months to resolve, and \n5 years to receive payment. That is what we are inviting in this bill, \nnot that patients are going to have rights and that patients are going \nto be assured that on an expedited basis they are going to be able to \nget the kind of medical treatment the insurance company has promised. \nThis bill, as it is currently drafted, will ensure the courts are \nclogged with lawsuits and lawsuits for not months but years and years. \nThat is not in the interest of improving health care in this country.\n  You would think, after months and years in court, a patient or the \npatient's family would finally be justly compensated for their injury \nor their loss, right? Wrong. In fact, the tort system returns less than \n50 cents on the dollar to the very people it is designed to help and \nless than 25 cents for actual economic losses. So the real winners in \nthis lawyers' bill of rights will, in fact, be the trial lawyers. The \nlawyers win and the process wins and the patients lose. That is why we \nneed to improve this bill.\n  Madam President, how long do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator has 1 minute 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. It is said over and over again that we have to pass a \nPatients' Bill of Rights because the American people are demanding it. \nI think if you ask the American people, if you ask most Members of \nCongress, are you for a Patients' Bill of Rights, they would \noverwhelmingly say yes. I would say yes. We all believe patients ought \nto have greater patient protections and they ought to be codified. They \nought to be in law. But it does not tell the whole story.\n  A recent survey that was conducted in conjunction with the Harvard \nSchool of Public Health found this. When the question was asked of the \nAmerican people, all voters, Republicans, Democrats and Independents, \ndo you favor a Patients' Bill of Rights, 76 percent said yes. But when \nthey were asked this question, what if you heard that this law would \nraise the cost of health plans and cause some companies to stop \noffering health care plans to their workers, would you still favor a \nPatients' Bill of Rights? Instead of 76 percent, 30 percent say they \nwould favor it under that situation.\n\n  During the last few weeks, it has become increasingly clear to the \nAmerican people that the Kennedy-McCain Patients' Bill of Rights, which \nopens the floodgates to lawsuits, would increase health care premiums \nand cause millions of people to lose their health care insurance, and \nthey do not favor that kind of bill of rights.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from \ntwo of my Arkansas constituents who are employers, telling about the \nthreat this litigation-laden bill poses to their ability to offer \nhealth insurance to their constituents.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            McKee Foods Corp.,\n\n                                   Collegedale, TN, June 14, 2001.\n     Hon. Tim Hutchinson,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchinson: The Senate will soon consider a \n     proposal that will give Americans the right to sue their \n     insurance provider in state and federal court for coverage \n     decisions. As a business owner, this prospect has me worried \n     McKee Foods has voluntarily sponsored its own health plan for \n     more than 30 years. All of our employees and their families \n     have the option to take part in our group coverage, including \n     the 1,420 employees who work at our Gentry, Ark., \n     manufacturing facility. In 2000, McKee Foods and its \n     employees spent $25 million to provide health care benefits \n     for all 6,100 of our employees and their families. The \n     company directly paid for more than 75 percent of this \n     amount.\n       Over the last two years our group insurance benefit costs \n     are up about 26 percent and our prescription drug benefit \n     cost has nearly doubled. The company has absorbed most of the \n     cost increases, but employee premiums have also risen by 10 \n     percent. It's important to note that none of the proposals \n     presently under consideration have protection in place to \n     protect the health care purchaser, whether individual or \n     company, from the increased cost of coverage due to insurer \n     liability. A health care bill containing additional costs \n     will simply compound the problem of rising costs.\n       Our health plan, which is governed by ERISA, is self-\n     insured, self-funded and self-administered. Maintaining an \n     ERISA plan allows McKee Foods to provide uniform health care \n     benefits to our employees in all contiguous 28 states. We've \n     reviewed the various proposals put forth by both the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives and have come to the \n     conclusion that McKee Foods can be sued for voluntarily \n     providing health care benefits. Each of the major bills under \n     consideration contains language that defines the liability \n     trigger as ``direct participation'' or ``discretionary \n     authority'' over the decision. This standard directly \n     implicates ERISA's fiduciary responsibility duty. For \n     employers who offer a health plan governed by ERISA, \n     liability is real.\n       I believe that legislation containing liability for \n     companies will certainly lead to more uninsured Americans. I \n     also believe that many employers want to offer health care \n     benefits because this type of benefit helps us attract and \n     retain high quality employees. Please remember that the \n     voluntary employer-based health care system in our country \n     provides coverage for more than 172 million Americans.\n       I'm asking you to support a health care bill that sets up a \n     strong system for binding external review instead of \n     lawsuits. Let's get patients the medical treatment they need, \n     when they need it. Reaching a conclusion later in a court \n     only benefits the attorneys.\n           Sincerly,\n                                                       Jack McKee,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Springdale, AZ.\n       Dear Arkansas Senators Lincoln and Hutchinson: I am a small \n     business owner in Springdale, AR. Our company employes 8 very \n     fine people.\n       Our company has always made an effort to provide, at no \n     expense to our employees, full family health insurance \n     coverage.\n       A couple of months ago we were forced to begin sharing some \n     of the cost of the health plan with the employees because of \n     40% plus increases. The monthly cost climbed to over $4000.00 \n     a month for our relatively young group. I fear passing the S-\n     238 bill will not\n\n[[Page S6477]]\n\n     only cause greater increases but subject our company to \n     possible legal actions because of our offering health \n     insurance. We could be at the mercy of whoever decides to pay \n     a claim or not--and open the door for the company to be \n     liable.\n       I think the bill has a lot of danger in it. I urge both of \n     our Arkansas Senators to do all in your power to defeat this \n     bill. I urge you to vote against ``cloture'' thus limiting \n     the truth to be brought out on the floor.\n       On behalf of myself, my partner and our employees, thank \n     you in advance for logging this request.\n                                                    John W. Hayes.\n       P.S. Your voting records are the proof of your loyalty to \n     the people of the Great State of Arkansas.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next block of \ntime shall be controlled by the majority party.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I say to my colleague from Arkansas \nthat I think what will become clear to the American people over the \nnext week--I certainly take very seriously the words of the majority \nleader that we will be here as long as it takes to pass this bill--is \nthat this will be a test case of whether or not all Members of the \nSenate will be there for consumers, or whether or not the health \ninsurance industry will be able to stop this legislation.\n  It is that clear.\n  There is an unprecedented lobbying effort going on right now and a \ntremendous amount of money is being spent with a full court press to \nblock this legislation.\n  I have no doubt that we will have amendments on the floor over the \nnext week or week and a half which will be an effort to gut this bill \nthrough amendments.\n  But I think that people in the country will have a very clear sense \nof whether or not we are on their side.\n  I say to each and every one of my colleagues that I am absolutely \nconvinced from a lot of coffee shop discussions with people in \nMinnesota that people do not give a darn about the labels left, right, \nor center. They do not care about any of it. Politics for people is \nmuch more personal. Consumers and the people we represent are saying we \nwant to have some protection.\n  Let me give you some examples. I will not use the real names of \npeople to make this more anonymous. I will never forget a woman coming \nup to me and saying to me at a farm gathering in Minnesota: I want you \nto come over and meet my husband, Joe. Remember--you met him about 6 \nmonths earlier. The doctor said he only had 2 months to live. But my \nJoe is a fighter.\n  He had cancer.\n  I would like for you to come over and say hello.\n  He was not yet in a wheelchair. But later he was because he was \nweakened by this struggle with cancer. He has now passed away.\n  She said to me: I want you to meet Joe.\n  I went over, and we talked.\n  Then she said: Can we talk away from him?\n  We go away so he can't hear.\n  She said: It is a nightmare. Every day I am on the phone with the \nmanaged care company trying to find out what they will cover. Every day \nit is a struggle to get the coverage for my husband for the treatment \nhe needs as he struggles with this illness.\n  No American family with a loved one who needs that care should have \nto be fighting it out with the insurance companies or managed care \nplans to get the care their loved one deserves.\n  That is what this piece of legislation is about that was introduced \nby Senators McCain, Kennedy, and Edwards with many of us supporting it. \nThat is what this is about, pure and simple.\n  This is the most important consumer protection legislation we will \nvote on this year as Senators.\n  My colleague from Arkansas said: What about the 44 million people who \nhave no insurance? I invite the Senator from Arkansas and other \nSenators to please join on a piece of legislation I have called Health \nSecurity for All Americans.\n  I am for universal coverage. I haven't heard a lot of my Republican \ncolleagues talking about the importance of comprehensive health care \nreform, universal coverage, affordable and dignified human coverage for \nall. I hear them talking in opposition to this piece of legislation.\n\n  Why don't we first pass this consumer protection legislation? Then we \nwill move on and we can talk about universal coverage.\n  I remember a gathering in Minnesota--there are so many stories like \nthis. There was a meeting that I had convened where we had some of the \nmanaged care plans there to meet with some of the parents. I do a lot \nof work in the mental health area.\n  I can hardly wait to have hearings in the Health Committee and have a \nbill on the floor doing what Senator Domenici calls the Mental Health \nEquitable Treatment Act to end the discrimination of coverage for \npeople struggling with mental illness.\n  At this gathering, a lot of the parents wanted to meet with the \nmanaged care companies. One mother said: My daughter is struggling with \ndepression. We have asked you and asked you for coverage, and you said \nthat it wasn't medically necessary for her to get the help she needed, \nto see the psychiatrist that she needed to see. My daughter took her \nlife.\n  Look. I can't say that she took her life because she didn't get a \nchance to see this particular psychiatrist. But I can tell you this: \nThere was an article in the Minnesota Star Tribune last Sunday about \nthe costs the State of Minnesota had to pick up because the health \nplans did not provide the coverage for people that the doctors said \nneeded to get mental health coverage.\n  What the patients and their families heard was: You need to see the \npsychiatrist. You need to be in the hospital for this many days. You \nneed to have outpatient treatment. Instead, they were denied the \ncoverage by their HMOs. Finally, the State just picked up the coverage.\n  It happens all the time.\n  A nurse in Minnesota told our state office about a woman who suffered \nwith stomach pains; she saw her doctor who did some tests and then \nsuggested further tests, that were more expensive for which she should \nget HMO's approval. The HMO denied the additional tests. Since the \ndoctor recommended the tests, you would think that a patient might have \nsome recourse to the HMO's denial of coverage. Instead, the woman \nendured a series of phone calls with HMO employees, being forwarded \nfrom one customer service representative to another, being put on hold \nfor 35 minutes and ultimately being referred to a 50-page benefits \nmanual with no change in the HMO's denial of these recommended tests. \nNo one at the company ever instructed the patient how to file an \nappeal. She ultimately gave up and paid for the tests herself.\n  It goes on and on. There is too much gatekeeping, and too much \nbottom-line medicine. The bottom line has become the only line. There \nare too many people and their loved ones who can't get the care they \nneed or the care for their children when they need a pediatrician or to \nget to the emergency room to have it covered when they need to be at \nthe emergency room or to get their parents and their grandparents the \ncoverage they need, to get the child the coverage she or he needs for \nmental health coverage.\n  It goes on and on. Too many people go without the care they deserve. \nToo many doctors and nurses are not able to provide the kind of humane \nand dignified care they thought they would be able to provide when they \nwere in nursing school or medical school.\n  What do we do? We say that we are going to have basic patient \nprotection coverage for every citizen no matter what State he or she \nlives in, no matter what company he or she works for. That is the first \npart.\n  What is the second thing that we say? We say if your plan denies you \nthe coverage, then you have a right as a consumer to appeal the \ndecision and go to an independent appeals board or through an \nindependent appeals process--not an appeals process within the managed \ncare company which is the competing proposal. That is crazy. People in \nthe country know it.\n  And to assist people in dealing with their insurance companies and \nHMOs I will be offering an amendment with Senator Reed of Rhode Island \nthat will have an ombudsman program set up in every State that provides \noutreach and\n\n[[Page S6478]]\n\nassistance when they have trouble getting the care they need or filing \nthe appeal they are entitled to. This would be an important addition to \nthis legislation.\n  If you have headaches, severe headaches, and you go see your doctor, \nand you are told by your doctor that you need an MRI, and then the \nmanaged care plan says, no, it is not medically necessary, and then \nyou, because you did not have that MRI, later find out you have a \nmalignant brain tumor, and you die because of that--or this happens to \nsomeone in your family who dies because of that--you better believe \nthat these companies can be taken to court. They should not have any \nspecial protection any different from any doctor or hospital or any \nother business.\n  If you are denied the coverage on the basis that it is not medically \nnecessary, of course people can go to State court, which is where it \nshould be. And then we abide by the laws of our States: the laws of \nMinnesota or the laws of Illinois or whatever state the patient lives \nin. It is simple.\n  This is all about whether or not we are finally going to pass \nlegislation that provides consumers, provides patients, provides \nfamilies, provides children the protection they deserve, the protection \nthey need. That is what this legislation is all about.\n  I think I introduced a bill in 1994, and then I know Senator Kennedy \nintroduced a bill a couple years later, and many people have introduced \nbills; and we have been going through the debate now for 7 years. The \ntime has come. It is real simple.\n  I conclude on this note: I really believe, more than anything else, \nthe way people judge us is not if we are Democrat or Republican, not if \nwe are liberal or conservative, not if we are right, left or center. \nNone of those labels mean very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The question is simple. Do you, the Senator from the \nState of Washington or the Senator from the State of Illinois or the \nSenator from the State of Minnesota know us? Do you care about us? Do \nyou understand us? Are you on our side?\n  That is what this legislation is all about. This is an important \ntime. Let's step up to the plate and vote to be on the side of families \nin our States, consumers in our States, and provide them with this \nprotection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time remains on the Democratic \nside on this debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes nineteen seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise in support of this bill that has been brought \nto this Senate Chamber by Senator Kennedy, who was here just a moment \nago; Senator John Edwards, Democrat from North Carolina; and Senator \nJohn McCain, Republican from Arizona, who have made this a bipartisan \neffort.\n  I think if you listened to the history that Senator Wellstone of \nMinnesota just recounted, you know this issue has been before the \nSenate and the Congress for many years. We now have an opportunity, \nbecause of the change in the leadership in the Senate a few weeks ago, \nfor this issue, which was buried in committee, to now be on the floor \nof the Senate--an issue with which 80 percent of the American people \nagree is finally before us for debate, for amendment, for a final vote.\n  I applaud our majority leader, Senator Tom Daschle. He has said to \nthose who want to drag their feet and stop us from this debate and \namendment, the party is over. We are going to stay in session in the \nSenate until we pass this bill.\n  You will hear moans and groans from my colleagues in the Senate who \nhave taken the Fourth of July recess period and have made plans. Some \nwere political plans, some were personal and family plans, but they had \na lot of plans. I have to confess I did, too. But I believe the \nSenators elected to this body were not elected to march in parades on \nthe Fourth of July. We were elected to march to the floor of the Senate \nto pass legislation that will make life better for families across \nAmerica.\n  So if it means that we have to stay in session on the Fourth of July, \nand take a recess for a few minutes to look out the window at the \nfireworks on The Mall, so be it. Let's get our job done. Let's stay and \ndo it. This issue is worth it.\n  This issue, this Patients' Bill of Rights, will establish, for the \nfirst time nationwide, a standard of protection for American families \nwhen they go to their doctor or a hospital for medical care.\n  How important is it? Let me tell you a story. In Joliet, IL, I sat \ndown for lunch with a doctor. He said: Let me tell you what happened to \nme, Senator. A mother came into my office with her little boy. The boy \nwas about 5 or 6 years old. He had been complaining to his mom about \nheadaches. I asked his mother how long these headaches had gone on. She \nsaid for over 3 weeks.\n  The doctor said to the mother: Is it on one side of his head or the \nother or what?\n  She said: It is always on the same side of his head. He complains \nthat it hurts on this side of his head.\n  The doctor said to me he instantly knew that the appropriate medical \nresponse was to take an MRI to determine whether or not that little boy \nhad a brain tumor: 3 weeks, headaches, a little boy complaining, same \nside of his head. But before he said that to the mother, before he made \nthat recommendation, he asked her a question: Do you have health \ninsurance?\n  She said: Yes.\n  The doctor asked: What is the name of your company?\n  She gave him the name. He excused himself from the office, went into \nanother office, called the insurance company, described exactly what \nhappened, and said: I am ordering an MRI.\n  The insurance company said: No.\n  He said: What am I supposed to do?\n  The insurance company said: Send the mother home. See if he gets \nbetter.\n  The doctor walked back into the office and said to the mother: I'm \nsorry but at this point in time I think the best thing for you to do is \nto go home and call me in a week or two if he is still complaining \nabout it.\n  That is just one little episode in Joliet, IL, involving a doctor, a \nwoman, and her child. That mother left that office not knowing who had \nmade the medical decision. It was not the doctor she came to see; it \nwas a faceless clerk at an insurance company hundreds of miles away.\n  When doctors ask these clerks what qualifications they have to make a \nmedical judgment, do you know what they find out? These insurance \ncompany clerks are not nurses; they are certainly not doctors; many \ntimes they have high school diplomas and a manual in front of them \nwhere they can look up: Oh, I see, 3 weeks of headaches, one side of \nyour head, 5-year-old child. No, it takes 4 weeks. Send him home.\n  That is what this has come down to. That is what this debate is \nabout. It isn't about all the technicalities and complexities that a \nlot of us bring to this Chamber. It is a question about whether doctors \ncan practice medicine, whether mothers and fathers can walk into a \ndoctor's office and rely on the health care professional to make the \njudgment. That is what it is all about.\n  The health insurance industry, the HMOs, are the ones that oppose \nthis bill. They are the only ones that oppose this bill. Every health \ncare group, every consumer protection group, supports the bipartisan \nbill being offered on the Democratic side--every single one. The only \nopposition comes from one group, the health insurance companies. Why? \nThey make more money. It is more profitable. They do not want us eating \ninto their profit margin to provide greater and better care for \nAmerican families. It is just that simple.\n\n  The two bills before us are dramatically different. Here are some of \nthe differences shown on this chart. When you take a look at the two \nbills, this, on the left of this chart, represents the Bipartisan \nPatient Protection Act, and this side represents the Frist-Breaux bill, \nwhich is supported by the health insurance industry.\n  Take a look at the differences between them as to what kind of \nprotections are provided under the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\n  Our bipartisan bill protects all patients with private insurance. The \nbill being offered on the Republican side and by the industry, sadly, \nleaves many people behind. It says: If you can make an effort at \nprotecting patients, good enough. We say, no; it has to be real \nprotection.\n  Protection for patient advocacy: 100 percent on our side; none on \ntheir side.\n  Prohibition of improper financial incentives: Do you know what that \nmeans? Do you know there are at HMOs some doctors who get paid more if \nthey do not provide treatment for patients? At the end of the year, \nthey total it up and say: Dr. So and So, let's see, because you didn't \norder as many MRIs as we thought you would, you get a bonus check at \nthe end of the year.\n  Did you know it is a fact that that is going on? There are financial \nincentives for doctors not to prescribe drugs, not to use treatments, \nnot to hospitalize people. And if they do not do it, they get \ncompensation. Our bill prohibits that. The health insurance industry \nbill--surprise, surprise--thinks that is just fine.\n  The ability to hold plans accountable: Our bill makes it clear they \nare going to be held accountable. I will get into that in a moment.\n  Independent external appeals: When the health insurance company says, \nno, we won't cover what the doctor recommends--whether it is a \nprescription or a treatment--it does not give you a lot of comfort to \nknow you can go hire a lawyer and go to court and 5 years later get a \nverdict. You need to have an appeals process right now. Some of these \nare life-and-death decisions.\n  We want to make sure the appeals process isn't stacked against you. \nWe do not want the health insurance company to be the judge and the \njury. The bill supported by the industry leaves the health insurance \ncompany to make the final judgement. We believe it should be an \nindependent external appeal process, one that is timely.\n  Guaranteed access to specialists: Our bill has it; theirs takes a nod \nin that direction.\n  Access to clinical trials: Do you know what that is? Let's say you \nhave a rare serious disease and there is a clinical trial underway.\n  The doctor says to you: There is one possibility, Mrs. Jones. It is a \nclinical trial. I would like to see if you qualify for it.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. FRIST. The Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill you are referring to as \n``the health industry bill,'' endorsement of their bill, can you name \none insurance company or one HMO that has endorsed the Frist-Breaux-\nJeffords bill?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The health insurance industry--and the Senator knows \nthis--objects to, opposes the bipartisan bill which I support. They \nwould gladly accept your alternative because it is much more preferable \nto them because it is more profitable to them. That is as obvious as \nthis debate is. I think that is the difference between us.\n  We stand here supported by nurses and doctors and medical \nprofessionals, hospital associations across America. The health \ninsurance companies are our No. 1 opposition. They support your \nlegislation. They don't support ours.\n  Mr. FRIST. But is the Senator aware that there is not one HMO, to the \nbest of the sponsors' knowledge, that has endorsed our bill, or \ninsurance company, and is the Senator aware that over 362,000 \nphysicians from 70 different organizations have endorsed the Frist-\nBreaux-Jeffords bill?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sure the Senator's figures are accurate. I wouldn't \nquestion them. But the Senator knows, if you are going to total up the \nmedical profession, where they come down on which bill, you don't have \na chance, my friend. They are all on this side of the aisle. They \nsupport the real patients' protection bill. Finding 300,000 doctors who \nagree with one thing or the other, congratulations.\n  I can tell you, when you look at the American Medical Association, \nthe American Nurses Association, the American Hospital Association, \nthey are all on this side of the aisle I think that is very clear.\n  As you go through here, access to doctor-prescribed drugs, if a \ndoctor says this is the drug you should have, this is what you need to \nget well, the health insurance company takes a look at the list and \nsays, sorry, that drug is not on our list; you can't prescribe it.\n  Wait a minute. If that is the drug that you need, that is what you \nneed. That isn't a decision of an insurance company; that is a decision \nof a doctor. Doctors go to medical school. Insurance company clerks go \nto business school maybe. They shouldn't be making medical decisions.\n  The choice of provider, point of service, emergency room access--our \nbill provides that protection start to finish.\n  Let me ask, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to address, in the closing time, this whole \nquestion of liability. In America, if you go out and do something \nwrong, if you are negligent, guilty of wrongdoing, we have a system of \naccountability. If you drink too much at a party, get involved in an \naccident and get sued, you are held accountable, right? If your \nbusiness does something that it isn't supposed to do, that is illegal \nor wrong, you are held accountable, correct? If someone comes to your \nhome, slips and falls, they may sue you; you will be held accountable \nas to whether or not you are negligent. That is part of the system of \naccountability in a country of laws.\n  There are two groups that are above the law in America. The one group \nabove the law is diplomats. You have heard about it: The people who \ncome to Washington from a foreign country to work in an embassy get \ninvolved in a traffic accident, catch the first plane back to their \nhome country, and we can't touch them. Why? Treaties. We have said, for \ndiplomats, you are above the law. I don't like it. I have seen some \nterrible things happen. But that is a fact.\n\n  There is another group above the law--the health insurance companies. \nWe talked earlier about doctors coming up with suggested treatments and \nhealth insurance companies saying no. Under the law today, the only \nliability the health insurance company has for making the wrong \ndecision, not covering you when they are supposed to, is the cost of \nthe treatment, not the result of failing to treat. What is the \ndifference? The difference is the cost of the surgery as opposed to the \nfact that you might have a permanent disability because you didn't get \nthe surgery.\n  So we say that health insurance companies are above the law in \nAmerica. They are squealing like stuck pigs because they know that if \nthis bill passes, they will be brought into court as every other \nbusiness in America and held accountable.\n  I don't want to see a runup in court cases and litigation. That \ndoesn't solve the problems of a person who needs medical care right \nnow.\n  I can tell you this: Once those health insurance companies know that \n12 average Americans can sit in a box and listen to a judge and the \nattorneys and stand in judgment over their actions, they will think \ntwice before they make these terrible decisions that deny people the \nbasic medical care doctors think they deserve.\n  There has also been the argument made: If you allow us to sue the \nhealth insurance companies, you will allow us to sue the employer who \nbuys the health insurance plan. Not so. This is a phony argument. This \nbill very clearly says that an employer that buys the health insurance \nplan and doesn't make the medical decision, doesn't say yes to the \nprescription or no to the treatment, is not liable. The bill is \nexplicit.\n  Let me read the section from the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill:\n\n       [This provision] does not authorize any cause of action \n     against an employer . . . or against an employee of such an \n     employer . . . acting within the scope of employment . . . \n     unless there was direct participation of the employer in the \n     decision of the plan.\n\n  When could an employer be brought to court for health insurance \nproblems? I will give you one case--I think it is obvious--a case where \nan employer collects the health insurance premiums from the employee \nand doesn't pay them to the health insurance company. The employee and \nhis family think they are covered. They are not. They go to a hospital. \nThey say: We belong to XYZ health insurance plan. They say: Your \nemployer never sent in the money you contributed.\n  Should they be held liable? You bet. That is an employer guilty of \nwrongdoing. But if the health insurance plan\n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\nreceives the money for the premiums and makes the wrong medical \ndecision, the employer is not going to be held accountable.\n  That is a question that has been raised over and over by the other \nside, and it doesn't make any sense at all.\n  Do you know who can be sued in America? Incidentally, almost \neverybody is accountable in court under current law--the Red Cross, the \nHumane Society, the United Way, every other charitable foundation but \nnot your HMO. And when you go to sue because of medical malpractice, \nyou can sue your doctor, your nurse, your dentist, your hospital, but \nnot the HMO that decided you weren't going to get the treatment. When \nit comes right down to it, every Fortune 500 company, every family-\nowned corporation, every small business is subject to lawsuit in \nAmerica, subject to accountability, but not your HMO.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We need to keep in mind, as we consider this bill, that \naccountability is part of the system of justice. HMOs should be held \naccountable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next 30 minutes \nare under the control of the minority party.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, we continue discussion this afternoon on \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. Most of the morning we have spent \ndiscussing the differences between two bills, the only two \ncomprehensive bills that have been introduced to the Senate. One is the \nKennedy-Edwards-McCain bill introduced by the majority. The other is a \nbill introduced by me, the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill. Two Patients' \nBills of Rights that address the issue of how to get patient \nprotections to the patients in order to swing the pendulum away from \nhaving medical decisions made by HMOs and turn that decisionmaking back \nto the doctor and the patient and the nurse, that local level where we \nknow health care decisions are best made.\n  Several differences have been pointed out. Many of those focus on the \nimpact on the employer, whether or not the employer can be sued. Under \nthe Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, it is clearly delineated to make sure \nthat everyone knows whether it is the insurance company or the employer \nor the lawyer or the courts that accept that risk. Somebody does have \nto have that risk and that liability, and it has to be defined, which \nwe do.\n  The problem in the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill is the liability is \nkind of shifted around a little bit. You can go after the HMOs if they \nhave wronged or injured a patient. And they need to be held \naccountable; we agree with that. But the problem is, you can sue the \nHMO, you can sue other agents of the plan. That is really the key \nlanguage in there. Who are the agents of the plan?\n  Last week a physician stood up and said: I am an agent of the plan. \nSo they introduced a different bill last Thursday to say it can't be \nthe treating physician. I asked about the referring physician. Can you \nnow sue the referring physician as an agent of the plan?\n  Their bill also allows you to sue the employer. Remember, there are \n170 million people today--just about everybody listening to me, whether \nit is through radio or television or on the floor--who receive their \ninsurance through their employer, if not Medicare or Medicaid--170 \nmillion people.\n  Their employer is arranging for them to have that insurance. If you \nare an employer out there and all of a sudden you can be sued, what are \nyou going to do? Say your margin is 2 or 3 percent, you are a small \nbusiness, you are barely scraping by, and all of a sudden there is a \nlawsuit. Lawsuits can be billions of dollars under that plan. All of a \nsudden, yesterday you were not subjected to them and today you are.\n  When that is the case, what are you going to do? Your first reaction \nis going to be: How much is it going to cost me? What does it mean to \nme? Maybe I should not offer this insurance. Maybe I should give my \nemployees some money and let them go into the market themselves in \norder to avoid that. In the short term, that might be OK. I don't think \nit is OK, but it might be OK.\n  Ultimately, a number of those employees--and it falls most heavily on \nthe working poor. The premiums go up, and they will not be able to \nafford this insurance; they become a part of the uninsured. As the \nSenator from Pennsylvania said earlier, once you become part of the \nuninsured, with the increased cost and frivolous lawsuits, you can't \nafford your insurance anymore; your employer is afraid of being sued. \nThe premiums go sky high.\n  As the Senator from Pennsylvania said, if you have no insurance, the \nlikelihood of getting good health care in the United States is much \nless. Therefore, this bill has a huge impact on everybody listening to \nthis debate today. Everybody is going to be affected. The health care \ncosts for everybody are going to go up.\n  Under the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, it is going to go up 45 \npercent more--the premiums--than it goes up under the Frist-Breaux-\nJeffords bill. Yes, in our bill it goes up because we are giving new \nrights that haven't existed and those rights cost money. The money \ncomes out of the pockets of everybody listening to me right now--\neverybody--170 million people. We are talking about employer-sponsored \ninsurance for 170 million people. It is going to impact everybody \nlistening.\n  So when we talk about the cost, it is easy for politicians to show \npictures of families and talk about the individuals; but we have to \ntalk about the costs because those pictures can be pretty and you can \nreally personalize it and make it real, but at the end of the day, if \nyou drive the cost of insurance out of the reach of that family, you \nare hurting that family, or that individual. Therefore, you are going \nto hear us come back again and again and talk about the uninsured, the \nworking poor who are going to lose their insurance, about the cost of \npremiums which are going to go up significantly.\n  Everybody's premiums, right now, are already going up. Probably they \nwill go up 15 percent this year. Whatever you are paying this year, it \nwill go up another 15 percent regardless of what we do on the floor. We \nare saying that under this bill, which may pass 2 weeks from now, 3 \nweeks from now, a month from now--and I want to pass this bill--your \npremiums, instead of going up 15 percent, are going to go up 20 percent \nif the McCain bill passes.\n  Therefore, we are going to again and again say you need to justify \nthat increase in cost for these new rights. We will argue that you \nshould have better balance if you are going to drive these premiums up \nwith frivolous lawsuits--get rid of the lawsuits and have the same \npatient protections and have a lower cost. That means a lower cost of \npremiums, and it means fewer people going into the ranks of the \nuninsured.\n  That is why balance is critically important in this debate as we go \nforward. That is why looking at the rhetoric without looking at what is \nin the bill underneath is unacceptable, because if what is written in \nthat bill ultimately becomes law, that law results in--I am sure it is \ngoing to be translated into increased costs. How much depends on the \ninterpretation of what is written in the bill.\n  Can employers be sued or not? I say again and again that they can be \nsued. We have heard from the other side of the aisle that under the \nEdwards-Kennedy-McCain bill, they cannot be sued. Yet, if you read the \nbill, it says they can be sued.\n  Well, I started talking to the employers about lawsuits. I had the \npleasure of being with a number of middle-sized and small business \npeople yesterday. They were very clear in their concerns that if we \npass a bill that exposes them to not million-dollar lawsuits but \nbillion-dollar lawsuits, under the bill on the other side of the aisle, \nthe Democratic-sponsored bill, there will be open-ended lawsuits, \nunpredictable lawsuits, when they are barely scraping by, these small \nbusinesses. And they are saying now their company is going to be \nexposed to billions of dollars in lawsuits. And they might just have a \ncouple of convenience stores. They can't keep offering that insurance \nto their employees.\n  The Republicans are also accused of talking dollars and cost. We do \nnot do a very good job of translating it down to human faces, and that \nis something with which we have to do better. When we talk about \nemployers, people say: You are just for big business. It is not\n\n[[Page S6481]]\n\njust big business. It is the small mom-and-pop operations, such as \nthose convenience store operators.\n  Yesterday, I had an opportunity to meet with Sam Turner, an owner-\noperator of Calfee Company in Dalton, GA, with 139 convenience stores. \nHis words were loud and clear. He is not going to be able to offer the \ninsurance today if he is exposed to unlimited, unpredictable lawsuits \nas the owner of his convenience stores. Paul Braun from Braun Milk \nHauling Company employs 40 to 50 people in a town of about 500. The \nsame story. Lynn Martins, president and general manager of Seibel's \nFamily Restaurant in Burtonsville, MD, a second-generation \nrestaurateur, said, ``If you expose me to unlimited lawsuits, or if you \nincrease my premiums another 4 or 5 percent, I simply can't afford to \nkeep offering this health insurance for my employees.''\n  If it is not offered through your employer, yes, maybe your employee \ncan go out to an individual market and get some health insurance. But \nfor the most part, they won't do that. That is why we come back to this \nrule of thumb that is pretty accepted. It is accepted by everybody, in \nessence, that if you increase health insurance premiums by 1 percent--\nit doesn't sounds like much; it might be a hamburger once a month, or \nMcDonald's--I have forgotten the examples, but if you increase it 1 \npercent, and when you are talking about 170 million people, what does \nthat 1 percent in premium translate to? It means 300,000 people will \nlose their insurance. They have their insurance one day, and when we \npass a bill that increases it 1 percent, 300,000 people won't have \ninsurance the next day.\n  Who are those 300,000 people? Those 300,000 people are the ones who, \nwhen you increase it by 1 percent, are all of a sudden making the \ntradeoff between having food that night or having clothes for their \nkids. They are the working poor, the people who are barely scraping by, \nwho, with the help of their employer, voluntarily comes forward--and, \nremember, this is all voluntary. This employer-sponsored insurance is \nvoluntary, and therefore if you raise those prices too high, they are \ngoing to walk away from the table and leave their employees, \nunfortunately--in spite of good intentions--to go into the ranks of the \nuninsured.\n\n  How much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes, 25 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield whatever time the Senator from Utah desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I venture into this debate with a \nlittle hesitancy because I don't have the expertise that the Senator \nfrom Tennessee and others have in this field. But I want to confine my \ncomments to my experience as an employer.\n  As those who have listened to me know, I come to the Senate from a \nbusiness background and consider myself a businessman rather than a \npolitician. I have the experience of being an employer dealing with \nhealth care. It is that experience I would like to share with the \nSenate today.\n  I will open by asking unanimous consent that a letter I received \ntoday be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. BENNETT. This letter is from Ron Christensen, who is the vice \npresident of a construction company in a relatively small town in Utah, \nand the key points of the letter are those which have been made over \nand over again during this debate. That is, Mr. Christensen tells us \nthat if the Kennedy-McCain bill passes, he will be forced to stop \nproviding health care for his employees.\n  A lot of people listen to this threat, and they say businesses are \nhard-hearted, businesses are just looking for ways to punish their \nemployees, that businessmen and businesswomen are always motivated by \ngreed, and here is an opportunity for them to save money, they will \ntake the opportunity to save money whenever they get the excuse.\n  Having run a business, I can assure you that is clearly not true. \nWhen you run a business, you compete for employees, and you do \neverything you can to get the best ones to come to work for you. You \ncreate salary packages and benefit packages that are better than those \nat the business down the street so that someone will come to work for \nyou and be loyal to you and help you build your business. You don't \nview your employees as people to be exploited. You view your employees \nas a major asset. If you don't have that view, frankly, you won't be in \nbusiness very long.\n  So why is this person, who feels this way about his employees and who \nin his letter describes an excellent health care plan that he offers to \nhis employees, saying that if this bill passes, he will withdraw health \nbenefits and thereby run the risk of losing employees who are so vital \nand important to his success?\n  The reason, of course, is fear of lawsuits. He says:\n\n       If this legislation becomes law, the only way to protect my \n     company from lawsuits will be to drop health care benefits \n     altogether, and we will do this. I simply cannot afford to \n     expose our company to the potential liability from health \n     care lawsuits. Even if employers could be shielded from \n     liability, more lawsuits against health care plans will \n     result in higher premiums I pay for health care.\n\n  I know how true Mr. Christensen's statement is. It is one thing for \nan employer to say, I have a defined amount of money that I have to \nspend on health care plans; I am willing to pay that; indeed, I have to \npay that if I am going to attract and hold good employees. It is \nanother thing to say, I am putting the entire future of the enterprise \nat risk by exposing it to lawsuits. I cannot take that risk, so I will \nsay, even though it is going to jeopardize my business by diminishing \nmy ability to attract and hold quality employees, I have to do it \nbecause the alternative is so Draconian that I simply cannot escape it.\n  That is the real world. It is not the world we live in back here in \nWashington. That is not the kind of discussion we have here, but it is \nthe real world, and we should understand that as we make our decisions.\n  I remember during a similar discussion over lawsuits with respect to \nfalling stock prices that eventually resulted in the passage of \nsecurities legislation that put out of business some of the striped-\nsuit law firms, that Ralph Nader appearing before the Senate Banking \nCommittee kept pressing the point that lawsuits were always good. He \nsaid, Nobody ever settled a lawsuit out of court unless he had \nsomething to hide.\n  I remember that very clearly because Mr. Nader made that statement in \nresponse to me and some of the comments I was making.\n  I pointed out to him that while I was the CEO of the company I headed \nprior to coming to the Senate, I settled a lawsuit out of court, and I \nnot only had nothing to hide, I felt strongly I was in the right. So \nwhy did I settle the lawsuit? Quite simply because I had to save the \ncompany.\n  The legal fees of prosecuting that lawsuit at that point in the \ncompany's history were sufficiently high as to jeopardize the survival \nof the firm. So I swallowed hard the issue of whether or not we were in \nthe right and decided to save the company by settling the suit out of \ncourt without proving the point.\n  I have been there. I know how a lawsuit can threaten the survival of \na firm.\n  How significant is this in terms of decreasing health care coverage \nfor people? A study has been done that says for every 1-percent \nincrease in premium rates, 300,000 Americans lose their health \ncoverage. That is an interesting number when you realize the Kennedy-\nMcCain bill would increase rates, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, by 4.2 percent. Do the math: 300,000 lose their health coverage \nevery time it goes up 1 percent. You multiply that by 4.2 and you get \n1.26 million more uninsured.\n  I think that is a low figure, because if you take the evidence coming \nfrom the employer whose letter I cited and spread it out over the rest \nof the country, we find out that, in addition to those who will lose \ntheir coverage because the premium goes up, there are those who will \nlose their coverage regardless of where the premium is simply because \nof the fear of the lawsuits.\n\n  Some cynics have suggested that maybe that is the reason behind the \npush for the Kennedy-McCain bill.\n\n[[Page S6482]]\n\n They want people to lose their coverage so the pool of uninsured \nAmericans will grow so large that there will then be demand for a \nGovernment health care plan, which is what Senator Kennedy has told us \nhe prefers all along.\n  I would not ascribe those kinds of motives to Senator Kennedy. I \nthink instead he is simply acting out of unfamiliarity with the way \nbusinesses are really run in America.\n  I want to make it clear that the comments being made by employers \naround the country that passage of the Kennedy-McCain bill will result \nin the loss of health care benefits for millions of Americans are not \npolitical hyperbole. They are simply statements of fact based on the \nexperience of men and women who are building businesses, employing \nAmericans, moving forward to keep the economy growing, but who are \nterrified, I think accurately and properly, of the prospect of a wild \nincrease in the number of lawsuits that might come.\n  We are told some States have already done this and the lawsuits have \nnot gone up; so, therefore, that proves we will not have lawsuits on a \nnational basis. I am not sure we can make that determination and, once \nagain, the State laws are not exactly comparable to this law, and they \nare not subject to the kind of examination that has been given this law \nby those who are looking at it through the glasses of realism.\n  The other thing we hear around here often is: Forget the lawsuit \nside, the doctors are for this bill, the American Medical Association \nhas endorsed this bill. That is true; the American Medical Association \nhas endorsed the Kennedy-McCain bill and is very active in their \nstatements in favor of it. Normally, that would be something that would \nimpress me, but I share with you, Madam President, and the other \nMembers of the Senate, an experience I had in my office today.\n  I received a phone call from a doctor in Utah whom I have known for \nmany years. He said, I am here at the meeting of the American Medical \nAssociation, and they are whipping us all up to call our Senators in \nsupport of the Kennedy-McCain bill. And so I am doing what I have been \nasked; I am calling my Senator with respect to the Kennedy-McCain bill \nso I can report back to the American Medical Association that I have \ndone what I was told to do. As long as I have you on the phone, let me \ntell you what I really think. I am opposed to the Kennedy-McCain bill. \nI think it is a mistake. I much prefer the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill. \nI think it would work far better for the medical profession in Utah and \nthe patients I deal with in Utah, and, Senator, I trust you to do the \nright thing.\n  The American Medical Association succeeded in their lobbying efforts \nto get a hometown doctor to call me, but they probably were not pleased \nwith what the hometown doctor said. Based on his experience, based on \nhis understanding of where things are, he recommends we defeat Kennedy-\nMcCain and go in the direction of the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill.\n  The fact is, of course, we do not know in advance what will be all of \nthe consequences of the legislation we pass. The one thing I have \nlearned around here is that whatever other laws we pass, the one law we \npass over and over is the law of unintended consequences. We do not \nknow what the unintended consequences will be from either of these \nbills, but I have learned as a result of discovering the impact of the \nlaw of unintended consequences that the impression to go slow, the \ndesire to be careful, the desire to move in incremental steps rather \nthan a sweeping bold approach that we love to call for when we are \nrunning for reelection, is the right desire.\n  That is another reason why we should try the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords \nbill, which goes further than many of my colleagues on this side of the \naisle would like to go toward a Patients' Bill of Rights. Let's see how \nit works before we take the next step, which could have catastrophic \nconsequences.\n  I say catastrophic consequences because I am talking about the \ncancellation of health care for many Americans. I am talking about the \nrising disillusionment with the whole activity of what we do with \nrespect to health care on the part of many Americans and then \nultimately a demagogic call for the Government to take everything over, \nand we are back into the disaster, the train wreck we went through in \nthe 103d Congress when President Clinton tried to implement that kind \nof solution. It tied up this body for months. It stopped everything. It \nproduced maximum ill will all the way around. We stepped back from \nthat. We took the approach I am talking about, which is to say let's do \nit a step at a time, let's do it with something we can get our arms \naround where the unintended consequences will be less radical and less \nsweeping. We passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which I was happy to \ncosponsor and support, and then we began to see some of the reforms \nthat we could have had earlier if we had stayed away from the extremes \nproposed to us.\n\n  We see reforms in the Patients' Bill of Rights area, reforms that can \nwork. We see things that will give us experience, that will hold down \nthe severity of the unintended consequences, if we go in the direction \nof the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, but I fear if we go in the other \ndirection we will only see the consequence that is predicted in this \nletter that will follow my remarks, where employer after employer will \nsay, Sorry, we can't expose ourselves to this liability. And in the \nname of trying to help health care, we may end up destroying it \naltogether. That is, in my view, a serious mistake.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                           Christensen & Griffith,\n\n\n                                         Construction Company,\n\n                                        Tooele, UT, June 19, 2001.\n     Senator Robert Bennett,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington DC,\n       Dear Senator Bennett: I suspect I am ``preaching to the \n     choir'' by sending this letter to you, but I want you to know \n     I am strongly opposed to the Patients' Bill of Rights bill \n     sponsored by Sens. Kennedy and McCain under consideration by \n     the Senate. There are better ways to correct the few problems \n     that get so much attention.\n       My company prides itself on providing quality health care \n     for our valued employees and their families. We provide a \n     comprehensive plan which includes dental and have never had a \n     complaint that could not be corrected. We are partially self \n     insured and pay the total premium. No cost to the employee. \n     Why mess with a good thing? The present system has kept costs \n     in check and affordable. The politically motivated Kennedy-\n     McCain bill will only drive up the cost of health insurance \n     and encourage employers to pass more responsibility for \n     health care to the employee.\n       Unfortunately, the Kennedy-McCain bill threatens my ability \n     to provide health care for my employees. However well-\n     intentioned, this bill would expose employers like me to \n     lawsuits between employees and the health care plan my \n     company provides. Despite claims that this bill has a lawsuit \n     ``exemption'' for employers, this protection is murky, at \n     best, and does not adequately protect employers from \n     lawsuits. In fact my company could be sued for simply having \n     selected a health care plan for employees.\n       If this legislation becomes law, the only way to protect my \n     company from lawsuits will be to drop health care benefits \n     altogether, and we will do this. I simply cannot afford to \n     expose our company to the potential liability from health \n     care lawsuits. Even if employers could be shielded from \n     liability, more lawsuits against health care plans will \n     result in higher premiums I pay for health care. A survey of \n     construction companies last year found that 77% were faced \n     with increased health insurance premiums, even without the \n     potential added cost of this legislation. In order to stay in \n     business more and more of the cost will have to be passed on \n     to the employee. As an alternative, employees should be given \n     access to a quick, independent external review process that \n     would give patients the right to take their disputes to an \n     independent panel for a quick decision.\n       Employers are not bad people exploiting their employees as \n     the unions would have us believe. Were it not for employers \n     with a profit motive our economic system would not work. \n     Please oppose this Kennedy-McCain expansion of liability as \n     you consider managed care reform legislation. Don't destroy a \n     system that has served us well and made health care \n     affordable. Thank you for your consideration of my views.\n           Yours Truly,\n                                                 R.I. Christensen,\n                                                   Vice President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, when this debate began yesterday on \nreform of the managed care system in America by establishing a \nPatients' Bill of Rights, it did so under very uncertain and \nunfortunate circumstances. There was objection to proceeding to the \nbill, causing delay and unnecessary\n\n[[Page S6483]]\n\nconfusion with the American people as to whether we intended to deal \nwith this problem. We can all be pleased the Republican minority now \nhas withdrawn its objections. We can now, tomorrow, begin the serious \nwork of actually debating a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  This is a moment that has been 5 years in the making. Before the \nSenate is honest, compromised, and reasonable legislation to establish \na Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a question that involves our most \nbasic responsibilities to the American people to assure their health \nand welfare.\n  We all recognize how we arrived at this moment. The Senate may be \nlate, but it is right in dealing with this question.\n  The extraordinary increase in the cost of health care in the 1970s \nand 1980s radically increased the ranks of the uninsured in America. By \nestablishing a predetermined list of medical providers at established \ncosts with recognized services, it was everybody's hope that these \nmanaged care plans could strike a balance between the rights of \nconsumers and providers with reasonably agreed upon costs.\n  It was a sound concept, but practice has established that the power \ndisproportionately came to rest with insurance companies and the \ndoctors and that patients lost control over their professional rights \nor the needs of their families.\n  During these years that the Federal Government has been unable to \ndeal with this crisis, the ranks of the uninsured have continued to \nrise to 45 million people despite managed care. The growth of health \ncare costs rose less slowly but has continued to rise, and a feeling of \nparalysis began to grip the country as doctors no longer believed they \ncould make medical decisions and families could no longer get access to \nthe health care providers that had been a part of the American \ntradition of family medical practice.\n  While the Federal Government was paralyzed, interestingly, States \nbegan to fashion their own responses. In 1997, my own State of New \nJersey enacted the Health Care Quality Act--in some respects a model \nfor what the Federal Government is challenged to accomplish. That law \nin New Jersey prohibited gag clauses. Doctors had the right, the \nrecognized responsibility, to talk to their patients about medical \noptions. An independent health care appeals program was established so, \nwhen care was denied by the insurance company, people had someone to go \nto, to appeal the judgment. There was a requirement that insurers \nprovide clear information on their services and their limitations.\n\n  Interestingly, in 1997 when that act was passed by the State \nlegislature in New Jersey, it was by a Republican legislature and \nsigned by a Republican Governor, something that should be a challenge \nto Members of the Senate in the minority party today. But this Senate \nis now challenged to act because, while that State legislation was \nproperly designed, it was insufficient, not only insufficient in that \nit was not national in scope but because for many people in my State \nand across the country in other States, people with similar experiences \nwere exempted by ERISA laws.\n  Mr. President, 124 million Americans, 83 percent of those who get \ntheir health care from their employer, are not covered by State laws \nbecause of this exemption. Fifty percent of the people in the State of \nNew Jersey enrolled in HMOs are exempted from the very State \nprotections that I just outlined and that my State government wanted \nand intended to give to our people because of this exemption under the \nEmployee Retirement Security Act of 1974.\n  Under this bill, HMOs claimed immunity from State regulations even if \nthere was negligent behavior. It may or may not have ever been the \nintention of this Congress to exempt managed care in health care, but \nwhether that was our intention or not, that is how the law is \noperating. So despite the best actions of State government, millions of \nAmericans--124 million Americans--have no protection from the abuses of \nthe managed care system. That is why the responsibility now rests here \nand why this Senate is the only hope of the American people to get \nrelief from this abuse of power.\n  The American people understand what needs to happen. Only people in \nthis institution seem to doubt it. A recent survey in my own State of \nNew Jersey by Rutgers University found that one in four people in my \nState are completely dissatisfied with their health care plan, despite \nthe fact they are paying for it and are enrolled in it and cannot get \nout of it because their employers have contracted for it. Last October \na State report found that patients in my State were not only \ndissatisfied, but they are more dissatisfied than they were a year ago. \nThe situation is deteriorating.\n  The legislation now before this Senate, offered by Senators Kennedy, \nEdwards, and McCain, is an answer. It is not simply bipartisan. That \nunderstates what has been achieved. But 500 organizations of patients \nand doctors stand behind this legislation to get patient protection to \nall Americans in HMOs. The confrontation that went on for decades \nbetween patients' rights advocates and doctors has not only ended but \nthey have come together in a broad national coalition for this \nlegislation. We have not only achieved what once seemed unlikely, the \nbill represents what once seemed impossible. This is achieved because \nspecific rights would now be guaranteed to the American people.\n  To many Americans whose children suffer with diseases, whose lives \nare threatened, this Patients' Bill of Rights, to them, in their \nsuffering or their financial distress, is just as important as the \noriginal document which bears the title a ``Bill of Rights.'' The title \nis borrowed for this health care emergency because to them this has \nevery bit as much significance.\n\n  What are these rights? One is the right to get to a specialist. Under \ncurrent law in managed care, you can take a family member to your \nfamily doctor, but the cancer or the heart problem, the specialized \ndisease or ailment that may plague you and threaten your life, is \nbeyond the capacity of that family doctor. That is not the exception; \nthat is often the rule. With this bill, you will have the right by law \nto get to a specialist who can save your life.\n  No. 2 is the right to get to an emergency room. In a nation in which \nwe travel the country every day all across our States, all across our \nNation, what kind of system is it, if you have health care insurance \nand you should be in a car accident or have an illness traveling \nsomewhere in your State or across America and the local emergency room \nis not in your health care plan? Under this bill, that emergency room \nwill give you coverage, whether they are in the plan or not, because \nyou are there and that is where your illness or your accident happens \nto be.\n  No. 3 is the right of women to use an OB/GYN as their primary health \ncare provider. Millions of women have made the medical decision to use \ntheir OB/GYN as their principal health care provider. It makes no sense \nthat they have to first go to a family doctor, a general practitioner, \nfor a reference. This establishes that right.\n  No. 4, as with every other patient, the right of a child to get to a \nspecialist should never be impaired. A child should be able to get to a \npediatric oncologist or heart specialist as a matter of right, \ndirectly, without delay, without question, if that is the only person \nwho can deal with their illness and that is established.\n  No. 5, it is unconscionable that, by contract, any doctor should be \nrestricted from discussing with any patient their health care options--\nthe technology, the specialist, the choices that the genius of American \ntechnology in medicine has made available. But that is not a \ntheoretical problem, it is something that doctors are facing in America \nevery day, a contractual wall placed between a doctor's knowledge and a \npatient's need. This bill tears down that wall. No doctor in any \nmanaged care plan will ever be told again: In spite of what you know, \nin spite of what you think is in your patient's best interest, you \ncannot tell them the choices available. Now they will know as a matter \nof right.\n  No. 6 is the right to a review. If a doctor is prescribing a test or \na procedure and believes it is vital to a patient and that is denied, \nthat manager of a health care plan, that businessman, is not the last \nword. There is a right of appeal to a health care specialist, \nindependently placed to oversee the managed care plan, so not only is a \ndoctor making the recommendation but a doctor is the final, independent \nword.\n\n[[Page S6484]]\n\n  Finally, the right of accountability. I once heard Bill Clinton say \nthere were only two classes of people in this country by right who are \nimmune from accountability by the legal procedures: Foreign diplomats \nby treaty and HMO bureaucrats. One of those will be taken away by this \nbill.\n  Can you imagine what an American automobile would be like if auto \ncompanies did not have the threat of lawsuits if their cars were not \nsafe? We would still be manufacturing clothing in America that was \nflammable. We might still be living in houses that had carcinogens in \nthem. I guarantee, our cars, our trains, our airplanes would not be as \nsafe. The threat of liability, the knowledge that the courts will hold \na company accountable if they do not do whatever is required to be \nsafe, is a great protection for the American people. We have extended \nit to every other industry in America except to managed health care \nplans. This bill will change that. There will be access to court. There \nwill be damages.\n  There will be an expense if managed care health care plans are not \nensuring that the right decisions are made, that the law is followed \nand people are as safe as possible. It is the right judgment.\n  There are those who are going to come to this floor in the coming \ndays and argue: Oh, that may all be true, that may all be right, but if \nyou give these rights to the American people, those 124 million \nAmericans in managed care who are not getting these rights, the costs \nwill rise so high that the number of uninsured will grow and the \nproblem will become worse and not better.\n  It would be a sound argument but for the facts. The CBO has estimated \nthat if this legislation is put in place, the average cost per employee \nwill be $1 per month. That is a lot of protection for millions of \nAmericans at a very modest cost. The CBO continues that, over 10 years, \nit is estimated premiums would rise by 4.2 percent. That is a lot of \nprotection for a lot of years for very little cost.\n  But what of the argument that even these modest costs would throw \nmore people into the ranks of the uninsured? The experience has been \njust the opposite.\n  In 2000, when health insurance premiums increased by 10 percent, more \nthan twice the amount estimated would happen under this bill, the \nnumber of uninsured not only didn't rise but the number of uninsured \ndropped.\n  There is no reason to believe--and the empirical evidence suggests \noverwhelmingly--that we will not cause a rise in the uninsured. We will \nsimply cause better insurance by passing this bill.\n  This is good legislation. This goes to our most fundamental \nresponsibility to the American people. If this Congress and if this \nSenate does nothing else in this session, if nothing else is \naccomplished, we can reach the lives of millions of Americans who live \nin fear every day that during the night a child will get ill, a parent \nwill contract a disease, or someone in a family will suffer, and in \nspite of the fact that family members get up every morning, work every \nday and pay their health care premiums, when they need their insurance \nit will not be there for them.\n  It is not a theoretical fear; it is real. We can do something about \nit. It is reflected in this bill. If we are ever going to stand with \nthe American people, stand with them now. If we are ever going to do \nsomething to change their lives, do it with this bill.\n  I am proud to be associated with it. I am more than a little proud \nthat the first legislation brought to this floor by a new Democratic \nmajority in the Senate and by our majority leader, Tom Daschle, is a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. That speaks volumes about the Democratic \ncaucus in this Senate. It says everything you need to know about Tom \nDaschle, and it says a lot about why there is still a great chance to \nbe proud of this Senate and this session of this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, I want to thank my colleague, the senior Senator from New \nJersey, for his passionate commitment to affordable access to health \ncare and patients and families, and I appreciate being on the floor \nwith him today. We appreciate his leadership.\n  I come to the floor again to speak about this critical issue of \npassing a Patients' Bill of Rights for the families of our country. One \nof the reasons that I came to the Senate in January was because of this \nissue and what it means to the families I represent.\n  The very first opportunity and honor that I had to speak on the floor \nof the Senate was to speak about the importance of passing a Patients' \nBill of Rights. I am very pleased and thankful and grateful to our new \nmajority leader for his understanding of the priority of this \nlegislation and the fact that he would indicate that under his \nleadership the first bill to come to this floor would be the bill to \nguarantee that those who pay for insurance, who have health insurance, \nand the businesses that pay for insurance for their employees will know \nthat, in fact, care will be given when there is an illness or an \nemergency.\n  Yesterday, I spoke about young Jessica and her situation as a young \nperson under an HMO. Today, I want to share another story.\n  This comes from a letter that I received as a House Member 2 years \nago. I shared it on the House floor during the debate at that time. \nThis came from Susan and Sam Yamin. It was a very important letter \nabout the tragedy that befell their family and their fight with an HMO \nto get emergency care.\n\n  Sam Yamin owned his own business. He worked hard. He owned a tree-\ntrimming business. He was working on the job every day to support his \nfamily. He and Susan were working hard. One day on the job he had an \naccident with a chain saw that caused him to fall back and cut his leg \ndown to the bone. This is in Birmingham, MI, a business owner who had \nan accident. He was rushed to the nearest emergency room where he was \nprepared immediately for surgery to repair the nerve damage.\n  The doctors took him in, had him ready, and prepared to have surgery. \nThey called the HMO which said: He is at the wrong emergency room. You \ncan't proceed to save the nerve in this man's leg. You have to tell \nthis man that he has to go across town in metro Detroit to another \nemergency room in order to be able to be served.\n  With much distress, as you can imagine, his wife, Susan, packed him \nup, and drove him over to another emergency room where he waited, on a \ngurney, in the emergency room, for 9 hours. He didn't see a doctor \nuntil he finally literally tore a pay phone off the wall; he was in \nsuch pain; and he was crying out for help.\n  His ordeal continued when orthopedics began making decisions based on \nthe HMO point system for the approved hospital doctors. If a patient \nhas an unsuccessful operation or an expensive procedure, the doctor is \ngiven 5 to 10 points under this system. But if the doctor is able to \nprovide a low-cost, quick fix, the point range is 0 to 4. They receive \ncompensation based on how low the points are in this process of looking \nat payment.\n  Unfortunately, not only was he trapped by having to move to another \nemergency room, but this point system which rewards the low-cost fix \nput him in a situation where he didn't get surgery. He didn't have \nsurgeons who came to his rescue to fix the nerve in his leg. They just \nsimply sewed up the leg. Now Sam Yamin has permanent nerve damage that \nis spreading up his spine. He lost his business. His health care costs \nhave escalated and have become a serious burden to his family. After \nmany appeals, the HMO finally agreed to refer Sam to what they \nconsidered to be an adequate specialist, a podiatrist, a foot doctor. I \ncertainly respect podiatrists, but that is not what this gentleman \nneeds for the disability and the permanent nerve damage in his leg.\n  Finally, even when they made a referral, it was not to the \nappropriate specialist.\n  Sam Yamin is one example of somebody who worked hard, had his own \nbusiness, cared for his family, played by the rules, and had insurance. \nHe thought his family was covered. He goes to the emergency room, and \nhe is told that he cannot get the help that he needs.\n  That is what this is about. That is what this Patients' Bill of \nRights is about. It is about saying to those families who have health \ninsurance for\n\n[[Page S6485]]\n\ntheir family members that if you are in an emergency, you can go to the \nnearest emergency room and get care. If you need a specialist, you can \nhave the right to a specialist. If you need a test or a treatment, you \ncan have that, and the doctor or the nurse can make the medical \ndecision and not be overruled because of nonmedical reasons because it \nis just too expensive to give you the specialist that you need or the \ntest or the procedure.\n  We really have a choice in front of us this week and next week as we \ndebate the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is time to choose. Are we going \nto stand up for Susan and Sam Yamin and their family in Birmingham, MI? \nAre we going to stand up for the doctors and the nurses and the \ndentists and the therapists and all those who come into the health care \nprofession to be able to treat patients and give them the care they \nneed? Are we going to stand up for the people who pay the bills as \nconsumers of health insurance? Or are we going to side with the HMOs \nand the insurance companies that have created this problem?\n  That is the choice. To me, it is a simple choice. We know there are \nfolks in the HMO business and insurance companies that make good \ndecisions. There are HMOs in Michigan that do a good job.\n  But we also have situations where the wrong decisions are made and \npeople have been hurt. In the end, when the Yamins come to me and say: \nWhy is it that the only part of the health care system that is not held \naccountable for what they do and the decisions they make are HMOs? I \ncannot answer that. I cannot answer why the only two groups of people \nin the United States of America that are not held accountable--cannot \nlegally be held accountable for their decisions--are foreign diplomats \nand HMOs. I cannot answer the reason why that makes any sense because I \nbelieve it does not.\n  The Yamins are asking me to fight on their behalf. The damage is \nalready done. Mr. Yamin has lost his business. He has lost functioning \nin his leg. The mounting medical bills for their family will not be \nreversed. But they have asked me to fight to make sure this does not \nhappen to another family.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in a bipartisan bill before this body. A \nlot of hard work has gone on. There have been a lot of changes in the \nlast 5 years since this issue was first brought up. We have an \nopportunity to pass something meaningful that will make a difference in \nthe lives of our families. I urge we do so.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to address the issue today of \npatient protection legislation that is now before the Senate. I would \nlike to thank so many of my colleagues who have led the effort to enact \nsensible patient protection legislation that will protect patients \nmore, give patients more rights, and make sure we keep the costs down \nso that we will not decrease the number of insured in our country but, \nin fact, will increase the number of insured people. We would like a \ngoal of every American to have quality health coverage. To do that, we \nmust keep costs down as well as make sure that the quality part of the \ncommitment is kept.\n  Senator Frist, Senator Breaux, and Senator Jeffords have what I think \nis the best bill. Of all of the alternatives, I think there are parts \nof each that are similar, and I think all the three major bills will \ncertainly be able to come together. But I think the Frist-Breaux-\nJeffords approach is the one that makes the most sense and addresses \nthe issues that are of most concern.\n  Senator Frist, the Senator from Tennessee, is also the only medical \ndoctor in the Senate. Of all people, he would know the danger of \nturning over patient care to accountants and an insurance company. He \nalso knows the danger of turning patient care over to trial lawyers \nwhose first interest is not the well-being of the patient.\n  That is why I think his bill is the one that takes the balanced \napproach of giving more rights and addressing the major concern of \nquality patient care but also making sure that we do not open the \ncourts to frivolous lawsuits that would cause the cost of health care \nto increase exponentially.\n\n  We all know that quality health care in the United States is \nunparalleled. There is no argument from anywhere regarding that fact. \nThe question is, How do we maintain this level of quality while \nexpanding it to as many Americans as possible? This is a complicated \nquestion, but there is a deceptively simple answer: Cost.\n  When you review the statistics on the uninsured, it becomes very \nclear. Only 18 percent of the uninsured come from families who have no \nconnection to a workforce. The Kaiser Commission found that 82 percent \nof the uninsured come from working families. In fact, 71 percent of the \nuninsured come from families with one or more full-time workers.\n  According to a study done by the Center for Studying Health System \nChange, 20 percent of all uninsured people are offered health insurance \nby their employer, or a family member has an employer who offers health \ninsurance, and they could get coverage for his or her family, and they \nchoose not to enroll in the plan.\n  The most cited reason for not enrolling in an offered plan is cost. \nThe costs are a double-edged sword. They are of concern to the patient \nand the employer who would provide insurance. High costs have caused \npeople to choose to be uninsured in return for more money in their \npaycheck, feeling that they need that money for other priorities higher \nthan health care coverage. It also is the stated cause by employers \nthat say they cannot offer health insurance to their employees. That is \nwhy it is essential that any bill we pass not increase costs either for \nthe patient or for the employer.\n  If health costs continue to climb, the potential results could be \nalarming, as evidenced by a recent series of nationwide polls of \nemployers. In each one, an overwhelming majority of employers stated \nunequivocally they would have to pass on any new cost to their \nemployees, whether by raising the employees' premium or out-of-pocket \ncosts or by reducing benefits or eliminating coverage of certain \nservices.\n  As the American economy begins to cool, businesses are beginning to \ntighten their belts. We are seeing the unemployment rolls go up. This \ncould take a bigger toll on the rolls of the Nation's uninsured. We \ncannot fool ourselves that a minor increase would make no difference to \nbusinesses, especially small businesses with tight profit margins. \nIndeed, it would not take much at all for small businesses to drop \ncoverage of their employees.\n  According to a study done by the Employee Benefits Research \nInstitute, a 5-percent increase in premiums would cause 5 percent of \nsmall businesses to drop coverage, and a 10-percent increase would \ncause 14 percent to drop coverage.\n  There is also some good news in these figures, if we can just address \nthem; that is, this would also work in reverse, with decreases in rates \ncreating more coverage. In fact, just a 10-percent decrease in rates \nwould make 43 percent of small businesses more likely to offer \ncoverage.\n  We must keep these consequences in mind. We must also remember the \nconsequences of our own actions in another way. Remember the health \ncare debate that we had less than 10 years ago. I doubt that my \ncolleagues across the aisle want to relive the consequences of trying \nto force upon the American people a nationalized health care system in \nour fiercely independent, democratic Nation.\n  If Americans are currently unhappy with decisions being made by their \nHMO rather than their doctor, then just as in 1993, they are not going \nto want decisions to be made by a bureaucracy in Washington, DC. Yet \ntoday we are considering legislation that would impose numerous new \nFederal mandates and regulations. I know if we don't learn from the \nmistakes of the past, we are doomed to repeat them. I didn't think we \nwould be doomed so soon.\n  We all have the same goals: to ensure high-quality health care is not \ncompromised; that more Americans have access to health care; and that \nall patients have basic rights and guarantees concerning their health \ncare.\n\n[[Page S6486]]\n\n  This is about people, not lawyers. We understand that people care \nmore about getting health care, not about filing a good lawsuit. We \nunderstand patients want the care. They are not interested in filing a \nlawsuit later, when the injury may be irreparable. We have the support \nof the American people on this issue. A recent survey by Market \nStrategies showed that 83 percent of Americans say lawsuits with few \nrestrictions would make it even harder for the working poor to afford \ncoverage.\n  We should also listen to States that have already introduced some \nform of a Patients' Bill of Rights, such as my home State of Texas. One \nsize does not work on humans, and it should not be applied to all \nStates, either. Yet one of the bills that is before us, the Kennedy-\nMcCain bill, would make all States the same. It would penalize States \nsuch as Texas that have taken steps toward a Patients' Bill of Rights \nand where, in fact, it is working.\n  When Texas enacted the broad set of managed care reforms in 1997, \nthey addressed an issue that we are attempting to address in Congress. \nTexas successfully tackled even the sticky issue of appeals and \nlawsuits, one of the greatest hurdles in the debate on the bill today.\n  In Texas, if an HMO denies a claim, patients have the right to \ninternal and external appeals. Once you have exhausted your \nadministrative remedies and only then can you contemplate suing your \nHMO in court. The external review section was struck down by a Federal \ncourt as the State tried to apply these provisions to federally \nregulated HMOs. As you can imagine, that didn't stop Texas. They \nrevived their external review section of the law, this time making it \nvoluntary. Despite the ability to decline to participate, HMOs and \nother health plans are participating, and they are agreeing to be bound \nby the external review process.\n  This is how the external review process works in Texas. We let an \nexternal review board of professionals, who are not associated with the \nHMO, decide who is right concerning the patient's care. If the HMO \ndenies coverage for a certain procedure, the patient and the doctor \ndisagree with their decision, then the patient can make an internal \nappeal within the HMO first.\n  If after the HMO reviews the appeal they still refuse to change their \nstance, then the patient can appeal again to an outside panel of \nexperts not associated with the HMO in any way. It works.\n  In fact, of more than 300 appeals heard under the external review \nsystem, fewer than 10 lawsuits has emerged. At the same time, the \nsystem has proved to be fair. The conclusions of the appeals are \nvirtually 50/50 in favor of both the patients and the health plans.\n  I know all of us want the best health care for America. But it is a \nlot easier to jump on a rhetorical or political bandwagon, sometimes, \nthan to create good legislation. Rather than rushing a bill through \nCongress--and this bill has not even had a committee markup--it is \nimportant that we examine this bill carefully. We are going to have to \ndo that in this Chamber because the committee process was bypassed.\n\n  It is important that we ensure we are not creating more problems than \nwe are trying to solve. We must remember the rule of unintended \nconsequences, that sometimes the end results are vastly different from \nwhat we expect or intend.\n  We can't afford to take a chance with unintended consequences with \nour health care system. It is too basic to too many people in this \ncountry for us to make a mistake and go overboard and find that we have \nallowed so many lawsuits with not very many limits to create a cost \nincrease in our health care system that would cause people to lose \ncoverage or to start relying on lawsuits instead of talking to their \ndoctors and getting an outside appeal to get the care on a timely \nbasis.\n  A Patients' Bill of Rights is important. We must make sure that we \nwork together to get this high quality.\n  Let me describe some of the reasons I am supporting the Frist-Breaux-\nJeffords plan. It gives access to emergency rooms without any question \nand without any delay. In fact, all of the bills agree on these basic \nissues. I believe if we have a bill that has direct access to an \nemergency room, direct access, without going through a process, to get \nto an OB/GYN specialist or a pediatrician or specialty care by a \nspecialist in an area, when that is called for in a diagnosis, then I \nthink that will be a good Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  If we have a rapid, binding internal and external review process on \ndenials of claims, that would be a good Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  If we have access to Federal courts, after going through the external \nreview process, with reasonable limitations on noneconomic damages, \nthat will be a good Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  No one argues that we should have unlimited economic damages if a \nperson is found not to have gotten the proper care. That person needs \nto have the right to that care that was found to be denied in error.\n  It is the noneconomic damages that have caused so much rise in cost \nthroughout our health care system, that has caused premiums to go up, \nhospital costs to go up, equipment costs to go up, doctor visits to go \nup. We can come to a reasonable compromise that gives people rights to \nsue and rights to access but doesn't take the cap off responsibility so \nthat the patient care is secondary to the big court reward that you \nmight get even if it is unwarranted.\n  That hurts everybody in the system because the cost goes up. And who \nis hurt the most? It is the person who is barely able to afford that \ninsurance coverage but has access to it and might drop it or choose to \ngo uninsured because the costs become unbearable.\n  This has a ripple effect throughout the health care system. When a \nperson goes uninsured and then has a terrible accident, then the costs \nmust be shared by all taxpayers, by all the people in and out of the \nsystem. It is in everyone's best interest that we have quality, \naffordable health care coverage so people will have their needs met in \na responsible way.\n  That is what I think the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords plan will do. I hope \nvery much that my colleagues will make sure that we do the responsible \nthing because it would be a bigger harm to our country to do the wrong \nthing, to take a chance.\n  I was here during the debate in early 1994 on the health care plan \nthat was put forward, which would have basically nationalized our \nhealth care system. After 2 days of debate on that bill, it was pulled \ndown because people began to see that putting our health care system \ninto a government system was going to limit quality. It was going to \nlimit the access that people have to the great quality health care that \nwe have come to enjoy in our country.\n  When we talk about quality health care, we are talking about new \ninnovations in prescription drugs. We are talking about being able to \ntreat something with prescription drugs today that 10 years ago would \nhave been a huge operation and a 2-week stay in the hospital. We have \nbeen in the forefront of the innovation with the newest technologies \nand the newest prescription drugs that would allow America to have the \nvery best health care coverage of any country in the world. We don't \nwant to lose that. Our freedom to choose has been a big part of the \nsuccess of that system.\n  But we are in danger of losing it if we turn our system over to \npeople who are not interested in patient welfare. It could be the \naccountant in the insurance company office who makes a data entry error \nand causes the person to lose coverage; or it can be the trial lawyer \nwho is more interested in earning a big fee than in getting the patient \nthe coverage they need.\n  It is my intention to offer an amendment to this bill that would also \nmake sure that a person can't have coverage dropped without notice. \nToday, a person can walk into a pharmacy and order a prescription under \ntheir insurance policy and be told by the pharmacy that a family member \nhas been dropped from coverage, unbeknownst to the person who walked in \nthe door. What kind of system is it that someone can be told they don't \nhave insurance and, therefore, they can't get their prescription or \nthey must pay for it in full even though they have coverage, and then \nwhen the person calls the next week and says, excuse me, but I was told \nthis week, after 6 years of coverage by the same insurance company, \nthat a member of my family was dropped from coverage, and the person \nsays, oh, there was an error made in a data entry and it was a mistake \nthat\n\n[[Page S6487]]\n\nyour wife was dropped from coverage. That has happened with one of the \nbetter insurance companies in this country.\n  I am going to offer an amendment that would keep an insurance company \nfrom dropping without notification someone who has been approved for \ncoverage, so if there is a mistake, the person will have the ability to \ncorrect the mistake before suffering the embarrassment of being told \nthat they don't have coverage. I just wonder what would have happened \nif the person had showed up in the emergency room and was told they \ndidn't have coverage anymore, unbeknownst to them, because of a data \nentry error that was inadvertently made by a faceless bureaucrat in an \ninsurance company system.\n  So I do think it is important that we have a Patients' Bill of \nRights, and I think it is important that we proceed with the utmost \ncaution to make sure that everything we are doing is going to \ncontribute to the problem's solution and not make it worse. That is the \nchoice that we have today, and the reason that I am supporting the bill \ncreated by the only physician in the Senate, Senator Bill Frist, who \nhas seen firsthand the dangers of an insurance company making a bad \ndecision in an HMO and the dangers of putting patient care in the hands \nof trial lawyers.\n  What we want is a Patients' Bill of Rights that puts patient care \nfirst and foremost and makes sure that we don't increase costs with \nunintended consequences. That is the issue that we will be debating for \nthe next 2 weeks. I hope the people of America will take the \nopportunity to learn the differences between the two major bills that \nwill be before us today and the rest of this week, and probably next \nweek, because a person's insurance coverage and quality of care will be \ngreatly affected by what we do in the Senate in the next 2 weeks.\n  I urge my colleagues to take the responsible approach to make sure \nthat we keep the high level of quality care that we have been able to \nenjoy in our country--the best in the world--and let's not take a \nchance on lowering the quality while we give more people the ability to \nhave guaranteed rights, and that our eye is on more access for more \npeople in our country, not less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the \nBipartisan Patient Protection Act of 2001, which has been sponsored by \nJohn McCain, John Edwards, and Ted Kennedy.\n  I am a proud sponsor of this legislation because it meets my \nprinciples for managed care reform and, yet, at the same time, it meets \nthe day-to-day needs of my constituents in Maryland and the American \npeople. It is also supported by virtually every health care consumer \nand provider group.\n  Mr. President, the time to act is now--not weeks from now, not months \nfrom now, not years from now. We have been considering what is the best \napproach to have a Patients' Bill of Rights to protect people from the \narbitrary, capricious, and often dangerous decisions of insurance \ncompanies. We have been considering that now for more than 4 years.\n  Now, nobody said during the debate of the tax bill that we need more \ntime to analyze these amendments. Yet we have irrevocably made a fiscal \nchoice that I think will ultimately shackle us in what we can do for \nthe American people. We did that pretty quickly. They were all set to \nkind of ram a missile defense shield down our throats, where we were \ngoing to spend $80 billion to come up with a ``techno-gizmo'' to shoot \na bullet with a bullet that might or might not come to us. Yet after 4 \nyears, we need more time to look at the fine print on the Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  I say the time has come. We have to have this done by the Fourth of \nJuly, and I am ready to declare my declaration of independence and \nreally move this bill forward.\n  In the United States of America, we are geniuses at inventing the \nthird way. We don't have a socialist system. We don't have a comrade \nsystem. I agree, we don't want comrades and socialism. Also, we did \nbelieve people needed a safety net. We didn't want to leave them to the \nvagaries of who gets health care--where you could have the rich versus \nthose with no health care at all--kind of a Darwinian, predatory, free-\nmarket approach; but at the same time we invented the third way--\nprivate insurance that people could buy to protect themselves. We in \nthe United States wanted to give help to those who practice self-help. \nWe invented Medicare and Medicaid for those populations that were \neither too poor or too at risk for the private market.\n  So now here we are with the third way--private insurance. But some \nyears ago, in a place called Jackson Hole, where the insurance \ncompanies met with lots of tax subsidies to support them at that \nmeeting, they came up with managed care. Managed care is nothing but a \neuphemism for a moat around medical care. That is what managed care \nis--a moat around medical care. Jackson Hole created a black hole for \npatients to be able to go in and get the medical care they need.\n  So I think the time to act is now. I hope that we will follow some \nvery basic principles. Mr. President, I think we need to fight for \npatients, not for profits. Medical decisions should be made in the \nexamining room by the doctor, not in the board room by the insurance \nexecutive. Patients should have the right to receive the treatment that \nis medically necessary by the most appropriate provider using the best \npractices.\n  Patients need continuity of care. Just because an employer changes \ninsurance companies, you should not have to change your doctor, \nparticularly if you are pregnant or a family member is terminally ill \nor if you are in a rehab center.\n  Patients should be able to hold their insurance companies accountable \nfor medical decisions in the same way they hold their doctors \naccountable for medical decisions, and that is by having the \nopportunity for redress in court. The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill meets \nthose principles.\n  Let me give an example of continuity of care. It is absolutely \ncrucial. I worry about people who are undergoing care for serious and \ncomplex medical conditions. Often an employer will change insurance \ncompanies, but the employee should not be penalized. Again, if a woman \nis pregnant, she should have continuity of care. If a family has a \nchild who has leukemia, while they are fighting for their child's life, \nthey should not be fighting with their insurance company to keep their \ndoctor.\n  If a family member has a stroke and is getting rehab, certainly they \nshould be able to have continuity in that facility with that rehab team \nfor 90 days or until discharge from the facility.\n  These are the kinds of issues we are talking about in our legislation \nand what we are fighting for.\n  I came to the Senate to save lives, to save jobs, and to save \ncommunities. This is what we want to do: save lives and make sure we \nstop the horror stories about Americans who are denied medically \nnecessary treatment.\n  Mr. President, 31,000 people every year are forced to change doctors; \n35,000 people a year have needed care delayed. Thousands and thousands \nevery day have to wait for permission to get their bills paid.\n  Let me tell you about Jackie from Bethesda, MD. She is a go-getter, \nas many Marylanders are. She was hiking in the Shenandoah Mountains, \nlost her footing, and fell down a 40-foot cliff. Thank God there were \npeople there to help her. She was airlifted to a hospital. Guess what. \nThe HMO refused to pay her $10,000 hospital bill because she did not \nget prior authorization.\n  Then there is the story of a little boy who found his diabetic dad \nlying unconscious after days and days of trying to get an HMO referral \nto a specialist. This little genius called 911, but, again, though the \nfather was rescued, they then had to fight with the insurance company \nwhile they were fighting to bring him back to health so he could go \nback to work.\n  Fight, fight, fight always with the insurance company. I am joining \nwith Senator Jack Reed on an ombudsman bill that supports programs like \nthe one in Maryland where we actually pay people to deal with the \nentanglements of denial and dismissal of benefits to which they think \nthey are entitled.\n  The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill is terrific. It guarantees access to \nemergency care. It provides timely access to specialists.\n\n[[Page S6488]]\n\n  In this bill, if you have a child, you have access to a pediatrician. \nA woman has direct access to an OB/GYN. We guarantee continuity of \ncare, and we stop that dreaded practice of drive-by mastectomies. That \nis why we like the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill.\n  We know Dr. Frist and Senator John Breaux and even yourself, Mr. \nPresident, look at it another way, and we respect that, but we think \nthat bill has too many loopholes. It leaves out too many protections. \nThere is no protection for a health care provider that advocates on \nbehalf of a patient. It does not prohibit coercive financial incentives \nfor physicians to deliver health care. But I do not want to talk about \ntheir bill. I want to talk about the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill. I \nwant to talk about getting a bill now. I am talking about a bill that \nremoves the moat around medicine. I am talking about putting patients \nbefore profits.\n  I conclude by saying we are the discovery nation. In the 20th \ncentury, we made more scientific and medical breakthroughs than at any \nother time in world history, and the breakthroughs came from here. They \ncame because the American people funded the NIH and then the private \nsector and our universities value added to come up with new ideas and \nnew products that are saving lives.\n  When my mother was first diagnosed with diabetes, she could either go \non insulin, oral insulin, or nothing at all. Now there are over 300 \ndifferent forms of medication to help those patients. We are on our way \nto finding a cure for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\n  While we are so busy discovering lifesaving pharmaceuticals, dramatic \nnew techniques, and new forms of prevention, we should not let the \ninsurance companies prevent our access to the very things we paid to \ninvent.\n  Let's pass this Patients' Bill of Rights. Let's do it before the \nFourth of July break, or I believe the American people will foment \nanother revolution, and we will have to stand out of their way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the McCain-Edwards-\nKennedy patient protection bill of which I am very proud to be a \ncosponsor.\n  It is time--it is past time--for us to help millions of Americans \nobtain their basic rights and protections in dealing with health care \nproviders.\n  It is time--it is past time--for health insurers to be held \naccountable when they show more concern for their own bottom line than \nfor the patients' health and safety.\n  It is time--it is past time--for medical decisions to be made by \npatients and doctors, not some HMO bean counter.\n  I am no stranger nor a Johnny-come-lately to this issue. Years ago I \nbecame a supporter of Congressman Charles Norwood's effort, my good \nfriend and Republican colleague from Georgia, as he went about in his \ncourageous effort to make this change. And I come from a State that \npassed a strong patient protection law 2 years ago which, by all \naccounts, is working very well.\n  Now it is time for Congress to pass a strong Federal law to protect \nthe millions of patients who cannot be protected by the Georgia law or \nby any other State's law.\n  This patient protection issue has been on our to-do list for a long \ntime. We often speak of something serious as being a life-or-death \nmatter, but it seldom is. Today this is truly a life-or-death matter \nfor many American families who cannot wait any longer for us to act.\n  When Georgia wrestled with this issue 2 years ago, at the heart of \nthe debate was the question of how we could best protect the interest \nof patients enrolled in managed care plans. That question has become \nincreasingly important over the past 20 years because managed care has \ncome to dominate the health care delivery system.\n  In 1980, managed care was a novelty. Today more than 70 percent of \nAmericans and close to 80 percent of insured employees are covered by \nsome form of managed care.\n  As the number of Americans enrolled in HMOs and managed care has \ngrown, so have the complaints grown and so have the horror stories \ngrown about being denied adequate care.\n  The proper role of managed care is to balance the cost of health care \nwith the medical needs of patients, but in too many cases the concerns \nabout cost always come out ahead of the concerns for the patient. In \nfar too many cases, managed care has become mismanaged care.\n  The Georgia law that was passed in 1999 brought balance to the \nequation by giving patients explicit access to specialists and \nemergency care. The law also created an independent external review \nsystem to address patients' grievances. These are the essential \ncomponents of any good bill, and they are the components of the bill I \nspeak for today.\n  When the Georgia Legislature debated this law, there were critics--\ncritics who made the same arguments that we are hearing in Washington \ntoday and that I heard last year and the year before.\n  In Georgia, the critics paid for ads saying the law would drive up \npremiums and cause more people to lose coverage. The critics paid for \nads claiming employers would be held liable for HMO mistakes. They paid \nfor ads predicting--and I love this alliteration--a ``flurry of \nfrivolous'' lawsuits. Oh, there was hissing and moaning, but you know \nwhat? None of those dire predictions has come true. By all accounts, \nGeorgia's patient protection law is working, and working well. In fact, \npatients are so satisfied with the independent review process that not \na single, solitary patient has filed a lawsuit. No, not one.\n\n  Let me read from an article in the Atlanta Constitution on Monday, \n``Georgia's Pioneer Plan Avoids Legal Side Effects.'' The first two \nparagraphs I will read:\n\n       When Georgia's Patient's Bill of Rights became law two \n     years ago, managed-care companies predicted they would be \n     spending a lot of time in court defending their decisions to \n     deny coverage. But there has yet to be a lawsuit filed by a \n     patient who first aired the grievance through the new \n     independent review system, state officials said.\n       ``The law is working as intended,'' said Clyde Reese, \n     Director of the Health Planning Division that oversees the \n     patient protection process. ``In the two years, no one who \n     has gone through this process and has been denied has filed a \n     lawsuit. It has not given rise to litigation. We're not aware \n     of even one suit that's been processed.''\n\n  There it is. The naysayers, Chicken Littles, never give up. Today on \nthis bill, they are telling you that if it is passed, the sky will \nfall. They claim that the patients' employers can be sued as well as \nthe HMO itself.\n  Wrong. Not so. This conservative, probusiness, Democratic Senator \nwould never support a bill that exposes employers to that kind of \nliability. The McCain-Edwards bill specifically protects employers, \ngives protection even to the directors of the HMO. Those individuals \ncannot be personally sued, as some would have you believe. Employers \nare shielded from lawsuits unless they directly participate in a \nmedical treatment decision.\n  This is also one of the very principles President Bush has said must \nbe included. When President Bush released his principles for a \nbipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights on February 7, he said: Only \nemployers who retain responsibility for and make medical decisions \nshould be subject to suit.\n  We agree with President Bush. The principle outlined in February is \nthe exact principle that is in our bill.\n  Now I am not a judge, and there is not enough of me to be a jury, but \nthat is pretty plain to me. Only the HMO itself can be sued. And who \ncan argue that HMOs should not be held accountable for mistakes? \nShouldn't HMOs be treated like any other health care organization or \ndoctor or business or individual?\n  While the Georgia law is a model for protecting patients, they \nunfortunately cannot protect all of Georgia's patients. No State law on \nthis issue can protect all the citizens because a Federal law, the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, also known as ERISA, \nexempts a large class of employees from State oversight. That means \nmillions of Americans are not covered under any patient protection law. \nThey have no legal recourse in dealing with their HMOs, and they are \nsuffering. It is, for too many, truly a life-or-death matter. That is \nwhy I believe so strongly that Congress must act, and act now.\n  The McCain-Edwards bill would also provide patients with their basic \nrights and protections in a balanced way. It\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\nguarantees access to medical specialists; it protects patients from \nhaving to change doctors in the middle of treatment; it provides fair, \nunbiased, and timely internal and independent external review systems \nto address patients complaints; it ensures that patients and doctors \ncan openly discuss all the treatment options without regard to costs; \nand it includes an enforcement mechanism that ensures these rights are \nreal.\n\n  The McCain-Edwards bill is also consistent with all of the principles \nlaid out by President Bush except one: President Bush, a man for whom I \nhave profound respect, wants the Federal courts to have exclusive \njurisdiction over patient protection lawsuits. Another bill introduced \nby Senators Breaux and Frist, colleagues for whom I also have great \nrespect, would comply with the President's wish on this point by moving \nall liability lawsuits to the Federal courts.\n  I am sorry, but I must respectfully disagree with the President and \nmy colleagues on this one point. A purely Federal solution is not the \nbest solution. The Breaux-Frist bill would preempt Georgia's law, as \nwell as the laws of seven other States that have passed similar patient \nrights bills. The traditional arena for resolving questions about \nmedical negligence is the State court. I submit that is where the \njurisdiction should remain. It is the courtroom that is the closest to \nthe people. Don't make my folks in Brasstown Valley have to go over the \nmountains, through Unicoi Gap, to get to that big, crowded, white \nmarble courthouse in faraway Gainesville. That ``ain't'' right. Let 'em \ngo to the county seat, to the courthouse in Hiawassee that they and \ntheir family have known for years.\n  Now, one more thing. Any bill on this issue is going to add to the \ncost of health insurance premiums. They all do. Ours, in my opinion, is \nthe most reasonable. The Congressional Budget Office estimates if the \nMcCain-Edwards bill is passed, premiums will increase by 4.2 percent \nover 10 years. That translates to slightly more than $1 a month for the \naverage employee. I believe most Americans will be more than willing to \npay an extra $1 a month for the protection this bill will afford them.\n  Let's not drag this thing on. Please, let's not play partisan games \nwith something this important. It has been an issue in three \ncongressional elections now and two Presidential elections. The time \nhas come to resolve this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Georgia leaves the \nfloor, I will say a word. I have one daughter--my oldest child is a \ndaughter--and she has four brothers. When she married, we were a little \nconcerned because she married someone from the South, from North \nCarolina. But he has been such a wonderful son-in-law and, with his \nfamily, we have gotten to know about something that I kind of refer to \nas southern common sense. My son-in-law, first of all, is very smart. \nIn addition to that, he has so much common sense. He can figure out \nproblems. He has been a great father to three of my grandchildren.\n  I give that background because the more I am exposed to southern \nlegislatures, the stronger I feel on an affirmative basis about my son-\nin-law. I think we need more of this southern common sense in the \nnational legislature. The two Members on the floor today epitomize what \nI think is the direction of the South in influencing legislation in the \nSenate.\n  I listened with interest and awe to the statement of the Senator from \nGeorgia. It was as good as I have heard in this Chamber, and I have \nheard some good ones. It was direct and to the point, as only the \nSenator from Georgia can be with his wealth of experience being an \nadministrator and legislator.\n  Another Senator on the floor with the Senator from Georgia is our \nfriend from North Carolina.\n  My son-in-law is from Kannapolis. We talked about that. It is a place \nwhere they made lots of sheets and towels and things such as that, for \nmany years.\n  I have not had the opportunity publicly to express my appreciation to \nmy colleague for lending his expertise to this legislation because he \nhas not only brought the southern common sense to this legislation but \nalso the respect we all have for him and his legal abilities.\n  To my two southern friends here today, I say thank you very much for \nmaking it possible for us to be able to pass this legislation. Because \nof the two of you--there are other reasons, of course--we are going to \npass this legislation. More than 5 years is enough. We are going to \npass this legislation, and we are going to do it in the immediate \nfuture, not way down the line. We are going to pass it as soon as we \ncan, which is going to be before the July recess begins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, first I say to my friend from Nevada, he \nis mighty lucky to have a son-in-law from North Carolina.\n  Mr. REID. I agree.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. We are glad he has a son-in-law from North Carolina.\n  I say to my friend from Georgia, who, some people may not know, lives \n6 or 8 miles from the North Carolina line, so North Carolina had a \nlittle good influence on him when he was growing up in Georgia. In \nfact, when I was in western North Carolina not long ago, in the closest \ntown to the Georgia border, they said they started to believe Senator \nMiller was their Senator, so I had to make it clear to them, no, it was \nnot true; I represented them, although he does a great job of \nrepresenting all the people of that area.\n  I thank the Senator for a number of things.\n  No. 1, for the eloquence of his speech, because it was so well \nthought out, so clearly spoken that anyone listening would have \nunderstood it.\n  No. 2, for talking about the actual experience as opposed to some of \nthe rhetoric we hear on both sides of this debate on the issue of what \neffect this kind of patient protection legislation will have on \nlawsuits and the potential for lawsuits.\n  Georgia in fact has a real experience. We do not need to guess about \nwhat has happened down there. They have legislation very similar to \nours. In the State of Georgia, there have not only been few lawsuits, \nthere has been none during the time that law has been in place. I know \nthe Senator played a role in helping, with his friends down there, to \nmake sure that law in fact happened.\n  Next, I thank the Senator for his leadership on this issue. As he \nsaid, he is no newcomer to this issue. He has been involved in it for a \nnumber of years. His expertise and involvement are critically \nimportant.\n  Finally, no one cares more about being certain we are not exposing \nemployers to lawsuits than the Senator from Georgia. He has made very \nclear from the day he walked in this institution that he is a man of \nstrong character, integrity, and independence. There is no doubt in my \nmind he means what he says. He would not be in support of this \nlegislation--I might add, nor would I, nor would the Senator from \nNevada--none of us would support this legislation if we believed it \nexposed employers to lawsuits. We all care a great deal about that \nissue, as we care about protecting patients and providing adequate \npatient protection against some of the HMO abuses that have occurred.\n  I wanted to stand briefly and thank my friend from Georgia, thank him \nfor his cosponsorship of our legislation and thank him for his very \nclear thinking on this issue which has now been expressed to the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I inquire how much time we have \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Let me speak briefly and then yield the floor to my \ncolleagues on the other side from whom we welcome hearing on this \nissue.\n  First, we have now had a number of speakers who have addressed the \nissues that have been discussed over the course of the last 2 days now, \nsince our legislation was introduced. We pointed out--and I hope we \nwill continue to point out throughout the course of this debate--that \nthere are areas of agreement but there are areas of disagreement. There \nare important differences between the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy\n\n[[Page S6490]]\n\nbill and the competing bill on the other side. Those areas of \ndisagreement go from the beginning of the bill through the end, \nincluding such things as access to specialists outside the plan, access \nto clinical trials--particularly FDA-approved clinical trials, access \nto a truly independent review process so when the claim of a patient is \ndenied by an insurance company that patient they can go to a group and \nget that decision reversed, knowing it is a totally impartial review \npanel, there being no question about the independence of that review \npanel; finally, as a matter of last resort, the case being able to go \nto court if in fact these other processes do not work.\n  But what we now know from the Senator from Georgia, plus the \nexperiences in Texas and California, is that when these appeal \nprocesses are in place, when a patient is wrongly denied care by an \nHMO, there are two places for that decision to be reversed before \nanybody goes to court. One is the internal review within the HMO; the \nother is the external review to a truly independent body.\n  I might add as to the cost--the Senator from Georgia referred to \nthis--our bill, according to the Congressional Budget Office, will \nraise insurance premiums 4.2 percent over 5 years. The Frist bill \nraises insurance premiums I believe 2.9 percent over the same period of \ntime.\n  The difference between the two, the 1.3-percent difference, the \nmajority of that difference has nothing to do with litigation. It rests \nin areas such as difference in access to specialists, difference in \naccess to clinical trials, difference in quality of care. So the bulk \nof the cost difference between the two bills goes specifically to the \nissue of the quality of care that children, families, and patients \nacross America will receive.\n  To the extent the argument is made that there is an explosion of \nlitigation, that this is going to cost a great deal of money, the \nreality is that there is a little over 1 percent difference between our \nbill and the competing bill. The bulk of that difference is accounted \nfor by difference in quality of care.\n  The American people are going to get a better product. They are going \nto get better health care. They are going to have a way to get access \nto clinical trials for their child who needs to be seen by a \nspecialist, to be seen by a specialist. They are going to have a way to \nreverse a wrongful decision by an HMO. That is what we are talking \nabout. None of that has anything to do with going to court or lawsuits.\n  As to the issue of going to court, as the Senator from Georgia \npointed out so clearly, we are only asking one thing, and that is that \nHMOs not continue to be treated as privileged citizens; that they be \ntreated as everyone else--they ought to be treated as every other \nAmerican, every other small business, every other large business--and \nthat they not maintain their status as being the only group in America \nthat cannot be held accountable for their actions. That is what this \ndebate is about. We are on the side of patients. That is the reason the \ngroups, AMA and others, support our legislation.\n\n  I think it is time now for me to yield the floor to my colleagues on \nthe other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. I will take a couple of minutes. I will be brief, and then \nthe Senator from Maine will address many of the issues we discussed.\n  Clearly, much of the debate centers on what the cost of this bill \nwill be. We both have patient protections. We want to give rights to \npatients that they deserve, rights to make sure we have medical \ndecisions made by doctors and patients working together, and not \nmedical decisions made by HMOs.\n  If HMOs make a medical decision, then they need to be held \naccountable. How do you hold them accountable? That is where much of \nthe difference lies.\n  In terms of cost, because I do want to clarify this and because the \nSenator from North Carolina is comparing the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill \nto the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, most of the quoted cost comparisons \nare from the Congressional Budget Office, upon which we rely. In truth, \nthey are projections. Nobody knows exactly what the cost will be, but \nit is important to understand how the increase in premiums relates to \nthe overall cost. Specifically, how much will premiums increase for the \n170 million people who rely on insurance to obtain their health care? \nThat is what we are discussing. The American people, who are the ones \nwho will be paying more for the cost of this Bill of Rights--what they \nwill pay is substantially different in our bill versus their bill.\n  In their bill, when you talk about these little percentages, the \nincrease itself is about a 4 percent increase in premiums. When you \ntalk about their 4.2 versus our 2.9 percent, the percentage is only 1 \npoint difference. However, the difference is significant, whether it is \n8 percent, or 5 or 4 percent, because for every 1 percent increase, we \nare talking about 300,000 people losing their health insurance.\n  In America, when you don't have insurance, you can still go to the \nemergency room, but you do not have the quality of care that you would \nhave with insurance.\n  Instead of trying to make these differences sound tiny and small, as \na physician, I see the faces of 300,000 individuals. Three hundred \nthousand individuals, who today have health insurance, but because of \nfrivolous lawsuits and paying trial lawyers too much with no increase \nin patient protections, they lose their health insurance.\n  We continue to talk about the relative cost.\n  One other thing, to clarify what has been said on the floor regarding \nthe civil remedies part, the Congressional Budget Office scores the \nFrist-Breaux-Jeffords bill versus the Kennedy-McCain-Edwards bill twice \nas much in terms of that increase. There is a big difference in terms \nof the cost. They score theirs .8 and ours is .4 in terms of the cost \ndue to civil remedies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is now considering the \nissue of how best to ensure that patients receive the health care they \nneed when they need it and that was promised by their insurance plan.\n  The last 10 years have been particularly turbulent ones for health \ncare providers and patients alike. Concerns about rising costs have led \nto extensive changes in how health care services are provided and paid \nfor in both public and private health plans.\n  As a consequence, there is a growing unease across the country about \nthe changes in the way we receive our health care. Families worry that \nif they or their loved ones become seriously ill, their HMO will deny \nthem coverage and force them to accept either inadequate care or \nfinancial ruin--or perhaps both. They feel that vital decisions \naffecting their lives will be made not by a supportive family doctor \nbut by an unfeeling bureaucracy. They fear that they will have to fight \ntheir insurance company as well as their illness.\n  These are the concerns that have prompted this important debate about \nhow we can ensure that HMOs are held accountable for promised care and \nthat medical decisions are made by individuals wearing stethoscopes, \nnot green eyeshades. People should not have to worry that their HMO \nwill unfairly deny them treatment or force them to accept inadequate \ncare.\n  Virtually every Senator agrees that medically necessary patient care \nshould not be sacrificed to the bottom line and that health care \ndecisions should be in the hands of doctors, not insurance accountants. \nBut we face an extremely delicate balancing act: as we respond to these \nconcerns, we must be careful not to impose overly burdensome Federal \ncontrols and mandates that will drive up costs and cause some people to \nlose their health insurance altogether. That is the whole crux of the \nmanaged care debate.\n  We should pass a strong, binding Patients' Bill of Rights, but we \nshould do so in a responsible way so that we don't add excessive cost, \nlitigation, and complexity to an already strained health care system. \nCongress should use the set of principles that President Bush has given \nus as a road map to develop a bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights--one \nthat applies meaningful patient protections where they are needed \nwithout unduly increasing health care costs.\n\n[[Page S6491]]\n\n  The biggest obstacle to health care coverage in the United States \ntoday is cost. American employers everywhere--from the giant \nmultinational corporation to the small corner store--are facing huge \nhikes in their health insurance costs. Rising health insurance costs \nare particularly problematic for people purchasing coverage in the \nindividual market and for small businesses and their employees.\n  Earlier this year, the dominant carrier in Maine's individual market \nincreased its rates by an average of 23.5 percent for indemnity plans \nand 32.6 percent for HMO plans. As a result of these increases, many \npeople in my state are either dropping coverage or switching to \n``catastrophic'' plans with very high annual deductibles.\n  Similarly, many small employers in Maine are facing premium increases \nof 20 to 30 percent, forcing them either to drop their health benefits \nor pass the additional costs on to their employees through increased \ndeductibles, higher copays, or premium hikes. This also adds to the \nranks of the uninsured as more lower-wage workers, unable to afford the \nincreased costs, drop coverage or turn it down.\n  No wonder the ranks of uninsured Americans have grown to 43 million. \nIf this happens at a time we have been enjoying a strong economy, just \nimagine what could happen in an economic downturn.\n  Higher health insurance premiums lead to significant losses in \ncoverage. Studies have shown that for every one percent increase in \ninsurance premiums, insurance coverage for as many as 300,000 people is \njeopardized. This is one of the primary reasons I am so concerned about \nthe McCain-Kennedy version of the Patients' Bill of Rights. According \nto the Congressional Budget Office, the McCain-Kennedy approach will \nincrease health insurance premiums by an additional 4.2 percent over \nand above the double-digit premium increases we have already \nexperienced. Moreover, this bill is even more expensive than previous \nversions of the legislation.\n  Congress should act to provide the important protections that \nconsumers want without causing costs to soar, and we can do so by \npassing a carefully crafted bill. I also believe that we should not \npre-empt or supercede, but rather build upon the good work that states \nhave done in the area of patients' rights and protections.\n  States have had the primary responsibility for the regulation of \nhealth insurance since the 1940s. As someone who has overseen a Bureau \nof Insurance in state government, I know that state regulators have \ndone a good job of protecting consumers.\n  One of the myths in this debate is that unless the federal government \npre-empts state insurance laws, millions of Americans will somehow be \n``unprotected'' in their disputes with HMOs. That simply is untrue.\n  For example, as this chart demonstrates, 48 states have passed laws \nprohibiting ``gag clauses'' that restrict communications between \npatients and their doctors. Forty-four states have requirements for \nemergency medical care; forty-seven have prompt payment requirements; \nthirty-seven require direct access to an OB/GYN; forty-one have \nrequirements for external appeals; and all fifty have requirements for \ninternal appeals and patient information.\n  As is so often the case, states have been the laboratories for \ninsurance reform.\n  They have acted without any mandate or prodding from Washington to \nprotect their consumers. They have been way ahead of us in enacting \npatients' rights.\n  Moreover, one size does not fit all. What may be appropriate for one \nState may not work well in another or may simply be unnecessary. For \nexample, what may be appropriate for California, which has a very high \npenetration of HMOs, may simply not be needed in States such as Alaska \nand Wyoming where there is virtually no managed care. In these States, \nimposing a new blanket of heavy-handed Federal mandates and coverage \nrequirements will simply drive up costs that will impede, not expand, \naccess to health care.\n  That is why the National Association of Insurance Commissioners \nopposes the approach taken in the McCain-Kennedy bill which would force \nall States to adopt virtually equivalent Federal standards.\n  Recently, I received a letter from Kathleen Sebelius, the president \nof the NAIC, in which she writes:\n\n       States have faced the challenges and produced laws that \n     balance the two-part objectives of protecting consumer rights \n     and preserving availability and affordability of coverage. \n     For the federal government to unilaterally impose its one-\n     size-fits-all standards on the states could be devastating to \n     state insurance markets.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this letter from the NAIC be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, under the McCain-Kennedy bill, the \nFederal Government could preempt existing State patient protection laws \nunless they had already enacted identical protections--not just similar \nones, identical ones. The approaches taken by the 50 States to the same \ntypes of patient protections vary widely and with good reason in many \ncases.\n  Why should a State that has already acted on its own to provide \nstrong, workable patient protections have to make extensive changes in \ntheir laws to comply with new Federal standards?\n  Let me give you a recent example from my home State of Maine. Maine \nis one of just 12 States that require health plans in the fully insured \nindividual and small group market to provide coverage for routine costs \nfor patients participating in clinical trials. During its consideration \nof this provision last year, the Maine Legislature made the decision to \ninclude only those clinical trials that were approved and funded by the \nNational Institutes of Health. I would note, parenthetically, that this \ndecision was one that was made by a legislature controlled by the \nDemocratic Party.\n  What would happen under the McCain-Kennedy bill? Under that approach, \nMaine would have to go back and rewrite its law to include clinical \ntrials approved or funded by the Department of Defense, the Veterans' \nAdministration, and the Food and Drug Administration.\n  Why should the State of Maine have to revisit its law? The law that \nthe State of Maine came up with to require coverage of certain clinical \ntrials was carefully debated. It was thoroughly considered. And the \nMaine State legislature decided that this was the best approach for the \ncitizens of Maine. Yet under the legislation we are considering today, \nMaine would have to change its law or have it completely superseded by \nthe Federal Government taking over control of its health \ninsurance market.\n\n  Let me be clear. I believe the Federal Government does have an \nimportant role to play in regulating the self-funded plans under ERISA. \nThat is because, under current Federal law, States are precluded from \napplying patient protections to these Federal plans. That is why we \nneed a Federal law to ensure that consumers enrolled in insurance plans \nbeyond the reach of State regulators enjoy the same kinds of strong \npatient protections that apply to State-regulated plans.\n  As I said, and as you can see from the chart, the States have been \nextraordinarily active in this area. It is all well and good if \nCongress decides that it wants to impose a specific requirement or \nmandate on federally regulated ERISA plans, since States are, by law, \nprecluded from regulating these insurance plans. But the Federal \nGovernment should not be in the business of second-guessing and \noverriding the carefully crafted patient protections that have been \nnegotiated by our State legislatures and Governors to meet the needs of \nthat State's citizens.\n  States that have seized the initiative and acted on their own should \nnot have to revise their carefully tailored laws simply in order to \ncomply with a Washington-knows-best, one-size-fits-all Federal mandate.\n  Moreover, what if the State has made an affirmative decision not to \nact in one of these areas for very good reasons, such as the reason I \npreviously gave where a particular State may not have much managed care \nso that this debate is largely not relevant to its citizens? What if \nthe State legislature, after much discussion and debate, has decided \nthat a particular consumer protection simply isn't needed because the \nmarketplace has already taken care of this issue?\n\n[[Page S6492]]\n\n  Let's look at the consequences under the McCain-Kennedy bill of a \nState failing to enact an identical provision to the consumer \nprotections in S. 1052.\n  The bill proposes, quite simply, a Federal takeover of State health \ninsurance regulation. The Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, \nwould be charged with enforcing the new Federal standard.\n  Talk about a right without a remedy. In a report issued in May of \nthis year--5 years after new Federal health insurance standards were \nenacted under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, \nthe Mental Health Parity Act, and the Newborns' and Mothers' Health \nProtection Act--5 years after those laws passed, five States are still \nout of compliance, and Federal fallback enforcement in these States is \nvirtually nonexistent.\n  Moreover, HCFA told the GAO that it has not even been able to fully \nassess whether or not the States have complied with the Mental Health \nParity Act enacted 5 years ago, and that law is scheduled to sunset \nthis year. Given the fact that the Patients' Bill of Rights--the \nversion we are considering right now--is replete with new health \nmandates, consumers should be very concerned that HCFA has already \nproven beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is incapable of enforcing \nexisting Federal insurance standards in States that do not conform. In \nfact, HCFA has shown that it is incapable of even assessing whether or \nnot the States have complied with these limited Federal insurance \nstandards. So what makes us think that HCFA could in any way take over \nthe responsibility of regulating health insurance in States that do not \ncomply to the letter with the standards in the McCain-Kennedy bill?\n  If HCFA has not been able to handle its limited responsibility under \nthe laws that I mentioned, how in the world would it benefit consumers \nto provide for a Federal takeover of health insurance regulation in \nthis area?\n  I think the answer is clear. It would be a tremendous disservice to \nconsumers to have HCFA take over health insurance regulation. I know \nthat my consumers, my constituents in Maine will have far better \nservice and far better luck dealing with the Bureau of Insurance in the \nState of Maine in Gardiner, ME, than trying to call the ERISA office in \nBoston or the HCFA office in Baltimore. It is that simple.\n  As we consider Federal patient protection legislation, I believe that \ntrue deference should be given to the expert decisionmakers who know \nbest what is appropriate for each State and who are most immediately \naccessible and accountable to that State's citizens.\n  Another of the myths--and there are many--in this current debate is \nthat you can't sue your HMO. That, too, is not true. HMOs--even self-\ninsured ERISA plans--can be sued in State court over quality-of-care \ntreatment decisions. They can also be sued, under current law, in \nFederal court for injunctive relief to force them to provide needed \ncare or to compensate the patient or provider for the value of the \nbenefit, plus any attorney's fees. This is the exact same legal remedy \nthat is currently available to us as Members of Congress under the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Plan.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I do not wish to yield at this point. I would like to \nconclude my statement.\n  We do need strong remedies to prevent HMOs from denying needed care. \nThere is no dispute over that point. All of us are deeply troubled by \ncases in which an HMO has acted in a way that was not in the best \ninterest of the patient. That is not what this debate is about. The \ndebate is about the best way to solve those problems, to ensure that \nevery patient gets the care that he or she needs when they need it. \nThat is what the debate is about.\n  That is why a strong, independent, and binding appeals process is \ncritical to ensure that patients get the care they need when they need \nit; that they get the care they were promised. They should not have to \nhire an attorney and file a lawsuit to get the health care they need. \nThey just can't sue their way to quality care. That is why the key is \nto make sure that we have an appeals process that is binding, that is \nindependent, and that will force the HMO to provide the care that has \nbeen promised.\n  I am particularly concerned that the liability provisions in the \nMcCain-Kennedy bill, as currently drafted, could well discourage \nemployers that currently voluntarily provide health insurance to 172 \nmillion employees and their families from continuing to offer coverage. \nWhile the McCain-Kennedy bill claims to protect employers, the fact is, \nas I read the bill, they would be subject to both new Federal and State \nlawsuits authorized under the bill.\n  Under the McCain-Kennedy bill, a trial lawyer just needs to allege \nthat an employer directly participated in a medically reviewable \ndecision to force that employer to court. The direct participation \nstandard in S. 1052 does not shield employers from being sued. It \nsimply gives them a defense that they can raise in court. Being subject \nto such lawsuits will be particularly hard, potentially ruinous for \nsmall business owners who cannot afford the tens of thousands of \ndollars they would have to spend on attorney's fees to fight these \nkinds of cases in court.\n  Many Maine employers have expressed their serious concerns about the \nliability and scope provisions of the McCain-Kennedy bill. I met, for \nexample, with the assistant director of human resources at Bowdoin \nCollege who talked about how moving to a self-funded ERISA plan enabled \nthe college to continue to offer affordable coverage to Bowdoin \nemployees when premiums for their fully insured plan skyrocketed in the \nlate 1980s. Since they were self-funded, they were actually able to \nlower their premiums for their employees and at the same time enhance \ntheir benefit package with such features as well-baby care, free annual \nphysicals, and prescription drug cards with low copayments. They told \nme that a proposal such as the one before us today could seriously \njeopardize their ability to offer affordable coverage for their \nemployees.\n  Similar concerns have been expressed by the Maine Municipal \nAssociation, L.L. Bean, Bath Iron Works, and many other very \nresponsible Maine employers that care deeply about providing the best \npossible health insurance for their employees.\n  Even though S. 1052 is certain to drive up health insurance costs, it \nalso does nothing to expand access to affordable health insurance. In \nfact, by driving up costs, it jeopardizes health insurance coverage for \npeople who already have it and puts the cost further out of reach for \nthose who lack it now.\n  As we proceed with our consideration of legislation to protect \npatients' rights, we should also be considering ways to expand access \nto coverage for millions more Americans by making health insurance more \naffordable.\n\n  As the Presidential Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and \nQuality noted in its report which was done for President Clinton, I \nnote: Costs matter. Health coverage is the best consumer protection.\n  As we proceed in this very important debate, I hope we can continue \nto work to improve S. 1052 so that it truly protects patients without \njeopardizing their insurance coverage and without wiping out the good \nwork of the States.\n  I was encouraged today by a conversation with Senator McCain in which \nhe indicated that he is very open to resolving some of the problems I \nhave raised in my statement. I hope that we can work together, and at \nthe end of the day I hope we can approve, by an overwhelming vote, a \nresponsible Patients' Bill of Rights that will help ensure that \npatients receive the care they need, when they need it, without having \nto resort to hiring an expensive lawyer and filing a lawsuit. That \nshould be a goal that should unite us all.\n  I look forward to the upcoming debate. I think it is an important \none. I hope we can come together on a bipartisan bill that the \nPresident will sign, that will make a real difference in the health \ncare for America's patients.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield to my friend from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I listened carefully to the Senator. As a member of our \ncommittee, I know she gives a good deal of attention and time to health \ncare and education issues, as well as the other matters that come \nbefore our committee. We take her words seriously.\n\n[[Page S6493]]\n\n  While listening to her, I was reminded that the Maine Medical \nSociety, which represents the medical community in the State of Maine, \nis in strong support of our proposal. Which proposal does the Senator \nsupport at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has the floor and she \nhas 1 minute.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have worked very closely with the Maine \nMedical Association on a variety of issues. I know that while they do \nwant to see liability provisions similar to those of the Senator, they \nare very concerned about the issue I raised about the preemption of \nMaine's law.\n  Maine has been very active in passing a number of laws to provide \nconsumer protections. They are carefully balanced laws. On this chart, \nthere is a check mark all the way across. I know the Maine Medical \nAssociation was very involved with the legislature in negotiating those \nprovisions. They are concerned about the preemption of Maine's laws \nwhich they helped to draft.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I ask one further question. The Maine law includes \nclinical trials, but does not include FDA clinical trials. The proposal \nof Senator Edwards and Senator McCain does include clinical trials. \nMost of the women's groups, including women's cancer groups are \nstrongly in support of this provision. They recognize that many \npharmaceutical companies are on the edge of breakthroughs in the \ndevelopment of these new products.\n  I am interested in this illustration. The provisions for clinical \ntrials in Maine are preferable, quite frankly, to the provisions \nincluded in Breaux-Frist, where there are a number of problems.\n  Wouldn't the Senator from Maine feel that including the patients in \nMaine in these FDA protocols might be helpful if they meet the other \nrequirements? For example, what if a doctor feels that participating in \nthese clinical trials means there is a real possibility of relieving a \npatient's medical condition?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Maine has led the way on insurance \nreform. Maine is one of only 12 States that cover clinical trials. The \nMaine legislators gave careful consideration to what the scope of that \ncoverage should be, and a Democratic legislature and an independent \nGovernor decided, for reasons of cost, to limit the clinical trials \nprovisions to those who were approved by the National Institutes of \nHealth. That is appropriate.\n  What I object to is that the Kennedy approach, the Kennedy-McCain \nbill, would say that if a State didn't cover clinical trials exactly as \nthe Senator from Massachusetts wants them covered, then Maine's law is \nwiped out. I don't think that is right. I notice that Maine has been \nfar more active than Massachusetts in the area of patients' protection, \nso perhaps that explains the difference in the approach that the \nSenator from Massachusetts, my friend, and I take.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                      Insurance Commissioners,\n\n                                   Kansas City, MO, June 19, 2001.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: As the Senate prepares to debate \n     legislation designed to protect the rights of health \n     insurance consumers I would like to reiterate the concerns of \n     the nation's health insurance regulators.\n       The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), \n     which represents all fifty-five insurance commissioners in \n     the states and territories, is primarily concerned about \n     federal preemption of state laws and regulations. All states \n     have passed and implemented legislation to protect the rights \n     of beneficiaries. Over 40 states have acted to ensure access \n     to emergency and OB/GYN care, require fair utilization review \n     and internal and external appeals processes, and prohibit \n     discrimination and gag clauses. Over half of the states have \n     laws ensuring access to specialists and non-formulary \n     prescription drugs, a point of service option, and continuity \n     of care.\n       As members of Congress know from experience, passing \n     patient protection legislation this can be a difficult task \n     with a variety of issues to consider. States have faced the \n     challenges and produced laws that balance the two-part \n     objectives of protecting consumer rights and preserving the \n     availability and affordability of coverage. For the federal \n     government to unilaterally impose its one-size-fits-all \n     standards on the states could be devastating to state \n     insurance markets.\n       Members of the NAIC are also concerned about enforcement. \n     As you know as a former state regulator, if there is no \n     enforcement then there is no protection. States have \n     developed the infrastructure necessary to receive and process \n     consumer complaints in a timely fashion and ensure that \n     insurers comply with the laws. The federal government does \n     not have this capability, and the proposals do not provide \n     any resources to federal agencies to develop such capability. \n     It has taken the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) \n     years to develop the infrastructure required to enforce the \n     Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) \n     which included only six basic provisions that most states had \n     already enacted. The proposed patient protection bills are \n     far more complicated than HIPAA and will require considerable \n     oversight.\n       To resolve these issues, the NAIC urges Congress to include \n     in any patient protection legislation provisions that would \n     preserve state laws and enforcement procedures, such as \n     internal and external review processes. Failure to maintain \n     state authority in this area could lead to the implementation \n     of regulations that are inconsistent with the needs of \n     consumers in a state and that are not enforced effectively.\n       Protecting patient rights is clearly a goal of both the \n     states and the federal government. Attaining this goal will \n     require cooperation and we look forward to working in \n     partnership with the federal government to implement \n     protections that are in the best interest of consumers in \n     each state.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Kathleen Sebelius,\n\n                                                  President, NAIC,\n                          Insurance Commissioner, State of Kansas.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will inquire of the Senator. If I may \nhave the Senator's attention, is the Senator supporting the Breaux-\nFrist bill at this time? Is the Senator going to work with Senator \nMcCain, a cosponsor with Senator Edwards, to try to see if we can find \ncommon ground within the next week?\n  Ms. COLLINS. My friend from Massachusetts may not have heard me when \nI said earlier--and I don't expect him to be on the edge of his chair \nthrough every moment, but I made very clear that my hope is that we can \ncome together on this important issue. It is important, and I think it \nis unfortunate that we didn't get through a conference on the Patients' \nBill of Rights last year. Then we would have had these protections \nalready in place.\n  It is a shame that last year when we had agreement on 90 percent of \nthe bill, we didn't enact it. Senator Breaux of Louisiana and I \nsuggested just that approach. So I look forward to continuing to work \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Just at noontime today, \nI had a discussion with Senator McCain and he indicated an openness to \nsolving some of the problems I have outlined in my statement. The \nSenator from Massachusetts knows I always enjoy working very closely \nwith him.\n  So I look forward to that because my goal is that we can pass a bill \nthat does the job on which we all agree, and yet that would not preempt \nStates' laws when States are doing a good job, and that would not cause \nhealth insurance costs to rise to the point where we jeopardize \ncoverage altogether.\n  I know those are goals we share, and I hope we can indeed work \nclosely together.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally--and I see the Senator from Connecticut here--\nthe point I would like to clarify is that the Edwards bill isn't \npreempting the States. They have identical provisions. The States' \nprovisions and protections, if substantial, will stand. They don't have \nto be identical. I just wanted to clarify that particular issue as we \ngo through the course of debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Very briefly, before the Senator from Connecticut \nspeaks, there were some points made by the Senator from Maine.\n  First, we very much appreciate her open attitude to work with us to \ntry to find a solution to a problem about which we all care a great \ndeal. We appreciate that. She was arguing, I believe, that because of \nincreased costs associated with a Patient Protection Act, people would \ngo from being insured to uninsured, and that is something about which \nthe American people should be concerned.\n  First of all, I point out that there are two competing bills, one of \nwhich will pass the Senate. The difference between those bills is \nminimal in cost. Second, in the three States that in fact\n\n[[Page S6494]]\n\nhave enacted patient protection--California, Texas, and Georgia--not \nonly has the number of uninsured not gone up but exactly the opposite \nhas occurred. During the time that patient protection has been in place \nin California, in Texas, and in Georgia, the number of insured has gone \nup. In California, for example, in 1998 and 1999, the number of insured \nwent up 2.3 percent. In Texas, it went up .9 percent--just under 1 \npercent. In Georgia, about which Senator Miller spoke so eloquently, it \nwent up .8 percent.\n  So the evidence from the three other States that have enacted laws \nsimilar to the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill is that because people have \na better product, better health care, better rights, not only does the \nnumber of uninsured not go up but it goes down. So these rhetorical \ncries of all of us needing to be greatly concerned about that issue--of \ncourse we are, but the actual evidence that exists from the three \nStates that have laws similar to the laws we are here talking about \nsuggests over a relatively short period of time, in fairness, that just \nthe opposite is true--that in fact, because of the quality of the \nproduct, the number of people insured can go up as opposed to going \ndown.\n  With that, I will yield the floor to my friend from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by, first of all, commending my \ngood friends and colleagues from Massachusetts, North Carolina, and \nArizona, Senators Kennedy, Edwards, and McCain, for their leadership on \nthis issue--bringing a series of reforms that seek to guarantee quality \nhealth care for more than 190 million of our fellow citizens.\n  This is extremely important. We know there are 43 million Americans \nwho have no health insurance at all. We hope at some point we can \ndevelop legislation to protect those 43 million fellow citizens who \nhave to go through the anxieties on a daily basis of hoping their \nchildren, their families will not suffer from some catastrophic illness \nwhich could wipe out whatever meager holdings they have. That debate \nwill have to be reserved for another day.\n  But there are 190 million Americans who obtain health care coverage \nthrough private insurance. So we begin the debate by trying to make \nsure that those 190 million people who are covered by private health \ncare coverage will be able to have the kind of rights we think they \nought to have as citizens of this country.\n  Mr. President, I also should begin with sort of a disclaimer to you. \nMy colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, and I represent what \nis oftentimes referred to as the insurance capital of the world. My \ngood friend, the Presiding Officer, is the Senator from, I suppose, the \nState of gaming and of family recreation. My State is well known for a \nvariety of insurance companies that have made significant and positive \ncontributions to the well-being of people not only here in the United \nStates, but around the globe. We are very proud of the fact that we \nrepresent insurance companies that have provided great security for \nmillions of people in so many different sets of circumstances.\n  But it is important to note that, as a Senator from that State, one \nof the things we are talking about here is the obligations of my \nconstituents, those insurance companies that are involved in providing \nprivate health care coverage. So today I suppose I engage in discussion \nthat you may not expect to hear from someone who comes from a State \nwhere I represent these interests.\n  I do so with a degree of sorrow because, unfortunately, in too many \ncases the industry does not understand the needs of millions of \nAmericans. This is not true of the entire insurance industry in my \nState. There are many who have reached out and are trying to make a \ndifference, to see to it that people do have access to specialists, \nemergency rooms, and clinical trials, and that they have an appeals \nprocess to turn to when they feel that they have been unfairly denied \ncare.\n  We have been at this debate now for 5 years. I recall a couple of \nyears ago being a member of a conference committee after this body had \ndealt with a Patients' Bill of Rights--partisan politics took over. We \nsat in the committee rooms for days on end and nothing happened. For \neach day we wait, each week that goes by, every month that passes, \nthese 190 million people in our country run a greater and greater risk \nthat their rights are being denied, that basic health care coverage is \nnot forthcoming.\n  I hope my colleagues who are engaged, as we have been over the last \nfew days, in delay tactics that won't allow for an amendment process to \ngo forward will cease and desist.\n  It is not what the American public wants. They may not agree with \nevery dotted ``i'' and crossed ``t'' in John McCain's and John Edwards' \nand Ted Kennedy's bill. I respect that. I understand their differences, \nbut not to have any amendments offered, not to be debating this, not to \nbe discussing it beyond the rhetorical comments is not going unnoticed \nby the American public.\n  As these days go by, I hope nothing happens to people, which could \nhave been prevented by the passage of this legislation or some \ncompromise version of it.\n  Let us begin the process of discussion. Let us begin the process of \nvoting. I am disappointed and saddened that we have not.\n  I mentioned my State and the fact that I represent some of the \nlargest, most successful insurance companies in the world. As many \nother States, my State has also taken action on this issue of a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. It has passed its own managed care \nprotections. The reforms included in the Connecticut law take an \nimportant step toward protecting patients and doctors, but today 41 \npercent of Connecticut employees are denied these very protections \nbecause of Federal law preemptions. Almost half of my constituents are \nnot protected by their State law.\n  Unless we adopt a Federal law, they will go unprotected, and that is \ntrue in State after State because of the adoption of ERISA, legislation \ngoing back years under the leadership of the former Senator from New \nYork, Jacob Javits, of blessed memory.\n  Under his leadership, ERISA was passed, but as a result of that fine \nlegislation and with the adoption of State laws providing protections \nfor people's health care rights, a lot of our fellow citizens are \npreempted by that Federal law.\n  That is the rationale for us engaging in this debate on a Patients' \nBill of Rights. There must be Federal law. If not, we are excluding \nmillions of Americans from the protections their fellow citizens living \nnext door to them, living down the street, working next to them at \ntheir businesses are provided under their State protections.\n  This debate is important, and we ought to be voting on amendments. \nEvery hour that goes by, every day that goes by that we do not do our \nbusiness raises even further risk that additional people will be \nharmed.\n  The increased role of managed care in our health system has brought \nsome very important improvements--better coordinated care, greater \nefficiency at lower costs, and an enhanced focus on preventive care.\n  The health maintenance organizations deserve credit for making these \npositive steps. The benefits, however, have been accompanied by some \nconcerns about the impact on the quality and delivery of care, and that \nis what the Kennedy-McCain-Edwards bill attempts to address.\n  Far too often the decision about whether you or your family can get \nthe health care you need is dictated by an insurance policy rather than \nyour doctors. That is why it pains me as a Senator from Connecticut to \nhave to talk about an industry of which I am so proud.\n  While we all agree on the goal of increasing efficiency and managing \ncosts in our health care system, we cannot do so at the expense of \ndenying needed care. We have to strike that balance, and today that \nbalance does not exist.\n  I want to take a minute to talk about a single case in my State. I \nrealize we are talking about 190 million people in the country who have \nprivate insurance insurance but do not have protections that a \nPatients' Bill of Rights would provide. I know there are 43 million \npeople who have no health care coverage at all. Sometimes we get to \ntalking about millions of people, millions of dollars, and billions of \ndollars and get lost in the morass of the\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\nFederal bureaucracy of how a Patients' Bill of Rights would work. We \nforget we are talking about individual people, families.\n\n  I want to take a minute, if I may, and share with my colleagues the \nstory of one family in my State and what happened to them as a result \nof our failure to have a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I just spoke with this family a few minutes before coming to this \nChamber. I did not want to talk about this family without their \npermission. I called the Moscovitch family in Connecticut and asked \nthem if I could talk about their 15-year-old son, Nitai. Let me tell my \ncolleagues what happened.\n  This family lives in Brookfield, CT, a small town in my State. They \nare a hard-working family. In fact, the father was not yet home from \nwork. He was on his way home from his job. Their son, Nitai Moscovitch, \nsuffered from very severe emotional problems. The family was wise and \nsmart enough to recognize their 15-year-old son, Nitai, needed help. He \nneeded medical help immediately.\n  This family sought that help, particularly after this young boy \nattempted suicide. He was admitted to the Danbury Hospital in the \nwestern part of my State. Despite the fact that the young boy had a \nhistory of trying to harm himself, the insurance company that provided \ncoverage for this family would only agree to cover his treatment for \nseveral days at the hospital, as if he had been in an automobile \naccident, or if he had stumbled and broken his leg or been in an \nathletic injury.\n  The idea that this was a child suffering from severe emotional \nillness was not under consideration: We will put on the Band-Aids, \nprovide the stitches, but beyond that, we are not going to provide that \ncoverage.\n  Even though Nitai threatened to commit suicide if he were removed \nfrom the hospital, they saw this as the rantings of a teenage boy, not \nto be taken too seriously.\n  Four hours after he was released, Nitai locked himself in a room, \nundid his belt on his trousers, and committed suicide.\n  If that is an isolated case I conjured up, then I ought to be ashamed \nof myself. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case. This goes on \nevery day, not necessarily with the tragic ending as in this case, but \ncoverage was denied not because someone looked at Nitai and said: We \ndon't think your emotional problems are severe enough to warrant \nhospitalization. Someone sitting behind a desk, I suppose at some \ncomputer terminal, was making the determination that the policy was not \ngoing to cover him. That was the medical analysis given to this young \nman and this family.\n  That has to stop. I am not suggesting that every medical examination \nor analysis is going to be right or there are not going to be tragedies \ninvolved, but we have to get away from the situation where the \ndecisions about what kind of care a patient needs, what kind of doctor \na patient ought to see is being determined by someone who has no \nmedical training, no medical background at all, and then to further say \nbasically they are not responsible.\n  Let me complete the story. On behalf of his son, Nitai's father, \nStewart Moscovitch, wanted to sue his health maintenance organization \nfor playing the role of doctor and refusing to cover extended treatment \nat the hospital. But the health plan argued that existing Federal law, \nthe very reason we are engaged in this debate, existing Federal law \nprevented the family from holding them liable.\n  After a 3-year battle, this family secured a ruling that the Federal \nlaw did not apply in his case. However, today there is still no \nguarantee that the Moscovitch family or any family would have the right \nto hold their plan accountable for making treatment decisions.\n  The bill we are debating will change that. I am not going to suggest \nthat somehow we could have entirely prevented this tragedy from \nhappening. As I said, it is conceivable that a doctor might have \narrived at the same decision. Do not assume for a second I was assuming \nthat Nitai's life definitely would have been saved but at least they \nmight have had more choices. At least the choice should have been left \nto the doctor looking at this young man and not a decision made by an \ninsurance company or an insurance employee who, with all due respect, \nhas no business making the decision of whether or not extended hospital \ncare for this child ought to be covered.\n  I thank the Moscovitch family for allowing me to talk about their \nson. I called them to seek their permission to talk about their son. I \nwas told by Nitai's brother that, in fact, the family had discussed it \nand hoped I would because it might, just might, make a difference. It \nmay convince some who are wavering about whether or not this bill is \nwarranted, whether or not this effort is worthwhile. It may be the case \nthat one family, one individual will have a more profound effect than \nall of the numbers and millions of people and billions of dollars we \ntalk about. It is family by family, patient by patient that the effects \nof not passing this legislation are most felt.\n  Putting patients first means guaranteeing access to emergency room \ncoverage when a rational person would say emergency care was needed. It \nmeans ensuring access to doctors qualified to treat a condition, and \nthat it is those doctors who will decide the best course of treatment. \nPutting patients first means making sure that patients with illnesses \nthat have not been cured by conventional treatment are not denied the \nchance to participate in potentially life-saving clinical trials. It \nmeans making sure that a patient and his family can have the \nprescription drugs doctors say they need, not just the drugs the \ninsurance company says are cheaper.\n  Other managed care bills have been introduced in this Congress that \nare watered-down versions. They are weaker versions. They are not truly \na Patients' Bill of Rights. The Bipartisan Patient Protection Act is \nthe only bipartisan legislation that will offer managed care patients \nand providers that serve them reasonable protections. The bill allows \npatients and doctors to determine the best course of care, establishes \nan independent appeals process for patients who believe they were \nunfairly denied care, and allows patients to hold health care plans \naccountable when they make those decisions.\n  I hope our colleagues allow this debate to go forward. Let not \nanother day pass in delaying a debate on amendments on this bill. It is \nblatantly unfair. Forget Democrats and Republicans. What you do to my \nparty, sitting on this side of the aisle, is not terribly relevant; put \nthat aside. If you will, think of the people you represent in your \nStates. Even if you don't like this bill, offer your ideas on your \napproach to this. But allow an amendment process to go forward.\n  It is unfair to these people, after 5 years, to not allow a full \ndebate on amendments on this bill. That is what this institution was \ncreated for. It is what we ought to be engaged in. Now after the second \nday of listening to statements about this bill, it is time we started \ndebating amendments. My hope is that will be the case.\n  I understand the commitment of our distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Daschle, when he says we will stay here, we will stay here \nuntil this bill is properly and fully considered. It may be defeated. \nAt the end of the day, 51 Members may decide to defeat this bill. I \nwould be terribly unhappy if that were the case, but at least we would \nhave had a chance to debate and consider amendments. Sitting here day \nafter day, hour after hour, without the chance to consider amendments \nand vote on an important subject such as this is dreadful. My hope is \nmy colleagues who are engaged in this delaying practice will cease and \ndesist.\n  I commend the authors of this bill and look forward to supporting \nthem in the amendment process. My sincere hope is at the end of this \ndiscussion we will have amended the law and that the millions of \nAmericans who are insured and preempted by Federal law as well as all \nthe others with private insurance, will get the protections they \ndeserve.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains in this block?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes remain.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Connecticut has covered\n\n[[Page S6496]]\n\nthe subject of needed patient protections well. Let me, in the few \nshort remaining minutes, make a couple of comments--some I have made \nbefore.\n  Let me narrow the issue down. It is about the right of patients to \nget the health care they deserve and that they think they have under \ntheir managed care plans. Often however, that care is actually denied \nthem.\n  Patients ought to have a right to understand all of their medical \noptions for treatment, not just the cheapest. They ought to have a \nright to medically necessary care without arbitrary HMO interference. \nThey ought to have a right to go to an emergency room when they have an \nemergency. They ought to have a right to see a specialist when they \nhave a need to consult a specialist. They ought to have the right to a \nfair and speedy process for resolving disputes.\n  Let me see if I can use a couple of pictures to describe what these \nrights mean. This young child was born with a horrible facial defect. A \ncleft palate which is a horrible defect of the top lip. Plastic \nsurgeons say in about 50 percent of the cases, a managed care \norganization says this is something that is not medically necessary to \ncorrect. It's correction is not medically necessary? Imagine having \nthis child and being told by a managed care organization that it is not \nmedically necessary to correct this defect!\n  I spoke yesterday about a young woman named Donna Marie McIlwaine. \nDonna is from New York. Her mother, Mary Lewandowski, testified before \na hearing I held on managed care. This beautiful young lady is not with \nus any longer. Donna died. Her mother described the circumstances of \nher death. For want of a $750 lung scan, this young girl died as a \nresult of a blood clot in her lung the size of a football. Donna's \nmother called the doctor and she called the hospital, but to no avail. \nThis young woman died because she didn't get a $750 lung scan that \nwould have shown a blood clot the size of a football in her lung. And \nshe died. She died on the evening of February 8, 1997. Her mother, God \nbless her, Mary Lewandowski, has been to Washington at her own expense, \nas a missionary to say ``pass this legislation and don't let this \nhappen to another child!''\n  I have described before, this young man, Christopher Roe, whom I \nlearned about at a hearing I held in November--and if you are tired of \nhearing about him--I have talked about Christopher several times--if \nyou are tired of hearing about him, tough luck because I will keep \ntalking of his tragic circumstance. His mother held this picture high \nas she began to sob when she testified about this 16-year-old boy who \ndied on his birthday. Christopher was fighting cancer, and fighting the \nmanaged care organization at the same time for the care he needed and \ndidn't get. This young boy had cancer. He needed some treatment. He \nneeded a chance. He needed some experimental treatment, a chance to get \nthrough this and successfully wage war against this dreaded disease.\n  But time ticked away and the managed care organization said, no, no, \nno. And finally this young boy, flat on his back in bed, died on his \n16th birthday. Before he died, his mother told us, crying: \n``Christopher looked up at me and said, Mom, how can they do this to a \nkid?''\n  This is not some ethereal debate about what you think or what I \nthink. This is about whether patients have the protections they believe \nexist in their managed care policies.\n\n  Are we going to say that we stand on the side of patients? Are we \ngoing to stand on the side of doctors? Are we going to stand on the \nside of nurses who know that the only real good health care that is \ndelivered is delivered by health care professionals in a clinic or in a \nhospital room? It is not health care delivered or decisions made in an \ninsurance company or managed care office by some junior accountant \n1,000 miles away. Yet all too often that is what is happening. It is \nwhy Christopher Roe is no longer with us. This young boy lost his \nbattle fighting cancer and he lost his battle fighting a managed care \norganization.\n  That, my friends, is not a fair fight. We know that. That is why we \npropose passing a piece of legislation called the Patient Protection \nAct or the Patient's Bill of Rights. There will be a lot of discussion \nand debate about this for a long period. At the end of the day, the \nonly question is, Whose corner are you in? With whom do you stand? Are \nyou with the patients, doctors, and the nurses? Or are you with the \nmanaged care organization and the insurance industry who say they don't \nwant this?\n  In the names of Christopher Roe and Donna, and so many others that I \nhave discussed previously on the floor of the Senate, we ought to do \nwhat is right. We ought to do the right thing. This legislation has \nbeen four years in the making. This is a long gestation period. We have \ndebated, debated, and debated again. We have compromised, compromised, \nand compromised on this legislation. It is now time for us to own up to \nthis responsibility. Let's pass this bill. Let's do it now and do it \nright.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are now debating the crucial issue of \npatients' rights. For better or worse, we have a health care system \nthat increasingly uses managed care to organize and deliver services. \nOver the next week or two or more, we are here to debate what we need \nto do to protect patients and to restore balance to our new system \ndominated by managed care companies, whether insurance companies or \nHMOs.\n  Let's be clear; patients need protections. For a variety of reasons--\nbad customer service, bad incentives that lead to a conflict between \ncare and the bottom line, and simple carelessness and neglect--too many \npatients have been mistreated by their health care insurance companies. \nThat is why every State in the Nation has acted on this measure to \nprovide protections because we have seen this mistreatment range from \nthe heartbreaking to the mundane.\n  We have all heard the rare but tragic horror stories in which a \nmanaged care company denies desperately needed care, sometimes with \ncatastrophic results for the patient. Many of us have actually \nexperienced the all too common phenomenon, nuisances of being forced to \nmake phone call after phone call to get routine care authorized or \nhaving to wait longer than should be necessary to get an appointment \nwith a doctor in a limited network of managed care providers.\n  That is why I voted in the past for comprehensive managed care reform \nbills that will deal with the federally regulated plans. This is why I \nhave confidence that I will again vote for a good patient protection \nbill at the end of this debate.\n  We have heard some statements on the floor--I think maybe we ought to \nbring a little reality to it--saying we have to pass this bill right \naway. This bill is a moving target; it is a shell game, trying to \nfigure out which version is the latest version, what version is the \noperative version. It did not go through the committee.\n  People talked about maybe we want to compromise some of it. Normally \nthe compromise, working out of these details, happens in committee. \nThat is why we send a committee markup to the floor. We did not do it \nthis time. So we are going to have to do the committee's work in this \nChamber.\n  But when I hear people talk about how there are 50,000 people being \ndenied insurance, we hear about tragedies that happen every day, some \nsay if we wait a day longer or a week longer, more patients are going \nto get denied care--just a little bit of reality. The effective date of \nthe McCain-Kennedy bill is October of 2002. That is October of 2002, a \nyear and a quarter from now. So while it is important that we deal with \nthis bill, it is important that we not pass a bad bill. We have the \ntime, and we must take the time, to make sure what we do is a good \nproduct.\n  Legislating is a difficult job. It inevitably involves striking a \nbalance between competing goals. In this debate, that tradeoff is \nbetween specific patient protections and the costs those protections \nwill impose on an already strained health care system.\n  Mr. President, 43 million Americans lack health insurance coverage. \nThat is an important fact to remember and one we have to keep in mind \nas we deal with assuring that patients are protected. Even if Congress \ndoes nothing here, that number is almost certain to go up, perhaps \ndramatically, in the\n\n[[Page S6497]]\n\nwake of health care costs that are shooting up 13 percent this year, \nfollowing a year in which they rose by 12 percent. That is more than a \n26-percent increase in just 2 years, a rate that is not sustainable. I \nmight add, in the next year or two cost increases are expected to rise \nby about the same amount.\n\n  The goal of managed care, of HMOs and others, is to assure health \ncare but to maintain some limit on the cost because anybody who has \nstudied economics 101 knows if costs are totally unreasonable, you are \nnot going to get the service. That service in this case is the vitally \nimportant service of health care coverage.\n  Employers, particularly small businesses, make a valiant effort to \nstruggle through and provide health care insurance to their employees. \nI have talked to and listened to an awful lot of small businesspeople \nand their employees who are concerned about this particular bill as \nwell as health care costs in general. As costs go up, fewer and fewer \nsmall businesses will provide care.\n  In our employer-based health care system, 75 percent of Americans \nwith insurance get all or some of that coverage through an employer. We \nhave to be careful. We have to be careful to ensure that we do not \ndrive, particularly small businesses, out of the business of providing \ngood health care coverage for their employees.\n  This is the dilemma. It is really the crux of what we will be talking \nabout over the next several weeks: Which patient protections are \nworthwhile and when is the price of lost coverage too high?\n  Let me emphasize that. What is the cost in terms of health care \ncoverage to increasing the cost of health care protection? After all, a \npro-patient protection bill that takes away a family's health insurance \ndoes not provide any protection at all. If they lose their coverage, we \nhave done exactly what we should not have done, and that is to deny \nthem any coverage.\n  With all this in mind--the importance of patient protections, the \ndanger of rising costs--what should we support? In the past I voted \nfor, and I will vote for again, a strong Patients' Bill of Rights that \ncontains basic, reasonable, commonsense patient protection.\n  This includes guaranteed access to emergency room care. Americans \nshould not have to worry their insurance company will not pay for \nnecessary emergency care or even for care that reasonably seems to be \nan emergency. I have gone to the emergency room with problems that \nlooked very serious and after treatment found out, although they were a \nproblem, they needed care but they were not a critical emergency. But \nthose should be covered.\n  Second, a guarantee that patients get all information on treatment \noptions. Doctors and patients need to be able to discuss openly all \npossible treatment options without gag rules.\n  Third, a right to a quick, independent, and expert appeal process. \nThere must be an appeal to a medical expert outside of the HMO to \nguarantee the HMO is not focusing too much on its bottom line and not \nenough on the patient's bottom.\n  The appeal must be quick so patients get care when they need it, \nstrong managed protections for our children, such as the ones I \nincluded in Healthy Kids 2000 legislation 2 years ago. These include \nthe right for a child to go see a pediatrician without being forced to \nsee a nonpediatrician gatekeeper. Pediatricians are not specialists to \nwhom children need to be referred. They should be a child's first line \nof care.\n  Next, the right for a child to see a specialist with pediatric \nexpertise, including going to children's hospitals when necessary. \nChildren are different from adults. Their care is different. Doctors \nwho primarily treat adults are not always prepared to interpret and \nattend the unique needs of children. A sick child needs to go to \nsomebody who specializes in taking care of sick children.\n  The right to have a pediatric expert review a child's case when \nappealing an HMO decision. Again, even an experienced medical \npractitioner who deals only with adults may not have the ability, the \nexpertise, and the training to make a decision about what kind of care \na child needs.\n  Let me tell you a few things about what I do not support in the \npatient protection debate. Unfortunately, I must put at the top of the \nlist of what I cannot support the McCain-Kennedy bill. The McCain-\nKennedy bill contains some good provisions--all of them do. There are \ngood provisions in all of these bills. But the McCain-Kennedy bill is \noverzealous; it goes much too far towards creating a litigation-heavy, \ncostly new world of health care.\n  I will take the opportunity in the following days and weeks to go \ninto detail on some of the glaring problems presented by the McCain-\nKennedy bill and the profound threat this legislation poses to \ncontinued health care coverage for millions of Americans. For now, let \nme begin by highlighting the major flaws in this significantly flawed \nbill.\n  Problem No. 1, the McCain bill will dramatically increase health care \ncosts and will take away the health insurance of more than a million \nAmericans. The new costs this bill imposes will be paid by everybody \nwho has health insurance. The lucky ones will just pay more. The \nunlucky ones will lose their coverage. That price is simply too high.\n  Next, the cost of this bill will hit small businesses and small \nbusiness employees particularly hard. Without the clout of larger \ncompanies, small businesses right now face higher prices and have more \ndifficult administrative hurdles when they try to buy health care. \nWhile this makes it far more difficult for small businesses to provide \nhealth care, millions of small companies try to find a way and do it \nanyway. I fear that will dramatically change if the McCain-Kennedy bill \npasses.\n  Since late last week when it was announced that we would be debating \nthe McCain-Kennedy bill, my office has been inundated with letters, \ncalls, and faxes from small businesses in Missouri. The message has \nbeen unanimous. Missouri's small businesses are struggling to provide \nhealth care despite high costs. They fear what the Kennedy-McCain bill \nwill do to their ability to pay for health care. Many say they will \ndrop their coverage if McCain-Kennedy passes.\n  This is not just a phenomenon related to my State. This is what we in \nthe Committee on Small Business are hearing from across the country.\n  Let me read excerpts from one of the many letters I have received. I \nwill not use his name, but I want to give you a flavor by telling about \nthe important parts of the letter.\n  He says:\n\n       I am writing this letter in regard to Senator Kennedy's \n     Patients' Bill of Rights, S. 283. My family owns a small \n     agriculture business selling certain kinds of farm equipment \n     and lawn equipment with a fully staffed sales, parts, and \n     service department. I offer health care coverage to my \n     employees and paid 100 percent on the premiums until about 5 \n     years ago when our health care costs got too high to \n     continue. So I went to 50 percent on both the employees and \n     their dependents, thus helping our business but strapping my \n     employees with added costs to raise their families.\n       This year our health insurance went up 34 percent. Last \n     year, it was only 24 percent. But where is this going to \n     stop? How am I, as a business owner who has 23 families \n     depending on me for their livelihood, supposed to make a \n     profit in order to pay them a livable wage and benefit \n     package in a severely depressed agriculture economy while our \n     liberal Government leaders are trying to further increase my \n     expenses? If these costs escalate much further, I anticipate \n     that I will have to drop my health plan altogether, \n     especially if I am to be held responsible for medical court \n     cases. I will, at a minimum, drop my group health coverage \n     and think very long and hard about closing down and counting \n     my interest and rent checks instead of continuing to run this \n     business.\n\n  We need relief from Government regulations that are sucking all the \nprofits out of our organizations causing us to employ one person to do \nnothing but Government paperwork. We need to eliminate the death tax or \ninheritance tax. Please just say no to Kennedy care disasters.\n  From time to time during the debate on this bill I will read from \nother letters from Missouri businesses to remind us of the real-world \nimpact of this legislation.\n  On this chart, I have an up to the minute count of the employees of \nMissouri's small businesses that would, as I understand, lose their \nhealth care coverage if McCain-Kennedy passes. These are letters from \nsmall businesses\n\n[[Page S6498]]\n\nin Missouri that say that, as of this date, if Kennedy-McCain passes, \nthey will drop their health care plan. Our running total on the number \nof employees who will lose health care if this bill is signed into law \nright now is 1,042.\n  That may not seem to be a lot, but that is a tremendous burden on \nthose employees and their families. These are real people. These are \nthe ones who will be totally unprotected if we pass the McCain-Kennedy \nlegislation.\n  Rest assured that I will seek opportunities during this debate to \nfind ways to shield small businesses and employees from the most \noutrageous aspects of this legislation.\n  I don't think anybody intended to cause health care coverage to be \ndropped. That was certainly not my understanding of the objective of \nthis bill, but sometimes what we do here in Washington has unintended \nconsequences. Very often the unintended consequences are far greater \nthan the beneficial consequences.\n  Cost-benefit is something we neglect too often. I intend to make sure \nmy colleagues focus on the costs as well as the benefits.\n  A second problem of the McCain-Kennedy bill is that it focuses too \nmuch on lawsuits and trial attorneys by encouraging endless litigation. \nLawsuits are an avenue for retrospective blame and incrimination after \nsomeone claims they are harmed. Lawsuits in no way contribute to high-\nquality care. Instead of turning health care over to lawyers, the focus \nshould be on making sure patients get the care when they need it before \nany harm occurs.\n  When you are sick, you want to see a doctor--not a lawyer. When I \nhear about all of these protections from subsequent lawsuits, I am not \nvery interested in leaving my heirs with a bunch of lawsuit claims \nagainst a bunch of defendants if I am gone. I want to have a bill that \nmakes sure that I can get the kind of care I need when I am really \nsick. That is what I think the American people have a right to ask.\n  A third problem of this bill is that it nationalizes the regulation \nof health care. State governments have traditionally overseen health \ncare and health insurance, and, as I mentioned, every State in the \nNation has done something in this area. They have tried different ways. \nMany of them have done good jobs.\n  I believe it was Justice Douglas who said ours is a laboratory where \nStates perform experiments to see which legislation works best. The \nStates have been out there doing it. In fact, as I said, every State \nhas passed some type of State level patient protection act. Now the \nMcCain-Kennedy bill comes along and threatens to impose a one-size-\nfits-all scheme that will do away with most or all of the tried and \ntested State law reforms. Some of them may be better than others. We \nwill not know if we pass the McCain-Kennedy bill that eliminates all \nthe State options.\n  Even worse, it will turn over much of the new Federal regulation of \ninsurance to the Health Care Financing Administration, one of the most \nheavyhanded, unresponsive, arrogant bureaucracies in all of Washington.\n  I have spoken in this Chamber before about the Health Care Financing \nAdministration. A couple of years ago, the Health Care Financing \nAdministration was overzealous in its effort to cut the cost of home \nhealth care. Instead of saving the $16 billion that Congress asked it \nto save, it is on the path to saving $60 billion by shutting down \nhealth care provided in homes.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I was contacted by \nmany small entities providing home health care services. I set up the \nhearing. I invited the representatives of these home health care \nagencies who believed they were being unfairly treated by HCFA to come \nto Washington. A number of my colleagues wanted to testify. I invited \nHCFA to come and listen to their comments and provide their response. \nIt seems reasonable, doesn't it? You have a Government bureaucracy that \nis the subject of all kinds of outrage. You let the people come in and \ntell what they see as the problem. Then you give the bureaucracy an \nopportunity to respond, to tell their side of the story.\n  Do you know what HCFA said? They didn't want to sit around and listen \nto the complaints of those they regulate. They would be happy to \ntestify if they could testify along with other Senators. I forgot to \ncheck to see how many States elected the officials of HCFA to serve in \nthe Senate. The best I can tell, none.\n  This is the agency that would tell State governments what kinds of \nhealth care provisions they could have. I don't think so. That is not \nthe way we need to go.\n  Finally, in what I think is a major oversight in the Kennedy-McCain \nbill, it doesn't do a single thing to help Americans get access to \nhealth coverage. At the same time, it is threatening coverage from \nmillions of Americans. If we are going to do harm, we ought to be \nprepared to help. That is why I intend to continue with my effort of \nintroducing an amendment that will immediately allow self-employed \nAmericans, including the 34.8 million uninsured Americans in families \nheaded by a self-employed individual, to fully deduct their health \ninsurance expenses.\n  Patients need protection through a Patients' Bill of Rights. But \nthere is a right way and a wrong way to do it. The right way limits \nitself to commonsense reforms that help patients get care when they \nneed it. The wrong way--the McCain-Kennedy way--encourages endless \nlitigation, nationalizes health care oversight, and takes away \ninsurance coverage from more than 1 million Americans.\n  There are some people who say this bill is a lawyers' bill of rights, \nnot a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  What is wrong with the right to sue?\n  The McCain-Kennedy bill is a trial lawyer's dream that will raise \nhealth care costs, subject our health care system to frivolous \nlawsuits, and will make trial attorneys rich. Despite Democratic \ninsistence, this will put employers at risk of being sued. The so-\ncalled cap on damages in the McCain-Kennedy bill is practically \nworthless because it applies only in one area and leaves a variety of \nother types of damages uncapped. There are no caps on attorneys' fees \nand the outrageous contingency fees many trial lawyers force on their \nclients.\n  What types of lawsuits should we allow?\n  Because of the destructive capacity of plaintiffs' attorneys, we must \nbe extremely cautious with any new lawsuits. I realize there are some \nsituations where we need to expand the right to sue, but first \neverything must flow through an appeals process through which a patient \ncan go outside the HMO to get an expert's second opinion.\n  Before we resort to lawsuits--which can't provide care--we must ask \npatients to complete this appeals process because it can result in a \npatient getting care. And that is what we should be talking about. But \nif a health insurer doesn't comply with a independent expert decision \nthat a patient should get care, on it acts in bad faith or extreme \nnegligence by denying care that the independent expert says is needed, \nthe patient should be allowed to sue for damages.\n  The McCain-Kennedy bill limits punitive damages--although they call \nit a ``civil assessment'' to $5 million in the new Federal lawsuits \ntheir bill will allow. But economic and noneconomic damages in Federal \nlawsuits are still uncapped. It won't be hard for trial lawyers to find \nways to milk these alternative types of uncapped damages for all they \nare worth.\n  At the State level, the McCain-Kennedy bill does nothing to impose \ncaps on damages, even for punitive damages. While some States have \ntheir own damage caps for malpractice lawsuits, in many States these \ncaps won't apply to the new lawsuits and the new Federalization of \nState health insurance regulation permitted under the McCain-Kennedy \nbill.\n  Bottom line--the caps in the McCain-Kennedy bill barely provide even \na fig leaf of protection for those who will be sued.\n  The State-level health care liability system that exists for doctors \nhas failed. It dramatically increases costs through defensive medicine. \nIt encourages doctors to quit the profession. And not only does it not \nencourage quality care, it hinders quality care by creating a code of \nsilence that prevents health professionals from talking about how to \nsystematically avoid medical mistakes.\n  Studies show that most people who get negligently harmed in health \ncare\n\n[[Page S6499]]\n\ndo not get compensated, and those that are compensated are often not \nharmed. Again, studies show that whether or not a patient was \nnegligently harmed has almost no connection to whether they get \ncompensated.\n  The American tort system is like a lottery in which most patients \nlose, a handful of patients win big on a random basis, and trial \nlawyers strike it rich by raking off the top of each lawsuit.\n  This is a huge flaw in the system to which the Kennedy-McCain bill \nwill subject us even more.\n  Some supporters of the McCain-Kennedy bill claim their bill exempts \nemployers from the new lawsuits permitted by the bill. That is a great \nline. My colleagues pointed out, on page 144 it says: This ``does not \nauthorize a cause of action against an employer or other plan sponsor \nmaintaining the plan . . .'' That is the good news. The bad news comes \nin the next paragraph. It says:\n\n       (B) Certain Causes of Action Permitted. Notwithstanding \n     subparagraph (A), a cause of action may arise against an \n     employer or other plan sponsor . . .'' And then it lists the \n     exceptions. It goes down this page, goes down this page, goes \n     down this page, goes down this page, and comes over to this \n     page. Those are the exceptions. That is what happens to you \n     if you are an employer.\n\n  That is why, with four pages of exceptions, a lot of employers of \nsmall businesses in my State and around the country are simply going to \nhave to get out of the business of providing health care. It scares the \nheck out of them, and it should.\n  As we heard from small businesses, this is their concern. They want \ngood health care for their employees, but they cannot afford to stay in \nbusiness and expose themselves to the lottery of a tort system out of \ncontrol.\n  If employers are so well protected, why are they scared? Well, \nsimply, they are not exempt. If the right to sue is so great, why not \nprovide all employees the right to sue--Federal Government workers, \nseniors in Medicare, all of the other causes? We look at it, and it is \nprobably too expensive for the Federal Government. Think of what it is \nfor the patients who are employees of small businesses. If they lose \ntheir health care coverage, it does little good for them to know that \nmaybe--just maybe--they would have had the right to sue.\n  We are having the right debate, but the McCain-Kennedy bill is the \nwrong solution. I urge my colleagues to take a look at this seriously \nflawed legislation and to help us improve it. If we succeed in making \nsubstantial changes, I hope we will pass a dramatically different bill \nthat represents a more reasonable and affordable approach.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, how much time is left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Three minutes. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I will be very brief. I commend the Senator from Missouri for \noutlining what are really the fundamental problems in this legislation. \nIt boils down to the fact that essentially, with the same patient \nprotections that are in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, they offer it \nat a price which drives hundreds of thousands of people to the ranks of \nthe uninsured.\n  The Senator from Missouri just had up a chart in relation to the \nnumber of employees of small businesses who are going to lose their \ninsurance because of this bill. It tells the whole story. Over the next \nseveral days we will be able to weave together why. But it goes down to \nwhat the Senator from Missouri just outlined.\n  You have to read the bill. You have to look at the exceptions. In the \nbill there is the statement that employers are excluded, but then you \ngo through exception after exception after exception, where you have \nthese lawsuits where the employer can be sued. That creates insecurity \nand uncertainty for the future. Clearly, an employer is not going to \nmaintain that new liability which can put him or her out of business \nthe next day.\n  One of the problems we will get to in reading the bill--and I only \nhave a couple minutes now--is the fact that under the Kennedy bill, \nonce you get to court, you can go either to State court or Federal \ncourt. If you do not like Federal court, you can go back to State \ncourt. If you go to State court, since there are 50 different State \ncourts, you can shop from court to court.\n  If you are an insurance company, and you cover five or six States, \nand a patient sues you, that patient will say: Well, they cover, for \nexample, Alabama, and there are no caps, no limits there--the tort may \nbe very different--I can sue for an unlimited amount. You have forum \nshopping on the States.\n  You can go to State court or Federal court. If you go to State court, \nthere are unlimited economic damages under the Kennedy bill, and \nunlimited noneconomic damages, and, for pain and suffering, unlimited \npunitive damages.\n  Let's say you flip and go to Federal court. If you go to Federal \ncourt, again there are unlimited economic damages, unlimited \nnoneconomic damages, and, yes, there is this $5 million limit on \npunitive damages. You might decide to go back to State court: No caps, \nno limits--shopping back and forth. That is what is in the underlying \nbill.\n  Can it be changed? Hopefully, it can be changed during the debate. \nClearly, this sort of forum shopping between Federal court for \nnonmedically reviewable decisions--in the new bill, which is just \nintroduced three nights ago, there is a whole new provision which \ngreatly expands what you can go to Federal court for, and I quote what \nis in the new bill--it was not in the bill 5 days ago but is in the new \nbill--``violation of any duty under the plan,'' which is a brand new \nexpansive right to sue.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have at this juncture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 50 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Fifty seconds.\n  So we do have to read the bill. Again, it is going to take time as we \ngo through it line by line. When you see this expansive new right to \nsue in Federal court, which was not there last week or a month ago or 2 \nmonths ago or in last year's bill--I don't know if it was snuck in; it \nis in this new bill--all of a sudden it opens up a whole new category \nfor which you go to Federal court. But if you do not like that, maybe \nyou will decide to go to State court. There is no bifurcation in the \nbill as written.\n  Once again, that is just an example of why we need to read the bill. \nIt is critical that we do so as we move forward; otherwise, we are \ngoing to cause hundreds of thousands of people to lose their insurance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, during the next few days, we have the \nopportunity to finish important work that was started years ago. We can \nfinally enact meaningful patient protection legislation by passing the \nMcCain-Edwards-Kennedy Bipartisan Patient Protection Act. The time has \ncome to ensure that patients of managed care organizations receive the \nprotections that they deserve and HMOs can be held accountable when \nthey wrongfully delay or deny coverage.\n  Many times, it is difficult for people to understand how the issues \nwe debate here relate to their everyday lives, but that is not the case \nwith patients' rights legislation. The preponderance of managed care \norganizations makes it crucial that participants in these plans have \nbasic protections. Over 25 percent of the U.S. population is enrolled \nin an HMO. Over 60 percent of Americans and over 75 percent of insured \nemployees are in some form of managed care. Receiving health care \nthrough managed care organizations is not a matter of choice for most \nof the 160 million Americans in these plans and uniformly providing \nquality care should be the standard for health insurers.\n  I hear from my constituents about this issue constantly and they are \nanxious for this legislation to be debated, voted on, and signed into \nlaw. They want guaranteed access to specialists. They want to be sure \nthey can receive emergency services as soon as possible and from any \nappropriate provider. They want to be able to participate in life-\nsaving clinical trials. They want a fair, independent and timely \nappeals process when HMOs deny care. And they want to know that their \nHMOs will be held accountable for the harm\n\n[[Page S6500]]\n\ncaused by wrongful denials or delays in coverage. The Bipartisan \nPatient Protection Act ensures patients receive common sense \nprotections and this bill provides these protections without \nsignificantly increasing health care costs or unfairly opening \nemployers up to liability.\n  Like my colleagues, I have heard from hundreds of constituents who \nare deeply concerned about the unfair treatment they receive from their \nHMOs. They have been in situations that any of us would dread. They \ndiscover they are ill, or that their child or spouse is ill. These \nsituations are taxing enough, but many of my constituents and many \nAmericans throughout this country find that in addition to fighting a \npersonal or family illness, they have to muster extra strength to \nbattle their HMO. When people are at their most vulnerable, they are \nbeing treated unfairly and being denied the care to which they are \nentitled. This legislation will put a stop to these practices.\n  The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill would not subject an employer to \nliability for HMOs unless the employer ``directly participates'' in a \nhealth treatment decision. Only those very large employers who run \ntheir own HMO would be liable. So if an employer were not acting as an \nHMO, they would not be held accountable as an HMO. In addition, the \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated that this legislation would \nonly modestly increase costs--4.2 percent over 10 years. Of this modest \nincrease, only .8 percent is attributed to the liability provisions of \nthe bill.\n  As we debate this measure, the experience of one of my constituents \ncomes to mind. She is a young woman who loves the outdoors. One weekend \nduring a hiking trip in the Shenandoah Mountains, she lost her footing \nand plummeted to the ground from a 40-foot cliff. Though she suffered \nsignificant injuries, she was fortunate to have survived.\n  Unfortunately, her fight to get well was not the only challenge she \nfaced after her accident. Her HMO denied her claim on the grounds that \nshe had failed to gain pre-authorization for her emergency room visit. \nShe fractured her arms, pelvis and skull. Her survival was largely \ndependent upon her being airlifted from the trail to a nearby hospital \nand her bills climbed to over $10,000.\n  Apparently her HMO wanted her to call for preauthorization before she \nreceived emergency care. This would have been an impressive feat for \nher considering she was unconscious at the foot of a mountain. I am \nunsure exactly when this young woman was supposed to have made this \ncall to her HMO. When she was unconscious on the ground with broken \nbones? Or maybe when she was in the helicopter being flown to the \nemergency room?\n  The fact that she had to fight with her HMO to pay the claims for \nover a year illustrates the importance of this legislation. All this \ntime, the unpaid hospital bills stacked up and almost forced her into \nbankruptcy. Unlike many stories, this one did not end as tragically as \nit could have. This young woman did eventually get her insurer to pay \nher medical expenses, but only after the Maryland Insurance \nAdministration ordered the HMO to do so. Her unnecessary ordeal and \nother stories that end up in tragedy show us that the time has come to \nstop the delaying tactics and pass meaningful patient protection \nlegislation.\n  If an HMO wrongfully denies care, if it purposely limits diagnostic \ntests, if it refuses to cover necessary emergency care, if it withholds \naccess to a needed specialist all in the name of saving money, then the \npatient who was harmed by these actions should have the right to hold \nthat HMO accountable.\n  Now we have a bipartisan effort to move this legislation. The authors \nof this bill have worked tirelessly to try to please opponents and they \nhave made significant adjustments. They have limited punitive damages \nin Federal court to $5 million. They have allowed State caps on damages \nto stand. They have prohibited parallel causes of action in Federal and \nState court. However, they have not and should not refuse to abandon \nthe main principles of any true patient protection legislation. We have \nto make sure any bill we pass is as strong as the bill the House passed \nin 1999.\n  I commend Senator Daschle for placing such a high priority on \npatients' rights legislation. His decision to make it the first bill to \nbe debated on the floor under his leadership shows his commitment to \nthis issue. The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy legislation provides strong, \nenforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. This bill is long overdue and we \nshould pass it now.\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nyielding me time.\n  Families across our country are being denied the medical care they \nneed. These are people who have insurance. They paid their premiums. \nThey think they are covered, but when they need care, too often they \nfind their insurance company is most concerned about its immediate \nbottom line rather than their health care.\n  Like my colleagues, I cringe at the stories I have heard: A parent \ntaking a child with a 105-degree fever to the emergency room in the \nmiddle of the night only to be told later that their insurance would \nnot pay for the care that was needed; doctors offer their best medical \nopinions only to see them overruled by an insurance company. Too often \nthe system makes it harder for patients to get the care they need. \nThere is more of a focus on short-term costs than quality care.\n  The truth is those decisions by insurance companies and HMOs have \nreal consequences. A child's condition may worsen. A dad might not be \nable to go to work. A mom may need around-the-clock medical care. But \nunder the current system, these patients have no legal recourse. If the \ncompany they paid medical coverage to makes a bad decision, there is \nlittle recourse. That is wrong. That is one of the problems I hope we \ncan fix by passing the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act.\n  For several years, I have been working in the HELP Committee, with my \ncolleague presiding today, and here on the floor to make sure that \npatients get the kind of care they need. Last Congress, the other side \nput forth a very hollow bill that excluded many Americans and didn't \nprovide the protection patients needed. But this year, we finally have \na real chance to help families. That is why I am proud that this is the \nfirst major bill being offered in a Democratic-controlled Senate.\n  I support S. 1052, the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act. It gives \npatients the protections they need. During this debate, many amendments \nwill be offered. Some of them will weaken the bill and draw the debate \naway from patient protections. I will call those attempts as I see \nthem. I will work to make sure that patients' rights are not watered \ndown over the course of the debate.\n  Health care quality and access are top issues for people in my home \nState of Washington. A few weeks ago, I spoke at a forum on health care \nin Olympia, WA. We were expecting at the most maybe 100 people would \ncome to that event. When I arrived at the Olympia Center, I saw almost \n600 people packed into the auditorium and into rooms they had opened \nfor overflow. They turned out in tremendous numbers and spoke with such \ngreat passion because they are concerned about access to health care.\n  As we begin this year's debate in the Senate, I want to outline some \nof the problems of our current system and some of the reforms I believe \nare really needed. I do mention that we are not trying to eliminate \nmanaged care. In fact, it is important that we have ways to coordinate \ncare and focus on prevention and wellness and to diagnose problems \nsooner. When the incentives are right, managed care can work.\n  In Washington State, it has helped play a role in improving life \nexpectancy, lowering infant mortality, and ensuring women get \nmammograms. Unfortunately, however, today the incentives are all wrong. \nThey focus more on cost than on care, more on a company's short-term \nfinancial health than on a patient's long-term physical health. We need \nto change the incentives so people are fighting illness, not fighting \ntheir insurance company.\n\n  We need to make sure insurance protects you when you become ill and \nprevents you from becoming sick in the first place. We need a system \nwhere\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\ndoctors are not spending 45 minutes on the phone with an insurance \ncompany so a sick child can be admitted to a hospital. We need a system \nwhere parents can take an injured child to the closest emergency room \ninstead of one that is miles away because the insurer demands it. We \nneed a system where the ultimate decision rests in the hands of \npatients based on the best medical advice of their own physician.\n  We need simply to restore the doctor-patient relationship. Too often \ntoday a doctor is allowed to be little more than a consultant. \nSometimes his or her recommendations are accepted. Other times they are \nnot because someone else made a decision for that patient, someone who \nhas not even seen that patient and who is not even a qualified or \nlicensed health care provider. We need to help companies that are \ntrying to do the right thing but are being beaten out by some bad \nplayers. We need a system where patients will know up front what their \nown rights are.\n  These days it is only when they become seriously ill that patients \nlearn how good or bad their insurer or their HMO is. That is why we \nneed clear, uniform, Federal quality control standards that protect all \nconsumers. Those are some of the changes we should seek.\n  I now turn to a few specific points I will be fighting for in this \ndebate.\n  First of all, we need to guarantee access to specialty care. \nSecondly, we need to guarantee access to clinical trials and \ncomprehensive care. We need to cover emergency treatment and not just \nthe care provided in the emergency room itself. We need to make sure we \nprotect as many Americans as possible. Some bills have such a limited \nscope that many patients would get no protection.\n  Finally, we need to make sure that plans are held accountable for \nhealth care decisions and that the external review process is objective \nand timely.\n  Those are some of the things I will be fighting to make sure we keep \nin this debate.\n  We know that patients aren't getting the care they need. We know what \nthe problems are, and we have a bill in front of us that will fix them.\n  The American people have been waiting too long for real health care \nprotection, and we have an obligation in the Senate to give them the \ncoverage they need. That is what this coming debate will be about.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a number of our colleagues want to \naddress the Senate. So I will speak briefly this afternoon.\n  I want to come back to one of the provisions I believe is so \nimportant in our legislation. I don't think there really should be any \ndoubt about our strong commitment in the Senate to protecting American \npatients on the issue of clinical trials.\n  As I mentioned earlier when I had a brief exchange with my friend and \ncolleague from North Carolina, I think any Patients' Bill of Rights \nthat is going to be worthy of its name is going to provide good \nprotection for clinical trials. As I have mentioned on other occasions, \nwe have seen a vast expansion of basic research and commitment by this \nbody. We have doubled the NIH budget in recent times. Recently we have \nwitnessed the mapping of the human genome and the sequencing of genes.\n  Rarely does a day go by when we don't hear on radio, see on \ntelevision, or read in the newspapers about some new kind of medical \nbreakthrough. These breakthroughs can make a very important difference \nin the quality of health and life for American patients. Our whole \nbiotech industry has been increasingly effective at making progress in \nareas which we could not have possibly have imagined. It is true with \nthe orphan drug program, which we intend to reauthorize this year. On \njust about every front, we have seen the most remarkable progress. But \nin order for that progress to take life, we have to see the progress \nmade in the laboratory get to the patient. The key aspect of this \ntransition is clinical trials.\n  We believe clinical trials offer enormous hope for thousands of our \nfellow citizens. What we have seen in recent times is that one of the \nmost serious abuses by HMOs is the denial to participate in clinical \ntrials. Had these patients been involved in clinical trials, in many \ninstances their lives would have been saved. This has been commented on \nby our colleagues. Their lives would have been greatly enhanced if they \nhad been able to participate in these clinical trials.\n  I still remember very clearly the testimony we had before our HELP \nCommittee on this issue a number of months ago. We had the director of \nthe Lombardi Center, named after the great football coach, here in \nWashington. We asked him about what their principal challenges were as \na research center. He said they had hired a number of people, and the \npeople they hired were professionals. However, what they were hiring \nthem for was to wrestle with the insurance companies to permit those \nindividuals who ought to be included in the clinical trials to be so \nincluded. They had seen a significant expansion of that--far too many. \nHe said they could have used those resources for additional kinds of \ntrials and benefits for consumers. But he gave so many different \nexamples of people whose lives were basically diminished and, in many \ninstances, lost because of the failure of inclusion.\n  In the provisions of the McCain-Edwards bill, there are protections \nwhich are routine in terms of clinical trials that must be followed. In \norder to participate, there has to be the prospect that the individual \ncan make progress, and the patient also has to meet other kinds of \nbasic requirements. The last time we debated this issue on a Patients' \nBill of Rights, the Senate finally accepted a study on whether clinical \ntrials were really useful, productive, or helpful for American \npatients.\n  It is difficult for me to believe that was the final resolution for \nthis body, but it was. What concerns me greatly is the issue of how we \nare going to eventually resolve this issue.\n  Recently, the Medicare Program has expanded their clinical trials \nprogram. They had to deal with a number of issues. They had to deal \nwith unanticipated patient care costs as a result of participation in \nthe clinical trials. They had to deal with a number of these matters.\n  It is interesting to note that the alternative proposal from Senator \nFrist and Senator Breaux has a clinical trial provision, but their \nprovision will substantially delay implementation. A fair review of \ntheir provision reveals the clinical trials would not go into place for \nprobably 4 or 5 years and also their bill excludes unanticipated \npatient care costs as a result of participation in clinical trials.\n  The reason they delay implementation is they want a further study on \nthe allocation of costs between the clinical trials and the insurance \ncompanies. The fact is, that study has already been done. That review \nhas already been made. The facts are in and they have been examined, \nreexamined, and examined again. They are being implemented at the \npresent time and are virtually unchallenged.\n  We have to ask ourselves why we should have a whole other additional \nprocess that is going to delay clinical trials under the proposal of \nour colleagues. I have not heard the justification or the rationale for \nthat.\n  Also, the alternative to the McCain-Edwards proposal excludes the FDA \nclinical trials. That, I understand, is directly as a result of the \nrequest of the insurance industry.\n  That does raise important questions because the FDA reviews are some \nof the most advanced reviews, some of the most important reviews, and \nsome of the trials are at the edge of potential benefit to consumers. \nYet they are completely excluded. They are included in our proposal \nbecause we value those important clinical trials.\n  This provision of clinical trials may not seem as important, but if \none asks the breast cancer coalition in this country about what is \nextremely important in the protections of women and the treatment of \nwomen, they will mention clinical trials.\n\n[[Page S6502]]\n\n  If one talks about other dangers of cancer, by and large, the issue \nof clinical trials will be at the top of their list, a top priority, a \ntop patient protection, and we believe in that. We share that view. \nThis is something that is absolutely essential if we are going to move \nahead with the protections of patients.\n  We have done that previously. We have seen how there had been an \nallocation of resources historically between the insurance companies \nwhen they covered patients and the trial itself as a general \nunderstanding, as I mentioned, under Medicare, about those allocations \nof resources, what should be allocated for the clinical trial and \nexpenses associated with that, and also what would be allocated by the \ncontinuation of care which the HMO would be otherwise required to pay.\n  One of the loopholes that has been added to this is the issue about \nsome reaction to the clinical trial that may be related to the illness \nor not, say, someone going in under a cancer protocol and then having \nsome kind of adverse reaction as to make their situation more \ncomplicated. Yes, that may happen in certain circumstances, but it does \nseem to me we ought to address that. We have done that in the past. \nThere is no reason we should not. That has not presented itself as an \nimpediment to moving ahead on this issue. We ought to be able to get \nthat behind us.\n\n  I am strongly committed to ensuring that whatever comes out of this \nbody in terms of the Patients' Bill of Rights has these protections.\n  I might mention a note from the Cancer Society:\n\n       On behalf of the American Cancer Society and its 28 million \n     supporters, I am writing to respectfully request that you \n     allow debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights to move forward \n     and that you support the ``Bipartisan Patient Protection Act \n     of 2001.'' As the largest voluntary health organization \n     dedicated to improving cancer care, the Society has set the \n     enactment of a patients' bill of rights that provides strong, \n     comprehensive protections to all patients in managed care \n     plans as one of its top legislative priorities for this \n     session of Congress.\n       While the Society does not have a position on health plan \n     liability, we have identified several other provisions that \n     are critical to cancer patients.\n\n  This is what it is, Mr. President. We are concerned about what is \ncritical to cancer patients in this country. It is spelled out here. I \nwill take a few moments to mention them.\n\n       Specifically, we advocate the patient protection \n     legislation that provides all insurance patients with:\n       Increased access to clinical trials--assuring that cancer \n     patients who need access to the often life-saving treatments \n     provided in both federally and privately-funded or approved \n     high-quality, peer-reviewed clinical trials have the same \n     coverage for routine patient care costs (e.g., physician \n     visits, blood work, etc.) as patients receiving standard \n     care.\n       Prompt and direct access to the medical specialists. \n     Patients facing serious or life threatening illnesses, such \n     as cancer, need continuity of care--\n\n  This legislation provides it--\n\n     the option of designating their specialist as their primary \n     care provider--\n\n  This legislation provides it--\n\n     and the ability to have a standing referral to their \n     specialist for ongoing care.\n\n  Our legislation provides it.\n\n       Strong, independent, and timely external grievance and \n     appeals procedures.\n\n  Our legislation provides it.\n  Mr. President, the letter continues:\n\n       We are particularly pleased that--\n\n  McCain-Edwards--\n\n     includes a strong clinical trials provision that provides \n     access for cancer patients and others with serious and life \n     threatening diseases to both federally and privately-\n     sponsored high-quality, peer-reviewed trials.\n\n  The FDA trials as well as other trials.\n\n       Clinical trials are a critical treatment option for cancer \n     patients and are also essential in our nation's efforts to \n     win the War Against Cancer. Without clinical trials, new or \n     improved treatments would languish in the laboratory, never \n     reaching the patients who need them. Unfortunately, only \n     three percent of cancer patients currently enroll in clinical \n     trials. Part of the problem is that many health insurers \n     refuse coverage for a patient's routine care costs if the \n     patient enrolls in a clinical trial--effectively denying \n     access to life-saving treatment.\n\n  We are interested in dealing with the challenges of cancer in our \nsociety, which is the top killer and the one that is most dreaded.\n  I remember a great leader in the Senate, Warren Magnuson. He was \ninstrumental in setting up the National Institutes of Health, and \nstrongly supported the Cancer Institute. He said his dream of a \nnewspaper headline was ``Cancer Conquered.'' That is something most \nAmericans agree would be the best possible headline.\n  Clinical trials are indispensable. Nineteen percent of the children \nwho have cancers are involved in clinical trials. We have had the \ngreatest progress and breakthroughs in the area of children's cancers. \nResearchers say a very significant reason for that is because of their \ninvolvement in clinical trials. We have made slower progress dealing \nwith other cancers, and we have reduced numbers of people included in \nthose trials.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator is expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this bill is a very significant bill. It \nimpacts about everybody in America; about 200 million people presently \nhave health insurance. As a result, if we passed a bad law, the \nunintended, or intended, consequences of it could be dramatic.\n  It is important to take a hard, intense look at what is being \nproposed by Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy as their bill. This is \nin the context of bills which have already been proposed by Members \nfrom our side, some which are bipartisan such as the Breaux-Frist-\nJeffords bill; some do not have Democratic sponsorship, such as the \nNickles amendment. All have as their basic purpose the same intent \nunderlying--certainly I give credit to the McCain bill for this. The \nbasic intent is making sure individuals are properly treated when they \ninterface with their insurance companies; that they have an opportunity \nfor redress that is effective, which allows them to be sure that if \nthey get poor treatment, they have some way to correct it; and that if \nthey are harmed by their health care provider, they have the ability to \nrecover proper compensation for that harm.\n  That is a goal all Members have. Everyone who is debating in this \nChamber understands the importance of making sure that Americans who \nget health care have adequate recourse when that health care is not \nsupplied correctly. It is also equally important Americans have a \ncertain set of rights when they are dealing with their health care \nprovider in areas such as the type of physician they would see and the \ntype of referrals they would get and the issue of specialists. That is \nalso equally important.\n  All the proposals that have come forward address that issue. I have \nnot yet heard of a case from the other side of the aisle--and they have \npresented a number of anecdotal cases, and they are compelling, people \nwho have had problems with their insurers. I have not heard one of \nthose cases where that individual would not have had the ability for \nredress or be taken care of under either the Nickles or the Breaux-\nFrist-Jeffords bill. The issue is not about that. It is not about \nwhether or not we are concerned about individuals getting fair \ntreatment from their insurer. It is not about individuals having a set \nof rights which are protected when they deal with their doctor, who is \nrepresenting their insurance company, or whether they deal with their \ninsurance company. That is not what this issue is about.\n  It comes down to a couple of substantive questions as to the \ndifferences. The first involves States rights versus Federal rights. \nThat is called scope. It is a question of what authority do we have as \na Federal Government to take over authority which has traditionally \nbeen handled by the States, especially in the area of insurance. \nInsurance has traditionally been a State responsibility.\n  As a former Governor, I know it is something every State takes very \nseriously and is very committed to. New Hampshire's laws for protecting \npatients are much more aggressive than proposals in any of the three \npackages here. That is one element of difference. The other element is \nsomething I want to talk about, the area of liability. Liability is a \nterm that has huge implications. The practical effect of the McCain \nbill, no doubt about it, is that there are going to be created \ninnumerable opportunities for lawsuits to be initiated against not only \ninsurers but equally against employers, small employers and large \nemployers. Mom-and-\n\n[[Page S6503]]\n\npop grocery stores, mom-and-pop gas stations, mom-and-pop restaurants, \nsmall, struggling production facilities, software companies, and large \nemployers--Wal-Mart, Ford, whatever, the big ones--those employers are \nsuddenly going to find themselves drawn into literally hundreds of \npotential opportunities for liability.\n\n  What is the effect of that? The effect of that is a large number of \nemployers, especially small and midsize employers, are going to throw \nup their hands and say: Hey, listen, I can't afford the risk.\n  The average malpractice lawsuit in this country costs about $77,000 \nto defend if you are in an employer situation. There are a lot of small \nemployers for whom $77,000 is their entire profit margin for the whole \nyear. They may get hit with a multiplicity of lawsuits under this bill \nthat do not exist today. This is a new law created for the purposes of \ncreating new lawsuits. This is a bill that is of the lawyer, for the \nlawyer, and by the lawyer--for the trial lawyer. And the practical \nimplication is that a lot of employers, a lot of people who want to \ntake care of their people they work with, are not going to be able to, \nand they are going to simply have to drop their insurance. They are \nprobably going to replace--some of them, the more substantive, will be \nable to replace their insurance by saying to the employee: Go buy your \nown insurance. Here is the money.\n  They will never get as good a package in most instances as their \nemployer could get for them because they will not have the ability to \nnegotiate with the strength of a large number of individuals. \nIndividuals seeking individual policies simply get charged a lot more \nthan groups that have been pursued as a result of a group of employers \nbanning together or even one large employer banning together and \npursuing an insurance company. The quality of the insurance will drop \nfor those individuals. An even greater number of employees are simply \nnot going to have insurance at all because small and midsize employers \nare simply not going to be able to afford it and they will simply \neliminate it as an option they present as a benefit in their workplace. \nSo there will be more uninsured.\n  How can you possibly call something a Patient's Bill of Rights when \nthe practical effect of the bill is to create more people who don't \nhave any insurance at all? So they don't have any rights; they don't \nhave any insurance.\n  If that is the practical effect of the bill, and it is--you don't \nhave to listen to me. Listen to an independent group such as CBO which \nhas scored this bill as putting 1.2 million people out of insurance. \nThat is the conclusion they came to because of the additional costs \nthat result from the lawsuits, in large part. Those people are not \ngoing to have insurance. They don't get any new rights under this bill. \nThey lose all the rights they had. Yet this is claimed to be a \nPatient's Bill of Rights. Very inconsistent, to say the least.\n  In the process of setting this bill up, there has been a presentation \nfrom the other side that they actually took the other bills that had \nbeen pursued in the last couple of years--remember, we have not had a \nhearing on any of these bills in our committee now for 2 years, which I \nthink is a little bit much--to bring a bill of this size to the floor \nwithout any hearings at all so the people who are going to be affected \ncould have a forum to make their points.\n  Independent of that, there were over the last couple of years bills \nbrought to the floor. There was the prior McCain bill, the prior \nKennedy bill, and the prior Norwood-Dingell bill.\n  The representation has been that the McCain bill has moved to the \ncenter from those two bills that were introduced before. In fact, that \nis not true at all. This bill is much more to the left, and by the left \nI mean it is much more oriented towards undermining the rights of \npeople to buy insurance and have health insurance. By moving to the \nleft, I mean it interferes much more with States rights and it places \nmuch more liability on the backs of small employers and also large \nemployers.\n  This bill moves significantly to the left, not to the center. There \nare ways to move this bill to the center. Breaux-Frist-Jeffords is a \nbill that has moved to the center from the Nickles bill that was \ndebated and passed in the Senate last year. If you want to argue \ncenter, left, right, this bill moves way out into left field, as \ncompared with the original bills which were introduced and were already \npretty far out in left field. This bill, if it were in Fenway Park, \nwouldn't be in left field; it would be in the bullpen. Well, actually \nthat is in right field. It would be behind the Green Monster.\n  I point out a few areas where this occurs. First, as I have \nmentioned, it significantly expands liability for employers. Sponsors \nof the McCain bill say they have compromised by including a $5 million \ncap on punitive damages. However, the cap only applies in the Federal \nliability provisions added to the bill--it is sort of a bait-and-switch \nthing--and not to the more expansive liability provisions under State \nlaw.\n  One of the ironies of this bill is you can go forum shopping. This is \none of the favorite things trial lawyers like to do. I used to do a \nlittle bit of trial work. You love to forum shop. You find out what \ncourt has the best judge; you find out what court historically has the \njuries that give the highest award; you find out what court has the \nbest rules to improve your capacity to win your case on procedural \ngrounds; and you move to that court. If it is a Federal court, you go \nFederal. If it is a State court, you go State. Under the present law, \nyou cannot do that. You cannot bring an ERISA claim in a State court. \nBut under this bill, it expands dramatically the opportunity for forum \nshopping. Then it says: But, hold it, we put in a cap so you don't have \nto worry about that.\n  Unfortunately, there are a lot of States that have no cap. They have \nno limitation at all on damages.\n  Further, the bill itself allows unlimited damages for economic and \nnoneconomic losses--damages within the Federal court system. It expands \nthe right to sue for violations of duty under the plan. This is a \nbrandnew concept. It creates a whole new cause of action out there \nwhere employers will suddenly become liable for contractual activity on \nHIPAA or COBRA or ERISA that they are not liable for today, relative to \na private lawsuit.\n  I have a chart. I don't have it on the floor today because I had it \nup so often I thought people might be getting tired of it. But it shows \nthere are potentially 200 new causes of action just on this one point \nalone.\n  Then it says it does not have punitive damages. In fact the earlier \nbills did not have punitive damages. At least H.R. 990, which I think \nis the original Norwood bill, did not. But, in fact, it creates a new \nterm of art, which is essentially punitive damages, and it allows those \ndamages, as I mentioned, to be recovered at the rate of $5 million.\n  Here is a bill that says it is moving more to the center when, in \nfact, in the liability area it dramatically expands forum shopping, it \ndramatically expands punitive damages opportunities, it dramatically \nexpands the number of lawsuits that can be brought on the issue of \ncontracts and contractual obligations of the employer--all of this is \ndirected at the employer--and it dramatically expands, in Federal \ncourt, economic and noneconomic damages that can be recovered against \nthe employer. All of this is new. A brandnew attack on the employer by \nthe trial bar will be allowed under this bill.\n\n  This is not moving to the center. This is moving to the left.\n  Another example, the McCain-Kennedy bill effectively requires that \nall States pass new patients' protection laws identical to the new \nFederal requirement. This is a huge step, an intrusion into States \nrights. Earlier versions of the legislation, both the Daschle-Kennedy \nbill last year and the Norwood bill, used the standard under the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act to determine whether or \nnot State laws would be preempted by the new Federal patients' \nrequirements. That standard does not prevent the application of this \nFederal law versus requiring the application of the Federal law.\n  The latest McCain bill adds new barriers for States by requiring that \nState laws be substantially equivalent to and as effective as each new \nFederal patient protection requirement. This two-part standard will \neffectively require every State to renegotiate and pass a whole new \ngroup of provisions in order that their laws be virtually identical \nwith the Federal provision. If the State fails to do so, the Federal \nGovernment will take over and enforce those rules in every State.\n\n[[Page S6504]]\n\n  So I cannot see how you can claim this bill moves to the center when \nthe practical effect of this section is to essentially usurp and wipe \nout States' activities in this area.\n  My colleague from Maine just spoke a little while ago. She put up a \nlist that showed literally almost every State in the country has \naggressively addressed the issue of patients' rights and has \nestablished a set of requirements and rights which flow to the patient \nthat are fairly consistent with what we all seek in the Senate. But if \nthey are not exactly or substantially equivalent to and as effective as \nthe Federal law, they will be overruled and the Federal Government will \ncome in and usurp the State authority and actually take over the \nState's insurance enforcement.\n  We have had State insurance enforcement in this country for quite a \nwhile and it has worked pretty well. So you cannot say a bill moves to \nthe center when it essentially says ``to heck with the States, we are \ncoming in, we are the big boys, you are out of the game because we know \nbetter than you, State legislatures. You, the State legislature, are \nnot interested in the people who live in your States. We here in \nWashington are.''\n  That is not a movement to the center. That is a dramatic, if not \nradical, move to the left, to centralization of power here in \nWashington at the expense of the States.\n  In addition, another example of the fact this bill does not move to \nthe center but moves way off beyond the Green Monster, out beyond left \nfield, out past Lansdowne Street, probably down by the Massachusetts \nFreeway--actually it is not a freeway; it costs money--the \nMassachusetts Turnpike is the effect this bill has on the ability to \nbypass the appeals process.\n  The prior proposals, earlier versions which were pretty far left, out \nthere in left field, as I said, of the bill provided where injury or \ndeath had already occurred, and therefore the appeals process would be \nfutile, the patient would not be required to exhaust the appeals \nprocess before going to court. The new version permits a person to \nbypass the appeals process and go directly to court to seek monetary \ndamage if the harm would occur by going through the process.\n  That may sound reasonable, but you have to read behind that language \nfor the practical impact of what it is.\n  It is noteworthy that this exception would allow lawsuits for \nvirtually unlimited monetary damages rather than simply allowing \npatients to get the care they need if they would be substantially \nharmed by completing the review process.\n  The new version of the McCain bill also contains a late manifestation \nprovision. This is an amazing provision because this provision \nessentially says that if the appeal process period has run and you \ndecide that you have a manifestation of harm as a result of being \ntreated, you no longer have to go to the appeal process; You can go \ndirectly to court.\n  The practical effect of this language is essentially to eliminate the \nstatute of limitations. Under this law there is a total abrogation, in \nmy humble opinion, of the statute of limitations. That is a move to the \nleft.\n  As a trial lawyer, I love the idea that I never have to worry about \nthe statute of limitations because if my office happens to make a \nmistake and not reach that 3-year window or that 6-year window, I am \nnot going to be subject to the errors and omissions suit that I might \nget hit with by my client because, if there is no statute of \nlimitations, I will never miss the filing requirement.\n  But going back beyond the manifestations language, this concept that \nis totally different than what was in the original Dingell-Norwood bill \nand the original Daschle-Kennedy bill that you as a patient do not have \nto exhaust your administrative remedies before you go into court, but \nyou simply have to claim harm, and then you can go right after monetary \ndamages, is a dramatic undermining of the capacity to have an effective \nappeal process. You essentially have no appeal process.\n  Now all you have are court decisions. Nobody is going to go down the \nappeal process route. Everybody is going to race to the courthouse with \nthis bypass language.\n  The way it should be structured, obviously, is that, sure, if you are \ninjured and you are going to suffer as a result of having to go through \nthe appeal process and you are not getting a response, you should be \nable to go to court, but you shouldn't get the monetary damages at that \ntime. You should get whatever you need in order to get the right \nmedical care, then go back to the appeal process and find out what the \nproper resolution should be and then move into the court system for the \nmonetary issues.\n  That is the logical approach. It is actually the approach, for all \nintents and purposes, that was in the original bill. Now we have \nanother example of moving way over to the left and not moving back to \nthe center, which this bill claims to do. It doesn't move to the center \nat all.\n  These are not minor issues--the liability issue, going straight to \ncourt issue, and the States rights issue. These are not minor issues. \nThese are big questions in the scheme of how we deliver health care. \nThe reason they are big questions is because, if this bill passes, it \nis going to fundamentally change the way health care is delivered in \nthis country. It will push a lot of people into the uninsured ranks. As \na result, you are going to have this huge momentum for the \nnationalization of our system.\n  At this point, I see our leader coming on the floor. I know he has \ncomments that he wants to make. So I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, timewise, what is the situation now? Has the \ntime been divided? Is it in blocks of an hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 6 minutes 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you very much. Mr. President, I will try to take \nadvantage of that time and make a few remarks. Maybe then I can come \nback and talk again later.\n  First of all, I wish to comment briefly with the time we are using \nnow. I think it is an important part of the process that we have \nopening statements and descriptions of what is in the pending bills--\nboth the Kennedy-McCain-Edwards legislation as well as Breaux-Frist and \nother legislation--so we can see where the similarities are and find \nwhere the problems are.\n  We did not want to go forward with the amendment process on Monday \nbecause there had been changes made in the underlying bill on Thursday \nof last week, June 14. I presume there will still be more changes \noffered by the sponsors of the legislation, whether it is Senator \nMcCain, or Senator Edwards, or others, as problems are identified and \nas consideration is given to the reservations. Those will be either \namendments or substitutes that will be offered.\n  I make the point that we are not interested in prolonging the \nconsideration of this legislation. We are prepared to go to the vote in \nthe morning on the motion to proceed. We are prepared to begin the \namendment process on Thursday afternoon. Hopefully, we can make \nprogress on amendments on Thursday and Friday and on into next week.\n  I also hope we will find a way before the Fourth of July recess to \ncomplete action on a supplemental appropriations bill. A lot of that \nwill depend on whether or not the Committee on Appropriations can act \ntomorrow on what is in that legislation. We need to get that done or we \nare going to see more problems develop with the Department of Defense \nbeing able to keep our ships steaming and our planes flying. We will \nneed to do both of these issues as much as we can during the next week.\n  Let me emphasis a couple of points. Others have noted that many of \nthe core components of the various bills that have been offered, \nwhether it is the original Nickles proposal, the Breaux-Frist-Jeffords \nproposal, or the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy proposal, have a lot of \nsimilarities.\n  Let me talk a minute about where we agree. We agree that we want a \nPatients' Bill of Rights to protect patients and to ensure those \npatients get the care they have been promised. That is why we believe \nso strongly that we need an immediate review process that will get a \nresult hopefully within a managed care entity or an outside review if \nthat is not satisfactory inside of the managed care entity and that it \nbe\n\n[[Page S6505]]\n\ndone on an expeditious basis and not drawn out. Get a result.\n  That is why the idea of going immediately to court has such little \nappeal to me because legal action, while it might get beneficial \nresults that would be helpful to the heirs, may be of no value to a \npatient who will have had all kinds of problems, and perhaps even die, \nbefore the conclusion of a lawsuit.\n  All of the bills have a review process. The important thing, in my \nopinion, is that the review be quick and that it get the results. If \nthe result is not satisfactory, then there has to be some process to \nget it considered in the courts. I think we will find a way to do that.\n\n  We agree that patients have to have access to specialists. That is \nwhat caused us to get into the need for a Patients' Bill of Rights. \nAfter the managed care concept was established and started going \nforward, it was doing a good job. It was providing care at a reduced \ncost. But some of the managed care entities started to make mistakes. \nThe difficulty is they wouldn't make medical records available to \npatients, which were their own medical records. You can't have that. \nThe idea that you would have to get permission from some other \norganization to go to an emergency entrance is unacceptable. You have \nto have access to emergency care in case of an accident, or whatever. \nOr if you have an OB/GYN doctor seeing a pregnant woman who then leaves \nthat managed care operation, she should be able to continue to have the \ncare of that OB/GYN.\n  There is no question that we need to make sure that common sense \napplies and that there is access to physicians. We need to have some \nway that cancer patients can have access to clinical trials. We need to \nmake sure there is access for women to surgical treatments or for \nbreast cancer. We need to make sure that patients will be able to \ncontinue to see their doctor, if the doctor no longer works for the \nhealth care plan.\n  There is a long list of places where we agree that there needs to be \naccess to information that patients and beneficiaries need. We need to \nmake sure that there are new quality measures available.\n  We should not ignore the fact that there is a lot of common ground. \nWe, clearly, have some areas where we disagree. Of course, primarily it \nis when, where, and how you have a lawsuit.\n  I was a lawyer years ago. I was with a trial firm. We did defense \nwork. But we also occasionally filed some plaintiffs' lawsuits.\n  I am not opposed to having access to the court systems. Americans \ndeserve that right. The question is, Who can be sued? Should a person, \nor an entity, an employer, that has no involvement in the decision that \nis made based on business reasons, costs, or medical purposes be sued? \nNaturally, a good lawyer will throw out his dragnet and bring in \nemployers, doctors, nurses, the managed care entity, the insurance \ncompany--everybody who is within range and, by the way, look for the \none with the deep pockets. That is what you really want. You want the \none from whom you can get the money.\n  I think we need to be very careful about who is covered by these \nlawsuits and when they can be filed. Unless and until the review \nprocesses are exhausted, we should not be resorting to legal action.\n  Also, where a lawsuit is filed does make a difference. I know for \nsure from my own personal experience, since some of my very closest \nfriends and relatives are plaintiff lawyers, that there is this little \nthing of forum shopping: Let's look around and find the county in the \nState where we could get the highest judgment. Or maybe it is in a \nFederal court; let's pick and choose. Or maybe let's file in both \nFederal and State court.\n  In my own State of Mississippi, there are a series of articles being \ndone by a Gannett newspaper, the Clarion-Ledger, that would not \nordinarily do an article such as this, noting that there are one or two \nparticular counties in my State that are considered a plaintiff's \nwonderland, where you can get massive damages if you go into these \nparticular counties. By the way, our insurance commissioner--a very \nfine insurance commissioner of many years a Democrat--has noted that 46 \ninsurance companies have said: We are leaving this State. We are not \ngoing to face these exorbitant, ridiculous judgments in this particular \ncounty, Jefferson County, MS.\n  So where you file does make a difference. We need to pay attention to \nthat.\n  Of course, there is also the question of how much in damages. Is this \nabout a result or is this about a lawsuit? Do we want health care or do \nwe want legal action? Do we want a reasonable judgment for losses that \nyou have incurred or do we want pain and suffering and punishment? \nThose are basic questions.\n  But I hope we can bring all sides together and get a result. I want a \nresult. I want us to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. I think we need \nit. It is the right thing to do. And I am tired of hearing about it. It \nis time to act. It is kind of like what we did in the tax relief bill \non the marriage penalty. We have been talking about it for 10 years, \nabout how it is unfair, and that we ought to get rid of it. My question \nwas, Why haven't we done it?\n  We can do this if both sides can be reasonable. I talked to the \nPresident yesterday. There is no doubt in my mind the President wants \nto sign a reasonable and fair Patients' Bill of Rights. But there is \nalso no doubt in my mind he will veto the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill \nin its present form.\n  I hope we can go through this amendment process, address the delivery \nquestions, the liability questions, and also see if we can find a way \nto make health care more accessible to many Americans who are not now \ncovered. Small business men and women have a hard time, even when they \nreally want to, making sure all of their employees are covered because \neven if they offer them the coverage, and pay half the cost, many \nemployees say: We just can't afford it. We are not going to do it. So \nthey are not covered.\n  Can't we find a way to give them access to coverage or to help them \nwith the expenses of that coverage? I think we can. I think this is a \nbill where we can help address that.\n  Let me note that the distinguished Senator from Nevada is on his \nfeet. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I just want to say to the Republican leader, you do not \nhave to use leader time. You should not be rushed. Even though you are \non Democratic time, you are welcome to it.\n  Mr. LOTT. That was about the nicest way I have ever been told my time \nhas expired. That is why I was talking fast. I did want to get in a few \nremarks. I appreciate Senator Reid noting that.\n  At this point, I will yield the floor because we have had very good \ncooperation in going back and forth every 30 minutes.\n  I would like to continue that. I will take advantage of leader time \nanother time. But thank you very much, I say to Senator Reid.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder. There was an agreement that \nwe would go into morning business at 5 o'clock and that I would be \nrecognized at that time.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend from Alaska, we were told the \nRepublicans would have no one to speak at 4:30. But that was not \nfactual. People did come. And they have used 35 minutes of the 30 \nminutes. Senator Reed has been waiting.\n  We would ask, under the agreement that we entered into earlier today, \nthat he use his time. I wanted to speak, but I say to my friend from \nAlaska, if you are the last speaker for the Republicans, I have to be \nhere to close anyway. Senator Reed wants to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  I say to the Senator, you can speak for however long you desire.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I respond to the assistant majority leader, I would \nprobably need not more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island be recognized for up to 10 minutes--is that adequate?\n  Does the Senator from Massachusetts wish to speak anymore today?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I look forward to addressing the Senate \ntomorrow morning.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair \nrecognize the Senator from Rhode Island for 10 minutes; following that, \nthe Senator\n\n[[Page S6506]]\n\nfrom Alaska for 10 minutes; and then I will close out the evening with \nwhatever time is necessary for that to be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to support the McCain-Edwards-\nKennedy bill and to commend the authors. They have done some great work \nin trying to reconcile a very pressing need in this country; that is, \nto give patients the ability to get the health care they need and, \nindeed, that they either paid for or their employer paid for.\n  Today I have heard discussion that this is just about lawyers who are \ngoing to enrich themselves. But I think that argument misses the point. \nThe point is, there are lots of lawyers on the other side, on the HMOs' \nside, who are using their skills to deny patients what they thought \nthey purchased with their health care plan, where they are able to use \nall the loopholes that are rife throughout our statutes, not to provide \ncare but to provide the insurance companies with an out.\n  The McCain-Kennedy-Edwards bill clarifies the rights of patients. It \nmakes them specific. It makes them less debatable. Let's make these \nrights less a contest of lawyers on both sides and more something that \nthe patients of America, the citizens of America, can expect will be \ntheir right to demand and receive when they pay for health insurance.\n  So when you have situations where, instead of specifying, as the \nMcCain-Kennedy-Edwards bill does, the right to a pediatrician as the \nprovider of health care services for a child or a pediatric specialist \nfor a child, you have something nebulous like a physician with age-\nspecific qualifications, that is the type of ambiguity that is rife for \nthe competing proposals, and that leads to the denial of care to \nAmericans. In fact, it leads to lots of controversy, strife, \ndiscussion, and debate.\n  So this legislation has been well crafted over many months to \nspecify, delineate, and clearly give patients their rights; in fact, to \ngive them what they believe they are paying for. And they are already \npaying a lot.\n  So I believe that this bill has made great progress in moving from \nthe version we considered in the last Congress in this Senate Chamber, \nand the version that has been proposed by Congressman Norwood and \nCongressman Dingell in the other body; and we are moving close, I hope, \nto legislation that can receive the support of this Senate, which can \ngo forward and be combined with a very similar bill on the House side \noffered by Congressman Norwood and Congressman Dingell, and then go to \nthe President for his signature.\n  What it would do, I believe, is to, again, specify clearly, \nunequivocally, what Americans can expect from their health care \nprovider.\n  There has also been lots of discussion that this really is going to \npull in countless numbers of employers, small businesses, who are going \nto be ensnared in a web of litigation because of this legislation. But \nthat ignores the very specific language in the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy \nbill that says that an employer can only be liable if that individual \nplayed a direct role in a decision to deny a treatment of health care \nservices to a patient. This is not the situation where a small business \nbuys a Blue Cross plan or buys an HMO plan. This is a situation where \nan individual in that business organization makes the decision to say: \nNo, don't give that service to that individual who is covered by my \nplan--a very unlikely circumstance, but one I think most people would \nagree, if you are making those types of decisions, you should at least \nbe potentially liable for the consequences of those decisions.\n  I believe the discussion of an employer as being ensnared in this web \nof lawsuits misses the very specific language of the bill. It certainly \nis not the intent of this legislation. It never has been. With the \nrefined language and the very specific language, I don't think it will \nbe the effect of the legislation either.\n  We know that this issue is creating a great deal of controversy \naround the country. It is generating the activity of interest groups \nleft and right. This morning, early today, the junior Senator from Utah \nspoke about a doctor who was contacted by the American Medical \nAssociation to call the Senator and support the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy \nbill. In the course of the discussion, he discovered that he really \ndidn't support the bill but he favored the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords \napproach.\n  That is not the only calls that are being made out there in America \nas we speak and debate here. My office received a call from a \nbusinessman in Rhode Island instigated by the National Association of \nManufacturers who said: Call your Senator and tell him not to vote for \nKennedy-Edwards-McCain. But when we spoke with the individual, when we \nexplained the provisions of the bill, particularly the provisions with \nrespect to potential lawsuits against employers, he concluded that the \nKennedy-McCain-Edwards bill was the type of legislation he could \nsupport because he is not just an employer; he is just not a \nbusinessperson; he is a family man. His wife had recently been sick, \nand he understood the difficulties that are faced in trying to get \nhealth care out of an insurance company that is committed to the bottom \nline, not the health care, principally, of their insured members. He \npreferred, after discussion, the type of protections included in this \nbill.\n  I hope that is a sign that when we can come here to the Chamber and \nclearly explain the contents of this legislation, we can convince many \npeople across the country that this legislation is in the best interest \nof the families of America.\n  Now, I have for several years been working to ensure that this type \nof legislation pays particular attention to children. I am very pleased \nto say that the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill incorporates many of the \nprovisions of legislation I have submitted along with many colleagues. \nIt protects the right of families to have a pediatrician as a primary \ncare provider and the right to make referrals to a pediatric \nspecialist, not just a specialist. There is a vast difference between \nan adult cardiologist who may have seen a child 1 or 2 years ago and a \npediatric cardiologist who specializes in those types of problems for \nchildren. If you are a parent, that is the specialist you want to see. \nThis legislation provides for that access clearly, unequivocally.\n  The alternative legislation would say the company can find someone \nwho has a specific qualification. Again, the lawyers for the insurance \ncompany can find many ways to suggest that that is the gentleman or \nwoman who might have seen a child 2 years ago, a cardiologist, rather \nthan the more expensive doctor not in their plan who is, in fact, a \npediatric cardiologist.\n  This is real progress on the bill. I commend the authors for doing \nthis and pushing forward.\n  There is one area I would like to see included in addition to what \nhas been done. That is a proposal I have made previously on a \nbipartisan basis with Senators Jeffords and Collins to create for each \nState an ombudsman, someone who can be a point of reference and \nreferral to individuals who have questions about their health care \nplan. Before you even get into a long, protracted internal review or \nexternal review, there should be an individual you can contact and say: \nDo I have a problem here? I think I am covered for this procedure. Am I \nreally covered for this procedure? That type of advice, that type of \nobjective information on a systematic basis can do much to resolve the \npotential specter of a plethora of lawsuits.\n\n  It is a worthwhile initiative. I hope my amendment can be \nincorporated into this bill. Indeed, I am preparing to offer such as \namendment along with Senators Wellstone, Wyden, and Clinton. I hope \nwhen the process begins for amendments, we can make that improvement to \nwhat is already a very fine bill.\n  This is a very clear issue when you boil it all down. Do you stand \nwith the families of America who deserve health care coverage they paid \nfor or do you stand with the insurance companies whose major concern is \ntheir financial solvency and well-being? This legislation stands with \nand for the families of America. I support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlaska is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6507]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/20/senate-section/article/S6463-8", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6463-S6507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          BIPARTISAN PATIENT PROTECTION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6464]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I just want to say at the outset of \nthis debate that this is not a new legislative proposal. We have had \nvery extensive debates on the provisions which are included in the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We have had good debates on the provisions \nwhen we passed the Frist bill about 2 years ago. And we had additional \nkinds of debates when we took up the Norwood-Dingell bill a little over \na year ago. These matters have been before the Senate. They are matters \nthat have been discussed repeatedly in this Chamber by a number of us \nover a very considerable period of time.\n  We want to point out at the outset of this debate, that the kinds of \nalterations, adjustments and changes that were made over the weekend \nwere basically technical in nature. I went through those yesterday with \nthe Senator from North Carolina. Maybe later in the day, if it is \nnecessary, I might go through them again. But again, they were \nbasically clarifications in response to questions that were raised \nabout different language interpretations of the bill. These were issues \nthat have been raised by the White House, and those who were opposed to \nthe legislation. I think the most recent changes help clarify the \nlanguage in our bill.\n  As we have said all along, we are always interested in hearing ideas, \nsuggestions and recommendations, as long as they are consistent with \nthe fundamental purpose of the legislation. Our purpose is protecting \npatients, and also assuring accountability by HMOs and insurance \ncompanies that are making medical decisions and, too often, overruling \ndoctors, nurses, and trained personnel.\n  So I know there are some concerns. But the way to deal with those \nkinds of concerns is to engage in debate on these issues. I think if \nyou look at the Frist bill, you will find that it tracks, at least in \ntitles, the Norwood-Dingell and the McCain-Edwards legislation. \nHowever, the Frist bill creates numerous loopholes, which I think fails \nto respond either to the President's desire to make sure that all \nAmericans are covered. We will have a chance during the day to point \nout some of those differences between their bill and ours.\n  We are facing a situation where there are many of us, a majority in \nthe Senate, who are in strong support of the McCain-Edwards \nlegislation. On the other side there are those who don't want any \nlegislation and a small group who prefer the Frist-Jeffords-Breaux \nprovision. We will work our way through it. That is the way the Senate \nfunctions. We welcome the opportunity.\n  I note the presence of my friend and colleague, Senator Edwards. He \nand I plan to be here the whole day. We are in the Chamber ready to \ndeal with either amendments or to try to clarify provisions for those \nMembers who fail to understand them. We are also here to point out, in \nthe case of Breaux-Frist, how we think the McCain-Edwards bill provides \nbetter protections for American families. We are glad to do that as \nwell.\n  That is the framework. We are starting out on day 2. We are glad this \nbill is before the Senate, even though we will wait until tomorrow for \nthe first amendments. I am heartened by the strong resolution of our \nleader, Senator Daschle, in committing us to the conclusion of this \nlegislation prior to the Fourth of July recess.\n  Americans have waited too long. They have waited over 5 years for a \nstrong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. This issue has been \nstudied and studied to death. It is time for action. The Senate's \nfailure to take action results in too many of our citizens--too many \nchildren, too many women, too many seniors, too many families--being \nharmed today and experiencing additional kinds of pain and suffering.\n  It is within that framework that we will hopefully move ahead today.\n  It is time to pass the Patient Protection Act. Every doctor knows it. \nEvery nurse knows it. Every patient knows it. The American people know \nit. And in their heart, every Senator knows it, too. Often today \nmanaged care is mismanaged care. It is long past time for Congress to \nact to end the abuses by the HMOs. Too often insurance company \naccountants are making the medical decisions instead of doctors and \npatients. It is long past time for Congress to assure that the medical \ncare is based on a patient's vital signs, not an insurance company's \nbottom line.\n  The first proposal to do so was introduced in early 1997. We are now \nin the fifth year of consideration of this essential reform. Patients \nare still suffering, even dying, because of our inaction. Every day the \nCongress fails to act, an intolerable additional cost is imposed on \npatients and their families.\n  A survey by the School of Public Health at the University of \nCalifornia found that each and every day, 50,000 patients go through \nadded pain and suffering because of the actions of their health plan, \n35,000 patients have needed care that is delayed or denied, 35,000 \npatients have a referral delayed or denied, 31,000 patients are forced \nto change doctors, and 18,000 patients are forced to change \nmedications. A survey of physicians by the Kaiser Family Foundation and \nthe Harvard School of Public Health found similar results. Every day, \ntens of thousands of patients suffer serious declines in their health \nas a result of the action or inaction of their health plan.\n  Whether the issue is diagnostic tests, specialty care, emergency room \ncare, access to clinical trials, availability of needed drugs, \nprotection of doctors who give patients their best advice, or women's \nability to obtain gynecological services, too often HMOs and managed \ncare plans put profits ahead of patients.\n  The issue is clear: Does the Senate stand with powerful HMOs or with \nAmerican families? Do we stand for protecting patients and their \ndoctors or protecting insurance company profits?\n  There is only one reason this legislation did not pass years ago. It \nis because of the tens of millions of dollars the insurance companies \nand their allies have lavished on lobbying, campaign contributions, and \nmisleading advertising. Now is the time to say that the health of every \nAmerican family is a public trust, not a commodity for sale to the \nhighest bidder.\n  The need for prompt action on patient protections is great because \nthe dishonor roll of those victimized by HMO abuses is so long and \ngrowing.\n  A baby loses his hands and feet after a medical emergency because his \nparents believe they have to take him to a distant hospital emergency \nroom covered by their HMO rather than the hospital closest to their \nhome.\n  A Senate aide suffers a devastating stroke which might have been far \nmilder if her HMO had not refused to send her to an emergency room. \nEven now, the HMO refuses to pay for her wheelchair.\n  A woman is forced to undergo a mastectomy as an outpatient instead of \nwith a hospital stay as her doctor recommended. She is sent home in \npain with tubes still dangling from her body.\n  A doctor is denied future referrals of patients by an HMO under a \nmanaged care plan because he has told a patient about an expensive \ntreatment that could save her life.\n  The parents of a child suffering from cancer are told that lifesaving \nsurgery should be performed by an unqualified doctor who happens to be \non the plan's list, rather than by a specialist at the local cancer \ncenter equipped to perform the operation.\n  A woman with advanced cervical cancer is denied the opportunity to \nparticipate in a clinical trial that could save or prolong her life.\n  A child with cystic fibrosis is denied the opportunity for treatment \nat a center with the expertise to treat the disease.\n  A teenager with a seriously injured hand is told by his insurance \ncompany that they will pay for an amputation, but not the more \nexpensive reconstructive surgery that could provide a normal life.\n  A woman with a relatively minor leg injury ends up losing her leg \nbecause her insurance company persistently delays and denies adequate \ncare.\n  Our legislation corrects all of these problems and many more. It \ntakes HMOs and insurance company accountants out of the practice of \nmedicine and returns decision making to patients and doctors where it \nbelongs. Our proposal guarantees patients the rights that every \nhonorable insurance company already grants, and it provides an \neffective and timely means to enforce these rights. These protections \nare basic aspects of good health care\n\n[[Page S6465]]\n\nthat every family believes they were promised when they purchased \nhealth insurance and paid their premiums.\n  Virtually all of the patient protections in this legislation are \nalready available under Medicare. They have been recommended by the \nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners and the President's \nAdvisory Commission. They have also been proposed as voluntary \nstandards by the managed care industry itself through its trade \nassociation. In fact, most of them are features of the patient \nprotection legislation enacted under Governor George Bush in Texas.\n  Patients should have the right to see a specialist, if they have a \ncondition serious enough to require specialty care.\n  No parent should be told that their child with cancer has to be \ntreated by an HMO physician who lacks the expertise needed to treat the \nchild effectively.\n  Patients should have the right to the prescription medicine their \ndoctor says they need. They should not be told that they have to settle \nfor the second best medication for their condition or suffer \nunnecessary side effects or pay more because the most up-to-date drug \nis not accepted by the HMO.\n  Patients should have the right to go to the nearest hospital when \nthey have symptoms of serious illness.\n  They should have the right to continuing emergency care after their \ncondition is initially stabilized. Medicare patients have these rights, \nand other Americans should have them, too.\n  Patients should have the right to participate in a clinical trial if \nit offers the best hope for a cure or improvement of a serious or fatal \nillness.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Would the Senator talk briefly about the number of \nAmericans who are being affected by us not having already passed this \nlegislation, and whatever delay may occur in the debate of this bill?\n  I know the Senator has been involved in this issue for many years \nnow. He has heard all of the HMO horror stories, about what HMOs have \ndone to people around the country. But some of the Americans listening \nto this debate may not be aware, as the Senator is, of how many people \nare affected on a daily basis, on a weekly basis, on an annual basis. \nAs we go forward with the debate on this bill, could the Senator talk \nabout that issue first, and then I have a couple of other questions I \nwould love to ask.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite right about the fact that every day \nwe delay this legislation, thousands of Americans suffer.\n  The California study says that 50,000 Americans a day are suffering \nas a result of delay or treatment. They would not be suffering if this \nlegislation were passed. And 35,000 families are being turned down by \nHMOs today for specialty care that they otherwise would have for their \nchildren, their parents or another loved one.\n  Close to 20,000 are taking alternative medicines and not taking the \nprescription drugs that their doctor says are needed but are not on the \nformulary of the HMO. The HMO only allows patients to take these \nalternative drugs. In many instances, patients take their alternative \ndrugs and have two or three adverse reactions before they will come \nback to the drug that is actually prescribed by the doctors.\n  So every day that goes on, American families are suffering.\n  I might mention to the Senator the point made on this chart. This is \nfrom the Kaiser Family Foundation and the School of Public Health up at \nHarvard, July 1999. Doctors know that congressional delays mean patient \nsuffering. This chart indicates the number of doctors each day seeing \npatients with a serious decline in health from plan abuse. These 14,000 \ncases represent the number of doctors who every day see denied coverage \nof recommended prescription drugs.\n  So 14,000 doctors have said they prescribed prescription drugs and \nthey were denied, 10,000 doctors were denied the diagnostic tests that \nthey believe were necessary in order to make an effective evaluation, \n7,000 doctors claim they were denied the opportunity for specialty \ncare, and 6,000 were denied overnight hospital stays. And 6,000 were \ndenied referrals for mental health or substance abuse. The list goes \non.\n  Those are two very important studies that make a very powerful case \nregarding how American patients are suffering. An additional study from \nthe doctor's point of view came to a virtually identical conclusion--\nthat patients are suffering every day as a result of HMO abuses.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. This information is so important to this discussion. Is \nthe Senator saying that as of the time of this study in 1999, 14,000 \ndoctors a day are being overruled by HMOs when they recommend \nprescription drugs? In other words, a patient comes into the doctor, \nwho has training, experience, and expertise, and the doctor recommends \nthat a patient needs prescription medication, and 14,000 doctors a day \nare being overruled by the HMO? Is that what the Senator's \nunderstanding is?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. That is what is \nhappening regarding prescription drugs, and that includes the tests \nthat are necessary and the specialists that are necessary.\n  The point I want to mention here, as the Senator was inquiring, is \nthe importance of patients' rights to participate in a clinical trial. \nI think this is one of the most important guarantees that should be a \npart of this legislation. Unfortunately, we had a full debate on this 2 \nyears ago in the Senate, and the Senate rejected ensuring patients \naccess to clinical trials.\n  What we agreed to was a 2-year study of whether clinical trials are \neffective. That was under the Frist bill that eventually passed this \nbody.\n  I am wondering whether the Senator would agree with me that we are in \nthe time of doubling appropriations for the NIH budget. We are in the \ncentury of the life sciences. We can't pick up a newspaper any single \nday and not see medical breakthroughs. It is one of the most exciting \ntimes in medical history, with the progress that has been made on the \nhuman genome, the sequencing of genes and the explosion of different \nknowledge that is out there. We are going to see the development of all \nof this knowledge now in the laboratories.\n  I ask whether the Senator would not agree with me that in order to \nget it from the laboratories to the bedside, it has to be tested. It \nhas to have clinical trials. This is a time of enormous potential for \nreducing the kinds of pain and anxiety that disease and illness bring. \nWe can even reduce the demand on resources over a period of time. We \nknow, for example, that if we were to develop some kind of cure for \nAlzheimer's, half the nursing home beds in Massachusetts would be empty \nthis afternoon. Half of them would be empty. And there is important \nprogress. But it isn't going to get out there unless we have the \nclinical trials.\n  Finally, as the Senator understands, insurance companies have over a \nperiod of time continued--when a patient needed the clinical trial--the \nordinary expenses that were attendant to it. The clinical trial would \npick up the additional kinds of expenses. They didn't go to great \nadditional expenses. But even that kind of responsibility is being \nrejected now by the HMOs. The number of clinical trials is going down \nand threatening not only the well-being and security of the people who \nare in those HMOs, but the well-being of the rest of the people in our \nsociety.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Would the Senator address two questions, please.\n  First, the fact that the HMOs are denying and not covering patients \nneeding and having access to clinical trials--would he first talk a \nlittle about, from his experience and from talking to constituents, \nwhat impact that has on the country moving forward in the field of \nmedicine for all of the American people, so we can continue to be the \nworld leader that we have been in the past in advancing medicine in the \nareas such as Alzheimer's?\n  Second, would the Senator talk briefly about the difference between \nthe McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill on access to clinical trials and the \ncompeting Frist bill?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I will. This is enormously important. Let's look \nat what clinical trials have meant in recent times. We have made the \ngreatest progress in addressing the challenges that children face with \ncancer.\n  Listen to this. We have 70 percent of children with cancer treated \nthrough\n\n[[Page S6466]]\n\nclinical trials. This is the area where we have seen dramatic progress \nmade. In the last 10 years, it has been miraculous. There is still a \nlong way to go, but regarding children's cancer, we have made \nprogress. Yet less than 3 percent of adults with cancer are enrolled in \nclinical trials. We have made some progress in the area of the adult \ncancers, but that number is in danger of decline.\n\n  Until recently, the health insurance companies routinely paid for the \ndoctor and hospital costs associated with a clinical trial. In 1998, \nthe CBO found that approximately 90 percent of health insurance \ncompanies reimbursed for their patient costs, but HMOs are quickly \nreversing that lifesaving policy. Many of the HMOs are refusing to \nallow their patients to participate, leaving them with few \nalternatives.\n  I want to give the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Edwards, a quick \nanecdote. One of the important cancer centers is the Lombardi Center, \nnamed after one of the great football coaches, Vince Lombardi. Most \npeople in the Washington area are familiar with that center.\n  Our committee had a hearing at which the director of that center was \npresent. He told us they had to hire more and more people to deal with \nthe insurance companies to persuade the insurance companies to let \nwomen who had breast cancer and other cancers participate in these \nlifesaving trials.\n  That was their big new expense; not trying to treat more people, not \nexpanding the facility, not bringing the benefits of their research and \nbreakthroughs to other people, but to hire more people to tangle with \nthe insurance companies. They had to do this because, for the most \npart, women were being turned down, even though the possibilities for \ntheir recovery were significant.\n  As the Senator knows, under his bill, the McCain-Edwards bill, they \nstill have to meet certain requirements. There has to be the likelihood \nof progress within the clinical trials. There are protocols that have \nbeen established by the FDA and NIH. They have to qualify in these \nareas. There are requirements that have to be met.\n  We must protect vulnerable populations with these diseases, people \nwho have the hope of being freed of the shackles of sickness. These \nprotections are included in the Edwards-McCain bill. The Frist bill \nleaves the door ajar but not very much ajar. It allows HMOs to continue \nto resist applications for clinical trials, resistance that can last as \nlong as 7 or 8 years.\n  As all of us understand, these are timely occasions. Individuals have \nto be enrolled in these clinical trials in a timely way to benefit.\n  When laying these two proposals side by side, one would have to say \nthat under our proposal the guarantee is there, as it has been \nhistorically. And on the other side one would say that there are \nsignificant roadblocks and hazards that are being placed in the way of \nqualified patients to participate in the trials.\n  Madam President, I believe I have consumed most of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \ncorrect. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I look forward to continuing this \ndiscussion during the course of the day. It is important during this \nday to point out exactly what is before the Senate.\n  There are those who favor no HMO bill, and there are those who favor \nan alternative. It is important Members understand exactly the \nprotections that are in the Edwards and McCain legislation, which I \nthink are the types of protections that are in the best interest of the \npatient and are the result of a great deal of review. These protections \nhave the very strong support of the medical profession.\n  We will have that opportunity later in the day. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, we are alternating approximately every 30 \nminutes. It is an opportune time because we have present two of the \nprincipals of the bill that we will be debating over the next several \nweeks. They just addressed many of the points in their plan.\n  There have been two bipartisan--ours is tripartisan--Patients' Bill \nof Rights bills introduced in the Senate, and I think it will be useful \nto contrast the two bills as we go forward to educate our colleagues \nbut also to educate people who may be watching this debate so they may \nunderstand what we are all trying to accomplish, and that is to produce \na strong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights that will benefit \npatients by strengthening the doctor-patient relationship, restoring \ntrust to our health care system and making sure patients really are \nprotected. In many ways, the whole swing has gone too far towards \nmanaged care. That pendulum has to swing back. How far it should swing \nback is a balancing act.\n  Both of these bills attempt to do that and I, of course, believe the \nFrist-Breaux-Jeffords bill does it in a much more balanced way, in a \nway that ensures that patient protections are appropriate and ensures a \nstrong appeals process and legal remedies if the appeals process is \nunsatisfactory.\n  I begin by outlining what our bill attempts to achieve. It goes back \nto the principles that the President of the United States, President \nBush, introduced several months ago. I applaud his leadership and \ncommitment to a strong, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The principles he outlined were, No. 1, patient protections should \napply to all Americans. That is important because, if we have certain \nrights, we want them to apply broadly. However, the breakdown in the \ndiscussion is: Is it the Federal Government that specifically defines \nthe wording that applies to all Americans or do we respect what \nGovernors and State legislatures have already been doing to address \nissues such as prohibiting gag clauses, ensuring access to specialists \nand access to emergency room care, and ensuring access to something my \ncolleagues were just talking about--clinical trials.\n  A lot of States have not addressed clinical trials. If they have not \naddressed it, what should our response be? Does the Federal Government \ncome in and say: You have to address it the way we say or can they \naddress it the way Tennessee might best address it?\n  The President also said patient protection should be comprehensive. \nAgain, there has been a lot of debate in the last 24 hours on \nliability, employers, and a little bit on scope. There are patient \nprotections in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill and in the McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy bill. The protections are similar and all the media are \nsaying they are exactly alike. They are not exactly alike. There are \nsome things in their bill not in our bill. Some areas of their bill go \nfurther than ours. Clinical trials is an example.\n  Clinical trials, as we all know, are critically important, and they \nare in both bills. However, the cost in their bill is higher than in \nour bill because they include thousands of clinical trials that we did \nnot include. Again, we can debate whether that is appropriate or not as \nwe go forward. I will go through those lists of protections shortly.\n  Third, the President said patients should have a rapid medical review \nprocess for denial of care. Both bills do that pretty well. Again, our \nbill has a more efficient process. The timelines are clearly defined.\n  The President's fourth principle is that the review process should \nensure doctors are allowed to make medical decisions and patients \nreceive care in a timely manner.\n  The fifth principle of the President is that Federal remedies should \nbe expanded to hold health plans accountable. This is an issue of real \ndebate. We believe that, since this is a new cause of action, it should \nbe a Federal cause of action and should go principally through Federal \ncourts.\n  However, the bill on the other side, the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, \nlooks at both State court and Federal court and allows patients to go \nback and forth between Federal and State courts. This raises a concern \nwith the issue of forum shopping. Trial lawyers have an incentive to \nmake money with this new Patient's Bill of Rights, and there is the \nfear that there will be shopping among the various courts.\n  The sixth principle of the President is that patient's rights \nlegislation should encourage employers to offer health care. We talked \nabout that yesterday. Everybody has to realize this bill is going to \ncost hundreds of billions\n\n[[Page S6467]]\n\nof dollars in addition to whatever will be paid for health care over \nthe next 10 years. These rights have a cost, a price to pay. That price \nis hundreds of billions of dollars. Whoever is listening will be paying \nit. It may be shared, and we may divide it by 260 million citizens, but \nit will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. That is why we should not \nrush through the bill too quickly without adequate debate on each and \nevery one of the issues. There is an urge to debate it, get it through, \nand pass it in a week or a week and a half. Remember, this will drive \ncosts up markedly, no matter what bill passes, and the higher you drive \nthe cost, the higher the premiums, the higher the number of uninsured \nin this country. We care about the uninsured and have to be careful \nabout how high we drive those costs.\n  Those are the six principles put forth by the President of the United \nStates.\n  Senator Breaux, Senator Jeffords, and I have put together a bill that \nembodies these strong patient protections and fulfills each one of \nthose principles put forth by the President.\n  No. 1, our bill, written in a nonpartisan way, is actually a \ntripartisan bill. It protects all Americans, while giving the \nappropriate deference to States. If a State has already addressed gag \nclauses in the way they think is appropriate, the Governor has signed \noff on it, the State legislature and elected representatives have \nagreed to it, we do not believe that we in the Congress need to mandate \nthat they say almost the exact words that we dictate, which causes them \nto go back and redefine what they have done and bring back an issue \nthey may have addressed.\n  No. 2, we guarantee comprehensive patient protections. We guarantee \nemergency room coverage. We guarantee in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill \naccess to specialty care. We guarantee direct access to OB/GYNs. \nPediatricians can be the primary care physician. We prohibit a \nrestrictive formula for prescription drugs. We ban gag clauses. We \nprohibit provider discrimination. We provide access to clinical trials \ncoverage, and continuity of care--if your care for some reason is \nterminated and you are pregnant, or towards the end of life, these \nissues, it will be continued.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Because I have not had the opportunity to lay out the \nbill, let me lay it out. Senator Breaux is on the floor. We will have \ntime to debate this. I would love to do it, but this is the first time \nwe have had the opportunity to lay out the bill, if that is all right.\n  No. 3, we require health plans to provide consumers with \ncomprehensive information about their new rights. We provide all the \nnew rights, but we need to make sure the consumer, the patient, \nreceives them in a way that they can truly understand. That is \naccomplished in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill.\n  No. 4, we ensure a rapid independent external review. If there is \ndisagreement on the patient protections, you need to go both internally \nand externally and have an independent, unbiased physician make that \nfinal decision.\n\n  No. 5, doctors--not HMOs, not health plans--need to make medical \ndecisions.\n  No. 6, we hold health plans accountable through expanded Federal \nliability. Both bills expand the liability to hold these HMOs \naccountable. Yes, we believe if HMOs create injury or harm, in essence, \nsomething unjust, you should be able to hold them accountable and \nliable, and you should be able to sue your HMO.\n  No. 7, we protect employers from costly, unnecessary litigation. We \ndebated that yesterday and will continue to debate that. We will argue \nthat the bill on the opposite side opens the door to frivolous \nlawsuits. Clearly, we do certain things to try to prevent unnecessary, \nfrivolous, costly lawsuits but at the same time hold the health plans \naccountable and allow the health plans, not the employers, to be sued.\n  No. 8, we protect doctors from new lawsuits. The bill introduced \nThursday, the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, included some improvements \nfrom the version of the bill on the floor until that time. Clearly, as \nan agent of the plan, doctors could be sued. A lot of doctors did not \nrealize that and will look at the new writings and the new bill they \nintroduced Thursday.\n  No. 9, we make litigation the last resort. We go to the court as the \nlast resort. They go to the courts much earlier, as a first resort.\n  No. 10, we protect the role of State courts in holding health plans \naccountable for quality and treatment decisions. We do not preempt \nState court. In Texas, if there is a lawsuit for a quality or treatment \nissue, it can still continue. It is very specifically written in our \nbill. It is for that new cause of action, a product of this \nlegislation, that we take to Federal court.\n  I will turn to the other principles shortly. What are the differences \nbetween these two bills? What I just outlined and in the first column \nof this chart is the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill. In the second column \nis the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill. The first line is protections \napplying to all Americans. Both bills achieve that.\n  Deference to State laws: We achieve it; they do not. They basically \nsay, here are the patient protections. You have to have these on the \nbooks or pass them essentially the way we wrote them.\n  Support State regulation of health insurance: Again, we defer to this \n60-year history of health insurance primarily being the State's \nresponsibility in terms of actual coverage.\n  Comprehensive protections such as emergency room specialists and \nclinical trials: There is a check in both columns. Both do it well.\n  Independent medical review: Both do it well.\n  Independent medical experts making medical decisions: Both do it \npretty well.\n  Avoid slow and costly litigation. We address it. They do not.\n  Holds health plan accountable in Federal court: Yes, we go to Federal \ncourt. They go to Federal court for some contract issues but \nprincipally allow people to go to State court.\n  Protect employers from unnecessary, costly law lawsuits: We will have \ntime to debate that, but we do that; they do not.\n  Reasonable limits on damages: We talked about that yesterday. They do \nnot have those limits.\n\n  President Bush said he will pass our bill as written into law, and he \nwill not pass their bill as written into law.\n  With that, I defer to the Senator from Louisiana to comment. Both \nSenator Breaux and Senator Jeffords are present. I would love to hear \nfrom them over the next 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee for his opening comments outlining what is the essence of the \nFrist-Breaux-Jeffords bill. I point out the obvious; it is the only \ntripartisan bill that has been introduced in this Chamber dealing with \nthis issue. We have had bipartisan bills introduced, and I congratulate \nthe author, but there is only one bill that has the support of \nindependents, Democrats, and Republicans, as well, and that, of course, \nis the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords legislation.\n  I have come to respect all Members engaged in this debate because I \nthink we all have the same goals, and in many cases we all have \napproached the solution to the problem in a very similar fashion--not \nidentical but very close to being almost the same approach.\n  I was struck yesterday by a number of our colleagues who were talking \nabout the Senator from New York, the senior Senator, Mr. Schumer, and I \nthink the junior Senator from New York was engaged in talking about \nindividual patients, children who have suffered damages because of \ndenial of access to care that is medically necessary.\n  I thought the points they made were well taken. I don't have any \ndisagreement with the points made. I have no disagreement that these \ncases should have someplace they can go to ensure the coverage for \nthese individuals, children, elderly, and average citizens, which is \nneeded and determined to be medically necessary. We have come a long \nway. I think this Congress in general is in agreement that patients \nshould have federally guaranteed rights that are enforceable through a \nprocess of internal and external appeals, to get a quick decision that \nis good for the patient and good for society. If those appeals \nprocesses do not work, there should be access to the\n\n[[Page S6468]]\n\ncourts to enforce these rights that all Americans should have under \ntheir health care plans. Indeed, if damage is done, there should be an \nopportunity for patients to recover damages.\n\n  We basically agreed on the rights the Federal Government should \nguarantee. Senator Frist went over those rights. They are very similar \nin both plans. I think theirs probably covers a few more protections \nfor what I would term the providers as opposed to protections for \npatients, which is what we essentially are talking about. But given \nthat, we are very similar in the things we say should be guaranteed to \nAmericans when they have health insurance. OB/GYN access for patients \nis guaranteed. Access to specialists is there. Breast cancer treatment \nplans must be covered. Clinical trials are available. There is \ncontinuity of care and emergency room access. There are no gag rules. \nThere are point-of-service provisions. These are things we have in \ncommon in both plans.\n  Congress has agreed there should be certain patients' rights on which \nthey can depend, that are enforceable, and if they are not provided, \ndamages can be provided to compensate the injured parties. We both \nagree that one methodology of handling the enforcement of these rights \nis through an appeals process, through an internal and external appeals \nprocess.\n  One of the few things, interestingly, that works in the Medicare \nProgram is, when a Medicare patient, a senior, is denied care, there is \nan internal and external appeals process that occurs very quickly. What \nwe try to do is not give patients access to courts but access to health \ncare. The fastest and best way to do it is through an appeals process \ninternally, as we provide in this legislation, which requires the \ncompany that denies the care to review that decision. They have to do \nit in a very short timeframe, a matter of hours. If the patient still \nis denied care, there should be some kind of access to an external \npanel of independent professionals, medical professionals who will take \ncare of looking at it independently of what the HMO did.\n  We have both agreed the external appeal should be independent. The \nquestion is, How do you do that? Both of them I think require--ours \ndoes--that HMOs are responsible for entering into a contract with \nindependent professionals who are in fact going to look at these cases \nand handle the external appeals.\n  I do not know, if you require the HMO to enter into a contract, how \nthey are not going to be involved in helping to select the independent \nreviewers. That is something I think that has to be done. If they are \ngoing to enter into a contract to pay for the people who are going to \ndo the independent review, how can they not be involved in the \nselection? We can talk about that. I think we both agree the external \nreview panel should be totally independent of the HMO. I think both \nsides say the HMO has to pay for them. Then how do you guarantee their \nindependence?\n  We can work on that, but I think we are both in agreement that the \nexternal review people should have no connection to the HMO, although \nwe both require the HMO pay for them. How we handle that I think is \nopen, but I think we both agree they should be totally independent of \nthe HMO, as much as humanly practicable that we can devise a plan that \nwill in fact do that.\n  Another problem you will hear a lot of talk about, that I think will \nbe subject to amendments, is both sides say we don't want the employer \nto be sued if the employer is not involved in medical decisionmaking. \nWe agree with that. I think this side and the other side agree with \nthat premise as well.\n\n  The problem with the approach of the other side, in the sense of how \nthey protect employers, is finding an area that would be protected \nactivities by the employer which would not cause them to be liable for \nany decisions. The concern many employers have is that doesn't prevent \nlitigation against employers, where they would have to come in and \nprove they have not done anything that is wrong. I think employers were \nlegitimately concerned about being sued for things and then they would \nhave to come in and show they were not guilty.\n  Our approach is a little different. I think it is a better approach. \nIt says employers can select a designated decisionmaker who will make \nthe medical decisions, and if they do that, the employer cannot be \nsued. They don't have to come into court and defend themselves for \nsomething they never did in the first place because the designated \ndecisionmaker, which in most cases would be the insurance company, is \nthe entity which should be sued for making the wrong decision. I think \nour approach in that area is a better approach.\n  The final point: We both have a convoluted system with regard to \nwhere you file suit. In their bill you can file for some things in \nFederal court and some things in State court. And guess what. In ours \nyou can sue for some things in State court and some in Federal court. \nWe are amending ERISA. It is a Federal statute creating Federal rights. \nAnytime you litigate under existing ERISA rules, you litigate in \nFederal court. Therefore, if you expand rights under ERISA by amending \nit to include a designated set of Federal rights, the proper forum is \nthe Federal court, not 50 different State forums.\n  I know my good friend from North Carolina suggested lawyers may have \na problem finding a Federal court. That is a slight exaggeration. But \nthere is no lawyer I know of who has any difficulty getting into \nFederal court. They do it on a regular basis very successfully, and I \nam glad they do.\n  So we have suggested if you are going to file litigation after the \nappeals process to enforce Federal rights that are passed by the \nCongress and signed into law by the President, it should be in Federal \ncourt. If you are going to sue on the existing State medical \nmalpractice laws, the proper forum for that to be litigated is in the \nState courts. That is where it traditionally has been. It is a right \nthat exists today in State court. If you are going to sue a company for \nmedical malpractice, a doctor or hospital for medical malpractice, you \nwill continue to do it in State courts as is the current situation.\n  I want to make sure we get something that can become law. If we enact \na bill the President will not sign, we have not given the patients in \nthis country one single benefit. We have given them perhaps a good \npolitical argument, but we have not created any legal rights for them \nto enforce when they need medical help and assurances their rights will \nbe protected. Therefore, what I am trying to do in offering this, along \nwith my two colleagues, is to try to create something that can actually \nbecome law.\n  I tell you, I would not lose sleep if the Kennedy-McCain-Edwards bill \npassed. My concern is not that. My concern is that it cannot become \nlaw. Therefore, as legislators, we want to enact something that can \nactually become law. We have offered a compromise which I think, No. 1, \neven from their perspective, could give at least 95 percent of what \ntheir legislation does in terms of protecting patients. But it gives \n100 percent more of what theirs would do if theirs cannot be signed \ninto law. That is just a bottom line as far as being pragmatic and as \npractical as I possibly can be, to say look, this is something that can \nbecome law. I think it can pass, and I think it will be signed into law \nif it reaches the President's desk. The opposite is true for their \nversion which the President has said time and time again he will not \nsign.\n\n  We can argue whether that is a good decision on his part or not. I am \nsure they think it is the right decision; others would disagree with it \nstrongly. I think we have offered something that can become law that \ndoes address the concerns that have been articulated in the Senate and \nin the other body for a long period of time. It is time to reach an \nagreement that can actually become the law of this land.\n  I yield any time I may have remaining.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I understand we have 7 minutes on our \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I join my colleagues in explaining and \nhopefully alleviating the concerns of Members with respect to the \nquestion of malpractice and lawsuits.\n\n[[Page S6469]]\n\n  I am probably the only one who was here back when ERISA was written. \nERISA was dealing, not with these kind of parties but with pensions. \nBut it was realized that employers need a common place to go to make \nsure, when they have their pension plan, there is just one jurisdiction \nthat can take care of the complications and legal aspects. The decision \nthere was to make it the Federal court to have exclusive jurisdiction.\n  We are still involved, in this case, with employers. Again, it is a \ndifferent issue from pensions, but it is a very important one for \nemployers. From World War II on, because of some special provisions for \ngetting advantages to businesses being able to provide health insurance \nwhich would be nontaxable, it has been quite advantageous for employers \nto provide health care. We do not want to disturb that.\n  In order to not disturb that, we should follow what happened in the \npension area, and that is to make sure there is uniformity of decisions \nacross this country when we get involved with whether or not an \nemployer would be found liable under the circumstances. We want to \ndistinguish that from the malpractice suits with which we are involved \nmost of the time.\n  I guess people get to thinking, as we talk here, that we are talking \nabout the malpractice situation.\n  The malpractice suits because of doctors performing improper care, or \nnurses, or even the overall operation by not giving the proper medical \ncare is one situation. That goes to State courts. If one is only \ntalking reserving for the Federal courts as to whether or not there \nreally was a decisionmaker who was properly put in place, or other \noperations totally outside of the delivery of health care, it is a very \nsmall and narrow area where you are limited to Federal courts. That is \nbecause you have to have uniformity. That is because, if an employer \nhas a business all across this Nation, the employer doesn't have to \nworry about 50 different jurisdictions as far as where the law applies.\n  The same is true for pension plans. One Federal rule should apply in \nthose very rare situations where there is a dispute over how much \ncontrol there is and whether the business had control over the \noperation of the medical side.\n  I want to make sure it is clear. For the ordinary case where there is \na problem of care, all of those will go to State courts. All we are \ntalking about is this very limited area where the jurisdiction will be \nin the Federal court only.\n  I want to straighten that out because I think people are concerned \nabout not being able to go through the court in their hometown where \nthe doctor is practicing. That is absurd. I think it is important we \nunderstand that.\n  The best way to make sure we have good care is to make sure we have a \nclear idea of where these laws are going and how they are handled in \nthe court system.\n  There is really little difference in our bills, if any. I don't \nunderstand what the arguments are with respect to the malpractice \nsituation, as our plan and their plan are very similar in that regard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank Senator Breaux and Senator Jeffords \nfor their outstanding participation in putting together the Frist-\nBreaux-Jeffords Bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights of 2001. This is a \nbill that we have jointly worked on aggressively over the last several \nyears. It is a bill that we regard as a balanced approach to this whole \nissue of patient protections--making sure that patients get the care \nwhen they need it, fixing the system itself, and making sure the \nprotections of the rights are there, but also making sure it is done in \na prospective way; and then, if the system fails, or if it breaks down, \nproviding appropriate access to legal remedies that make the patient \nwhole.\n  That is our approach. It is a balanced approach. I believe that is \nwhy it has been endorsed by the President of the United States. It \nmeets the principles that he has set forth.\n  Many times, as it has been discussed, someone will ask: Well, did any \nother provider groups or physician groups support the Frist-Breaux-\nJeffords bill? The answer is yes.\n  I list the following organizations so people will know that we have \nlistened to the consumers and to the patients as well as the \nproviders: American College of Surgeons; the Society of Thoracic \nSurgeons; American College of Cardiology; American Society of \nAnesthesiologists; American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy; \nAmerican Society of Clinical Pathologists; American Academy of \nDermatology Association; American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons; \nAmerican Association of Neurological Surgeons; American Urological \nAssociation, Inc.; American Association Clinical Pathologists; American \nCollege of Emergency Physicians; American Society of Cataract and \nRefractive Surgery; and the American Physical Therapy Association.\n\n  I point that out only because people will say these are the groups \nthat support each of our bills.\n  I think that is very important. These are the groups to which we have \nbeen able to explain our bill. They have endorsed our particular bill. \nWhat is most important, however, is the policy beneath the legislation \nand the rhetoric that we often hear in this chamber.\n  These groups have looked at our bill, and they agree that it is a \nbalanced bill that keeps the interests of the patient first and \nforemost.\n  I, again, thank Senators Jeffords and Breaux for their tremendous \nwork and for the work of their staffs in putting together our bill as \nwe go forth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next block of time is controlled by the \nmajority.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee, and the Senators \nfrom Louisiana and Vermont for their remarks and for their work on this \nissue.\n  I did not hear all of the groups that the Senator from Tennessee just \nread, but the majority of those groups also support our bill.\n  The bottom line is there is a handful of groups that support both \nbills. Then there are over 600 consumer groups and medical groups, \nincluding the American Medical Association, that support our bill. \nThere is a reason for that, which I will discuss in a few minutes.\n  From the start to the finish of these two bills that were analyzed \nside by side, there are significant differences throughout the bills. \nIn every place there is a difference. In every single place their bill \nsides with the HMOs and our bill sides with the patient and doctors.\n  That is the reason all of these consumer groups, all of these health \ncare groups, and the AMA support our bill and do not support their \nbill.\n  It is not an accident. These are people who have been fighting for \npatient protection and putting health care decisions in the hands of \ndoctors and patients for many years. They believe deeply in this issue. \nThey have looked at these two bills side by side. They understand that \nthere is significant and important differences that aren't abstract. \nThere are differences that affect the lives of thousands and thousands \nof families and patients all over the country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes. I will.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we were just talking about one such \nprotection that I think is of concern to families all over this \ncountry; that is, the clinical trials.\n  As I understand it, just to repeat, our bill has the right to \nparticipate in clinical trials without discrimination. The patient may \nnot be denied the right to participate in an approved clinical trial if \nthey or their physician can show that they can be appropriate \nparticipants in that trial. We have the right to coverage for routine \ncosts associated with clinical trials, and we have the right to \nparticipate in all federally funded or federally approved clinical \ntrials.\n  The other side delays the immediate coverage for routine costs with \nclinical trials, and the bill has a lengthy negotiated rulemaking \nprocess to establish standards for the routine costs that may be \ncovered--a process that may well result in an effective date for \ninsurers as late as January 2007, which adds a 6-year delay.\n  The current Medicare benefit was carefully crafted and fully vetted\n\n[[Page S6470]]\n\nthrough the Federal rulemaking. In addition, the Institute of Medicine \nhas also released a comprehensive study by experts in the field \nrecommending Medicare coverage for routine costs.\n  Furthermore, managed care plans that offer the Medicare+Choice option \nare already required to adhere to the current definition of routine \ncosts. Effectively, we have the clinical trial and the patients \nprotected.\n  In theirs, they don't even follow the Medicare system, which in terms \nof cost as a result clinical trials, would be very much deferred. As I \nunderstand, theirs does not cover the FDA-approved clinical trials. I \ndo not understand that either because it is in the FDA where the \npharmaceutical companies are working through these breakthrough drugs \nwhich offer enormous kinds of promise.\n\n  So, as the Senator knows, it is important to look at the fine print \non these issues in terms of the protections. I just think we have \nworked with our good friends--and they are good friends, Senator Frist \nand Senator Breaux and Senator Jeffords--and we want to try to find \ncommon ground to work on this because the differences between us are \nsmall compared to those who do not want any bill at all. We want to try \nto reduce those differences.\n  It is important to note that it isn't just on the issues of \nliability, of which the Senator from North Carolina spoke, but that he \nhas concern, as do I, about the protections--whether they provide the \nrange of protections he thinks the patients need.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Senator his questions and comments. He is \nexactly right. There is a difference on the issue of clinical trials in \nthe two bills. I think the Senator from Tennessee suggested the same in \nhis remarks. But there are differences throughout the bill, starting \nwith the issue of coverage and how you determine whether States opt out \nor do not opt out of the protections in the bill. There is a difference \nin the access to specialists outside the plan. There are differences \nbetween the two bills. There are differences, as the Senator just \npointed out, in access to clinical trials, and as the Senator from \nTennessee pointed out a few moments ago.\n  There are differences in the independent review process. We \nspecifically say that neither the HMO nor the patient can have any \ncontrol over the body that picks the reviewing panel or the reviewing \npanel.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I will, yes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I am trying to understand the differences between our two \nbills on that particular point. We both say the external review panel \nshould be independent. I think we say that the HMO has to contract with \nthese external review people. I think you have been saying they have to \nhave a contract with an HMO to do the same thing. So what is the \ndifference?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Reclaiming my time, the difference is, we have specific \nlanguage in our bill that says neither the HMO nor the patient can have \nany relationship or any control over who is the group who picks the \nreviewing panel, No. 1, or the reviewing panel itself. Their bill is \nsilent on that specific issue.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. If I could continue, this may be an issue on which, \nworking together, we may be able to resolve our differences. There has \nbeen some discussion----\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. If I could finish, then I will be happy to yield. There \nwas a discussion yesterday in this Senate Chamber about the issue of \nemployer liability. The Senator from Tennessee suggested, a few minutes \nago, he thought the intent of both bills was to protect employers from \nliability. I agree with that. I know that is the intent of our bill. \nAnd I know, from my discussions with the Senator from Tennessee, that \nis the intent of his bill. We have gone about it in different ways.\n  We believe our bill in fact protects employers. We believe our bill \nis totally consistent with the President's principles, to which the \nSenator from Tennessee made reference earlier. The President, in his \nprinciples, specifically said employers should not be subject to \nlawsuits--I don't have the language in front of me, so I am \nparaphrasing--unless they actively engage in making medical decisions.\n\n  That is exactly what we intend our bill to do and we believe our bill \ndoes; that employers are protected from lawsuits unless they in fact \nmake medical decisions.\n  Having said that, this is another issue on which I think we should \ncontinue our discussion because, particularly given the fact that both \nsides want to protect employers from liability and want to protect \nemployers from lawsuits, if there is a better and more effective way to \ndo that, which is also fair to patients, we should explore that. I \nthink that is worthy of further discussion as we go forward.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Back on the point, I am glad we are having this \ndiscussion on trying to narrow the differences.\n  Back to the external review panel, we both agree, if it goes to an \nexternal review panel for a decision of whether something is medically \nnecessary or not, that the people making that decision on this external \nreview panel should be independent of the HMO. But my understanding of \nthe Senator's bill is that the HMO would enter into a contract with \nthese independent reviewers in order to have them review the decision.\n  My question is, Who selects with whom the HMO is going to contract? \nIs it that the HMO has to enter into a contract to pay the external \nreview people, and they have to enter into a contract with somebody? \nWho picks the somebody?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. That is a fair question. Let me respond to the Senator's \nquestion, and then I want to go back to talking about the bill \nspecifically.\n  What our intention is in our bill is to provide an objective third \nparty who chooses who the group is, who contracts and actually selects \nthe review panel, and then chooses the review panel.\n  The Senator will recall, in previous bills that have been talked \nabout and debated in this Senate Chamber, that has been one of the \nmechanisms used so that you do not have the HMO actually involved in \ncontracting either with the group that is choosing the review panel--I \nthink it is important to talk about both because they are both \ninvolved--or the review panel itself.\n  As a practical matter, the HMO is not likely to be choosing the \nactual review panel because much more likely, in real life terms, as \nthe Senator knows, they would contract with a group that would choose \nthe review panel.\n  What we want, and is the whole intention of our bill--and we think \nthis is a very significant difference between the bills--is we do not \nwant the HMOs--other than the fact that the HMO, I think in both bills, \nis responsible for the cost--we do not want the HMOs being able to have \ncontrol either over the group that chooses the review panel or over the \nreview panel itself.\n  I think that is an important distinction between these two bills \nbecause the way this process works, both bills are structured--with the \nexception of this difference that the Senator from Louisiana and I have \njust discussed--exactly the same way to avoid cases going to court.\n  There has been a lot of rhetoric on the opposing side that our bill \nwill stimulate and foster frivolous lawsuits. The truth of the matter \nis, our bill does exactly what their bill does to try to avoid cases \ngoing to court.\n\n  Experience has proven, both in California and in Texas, that when you \nuse that structure, which is that an HMO denies treatment, an HMO \ndenies coverage, the first step is to go to an internal review within \nthe HMO. If that is unsuccessful, the second step is to go to a truly \nindependent third party review. If that is unsuccessful, and if the \npatient in the interim has been injured as a result of the HMO's \nbehavior, then the case can be taken to court--the two States where \nthat process has been used--and I again will say the structure is the \nsame in both bills, the difference being we prohibit the HMO's \ninvolvement in the selection of the independent review process.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. If I can finish, I will be happy to yield. In the two \nplaces\n\n[[Page S6471]]\n\nwhere that system has been used before, which is in California and \nTexas, very few lawsuits have been filed. They are two of the biggest \nStates in the country, some would argue two of the most litigious \nStates in the country. They have a system similar to ours, and actually \nsimilar in structure to theirs. In both cases, what has happened is \nthat the vast majority of the hundreds and hundreds of claims that have \nbeen filed--an HMO denies a claim, the claim then goes to internal-\nexternal review--the vast majority of those cases have been resolved by \nthe appeals process.\n  That is what we mean when we say our bill is structured to avoid \ncases going to court. In fact, in most cases it is in the best \ninterests of the patient to get the care and to get it as quickly as \npossible. That is the reason for the internal review process. That is \nthe reason for the external review process. That is the process we used \nin our bill. It is the process they used in their bill.\n  Unfortunately, in some cases, if an HMO arbitrarily or intentionally \ndenies care to a patient--and we have all heard the stories in this \nChamber--when that occurs, in some cases a child or a family or a \npatient can be injured as a result.\n  If that occurs, then that child or family can take their case to \ncourt. That is what has been done in Texas. That is what has been done \nin California. What we have found is what common sense would tell us, \nwhich is that the system works.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I will.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I am trying to nail down this point on the independent \nreview. I am trying to do this one point at a time because we have so \nmany points out there. It is my understanding both our bills have the \nHMO paying for the independent reviewers. Both of them enter into a \ncontract with people who are going to have an independent review. \nTherefore, in a sense, in both bills the independent reviewer really \nworks for the HMO in the sense that the HMO is going to enter into a \ncontract for their services. The HMO will have to pay for those \nservices. Both bills require that.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. That is correct.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The issue is, this should not be an insurmountable task \nfor us to reach agreement on how we select the people who are going to \ndo it. Somebody has to make the selection. I don't know that you have \nanother creature out there who goes out into the world and says: Pick \nreviewer A versus reviewer B. Somebody has to pick who the independent \nreviewers are. In both bills the HMO pays for them. It is just a \nquestion on how they are selected. Our bill says they should be \nindependent reviewers, and I think there are a lot of companies that do \nthat type of work. The Senator from North Carolina probably knows it \nfar better than I in his practice of law. But there are groups which \nare totally independent that offer their services to do this.\n  Isn't there a way that the two bills can reach agreement on how we \nselect the independent reviewers? The HMOs in both bills are going to \npay for the services. It is just a question of how we select them. I \nwant them to be as independent as they possibly can.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Louisiana. \nFirst of all, he made reference to a creature selecting who the review \npanel is going to be. We don't want that creature to be the HMO.\n  Looking specifically at the language of our bill, I am looking at \npage 54 of the bill, it reads:\n\n       No such selection process under the procedures implemented \n     by the appropriate Secretary may give either the patient or \n     the plan or issuer any ability to determine or influence the \n     selection of a qualified external review entity. . . .\n\n  I have a question for the Senator. My question is, This language \nspecifically prohibits anybody involved in the process from determining \nor influencing the selection of a qualified external review entity; \nwould the Senator agree to this language?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Let me answer that with a question.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator agree to this language?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Let me answer it with a question. Does that language \nprohibit the HMO from paying the salaries of the independent reviewers? \nIs that not influencing the independent reviewers? If the HMO, under \nyour bill, pays for the services of the independent reviewers, is that \nnot influence over their decision?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I just read the Senator exactly what the language says.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I appreciate that. But it says you can't influence the \nindependent reviewer. Under your bill, the HMOs are paying the salaries \nfor the services of the reviewer. Is that not influence?\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. My question to the Senator is, If you say you agree with \nus conceptually about this, and we have specifically said that no such \nselection process implemented by the appropriate Secretary may give \neither the patient or the plan or issuer any ability to determine or \ninfluence the selection of a qualified external review entity, would \nyou agree to that language?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I agree with the principle, but who makes the selection? \nThat is why I used the word ``creature.'' What entity picks the group \nthe HMO has to contract with?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. The Secretary sets up a process by which the selection \nof the independent review panel is done and by which the selection of \nthose people who are eligible for the independent review panel is done. \nThe Secretary is responsible for doing that.\n  My point to the Senator is, his bill doesn't say this. By the way, \nneither the HMO nor the doctor nor the patient can play any role in \nthat process. If the Senator agrees with us on that concept, would he \nagree with the language I just read to him?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I think we may be close to reaching agreement. If we \ncan't solve this problem, we might as well shut down this place; we \nwill never solve any problem. This is a small problem in comparison \nwith other issues we are going to be faced with in conference.\n  Let me ask if the Senator suggests that HHS or the Federal Government \nhas an approved list of independent arbitrators.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. It is actually the Labor Secretary.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The Labor Secretary would have an approved list of \nindependent reviewers and they would publish that approved list and \nallow that there be an approved list of independent reviewers that the \nSecretary of Labor would designate as being independent review people \nor organizations that do that type work. And then somebody has to pick \nfrom among that list. They may have 20 different groups that do that on \nthe list. Then somebody has to enter into a contract with one of those.\n  In both of our bills, it is the HMO that has to enter into the \ncontract. Is it inappropriate to allow the HMO to pick from a selected \napproved list by the DOL?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Reclaiming my time, first of all, I thank the Senator \nfor this discussion. I hope we will be able to continue to talk about \nthis. My concern is that we specifically say and designate that the \nSecretary of Labor shall set up a process by which these people are \nidentified. That process is required by law to not allow any of the \npeople involved in the process, which is only fair, to have any control \nor any influence over who ends up on the panel. We don't set up a \nspecific process. We give the Secretary of Labor the responsibility for \ndoing that.\n  My point, in response to the Senator's question--then I will go back \nto the other issues I need to talk about--is that we deal with this \nissue. He doesn't.\n  I think it is critically important--I am happy to continue working \nwith the Senator--that when you have an independent review, when you \nhave a second appeal after the HMO internally has denied the claim, \nthat whoever is conducting that review and whoever is on that panel not \nhave any connection with the patient, with the doctor, or, probably \nmost importantly, with the HMO. That is the only way we are going to \nget a fair and impartial review panel.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the Senator yield for a final question?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I am trying to resolve this point. It is not \nirresolvable. You suggest that the Department of Labor comes up with an \napproved list of independent external review people. It could be \nseveral groups or several individuals who would be in a selected\n\n[[Page S6472]]\n\ngroup of independent reviewers. When that is done, the next step is \nthat somebody has to pick the one for this particular case that is at \nissue. It is either going to be the HMO that has to enter into the \ncontract or the Department of Labor that is going to have to select the \none that is going to be used in every one of these procedures.\n  It seems to me at that point, if the DOL has selected a group of \nimpartial reviewers, that there is nothing wrong with having the HMO \npick one of them to enter into a contract with because it is from an \napproved list and it has to come from that approved list. Is that bad?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Reclaiming my time, responding specifically to the \nSenator's question, what we actually do--I hate to have to keep \nrepeating this--we deal with this issue. You don't. What we do in this \nbill is we give the Secretary of Labor responsibility for setting up \nthe process. We don't say to the Secretary of Labor: You identify this \ngroup of reviewers or these people who are eligible for the review \npanel. Instead, what we do is give the Secretary of Labor \nresponsibility for setting up the process. But in setting up the \nprocess, the Secretary is required to not allow any of the people \ninvolved to be able to influence who is on the panel and who is \ninvolved.\n  I appreciate very much the Senator's questions. I hope we can \ncontinue to talk about this. It sounds to me as if he is genuinely \nconcerned and interested in trying to resolve the issue. We appreciate \nthat, but at this moment we don't have a specific solution to this \nissue, and we are happy to continue to talk about it. But we believe \nvery strongly--it is the reason we address it in the bill--that the HMO \nand the people involved should have no role; instead, we should have an \nimpartial process. Just like you want an impartial jury, you have an \nimpartial review process.\n  Now, Mr. President, if I can go back to the overall issue of the \nbill, and then I want to talk about a particular patient. First, we do \nwant to make it clear to the American people who are listening to this \ndebate that there is a lot of media coverage that suggests that \naccountability, or taking HMOs to court, is the only major difference \nbetween the bills. There are major differences from start to finish--on \ncoverage, on access to specialists outside the plan, on access to \nclinical trials, as the Senator from Massachusetts suggested a few \nminutes ago, and on a truly independent review so the decision of the \nHMO can be reversed, as the Senator from Louisiana and I discussed.\n  Finally, the issue of accountability. There are two goals in our \nlegislation, and we believe they are met. One is to provide real and \nmeaningful patient protection--to put the law on the side of patients \nand doctors so that the health care decisions are being made by the \nfamilies affected by them and by the people who have the training and \nexperience to make them--the health care providers--and not by some \nbureaucrat sitting behind a desk working for an insurance company.\n  Second is to treat HMOs as everyone else. The problem is that some \npeople would suggest that we should help maintain the existing \nprivileged status of HMOs. HMOs are virtually the only entity in \nAmerica that cannot be held accountable. Their decisions can't be \nreversed; they can't be appealed; and they can't be taken to court. \nWhen they deny coverage, the families are stuck with what they did. We \nwant to simply treat HMOs as every individual American, every small \nbusiness, every large business; they should be treated the same.\n  If my colleagues think differently about that, and if they believe \nHMOs are privileged citizens and they ought to be able to maintain some \nof the privileged status they have today, they will have to make their \ncase. I believe the American people believe that HMOs should be treated \njust like the rest of us.\n  I said earlier that these debates are not abstract and academic; they \nare real. They affect people's lives. I want to tell the story today \nabout a young man named Gary Wemlinger and his wife Jerrie who live in \nmy State, in Kernsville, NC. Gary, unfortunately, was diagnosed with \nkidney cancer some time ago. Specialists at Duke University Cancer \nCenter have told Gary that surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy will \nnot help him. In other words, his life cannot be saved by those \ntreatments.\n  In this photograph are Gary and his wife and his five beautiful \nchildren. What they have told him is the only chance he has for \nrecovery and to be able to spend more time with his family is to have a \nprocedure called a stem cell transplant.\n  Now, what we know medically is that stem cell transplants have saved \nmany lives across this country of patients with cancer. But because \nthis is a fairly new treatment, and particularly for Gary's particular \nkind of cancer, the insurance company has said that it is experimental \nand, therefore, they won't pay for it. They have refused specifically \nto pay for it.\n  As you would expect, the people around Gary--his family, friends, \nneighbors, people in the community--have pitched in and they are \nworking very hard to try to raise the money for Gary to have this stem \ncell transplant that he so desperately needs. They are having a very \nhard time coming up with the amount of money that it would cost. This \nis a perfect example of the effect that the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill \ncan have.\n\n  Under our bill, when Gary needs this stem cell transplant--and his \nmedical doctors at Duke University Cancer Center believe he does--the \ninsurance company not only would be required to give him more serious \nconsideration initially, but once the decision was made not to pay for \nthe care, he would have the right to go to a truly independent medical \nreview board to get that decision reversed. That medical review board, \nmade up of doctors, would consider, among other things, the \nrecommendations of the cancer specialist at Duke University Medical \nCenter who would tell them that the only way Gary's life would be saved \nis through this stem cell transplant. Otherwise, these other \ntraditional therapies--radiation, chemotherapy, and other surgeries--\nwill not save his life.\n  This is a perfect example of a man and his family who would be \ndramatically affected if the law were on his side, on his family's \nside, instead of being on the side of the big HMOs.\n  We can talk about this a lot. There was a quote today in one of the \nnewspaper stories--which we will make reference to later as the debate \ngoes on--from the HMO lobbying group saying that they are prepared to \nspend whatever is necessary to stop the legislation from passing. They \nhave already spent many millions of dollars and they will continue to \nspend millions of dollars, and they have been doing it for years. They \nwant to keep their privileged status.\n  I will tell you who is not spending millions of dollars in this \ndebate. Gary and his family are not spending millions of dollars. They \nhave only us to count on--the people who are in this body and the \npeople down the street on Pennsylvania Avenue. That is who they are \ncounting on, the people they sent to represent them in Washington, DC. \nYou won't see a television ad about this family. You won't see this \nfamily spending millions of dollars. Instead, you will see their \nfriends and neighbors and members of their community trying desperately \nto raise the money that the HMO won't provide.\n  The point is there are clear lines in this debate. While we want very \nmuch to work with our colleagues to find a bill that can pass the \nSenate, pass the House, and will be signed by the President ultimately, \nwe have to make a decision. We have to make a decision about whether we \nstand with the big HMOs or whether we stand with patients such as Gary \nand their families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I understand that the next 30 minutes is \nunder our control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania--he understands \nthe situation. The Senator from Wisconsin needs how much time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. About 6 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Would the Senator yield to the Senator from Wisconsin?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If the Senator will yield, I will withhold our half \nhour and have his time come out of the next half hour on the Democratic \nside.\n\n[[Page S6473]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time of \nthe Senator from Wisconsin be taken from the next 30 minutes after the \n30 minutes on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I certainly thank the Senator from \nTennessee and the Senator from Pennsylvania for the courtesy in \nallowing me to speak at this point.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the importance of passing \na meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights that will provide patients access \nto the health care that they need. A real Patients' Bill of Rights is \nabsolutely vital to protecting the quality of health care for all \nAmericans.\n  I would like to make my colleagues aware of what I have been hearing \nfrom Wisconsinites about the importance of protecting patients' rights. \nAt my listening sessions across Wisconsin, I often hear about the grim \nreality that the American health care system is no longer controlled by \nthose who best understand how to treat patients--our physicians.\n  Instead, managed care companies, primarily HMOs but also other health \ninsurance providers, have become so involved in the business of health \ncare that they control nearly every aspect of health care including \nwhere care is provided, and by whom. Of greatest concern to me is that \nthese managed care organizations can decide whether that health care \ncan be provided at all--they make the key medical decisions.\n  In other words, regardless of whether that care is determined to be \nmedically necessary by the physician who is treating you, managed care \nadministrators can override your doctor's medical decisions and refuse \nto cover the care that you need.\n  How does this happen? Well, managed care companies control costs by \nlimiting supply--screening of the health care providers its enrollees \nare permitted to see, requiring patients to go through insurance \ncompany gatekeepers prior to seeing a specialist, tracking physician \nproactive patterns to ensure that doctors are complying with HMO's \ncost-control efforts.\n  Some HMOs go so far as to impose a gag-rule on doctors, prohibiting \nphysicians in their system from discussing treatment options that the \nHMO administrators deem too expensive.\n  I want to highlight two aspects of this legislation that are \nimportant examples of the need to ensure access to vital medical \ntreatment--access to live-saving prescription drugs and clinical \ntrials.\n  Perhaps nowhere has there been more advancement in medical technology \nthan in prescription drugs. They provide patients with cures to life-\nthreatening diseases, and are vital to restoring a patient back to \nhealth.\n  Unfortunately, some HMOs limit the type and amount of medications to \ncut down on their cost. While I understand that these costs lead to \nsavings in our health care system, we must ensure that patients can get \nthe drugs if they truly need them.\n  I commend Senators McCain, Edwards, and Kennedy for reaching a middle \nground in the tug of war between cost control and access. Congress must \npass legislation that ensures that physicians and pharmacists \nparticipate in the decision making process of who has access to \nprescription drugs. Congress must not forget in this debate that this \ninput is vital for those with allergies to a given medicine. We must \nremember that we are considering a lifesaving measure for those who \nhave found ineffective the prescription drugs that the health plan \nauthorizes.\n\n  Another vital provision of this legislation is that it protects the \nrights of patients who want to participate in lifesaving clinical \ntrials. The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill would ensure that routine \nhealth care costs associated with participation in clinical trials \nwould provide all patients with reasonable access that could \npotentially save their lives.\n  Health insurance and managed care plans must encourage good science \nand help define quality care by reimbursing routine patient care costs \nfor those with life threatening diseases who wish to participate in \napproved clinical trials.\n  Right now only 3 percent of adult cancer patients are enrolled in \nclinical trials and lack of insurance reimbursement is often a major \nobstacle to their participation. We must remedy this problem, and under \nthe McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, Congress can do just that.\n  These patient protections ought to be part of the deal when you \nenroll in health insurance. These are pretty basic concerns, Mr. \nPresident, concerns that I think may get lost in all the political \nrhetoric.\n  When we speak about protecting patients' rights, I want to be clear \nthat we are talking about how to make sure that corporate cost-control \nconcerns don't result in people being denied the care that they need.\n  What we need is some thoughtful, reasoned debate and deliberation of \nthe proposals, not stonewalling and stalemates. I hope that we can work \ntogether to craft bipartisan legislation that makes the difference in \nthe lives of patients across America.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the Senators from Tennessee and \nPennsylvania for their courtesy, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to comment for 1 minute on a \nstatement made earlier on clinical trials to clarify it for people who \nare following the debate. We are going to have the opportunity to \ndebate hopefully each of these patient protections to refine and \nimprove them. Both the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords and the Edwards bill have \nclinical trials addressed as a patient protection, as a right of a \npatient to have access to clinical trials if they are in employer-\nsponsored health care.\n  We do have to be very careful about coverage of clinical trials. What \nwe started with was trying to figure out how many clinical trials are \ngoing on today.\n  Under the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, we include coverage by the \nVeterans' Administration clinical trials, all the clinical trials in \nthe National Institutes of Health, and Department of Defense clinical \ntrials. The issue is on the FDA, and the FDA obviously does wonderful \nclinical trials.\n  One concern we need to address is how many clinical trials is the FDA \ndoing. I was going to ask the Senator from North Carolina earlier how \nmany clinical trials are there in the FDA. Since we are taking people's \nmoney to pay for it, we need to know how much it is going to cost.\n  It is unclear at this juncture, and we need to work together to see \nhow many there are. In fact, we do not know today how many FDA clinical \ntrials are being conducted as part of FDA protocol.\n  We know the Center for Drug Evaluation, at the end of calendar year \n2000, had 11,838. The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research has \n2,869. The Center for Devices and Radiological Health has 1,084. We \nknow there may be some 16,000 clinical trials. Until we understand how \nmany clinical trials, because these clinical trials cost, there is an \nincremental cost to these clinical trials, before we pass a law and say \nlet's cover everything, since we all know adding incremental costs \nultimately translates down to the uninsured, we need to know what these \ncosts are.\n  Until we get a better feel--and I have been working for a long time \ntrying to find out. I know NIH has 4,200 clinical trials extramurally \nand intramurally; 1,800 are cancer-related trials. The Department of \nDefense--we are looking at the number of clinical trials. The VA has \n162 clinical trials, 30 of which are with partners; and 729 extramural \nVA-funded clinical trials, for a total of about 891.\n  I do not know how many FDA clinical trials are out there or what the \ncost actually is. We need to look at that sometime in the debate.\n  I understand we have 30 minutes on our side, and I yield to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania for such time as needed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I \nthank him in particular for his excellent work in this area. He is a \ngreat leader and obviously an authority, somebody who understands the \nissue better than any of us in this Chamber. I appreciate his \nwillingness to be fully engaged and participate in crafting a\n\n[[Page S6474]]\n\nbill that will solve the problems of the health care system today and, \nfrankly, a bill that will be signed by this President and enacted into \nlaw.\n  That is the balancing act which people need to come to this Chamber \nand pay attention to.\n  To start, No. 1, I am certainly for a Patients' Bill of Rights, and I \nhave worked for the past couple of years as a member of the health care \ntask force on our side of the aisle to craft a Patients' Bill of \nRights. I feel very strongly there are protections that need to be \nplaced into Federal law for those people who are covered by plans that \nare regulated by the Federal Government. They do not currently have \npatient protections.\n  When I first got into this now over 3 years ago, the state of play in \nhealth care was a little different than it is today. We had some issues \nthat were hot-button issues. Maybe 4, 5 years ago, the issue of gag \nclauses was a big deal. I think everyone now pretty much agrees--even \nthough there is language in the bills that outlaws them--they are gone; \nthey are not around anymore. Most States, 5 years ago, had not really \ntaken this issue up and gotten involved in the area of patient \nprotections. Since that time, every State in the country has at least \ndebated, and almost all of them have passed, some form of patient \nprotection to cover regulated and sponsored plans of the State. We have \na little different state of play with respect to the landscape of who \nis and who is not protected.\n  Clearly, now the only participants in health insurance in this \ncountry who are not protected with any patient protections are those \nwho come under the ERISA plan, or federally sponsored plans. All the \nothers have some sort of State regulation to take care of their \nconcerns because they are State-regulated products; they are products \napproved and authorized by the State and State insurance commissioners, \nGovernors, and on down.\n  When it comes to the Federal plans, we need to look at and I am \nstrongly in favor of inserting some patient protections for these \nfederally sponsored plans, called ERISA plans. It is over 100 million \npeople. It is not a small amount of people. That is from where we need \nto start.\n  The second thing we need to look at is the differences where we began \nto take this up 3, 4, 5 years ago and where we are today. A few years \nago we thought we had health inflation under control. We were looking \nat rates of growth in health care costs that were slightly above the \nrate of inflation. As a result of some of the dynamics in the private \nhealth care system, we were settling down, and it looked like we had \nreined in costs in health care. We were being rather ambitious about \nhow we can provide patient protections and not worried about the impact \nof costs on the system.\n  That is a little different today. Today we are looking at double-\ndigit increases in health care premiums. I was with an employer \nyesterday who told me his health insurance premiums over the past 2 \nyears have gone up 42 percent. That, according to some other friends of \nmine with whom I have talked in Pennsylvania, is not unusual. Health \ncare costs are skyrocketing again.\n  The question is, What do we do here that impacts this system? I \nalways say with respect to anything we do in Washington, DC, first and \nforemost, is do no harm. We want to do good things. We want to make \nsure the state of play in America with respect to getting health \ninsurance and good quality health insurance is always to enhance that \nability, not detract from it.\n  One of the major concerns I have with the legislation before us today \nis what it will do to increasing costs of health insurance. At a time \nwhen we have 44 million uninsured, I believe that is the No. 1 problem \nin health insurance in America. We can talk about one bill covering 56 \nmillion people and one bill covering 170 million people and one \ncovering 180 million people. None of them covers the 44 million people \nwho do not have insurance.\n  If we want to look at what the real problem is in America, it is the \n44 million people who do not have any health insurance. There is not \none thing in this bill that helps any of those people.\n  The Congressional Budget Office and others looked at this and \ndetermined this legislation will take the 44 million people and turn it \ninto over 45 million people. All it will do is add to their ranks. If \nmisery loves company, this bill helps because it will add to the \nmisery. It will take 44 million people and make them 45 million people \nwith the increased costs in this bill. I would argue, given the \nemployer liability provisions in this bill, that 45 million is just the \nbeginning of the increase in uninsured. We may very well go from 44 \nmillion to 45 million if the employer provisions pass. I don't think \nthese provisions will be signed into law because, thankfully, the \nPresident said he would veto the bill.\n\n  If for some reason the employer liability provision passes, it will \nopen the avenue for lawyers to get in there and sue employers that \nprovide insurance to their employees. No good deed goes unpunished, as \nthey say, so we have employers who go out and provide insurance to \ntheir employees, and we would punish employers for doing that if we in \nthe Senate allow them to be sued simply for providing insurance for \ntheir employees. To me, that is not just going to increase the \nuninsured, as some say who have studied the bill, from 44 million to 45 \nmillion, but from 45 to 88 or 120 or whatever the case may be. We will \nhave massive uninsured. Employers will be crazy, if they are in the \nbusiness of making, say, podiums, to allow themselves to be sued by \nlawyers because they provide health insurance to employees.\n  This is a very serious issue, the issue of access. I hope, and I \nbelieve, there will be amendments offered over the next week or two--\nhowever long we are on the bill--that will do something about access to \ninsurance. If we walk out of this Chamber with our arms raised, saying \nwe have helped patients, and we have done nothing but add to the ranks \nof the uninsured, it is a hollow victory; we have done nothing for the \nNo. 1 problem in health care, not just to the 44 million who do not \nhave insurance, but to all the people who do have insurance and have to \npay higher insurance premiums to pay for the 44 million people who end \nup at the hospital because they don't have insurance and don't get the \nprimary care that they should at the appropriate time.\n  Currently, we take care of hospitals that provide uncompensated care \nfor those without insurance coverage. In my major cities--Philadelphia, \nPittsburgh, Harrisburg--hospitals are financially strapped because of \nthe high number of people who come through the door who don't have \ninsurance and have to be taken care of, and are willingly taken care of \nby the nonprofit hospitals. Again, it is uncompensated. What do they \ndo? They lose money. They cannot pass it all over to the insurance \nbecause the insurance will not pay for it. This is a huge problem. \nThere is nothing in this bill that takes care of this problem except, \nas I said before, if misery loves company, we add more to the uninsured \nas a result of this bill. That is not solving the fundamental problem \nin health insurance.\n  When we offer amendments, I hope we can get bipartisan support for \nsome tax provisions that will increase the number of insured in this \ncountry, that will deal with the No. 1 problem facing America in the \narea of health insurance. That is, frankly, the almost embarrassing \nsituation of having that many people on the uninsured lists.\n  We have a lot of other issues with which I believe we need to deal. \nOne of the things I am hopeful we will offer is an expansion of medical \nsavings accounts. It is a pilot program right now. I would love to see \nthat program expanded to give real choice to people in the private \nhealth insurance system, to give them the opportunity to manage their \nown health insurance needs, to be able to provide for themselves and \ntheir family, and do so in a way that they have maximum choice, maximum \nflexibility. That should be included. Giving people choices, giving \npeople coverage, giving people flexibility--these should be the \nhallmarks of this discussion, not driving up costs and increasing the \nuninsured and having lawyers replace doctors as decisionmakers, No. 1; \nand, No. 2, these lawyers' fees siphon a tremendous amount of money out \nof the health care system.\n\n  There are scarce resources, and this bill is overloaded with rights \nto sue not just HMOs--we can debate that. I am willing to discuss what \nwe can do as far as suing HMOs. However, I am not willing to discuss, \nto be very honest, allowing employers to be sued. What are the \nconsequences of employer liability?\n\n[[Page S6475]]\n\n  Any employer should think about it. Would you allow your business, \nfor which you sweated hard and perhaps built as a family business, or a \nbig corporation, would you allow your corporation to be liable to suit \nsimply because you provided a health benefit to your employees that has \nnothing to do with your business? If you did, my guess is, if you were \na big corporate CEO, you would be fired. No shareholder in their right \nmind would want their company, their investment, to be wiped out by a \ngroup of employees who were unhappy with the health care coverage the \nemployer provided. That is not their business. Their business is making \npodiums or printing paper or generating electricity. It is not \nproviding health care to their employees. So it is one thing to be sued \nfor the products you make or the services you provide. That comes with \nthe business. But you shouldn't be liable for suit for benefits you \nprovide to your employees. If you are liable for suit, you simply must \nget out of the business of providing health insurance to your \nemployees. The impact on the number of uninsured in this country will \nbe profound.\n  I will shortly yield to the Senator from Arkansas, and I am \ninterested to hear what he says. The No. 1 thing to understand in \ndealing with this issue is, first, do no harm. If we look at the \ngreatest problem in the health care system, it is the number of \nuninsured in America. And the greatest harm this legislation will \ncreate is to explode that number. That is not a victory for patients. \nThat is not putting patients first. That is putting lawyers first, \nputting litigation first. It is not putting mothers and fathers and \nchildren who need and want affordable health insurance first. It is not \nputting these people first who are saying they need these procedures. \nTaking insured people who have a problem with their HMO and turning \nthem into uninsured people is not helping them. Taking someone who has \na problem with their insurance company and turning them into someone \nwho is no longer covered is not helping them. That is not putting \npatients first.\n  What we want to do is put patients first, make sure there are \nadequate protections in the law, but not create a system where we will \nsimply destroy the private health insurance system in this country. \nThat is what this bill does. We, hopefully, can fix it. We will have \namendments to fix it. There is a lot in common with these bills, but we \nhave to fix the things that are the most egregious, and hopefully over \nthe next week or two we will be able to do that.\n  Mr. FRIST. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The Senator spelled out frivolous lawsuits, unnecessary costs, \nunnecessary mandates through micromanagement drive up the costs of \npremiums and it falls on the shoulders of the working poor who cannot \nafford the insurance. That is where the uninsured come in. I take it a \nstep further: Frivolous lawsuits increase costs, loss of insurance, the \nuninsured--that translates to less care, a lower quality of care. It is \nnot just the number of uninsured, it is the impact of being uninsured \ntoday. That is something on the floor we will have time to debate over \nthe next several weeks.\n  I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership \non this issue, his expertise and knowledge. We are fortunate, indeed, \nto have someone with his knowledge of this issue as part of our \ninstitution.\n  I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Pennsylvania. \nHe is absolutely right. I served on the conference committee on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights for more than a year. We wrestled with these \nissues. There was broad consensus that we need a Patients' Bill of \nRights. I agree; we need to have a Patients' Bill of Rights. We need to \nhave a set of legislatively codified protections for those who are in \nmanaged care systems in this country.\n  Where we had a problem was in the area of the lawsuits, the \nliability, the right to sue, and how broad should be that right to \nsue. While we have broad consensus in this body and in this country \nthat there should be a Patients' Bill of Rights, there is also a \ngrowing understanding that if we do this wrong in the next few weeks, \nall we will do is move hundreds of thousands, if not indeed millions, \nof people out of the ranks of those who enjoy the protection of health \ninsurance from their employer into the ranks of the uninsured. That is \nthe risk we take and we better do this job right.\n\n  The Kennedy-McCain bill ignores what I believe is the most important \npatient protection of all and that is access to affordable health \ninsurance. They do absolutely nothing to move those 44 million people, \nwho today in this country do not have health insurance, into a \nsituation in which they are covered. This bill does not address that at \nall.\n  While we may agree we need patient protections for those in HMOs, we \nneed to be very careful that in enacting those patient protections we \ndo not even exacerbate the problem of the uninsured in this country. \nThe CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, has found the Kennedy-McCain \nbill would raise health insurance premiums by at least 4.2 percent and \ncause nearly $56 billion in lost wages over 10 years.\n  That 4.2 percent, somebody says that is not much; that is about \ninflation, isn't it? That is on top of the 10-percent to 13-percent \nincrease in health insurance premiums this year, which is the third \nconsecutive year of annual premium increases in that range. In fact, in \nthe year 2000, premiums increased 12.4 percent; in 2001, premiums are \nprojected to increase 12.7 percent; and in 2002, premiums are projected \nto increase 12.5 percent.\n  We are adding on top of that premium increase another 4.2 percent, as \nprojected by the CBO. I think that is a very conservative estimate, \n4.2, so we are making that problem even more severe. The Barents Group \ndata shows for every 1-percent increase in health insurance premiums, \n300,000 Americans will lose their health insurance. What that means is \nthe Kennedy-McCain bill could cause as many as 1.3 million Americans to \nlose their health care, according to the CBO. If the CBO is wrong and \nthey are understating it, as I believe they may well be, instead of 1.3 \nmillion Americans losing their health care, it could go considerably \nhigher.\n  There are 44 million uninsured Americans in our country now. So the \nKennedy-McCain bill does nothing to make health insurance more \naffordable. Instead, it pushes the number of uninsured to even higher \nlevels, from 44 million to 45 million, 46 million, or more.\n  This is the question I pose to my colleagues: What good are patient \nprotections when 45 million people cannot enjoy them? What good will \nthis bill do for the 45 million who do not even have health insurance \ntoday? I will tell you, it does no good at all.\n  Claims that the Kennedy-McCain bill covers all Americans is the \nbiggest hoax being perpetrated in this debate today. This bill does not \ncover all Americans. This bill does absolutely nothing for the millions \nof Americans who cannot afford health insurance. We will do a \ndisservice to this country, a disservice to the health care system in \nthis country if, while addressing patient protections, we do not also \naddress access. I will be offering amendments to that end. I hope my \ncolleagues will be as well.\n  Dealing with the issue of liability, Kennedy-McCain supporters keep \ntelling the American public their bill protects employers from lawsuits \nand that it caps damages at $5 million. Let's be very candid; let's be \nvery honest about this. This cap only applies to punitive damages in \nFederal court. What Kennedy-McCain proponents fail to mention is that \nemployers can be sued for unlimited economic damages in Federal court, \nunlimited noneconomic damages in Federal court, unlimited punitive \ndamages in State court, unlimited economic damages in State court, \nunlimited noneconomic damages in State court, and damages through \nunlimited class action lawsuits under both Federal and State laws. That \nis what, according to the CBO, is the second major component of the \ncost increases that are going to occur to health premiums across this \ncountry.\n\n  I further point out there is really no exhaustion of the appeals \nprocess required. Though the bill says there is,\n\n[[Page S6476]]\n\nthe exceptions swallow up the rule. Kennedy-McCain requires a patient \nto file a request for external review within 100 days after the \ninternal review. Nevertheless, Kennedy-McCain allows a patient--this is \nso important--to go right to court on the 181st day without even having \ngone through the appeals process by claiming that they just discovered \nan injury.\n  It makes sense, then, if you think the insurance company, the HMO, \nhas made a wrong decision and they have been inappropriate in the \ndecision they have made, that you have an expedited internal appeal of \nthat decision. We all agree upon that. It is also logical and \nconsistent, and I think there is a consensus that there should also be \nan option to go to an external appeal, to an independent medical expert \nreviewer to look at the case and make a determination as to who is \nright.\n  If we are really concerned about health care being provided for the \npatient, we should require that the internal and external appeal \nhappen, happen quickly, and those appeals be exhausted before there is \never a right to sue. The goal should not be let's see if we can get to \ncourt to see who can get the dollars. The goal should be to ensure the \npatient is getting the health care they deserve. By allowing a patient \nto simply wait until 180 days have expired and then to simply allege \nthey only now discovered the injury and to go directly to court without \never having gone through an internal appeal, without ever having gone \nthrough an external appeal, is to open the floodgates to lawsuits.\n  Look at the original bill on page 149. You will see that exception is \nclearly there. This loophole allows an employer to be taken to court 5 \nyears, 10 years, 15 years after its health plan denied a claim for a \nbenefit without ever having gone through an external, independent, \nmedical review process.\n  What is the result? The result is that if Kennedy-McCain passes as it \nis now written, we will threaten the very employer-provided health \ninsurance system that has served our country well. Maybe that is the \ngoal. Maybe, instead of patient protections, the real goal in this \nlegislation is to swell the ranks of the uninsured and then come back \nand say: Look at our huge problem. We have to address this again.\n  I hope that is not the goal of those who are pushing this lawsuit-\ngeared so-called Patients' Bill of Rights. Employers will be sued even \nif they are upheld by the independent medical reviewer's determination \nunder the Kennedy-McCain bill.\n  Kennedy-McCain is, in fact, a trial lawyer's dream. It is a trial \nlawyer's bill of rights. New lawsuits under Kennedy-McCain have \nabsolutely nothing to do with ensuring that patients get quick access \nto needed care. According to the Urban Institute, medical malpractice \nclaims take an average of 16 months to file, 25 months to resolve, and \n5 years to receive payment. That is what we are inviting in this bill, \nnot that patients are going to have rights and that patients are going \nto be assured that on an expedited basis they are going to be able to \nget the kind of medical treatment the insurance company has promised. \nThis bill, as it is currently drafted, will ensure the courts are \nclogged with lawsuits and lawsuits for not months but years and years. \nThat is not in the interest of improving health care in this country.\n  You would think, after months and years in court, a patient or the \npatient's family would finally be justly compensated for their injury \nor their loss, right? Wrong. In fact, the tort system returns less than \n50 cents on the dollar to the very people it is designed to help and \nless than 25 cents for actual economic losses. So the real winners in \nthis lawyers' bill of rights will, in fact, be the trial lawyers. The \nlawyers win and the process wins and the patients lose. That is why we \nneed to improve this bill.\n  Madam President, how long do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator has 1 minute 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. It is said over and over again that we have to pass a \nPatients' Bill of Rights because the American people are demanding it. \nI think if you ask the American people, if you ask most Members of \nCongress, are you for a Patients' Bill of Rights, they would \noverwhelmingly say yes. I would say yes. We all believe patients ought \nto have greater patient protections and they ought to be codified. They \nought to be in law. But it does not tell the whole story.\n  A recent survey that was conducted in conjunction with the Harvard \nSchool of Public Health found this. When the question was asked of the \nAmerican people, all voters, Republicans, Democrats and Independents, \ndo you favor a Patients' Bill of Rights, 76 percent said yes. But when \nthey were asked this question, what if you heard that this law would \nraise the cost of health plans and cause some companies to stop \noffering health care plans to their workers, would you still favor a \nPatients' Bill of Rights? Instead of 76 percent, 30 percent say they \nwould favor it under that situation.\n\n  During the last few weeks, it has become increasingly clear to the \nAmerican people that the Kennedy-McCain Patients' Bill of Rights, which \nopens the floodgates to lawsuits, would increase health care premiums \nand cause millions of people to lose their health care insurance, and \nthey do not favor that kind of bill of rights.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from \ntwo of my Arkansas constituents who are employers, telling about the \nthreat this litigation-laden bill poses to their ability to offer \nhealth insurance to their constituents.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            McKee Foods Corp.,\n\n                                   Collegedale, TN, June 14, 2001.\n     Hon. Tim Hutchinson,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchinson: The Senate will soon consider a \n     proposal that will give Americans the right to sue their \n     insurance provider in state and federal court for coverage \n     decisions. As a business owner, this prospect has me worried \n     McKee Foods has voluntarily sponsored its own health plan for \n     more than 30 years. All of our employees and their families \n     have the option to take part in our group coverage, including \n     the 1,420 employees who work at our Gentry, Ark., \n     manufacturing facility. In 2000, McKee Foods and its \n     employees spent $25 million to provide health care benefits \n     for all 6,100 of our employees and their families. The \n     company directly paid for more than 75 percent of this \n     amount.\n       Over the last two years our group insurance benefit costs \n     are up about 26 percent and our prescription drug benefit \n     cost has nearly doubled. The company has absorbed most of the \n     cost increases, but employee premiums have also risen by 10 \n     percent. It's important to note that none of the proposals \n     presently under consideration have protection in place to \n     protect the health care purchaser, whether individual or \n     company, from the increased cost of coverage due to insurer \n     liability. A health care bill containing additional costs \n     will simply compound the problem of rising costs.\n       Our health plan, which is governed by ERISA, is self-\n     insured, self-funded and self-administered. Maintaining an \n     ERISA plan allows McKee Foods to provide uniform health care \n     benefits to our employees in all contiguous 28 states. We've \n     reviewed the various proposals put forth by both the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives and have come to the \n     conclusion that McKee Foods can be sued for voluntarily \n     providing health care benefits. Each of the major bills under \n     consideration contains language that defines the liability \n     trigger as ``direct participation'' or ``discretionary \n     authority'' over the decision. This standard directly \n     implicates ERISA's fiduciary responsibility duty. For \n     employers who offer a health plan governed by ERISA, \n     liability is real.\n       I believe that legislation containing liability for \n     companies will certainly lead to more uninsured Americans. I \n     also believe that many employers want to offer health care \n     benefits because this type of benefit helps us attract and \n     retain high quality employees. Please remember that the \n     voluntary employer-based health care system in our country \n     provides coverage for more than 172 million Americans.\n       I'm asking you to support a health care bill that sets up a \n     strong system for binding external review instead of \n     lawsuits. Let's get patients the medical treatment they need, \n     when they need it. Reaching a conclusion later in a court \n     only benefits the attorneys.\n           Sincerly,\n                                                       Jack McKee,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Springdale, AZ.\n       Dear Arkansas Senators Lincoln and Hutchinson: I am a small \n     business owner in Springdale, AR. Our company employes 8 very \n     fine people.\n       Our company has always made an effort to provide, at no \n     expense to our employees, full family health insurance \n     coverage.\n       A couple of months ago we were forced to begin sharing some \n     of the cost of the health plan with the employees because of \n     40% plus increases. The monthly cost climbed to over $4000.00 \n     a month for our relatively young group. I fear passing the S-\n     238 bill will not\n\n[[Page S6477]]\n\n     only cause greater increases but subject our company to \n     possible legal actions because of our offering health \n     insurance. We could be at the mercy of whoever decides to pay \n     a claim or not--and open the door for the company to be \n     liable.\n       I think the bill has a lot of danger in it. I urge both of \n     our Arkansas Senators to do all in your power to defeat this \n     bill. I urge you to vote against ``cloture'' thus limiting \n     the truth to be brought out on the floor.\n       On behalf of myself, my partner and our employees, thank \n     you in advance for logging this request.\n                                                    John W. Hayes.\n       P.S. Your voting records are the proof of your loyalty to \n     the people of the Great State of Arkansas.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next block of \ntime shall be controlled by the majority party.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I say to my colleague from Arkansas \nthat I think what will become clear to the American people over the \nnext week--I certainly take very seriously the words of the majority \nleader that we will be here as long as it takes to pass this bill--is \nthat this will be a test case of whether or not all Members of the \nSenate will be there for consumers, or whether or not the health \ninsurance industry will be able to stop this legislation.\n  It is that clear.\n  There is an unprecedented lobbying effort going on right now and a \ntremendous amount of money is being spent with a full court press to \nblock this legislation.\n  I have no doubt that we will have amendments on the floor over the \nnext week or week and a half which will be an effort to gut this bill \nthrough amendments.\n  But I think that people in the country will have a very clear sense \nof whether or not we are on their side.\n  I say to each and every one of my colleagues that I am absolutely \nconvinced from a lot of coffee shop discussions with people in \nMinnesota that people do not give a darn about the labels left, right, \nor center. They do not care about any of it. Politics for people is \nmuch more personal. Consumers and the people we represent are saying we \nwant to have some protection.\n  Let me give you some examples. I will not use the real names of \npeople to make this more anonymous. I will never forget a woman coming \nup to me and saying to me at a farm gathering in Minnesota: I want you \nto come over and meet my husband, Joe. Remember--you met him about 6 \nmonths earlier. The doctor said he only had 2 months to live. But my \nJoe is a fighter.\n  He had cancer.\n  I would like for you to come over and say hello.\n  He was not yet in a wheelchair. But later he was because he was \nweakened by this struggle with cancer. He has now passed away.\n  She said to me: I want you to meet Joe.\n  I went over, and we talked.\n  Then she said: Can we talk away from him?\n  We go away so he can't hear.\n  She said: It is a nightmare. Every day I am on the phone with the \nmanaged care company trying to find out what they will cover. Every day \nit is a struggle to get the coverage for my husband for the treatment \nhe needs as he struggles with this illness.\n  No American family with a loved one who needs that care should have \nto be fighting it out with the insurance companies or managed care \nplans to get the care their loved one deserves.\n  That is what this piece of legislation is about that was introduced \nby Senators McCain, Kennedy, and Edwards with many of us supporting it. \nThat is what this is about, pure and simple.\n  This is the most important consumer protection legislation we will \nvote on this year as Senators.\n  My colleague from Arkansas said: What about the 44 million people who \nhave no insurance? I invite the Senator from Arkansas and other \nSenators to please join on a piece of legislation I have called Health \nSecurity for All Americans.\n  I am for universal coverage. I haven't heard a lot of my Republican \ncolleagues talking about the importance of comprehensive health care \nreform, universal coverage, affordable and dignified human coverage for \nall. I hear them talking in opposition to this piece of legislation.\n\n  Why don't we first pass this consumer protection legislation? Then we \nwill move on and we can talk about universal coverage.\n  I remember a gathering in Minnesota--there are so many stories like \nthis. There was a meeting that I had convened where we had some of the \nmanaged care plans there to meet with some of the parents. I do a lot \nof work in the mental health area.\n  I can hardly wait to have hearings in the Health Committee and have a \nbill on the floor doing what Senator Domenici calls the Mental Health \nEquitable Treatment Act to end the discrimination of coverage for \npeople struggling with mental illness.\n  At this gathering, a lot of the parents wanted to meet with the \nmanaged care companies. One mother said: My daughter is struggling with \ndepression. We have asked you and asked you for coverage, and you said \nthat it wasn't medically necessary for her to get the help she needed, \nto see the psychiatrist that she needed to see. My daughter took her \nlife.\n  Look. I can't say that she took her life because she didn't get a \nchance to see this particular psychiatrist. But I can tell you this: \nThere was an article in the Minnesota Star Tribune last Sunday about \nthe costs the State of Minnesota had to pick up because the health \nplans did not provide the coverage for people that the doctors said \nneeded to get mental health coverage.\n  What the patients and their families heard was: You need to see the \npsychiatrist. You need to be in the hospital for this many days. You \nneed to have outpatient treatment. Instead, they were denied the \ncoverage by their HMOs. Finally, the State just picked up the coverage.\n  It happens all the time.\n  A nurse in Minnesota told our state office about a woman who suffered \nwith stomach pains; she saw her doctor who did some tests and then \nsuggested further tests, that were more expensive for which she should \nget HMO's approval. The HMO denied the additional tests. Since the \ndoctor recommended the tests, you would think that a patient might have \nsome recourse to the HMO's denial of coverage. Instead, the woman \nendured a series of phone calls with HMO employees, being forwarded \nfrom one customer service representative to another, being put on hold \nfor 35 minutes and ultimately being referred to a 50-page benefits \nmanual with no change in the HMO's denial of these recommended tests. \nNo one at the company ever instructed the patient how to file an \nappeal. She ultimately gave up and paid for the tests herself.\n  It goes on and on. There is too much gatekeeping, and too much \nbottom-line medicine. The bottom line has become the only line. There \nare too many people and their loved ones who can't get the care they \nneed or the care for their children when they need a pediatrician or to \nget to the emergency room to have it covered when they need to be at \nthe emergency room or to get their parents and their grandparents the \ncoverage they need, to get the child the coverage she or he needs for \nmental health coverage.\n  It goes on and on. Too many people go without the care they deserve. \nToo many doctors and nurses are not able to provide the kind of humane \nand dignified care they thought they would be able to provide when they \nwere in nursing school or medical school.\n  What do we do? We say that we are going to have basic patient \nprotection coverage for every citizen no matter what State he or she \nlives in, no matter what company he or she works for. That is the first \npart.\n  What is the second thing that we say? We say if your plan denies you \nthe coverage, then you have a right as a consumer to appeal the \ndecision and go to an independent appeals board or through an \nindependent appeals process--not an appeals process within the managed \ncare company which is the competing proposal. That is crazy. People in \nthe country know it.\n  And to assist people in dealing with their insurance companies and \nHMOs I will be offering an amendment with Senator Reed of Rhode Island \nthat will have an ombudsman program set up in every State that provides \noutreach and\n\n[[Page S6478]]\n\nassistance when they have trouble getting the care they need or filing \nthe appeal they are entitled to. This would be an important addition to \nthis legislation.\n  If you have headaches, severe headaches, and you go see your doctor, \nand you are told by your doctor that you need an MRI, and then the \nmanaged care plan says, no, it is not medically necessary, and then \nyou, because you did not have that MRI, later find out you have a \nmalignant brain tumor, and you die because of that--or this happens to \nsomeone in your family who dies because of that--you better believe \nthat these companies can be taken to court. They should not have any \nspecial protection any different from any doctor or hospital or any \nother business.\n  If you are denied the coverage on the basis that it is not medically \nnecessary, of course people can go to State court, which is where it \nshould be. And then we abide by the laws of our States: the laws of \nMinnesota or the laws of Illinois or whatever state the patient lives \nin. It is simple.\n  This is all about whether or not we are finally going to pass \nlegislation that provides consumers, provides patients, provides \nfamilies, provides children the protection they deserve, the protection \nthey need. That is what this legislation is all about.\n  I think I introduced a bill in 1994, and then I know Senator Kennedy \nintroduced a bill a couple years later, and many people have introduced \nbills; and we have been going through the debate now for 7 years. The \ntime has come. It is real simple.\n  I conclude on this note: I really believe, more than anything else, \nthe way people judge us is not if we are Democrat or Republican, not if \nwe are liberal or conservative, not if we are right, left or center. \nNone of those labels mean very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The question is simple. Do you, the Senator from the \nState of Washington or the Senator from the State of Illinois or the \nSenator from the State of Minnesota know us? Do you care about us? Do \nyou understand us? Are you on our side?\n  That is what this legislation is all about. This is an important \ntime. Let's step up to the plate and vote to be on the side of families \nin our States, consumers in our States, and provide them with this \nprotection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time remains on the Democratic \nside on this debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes nineteen seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise in support of this bill that has been brought \nto this Senate Chamber by Senator Kennedy, who was here just a moment \nago; Senator John Edwards, Democrat from North Carolina; and Senator \nJohn McCain, Republican from Arizona, who have made this a bipartisan \neffort.\n  I think if you listened to the history that Senator Wellstone of \nMinnesota just recounted, you know this issue has been before the \nSenate and the Congress for many years. We now have an opportunity, \nbecause of the change in the leadership in the Senate a few weeks ago, \nfor this issue, which was buried in committee, to now be on the floor \nof the Senate--an issue with which 80 percent of the American people \nagree is finally before us for debate, for amendment, for a final vote.\n  I applaud our majority leader, Senator Tom Daschle. He has said to \nthose who want to drag their feet and stop us from this debate and \namendment, the party is over. We are going to stay in session in the \nSenate until we pass this bill.\n  You will hear moans and groans from my colleagues in the Senate who \nhave taken the Fourth of July recess period and have made plans. Some \nwere political plans, some were personal and family plans, but they had \na lot of plans. I have to confess I did, too. But I believe the \nSenators elected to this body were not elected to march in parades on \nthe Fourth of July. We were elected to march to the floor of the Senate \nto pass legislation that will make life better for families across \nAmerica.\n  So if it means that we have to stay in session on the Fourth of July, \nand take a recess for a few minutes to look out the window at the \nfireworks on The Mall, so be it. Let's get our job done. Let's stay and \ndo it. This issue is worth it.\n  This issue, this Patients' Bill of Rights, will establish, for the \nfirst time nationwide, a standard of protection for American families \nwhen they go to their doctor or a hospital for medical care.\n  How important is it? Let me tell you a story. In Joliet, IL, I sat \ndown for lunch with a doctor. He said: Let me tell you what happened to \nme, Senator. A mother came into my office with her little boy. The boy \nwas about 5 or 6 years old. He had been complaining to his mom about \nheadaches. I asked his mother how long these headaches had gone on. She \nsaid for over 3 weeks.\n  The doctor said to the mother: Is it on one side of his head or the \nother or what?\n  She said: It is always on the same side of his head. He complains \nthat it hurts on this side of his head.\n  The doctor said to me he instantly knew that the appropriate medical \nresponse was to take an MRI to determine whether or not that little boy \nhad a brain tumor: 3 weeks, headaches, a little boy complaining, same \nside of his head. But before he said that to the mother, before he made \nthat recommendation, he asked her a question: Do you have health \ninsurance?\n  She said: Yes.\n  The doctor asked: What is the name of your company?\n  She gave him the name. He excused himself from the office, went into \nanother office, called the insurance company, described exactly what \nhappened, and said: I am ordering an MRI.\n  The insurance company said: No.\n  He said: What am I supposed to do?\n  The insurance company said: Send the mother home. See if he gets \nbetter.\n  The doctor walked back into the office and said to the mother: I'm \nsorry but at this point in time I think the best thing for you to do is \nto go home and call me in a week or two if he is still complaining \nabout it.\n  That is just one little episode in Joliet, IL, involving a doctor, a \nwoman, and her child. That mother left that office not knowing who had \nmade the medical decision. It was not the doctor she came to see; it \nwas a faceless clerk at an insurance company hundreds of miles away.\n  When doctors ask these clerks what qualifications they have to make a \nmedical judgment, do you know what they find out? These insurance \ncompany clerks are not nurses; they are certainly not doctors; many \ntimes they have high school diplomas and a manual in front of them \nwhere they can look up: Oh, I see, 3 weeks of headaches, one side of \nyour head, 5-year-old child. No, it takes 4 weeks. Send him home.\n  That is what this has come down to. That is what this debate is \nabout. It isn't about all the technicalities and complexities that a \nlot of us bring to this Chamber. It is a question about whether doctors \ncan practice medicine, whether mothers and fathers can walk into a \ndoctor's office and rely on the health care professional to make the \njudgment. That is what it is all about.\n  The health insurance industry, the HMOs, are the ones that oppose \nthis bill. They are the only ones that oppose this bill. Every health \ncare group, every consumer protection group, supports the bipartisan \nbill being offered on the Democratic side--every single one. The only \nopposition comes from one group, the health insurance companies. Why? \nThey make more money. It is more profitable. They do not want us eating \ninto their profit margin to provide greater and better care for \nAmerican families. It is just that simple.\n\n  The two bills before us are dramatically different. Here are some of \nthe differences shown on this chart. When you take a look at the two \nbills, this, on the left of this chart, represents the Bipartisan \nPatient Protection Act, and this side represents the Frist-Breaux bill, \nwhich is supported by the health insurance industry.\n  Take a look at the differences between them as to what kind of \nprotections are provided under the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\n  Our bipartisan bill protects all patients with private insurance. The \nbill being offered on the Republican side and by the industry, sadly, \nleaves many people behind. It says: If you can make an effort at \nprotecting patients, good enough. We say, no; it has to be real \nprotection.\n  Protection for patient advocacy: 100 percent on our side; none on \ntheir side.\n  Prohibition of improper financial incentives: Do you know what that \nmeans? Do you know there are at HMOs some doctors who get paid more if \nthey do not provide treatment for patients? At the end of the year, \nthey total it up and say: Dr. So and So, let's see, because you didn't \norder as many MRIs as we thought you would, you get a bonus check at \nthe end of the year.\n  Did you know it is a fact that that is going on? There are financial \nincentives for doctors not to prescribe drugs, not to use treatments, \nnot to hospitalize people. And if they do not do it, they get \ncompensation. Our bill prohibits that. The health insurance industry \nbill--surprise, surprise--thinks that is just fine.\n  The ability to hold plans accountable: Our bill makes it clear they \nare going to be held accountable. I will get into that in a moment.\n  Independent external appeals: When the health insurance company says, \nno, we won't cover what the doctor recommends--whether it is a \nprescription or a treatment--it does not give you a lot of comfort to \nknow you can go hire a lawyer and go to court and 5 years later get a \nverdict. You need to have an appeals process right now. Some of these \nare life-and-death decisions.\n  We want to make sure the appeals process isn't stacked against you. \nWe do not want the health insurance company to be the judge and the \njury. The bill supported by the industry leaves the health insurance \ncompany to make the final judgement. We believe it should be an \nindependent external appeal process, one that is timely.\n  Guaranteed access to specialists: Our bill has it; theirs takes a nod \nin that direction.\n  Access to clinical trials: Do you know what that is? Let's say you \nhave a rare serious disease and there is a clinical trial underway.\n  The doctor says to you: There is one possibility, Mrs. Jones. It is a \nclinical trial. I would like to see if you qualify for it.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. FRIST. The Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill you are referring to as \n``the health industry bill,'' endorsement of their bill, can you name \none insurance company or one HMO that has endorsed the Frist-Breaux-\nJeffords bill?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The health insurance industry--and the Senator knows \nthis--objects to, opposes the bipartisan bill which I support. They \nwould gladly accept your alternative because it is much more preferable \nto them because it is more profitable to them. That is as obvious as \nthis debate is. I think that is the difference between us.\n  We stand here supported by nurses and doctors and medical \nprofessionals, hospital associations across America. The health \ninsurance companies are our No. 1 opposition. They support your \nlegislation. They don't support ours.\n  Mr. FRIST. But is the Senator aware that there is not one HMO, to the \nbest of the sponsors' knowledge, that has endorsed our bill, or \ninsurance company, and is the Senator aware that over 362,000 \nphysicians from 70 different organizations have endorsed the Frist-\nBreaux-Jeffords bill?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sure the Senator's figures are accurate. I wouldn't \nquestion them. But the Senator knows, if you are going to total up the \nmedical profession, where they come down on which bill, you don't have \na chance, my friend. They are all on this side of the aisle. They \nsupport the real patients' protection bill. Finding 300,000 doctors who \nagree with one thing or the other, congratulations.\n  I can tell you, when you look at the American Medical Association, \nthe American Nurses Association, the American Hospital Association, \nthey are all on this side of the aisle I think that is very clear.\n  As you go through here, access to doctor-prescribed drugs, if a \ndoctor says this is the drug you should have, this is what you need to \nget well, the health insurance company takes a look at the list and \nsays, sorry, that drug is not on our list; you can't prescribe it.\n  Wait a minute. If that is the drug that you need, that is what you \nneed. That isn't a decision of an insurance company; that is a decision \nof a doctor. Doctors go to medical school. Insurance company clerks go \nto business school maybe. They shouldn't be making medical decisions.\n  The choice of provider, point of service, emergency room access--our \nbill provides that protection start to finish.\n  Let me ask, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to address, in the closing time, this whole \nquestion of liability. In America, if you go out and do something \nwrong, if you are negligent, guilty of wrongdoing, we have a system of \naccountability. If you drink too much at a party, get involved in an \naccident and get sued, you are held accountable, right? If your \nbusiness does something that it isn't supposed to do, that is illegal \nor wrong, you are held accountable, correct? If someone comes to your \nhome, slips and falls, they may sue you; you will be held accountable \nas to whether or not you are negligent. That is part of the system of \naccountability in a country of laws.\n  There are two groups that are above the law in America. The one group \nabove the law is diplomats. You have heard about it: The people who \ncome to Washington from a foreign country to work in an embassy get \ninvolved in a traffic accident, catch the first plane back to their \nhome country, and we can't touch them. Why? Treaties. We have said, for \ndiplomats, you are above the law. I don't like it. I have seen some \nterrible things happen. But that is a fact.\n\n  There is another group above the law--the health insurance companies. \nWe talked earlier about doctors coming up with suggested treatments and \nhealth insurance companies saying no. Under the law today, the only \nliability the health insurance company has for making the wrong \ndecision, not covering you when they are supposed to, is the cost of \nthe treatment, not the result of failing to treat. What is the \ndifference? The difference is the cost of the surgery as opposed to the \nfact that you might have a permanent disability because you didn't get \nthe surgery.\n  So we say that health insurance companies are above the law in \nAmerica. They are squealing like stuck pigs because they know that if \nthis bill passes, they will be brought into court as every other \nbusiness in America and held accountable.\n  I don't want to see a runup in court cases and litigation. That \ndoesn't solve the problems of a person who needs medical care right \nnow.\n  I can tell you this: Once those health insurance companies know that \n12 average Americans can sit in a box and listen to a judge and the \nattorneys and stand in judgment over their actions, they will think \ntwice before they make these terrible decisions that deny people the \nbasic medical care doctors think they deserve.\n  There has also been the argument made: If you allow us to sue the \nhealth insurance companies, you will allow us to sue the employer who \nbuys the health insurance plan. Not so. This is a phony argument. This \nbill very clearly says that an employer that buys the health insurance \nplan and doesn't make the medical decision, doesn't say yes to the \nprescription or no to the treatment, is not liable. The bill is \nexplicit.\n  Let me read the section from the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill:\n\n       [This provision] does not authorize any cause of action \n     against an employer . . . or against an employee of such an \n     employer . . . acting within the scope of employment . . . \n     unless there was direct participation of the employer in the \n     decision of the plan.\n\n  When could an employer be brought to court for health insurance \nproblems? I will give you one case--I think it is obvious--a case where \nan employer collects the health insurance premiums from the employee \nand doesn't pay them to the health insurance company. The employee and \nhis family think they are covered. They are not. They go to a hospital. \nThey say: We belong to XYZ health insurance plan. They say: Your \nemployer never sent in the money you contributed.\n  Should they be held liable? You bet. That is an employer guilty of \nwrongdoing. But if the health insurance plan\n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\nreceives the money for the premiums and makes the wrong medical \ndecision, the employer is not going to be held accountable.\n  That is a question that has been raised over and over by the other \nside, and it doesn't make any sense at all.\n  Do you know who can be sued in America? Incidentally, almost \neverybody is accountable in court under current law--the Red Cross, the \nHumane Society, the United Way, every other charitable foundation but \nnot your HMO. And when you go to sue because of medical malpractice, \nyou can sue your doctor, your nurse, your dentist, your hospital, but \nnot the HMO that decided you weren't going to get the treatment. When \nit comes right down to it, every Fortune 500 company, every family-\nowned corporation, every small business is subject to lawsuit in \nAmerica, subject to accountability, but not your HMO.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We need to keep in mind, as we consider this bill, that \naccountability is part of the system of justice. HMOs should be held \naccountable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next 30 minutes \nare under the control of the minority party.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, we continue discussion this afternoon on \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. Most of the morning we have spent \ndiscussing the differences between two bills, the only two \ncomprehensive bills that have been introduced to the Senate. One is the \nKennedy-Edwards-McCain bill introduced by the majority. The other is a \nbill introduced by me, the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill. Two Patients' \nBills of Rights that address the issue of how to get patient \nprotections to the patients in order to swing the pendulum away from \nhaving medical decisions made by HMOs and turn that decisionmaking back \nto the doctor and the patient and the nurse, that local level where we \nknow health care decisions are best made.\n  Several differences have been pointed out. Many of those focus on the \nimpact on the employer, whether or not the employer can be sued. Under \nthe Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, it is clearly delineated to make sure \nthat everyone knows whether it is the insurance company or the employer \nor the lawyer or the courts that accept that risk. Somebody does have \nto have that risk and that liability, and it has to be defined, which \nwe do.\n  The problem in the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill is the liability is \nkind of shifted around a little bit. You can go after the HMOs if they \nhave wronged or injured a patient. And they need to be held \naccountable; we agree with that. But the problem is, you can sue the \nHMO, you can sue other agents of the plan. That is really the key \nlanguage in there. Who are the agents of the plan?\n  Last week a physician stood up and said: I am an agent of the plan. \nSo they introduced a different bill last Thursday to say it can't be \nthe treating physician. I asked about the referring physician. Can you \nnow sue the referring physician as an agent of the plan?\n  Their bill also allows you to sue the employer. Remember, there are \n170 million people today--just about everybody listening to me, whether \nit is through radio or television or on the floor--who receive their \ninsurance through their employer, if not Medicare or Medicaid--170 \nmillion people.\n  Their employer is arranging for them to have that insurance. If you \nare an employer out there and all of a sudden you can be sued, what are \nyou going to do? Say your margin is 2 or 3 percent, you are a small \nbusiness, you are barely scraping by, and all of a sudden there is a \nlawsuit. Lawsuits can be billions of dollars under that plan. All of a \nsudden, yesterday you were not subjected to them and today you are.\n  When that is the case, what are you going to do? Your first reaction \nis going to be: How much is it going to cost me? What does it mean to \nme? Maybe I should not offer this insurance. Maybe I should give my \nemployees some money and let them go into the market themselves in \norder to avoid that. In the short term, that might be OK. I don't think \nit is OK, but it might be OK.\n  Ultimately, a number of those employees--and it falls most heavily on \nthe working poor. The premiums go up, and they will not be able to \nafford this insurance; they become a part of the uninsured. As the \nSenator from Pennsylvania said earlier, once you become part of the \nuninsured, with the increased cost and frivolous lawsuits, you can't \nafford your insurance anymore; your employer is afraid of being sued. \nThe premiums go sky high.\n  As the Senator from Pennsylvania said, if you have no insurance, the \nlikelihood of getting good health care in the United States is much \nless. Therefore, this bill has a huge impact on everybody listening to \nthis debate today. Everybody is going to be affected. The health care \ncosts for everybody are going to go up.\n  Under the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, it is going to go up 45 \npercent more--the premiums--than it goes up under the Frist-Breaux-\nJeffords bill. Yes, in our bill it goes up because we are giving new \nrights that haven't existed and those rights cost money. The money \ncomes out of the pockets of everybody listening to me right now--\neverybody--170 million people. We are talking about employer-sponsored \ninsurance for 170 million people. It is going to impact everybody \nlistening.\n  So when we talk about the cost, it is easy for politicians to show \npictures of families and talk about the individuals; but we have to \ntalk about the costs because those pictures can be pretty and you can \nreally personalize it and make it real, but at the end of the day, if \nyou drive the cost of insurance out of the reach of that family, you \nare hurting that family, or that individual. Therefore, you are going \nto hear us come back again and again and talk about the uninsured, the \nworking poor who are going to lose their insurance, about the cost of \npremiums which are going to go up significantly.\n  Everybody's premiums, right now, are already going up. Probably they \nwill go up 15 percent this year. Whatever you are paying this year, it \nwill go up another 15 percent regardless of what we do on the floor. We \nare saying that under this bill, which may pass 2 weeks from now, 3 \nweeks from now, a month from now--and I want to pass this bill--your \npremiums, instead of going up 15 percent, are going to go up 20 percent \nif the McCain bill passes.\n  Therefore, we are going to again and again say you need to justify \nthat increase in cost for these new rights. We will argue that you \nshould have better balance if you are going to drive these premiums up \nwith frivolous lawsuits--get rid of the lawsuits and have the same \npatient protections and have a lower cost. That means a lower cost of \npremiums, and it means fewer people going into the ranks of the \nuninsured.\n  That is why balance is critically important in this debate as we go \nforward. That is why looking at the rhetoric without looking at what is \nin the bill underneath is unacceptable, because if what is written in \nthat bill ultimately becomes law, that law results in--I am sure it is \ngoing to be translated into increased costs. How much depends on the \ninterpretation of what is written in the bill.\n  Can employers be sued or not? I say again and again that they can be \nsued. We have heard from the other side of the aisle that under the \nEdwards-Kennedy-McCain bill, they cannot be sued. Yet, if you read the \nbill, it says they can be sued.\n  Well, I started talking to the employers about lawsuits. I had the \npleasure of being with a number of middle-sized and small business \npeople yesterday. They were very clear in their concerns that if we \npass a bill that exposes them to not million-dollar lawsuits but \nbillion-dollar lawsuits, under the bill on the other side of the aisle, \nthe Democratic-sponsored bill, there will be open-ended lawsuits, \nunpredictable lawsuits, when they are barely scraping by, these small \nbusinesses. And they are saying now their company is going to be \nexposed to billions of dollars in lawsuits. And they might just have a \ncouple of convenience stores. They can't keep offering that insurance \nto their employees.\n  The Republicans are also accused of talking dollars and cost. We do \nnot do a very good job of translating it down to human faces, and that \nis something with which we have to do better. When we talk about \nemployers, people say: You are just for big business. It is not\n\n[[Page S6481]]\n\njust big business. It is the small mom-and-pop operations, such as \nthose convenience store operators.\n  Yesterday, I had an opportunity to meet with Sam Turner, an owner-\noperator of Calfee Company in Dalton, GA, with 139 convenience stores. \nHis words were loud and clear. He is not going to be able to offer the \ninsurance today if he is exposed to unlimited, unpredictable lawsuits \nas the owner of his convenience stores. Paul Braun from Braun Milk \nHauling Company employs 40 to 50 people in a town of about 500. The \nsame story. Lynn Martins, president and general manager of Seibel's \nFamily Restaurant in Burtonsville, MD, a second-generation \nrestaurateur, said, ``If you expose me to unlimited lawsuits, or if you \nincrease my premiums another 4 or 5 percent, I simply can't afford to \nkeep offering this health insurance for my employees.''\n  If it is not offered through your employer, yes, maybe your employee \ncan go out to an individual market and get some health insurance. But \nfor the most part, they won't do that. That is why we come back to this \nrule of thumb that is pretty accepted. It is accepted by everybody, in \nessence, that if you increase health insurance premiums by 1 percent--\nit doesn't sounds like much; it might be a hamburger once a month, or \nMcDonald's--I have forgotten the examples, but if you increase it 1 \npercent, and when you are talking about 170 million people, what does \nthat 1 percent in premium translate to? It means 300,000 people will \nlose their insurance. They have their insurance one day, and when we \npass a bill that increases it 1 percent, 300,000 people won't have \ninsurance the next day.\n  Who are those 300,000 people? Those 300,000 people are the ones who, \nwhen you increase it by 1 percent, are all of a sudden making the \ntradeoff between having food that night or having clothes for their \nkids. They are the working poor, the people who are barely scraping by, \nwho, with the help of their employer, voluntarily comes forward--and, \nremember, this is all voluntary. This employer-sponsored insurance is \nvoluntary, and therefore if you raise those prices too high, they are \ngoing to walk away from the table and leave their employees, \nunfortunately--in spite of good intentions--to go into the ranks of the \nuninsured.\n\n  How much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes, 25 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield whatever time the Senator from Utah desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I venture into this debate with a \nlittle hesitancy because I don't have the expertise that the Senator \nfrom Tennessee and others have in this field. But I want to confine my \ncomments to my experience as an employer.\n  As those who have listened to me know, I come to the Senate from a \nbusiness background and consider myself a businessman rather than a \npolitician. I have the experience of being an employer dealing with \nhealth care. It is that experience I would like to share with the \nSenate today.\n  I will open by asking unanimous consent that a letter I received \ntoday be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. BENNETT. This letter is from Ron Christensen, who is the vice \npresident of a construction company in a relatively small town in Utah, \nand the key points of the letter are those which have been made over \nand over again during this debate. That is, Mr. Christensen tells us \nthat if the Kennedy-McCain bill passes, he will be forced to stop \nproviding health care for his employees.\n  A lot of people listen to this threat, and they say businesses are \nhard-hearted, businesses are just looking for ways to punish their \nemployees, that businessmen and businesswomen are always motivated by \ngreed, and here is an opportunity for them to save money, they will \ntake the opportunity to save money whenever they get the excuse.\n  Having run a business, I can assure you that is clearly not true. \nWhen you run a business, you compete for employees, and you do \neverything you can to get the best ones to come to work for you. You \ncreate salary packages and benefit packages that are better than those \nat the business down the street so that someone will come to work for \nyou and be loyal to you and help you build your business. You don't \nview your employees as people to be exploited. You view your employees \nas a major asset. If you don't have that view, frankly, you won't be in \nbusiness very long.\n  So why is this person, who feels this way about his employees and who \nin his letter describes an excellent health care plan that he offers to \nhis employees, saying that if this bill passes, he will withdraw health \nbenefits and thereby run the risk of losing employees who are so vital \nand important to his success?\n  The reason, of course, is fear of lawsuits. He says:\n\n       If this legislation becomes law, the only way to protect my \n     company from lawsuits will be to drop health care benefits \n     altogether, and we will do this. I simply cannot afford to \n     expose our company to the potential liability from health \n     care lawsuits. Even if employers could be shielded from \n     liability, more lawsuits against health care plans will \n     result in higher premiums I pay for health care.\n\n  I know how true Mr. Christensen's statement is. It is one thing for \nan employer to say, I have a defined amount of money that I have to \nspend on health care plans; I am willing to pay that; indeed, I have to \npay that if I am going to attract and hold good employees. It is \nanother thing to say, I am putting the entire future of the enterprise \nat risk by exposing it to lawsuits. I cannot take that risk, so I will \nsay, even though it is going to jeopardize my business by diminishing \nmy ability to attract and hold quality employees, I have to do it \nbecause the alternative is so Draconian that I simply cannot escape it.\n  That is the real world. It is not the world we live in back here in \nWashington. That is not the kind of discussion we have here, but it is \nthe real world, and we should understand that as we make our decisions.\n  I remember during a similar discussion over lawsuits with respect to \nfalling stock prices that eventually resulted in the passage of \nsecurities legislation that put out of business some of the striped-\nsuit law firms, that Ralph Nader appearing before the Senate Banking \nCommittee kept pressing the point that lawsuits were always good. He \nsaid, Nobody ever settled a lawsuit out of court unless he had \nsomething to hide.\n  I remember that very clearly because Mr. Nader made that statement in \nresponse to me and some of the comments I was making.\n  I pointed out to him that while I was the CEO of the company I headed \nprior to coming to the Senate, I settled a lawsuit out of court, and I \nnot only had nothing to hide, I felt strongly I was in the right. So \nwhy did I settle the lawsuit? Quite simply because I had to save the \ncompany.\n  The legal fees of prosecuting that lawsuit at that point in the \ncompany's history were sufficiently high as to jeopardize the survival \nof the firm. So I swallowed hard the issue of whether or not we were in \nthe right and decided to save the company by settling the suit out of \ncourt without proving the point.\n  I have been there. I know how a lawsuit can threaten the survival of \na firm.\n  How significant is this in terms of decreasing health care coverage \nfor people? A study has been done that says for every 1-percent \nincrease in premium rates, 300,000 Americans lose their health \ncoverage. That is an interesting number when you realize the Kennedy-\nMcCain bill would increase rates, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, by 4.2 percent. Do the math: 300,000 lose their health coverage \nevery time it goes up 1 percent. You multiply that by 4.2 and you get \n1.26 million more uninsured.\n  I think that is a low figure, because if you take the evidence coming \nfrom the employer whose letter I cited and spread it out over the rest \nof the country, we find out that, in addition to those who will lose \ntheir coverage because the premium goes up, there are those who will \nlose their coverage regardless of where the premium is simply because \nof the fear of the lawsuits.\n\n  Some cynics have suggested that maybe that is the reason behind the \npush for the Kennedy-McCain bill.\n\n[[Page S6482]]\n\n They want people to lose their coverage so the pool of uninsured \nAmericans will grow so large that there will then be demand for a \nGovernment health care plan, which is what Senator Kennedy has told us \nhe prefers all along.\n  I would not ascribe those kinds of motives to Senator Kennedy. I \nthink instead he is simply acting out of unfamiliarity with the way \nbusinesses are really run in America.\n  I want to make it clear that the comments being made by employers \naround the country that passage of the Kennedy-McCain bill will result \nin the loss of health care benefits for millions of Americans are not \npolitical hyperbole. They are simply statements of fact based on the \nexperience of men and women who are building businesses, employing \nAmericans, moving forward to keep the economy growing, but who are \nterrified, I think accurately and properly, of the prospect of a wild \nincrease in the number of lawsuits that might come.\n  We are told some States have already done this and the lawsuits have \nnot gone up; so, therefore, that proves we will not have lawsuits on a \nnational basis. I am not sure we can make that determination and, once \nagain, the State laws are not exactly comparable to this law, and they \nare not subject to the kind of examination that has been given this law \nby those who are looking at it through the glasses of realism.\n  The other thing we hear around here often is: Forget the lawsuit \nside, the doctors are for this bill, the American Medical Association \nhas endorsed this bill. That is true; the American Medical Association \nhas endorsed the Kennedy-McCain bill and is very active in their \nstatements in favor of it. Normally, that would be something that would \nimpress me, but I share with you, Madam President, and the other \nMembers of the Senate, an experience I had in my office today.\n  I received a phone call from a doctor in Utah whom I have known for \nmany years. He said, I am here at the meeting of the American Medical \nAssociation, and they are whipping us all up to call our Senators in \nsupport of the Kennedy-McCain bill. And so I am doing what I have been \nasked; I am calling my Senator with respect to the Kennedy-McCain bill \nso I can report back to the American Medical Association that I have \ndone what I was told to do. As long as I have you on the phone, let me \ntell you what I really think. I am opposed to the Kennedy-McCain bill. \nI think it is a mistake. I much prefer the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill. \nI think it would work far better for the medical profession in Utah and \nthe patients I deal with in Utah, and, Senator, I trust you to do the \nright thing.\n  The American Medical Association succeeded in their lobbying efforts \nto get a hometown doctor to call me, but they probably were not pleased \nwith what the hometown doctor said. Based on his experience, based on \nhis understanding of where things are, he recommends we defeat Kennedy-\nMcCain and go in the direction of the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill.\n  The fact is, of course, we do not know in advance what will be all of \nthe consequences of the legislation we pass. The one thing I have \nlearned around here is that whatever other laws we pass, the one law we \npass over and over is the law of unintended consequences. We do not \nknow what the unintended consequences will be from either of these \nbills, but I have learned as a result of discovering the impact of the \nlaw of unintended consequences that the impression to go slow, the \ndesire to be careful, the desire to move in incremental steps rather \nthan a sweeping bold approach that we love to call for when we are \nrunning for reelection, is the right desire.\n  That is another reason why we should try the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords \nbill, which goes further than many of my colleagues on this side of the \naisle would like to go toward a Patients' Bill of Rights. Let's see how \nit works before we take the next step, which could have catastrophic \nconsequences.\n  I say catastrophic consequences because I am talking about the \ncancellation of health care for many Americans. I am talking about the \nrising disillusionment with the whole activity of what we do with \nrespect to health care on the part of many Americans and then \nultimately a demagogic call for the Government to take everything over, \nand we are back into the disaster, the train wreck we went through in \nthe 103d Congress when President Clinton tried to implement that kind \nof solution. It tied up this body for months. It stopped everything. It \nproduced maximum ill will all the way around. We stepped back from \nthat. We took the approach I am talking about, which is to say let's do \nit a step at a time, let's do it with something we can get our arms \naround where the unintended consequences will be less radical and less \nsweeping. We passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which I was happy to \ncosponsor and support, and then we began to see some of the reforms \nthat we could have had earlier if we had stayed away from the extremes \nproposed to us.\n\n  We see reforms in the Patients' Bill of Rights area, reforms that can \nwork. We see things that will give us experience, that will hold down \nthe severity of the unintended consequences, if we go in the direction \nof the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, but I fear if we go in the other \ndirection we will only see the consequence that is predicted in this \nletter that will follow my remarks, where employer after employer will \nsay, Sorry, we can't expose ourselves to this liability. And in the \nname of trying to help health care, we may end up destroying it \naltogether. That is, in my view, a serious mistake.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                           Christensen & Griffith,\n\n\n                                         Construction Company,\n\n                                        Tooele, UT, June 19, 2001.\n     Senator Robert Bennett,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington DC,\n       Dear Senator Bennett: I suspect I am ``preaching to the \n     choir'' by sending this letter to you, but I want you to know \n     I am strongly opposed to the Patients' Bill of Rights bill \n     sponsored by Sens. Kennedy and McCain under consideration by \n     the Senate. There are better ways to correct the few problems \n     that get so much attention.\n       My company prides itself on providing quality health care \n     for our valued employees and their families. We provide a \n     comprehensive plan which includes dental and have never had a \n     complaint that could not be corrected. We are partially self \n     insured and pay the total premium. No cost to the employee. \n     Why mess with a good thing? The present system has kept costs \n     in check and affordable. The politically motivated Kennedy-\n     McCain bill will only drive up the cost of health insurance \n     and encourage employers to pass more responsibility for \n     health care to the employee.\n       Unfortunately, the Kennedy-McCain bill threatens my ability \n     to provide health care for my employees. However well-\n     intentioned, this bill would expose employers like me to \n     lawsuits between employees and the health care plan my \n     company provides. Despite claims that this bill has a lawsuit \n     ``exemption'' for employers, this protection is murky, at \n     best, and does not adequately protect employers from \n     lawsuits. In fact my company could be sued for simply having \n     selected a health care plan for employees.\n       If this legislation becomes law, the only way to protect my \n     company from lawsuits will be to drop health care benefits \n     altogether, and we will do this. I simply cannot afford to \n     expose our company to the potential liability from health \n     care lawsuits. Even if employers could be shielded from \n     liability, more lawsuits against health care plans will \n     result in higher premiums I pay for health care. A survey of \n     construction companies last year found that 77% were faced \n     with increased health insurance premiums, even without the \n     potential added cost of this legislation. In order to stay in \n     business more and more of the cost will have to be passed on \n     to the employee. As an alternative, employees should be given \n     access to a quick, independent external review process that \n     would give patients the right to take their disputes to an \n     independent panel for a quick decision.\n       Employers are not bad people exploiting their employees as \n     the unions would have us believe. Were it not for employers \n     with a profit motive our economic system would not work. \n     Please oppose this Kennedy-McCain expansion of liability as \n     you consider managed care reform legislation. Don't destroy a \n     system that has served us well and made health care \n     affordable. Thank you for your consideration of my views.\n           Yours Truly,\n                                                 R.I. Christensen,\n                                                   Vice President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, when this debate began yesterday on \nreform of the managed care system in America by establishing a \nPatients' Bill of Rights, it did so under very uncertain and \nunfortunate circumstances. There was objection to proceeding to the \nbill, causing delay and unnecessary\n\n[[Page S6483]]\n\nconfusion with the American people as to whether we intended to deal \nwith this problem. We can all be pleased the Republican minority now \nhas withdrawn its objections. We can now, tomorrow, begin the serious \nwork of actually debating a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  This is a moment that has been 5 years in the making. Before the \nSenate is honest, compromised, and reasonable legislation to establish \na Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a question that involves our most \nbasic responsibilities to the American people to assure their health \nand welfare.\n  We all recognize how we arrived at this moment. The Senate may be \nlate, but it is right in dealing with this question.\n  The extraordinary increase in the cost of health care in the 1970s \nand 1980s radically increased the ranks of the uninsured in America. By \nestablishing a predetermined list of medical providers at established \ncosts with recognized services, it was everybody's hope that these \nmanaged care plans could strike a balance between the rights of \nconsumers and providers with reasonably agreed upon costs.\n  It was a sound concept, but practice has established that the power \ndisproportionately came to rest with insurance companies and the \ndoctors and that patients lost control over their professional rights \nor the needs of their families.\n  During these years that the Federal Government has been unable to \ndeal with this crisis, the ranks of the uninsured have continued to \nrise to 45 million people despite managed care. The growth of health \ncare costs rose less slowly but has continued to rise, and a feeling of \nparalysis began to grip the country as doctors no longer believed they \ncould make medical decisions and families could no longer get access to \nthe health care providers that had been a part of the American \ntradition of family medical practice.\n  While the Federal Government was paralyzed, interestingly, States \nbegan to fashion their own responses. In 1997, my own State of New \nJersey enacted the Health Care Quality Act--in some respects a model \nfor what the Federal Government is challenged to accomplish. That law \nin New Jersey prohibited gag clauses. Doctors had the right, the \nrecognized responsibility, to talk to their patients about medical \noptions. An independent health care appeals program was established so, \nwhen care was denied by the insurance company, people had someone to go \nto, to appeal the judgment. There was a requirement that insurers \nprovide clear information on their services and their limitations.\n\n  Interestingly, in 1997 when that act was passed by the State \nlegislature in New Jersey, it was by a Republican legislature and \nsigned by a Republican Governor, something that should be a challenge \nto Members of the Senate in the minority party today. But this Senate \nis now challenged to act because, while that State legislation was \nproperly designed, it was insufficient, not only insufficient in that \nit was not national in scope but because for many people in my State \nand across the country in other States, people with similar experiences \nwere exempted by ERISA laws.\n  Mr. President, 124 million Americans, 83 percent of those who get \ntheir health care from their employer, are not covered by State laws \nbecause of this exemption. Fifty percent of the people in the State of \nNew Jersey enrolled in HMOs are exempted from the very State \nprotections that I just outlined and that my State government wanted \nand intended to give to our people because of this exemption under the \nEmployee Retirement Security Act of 1974.\n  Under this bill, HMOs claimed immunity from State regulations even if \nthere was negligent behavior. It may or may not have ever been the \nintention of this Congress to exempt managed care in health care, but \nwhether that was our intention or not, that is how the law is \noperating. So despite the best actions of State government, millions of \nAmericans--124 million Americans--have no protection from the abuses of \nthe managed care system. That is why the responsibility now rests here \nand why this Senate is the only hope of the American people to get \nrelief from this abuse of power.\n  The American people understand what needs to happen. Only people in \nthis institution seem to doubt it. A recent survey in my own State of \nNew Jersey by Rutgers University found that one in four people in my \nState are completely dissatisfied with their health care plan, despite \nthe fact they are paying for it and are enrolled in it and cannot get \nout of it because their employers have contracted for it. Last October \na State report found that patients in my State were not only \ndissatisfied, but they are more dissatisfied than they were a year ago. \nThe situation is deteriorating.\n  The legislation now before this Senate, offered by Senators Kennedy, \nEdwards, and McCain, is an answer. It is not simply bipartisan. That \nunderstates what has been achieved. But 500 organizations of patients \nand doctors stand behind this legislation to get patient protection to \nall Americans in HMOs. The confrontation that went on for decades \nbetween patients' rights advocates and doctors has not only ended but \nthey have come together in a broad national coalition for this \nlegislation. We have not only achieved what once seemed unlikely, the \nbill represents what once seemed impossible. This is achieved because \nspecific rights would now be guaranteed to the American people.\n  To many Americans whose children suffer with diseases, whose lives \nare threatened, this Patients' Bill of Rights, to them, in their \nsuffering or their financial distress, is just as important as the \noriginal document which bears the title a ``Bill of Rights.'' The title \nis borrowed for this health care emergency because to them this has \nevery bit as much significance.\n\n  What are these rights? One is the right to get to a specialist. Under \ncurrent law in managed care, you can take a family member to your \nfamily doctor, but the cancer or the heart problem, the specialized \ndisease or ailment that may plague you and threaten your life, is \nbeyond the capacity of that family doctor. That is not the exception; \nthat is often the rule. With this bill, you will have the right by law \nto get to a specialist who can save your life.\n  No. 2 is the right to get to an emergency room. In a nation in which \nwe travel the country every day all across our States, all across our \nNation, what kind of system is it, if you have health care insurance \nand you should be in a car accident or have an illness traveling \nsomewhere in your State or across America and the local emergency room \nis not in your health care plan? Under this bill, that emergency room \nwill give you coverage, whether they are in the plan or not, because \nyou are there and that is where your illness or your accident happens \nto be.\n  No. 3 is the right of women to use an OB/GYN as their primary health \ncare provider. Millions of women have made the medical decision to use \ntheir OB/GYN as their principal health care provider. It makes no sense \nthat they have to first go to a family doctor, a general practitioner, \nfor a reference. This establishes that right.\n  No. 4, as with every other patient, the right of a child to get to a \nspecialist should never be impaired. A child should be able to get to a \npediatric oncologist or heart specialist as a matter of right, \ndirectly, without delay, without question, if that is the only person \nwho can deal with their illness and that is established.\n  No. 5, it is unconscionable that, by contract, any doctor should be \nrestricted from discussing with any patient their health care options--\nthe technology, the specialist, the choices that the genius of American \ntechnology in medicine has made available. But that is not a \ntheoretical problem, it is something that doctors are facing in America \nevery day, a contractual wall placed between a doctor's knowledge and a \npatient's need. This bill tears down that wall. No doctor in any \nmanaged care plan will ever be told again: In spite of what you know, \nin spite of what you think is in your patient's best interest, you \ncannot tell them the choices available. Now they will know as a matter \nof right.\n  No. 6 is the right to a review. If a doctor is prescribing a test or \na procedure and believes it is vital to a patient and that is denied, \nthat manager of a health care plan, that businessman, is not the last \nword. There is a right of appeal to a health care specialist, \nindependently placed to oversee the managed care plan, so not only is a \ndoctor making the recommendation but a doctor is the final, independent \nword.\n\n[[Page S6484]]\n\n  Finally, the right of accountability. I once heard Bill Clinton say \nthere were only two classes of people in this country by right who are \nimmune from accountability by the legal procedures: Foreign diplomats \nby treaty and HMO bureaucrats. One of those will be taken away by this \nbill.\n  Can you imagine what an American automobile would be like if auto \ncompanies did not have the threat of lawsuits if their cars were not \nsafe? We would still be manufacturing clothing in America that was \nflammable. We might still be living in houses that had carcinogens in \nthem. I guarantee, our cars, our trains, our airplanes would not be as \nsafe. The threat of liability, the knowledge that the courts will hold \na company accountable if they do not do whatever is required to be \nsafe, is a great protection for the American people. We have extended \nit to every other industry in America except to managed health care \nplans. This bill will change that. There will be access to court. There \nwill be damages.\n  There will be an expense if managed care health care plans are not \nensuring that the right decisions are made, that the law is followed \nand people are as safe as possible. It is the right judgment.\n  There are those who are going to come to this floor in the coming \ndays and argue: Oh, that may all be true, that may all be right, but if \nyou give these rights to the American people, those 124 million \nAmericans in managed care who are not getting these rights, the costs \nwill rise so high that the number of uninsured will grow and the \nproblem will become worse and not better.\n  It would be a sound argument but for the facts. The CBO has estimated \nthat if this legislation is put in place, the average cost per employee \nwill be $1 per month. That is a lot of protection for millions of \nAmericans at a very modest cost. The CBO continues that, over 10 years, \nit is estimated premiums would rise by 4.2 percent. That is a lot of \nprotection for a lot of years for very little cost.\n  But what of the argument that even these modest costs would throw \nmore people into the ranks of the uninsured? The experience has been \njust the opposite.\n  In 2000, when health insurance premiums increased by 10 percent, more \nthan twice the amount estimated would happen under this bill, the \nnumber of uninsured not only didn't rise but the number of uninsured \ndropped.\n  There is no reason to believe--and the empirical evidence suggests \noverwhelmingly--that we will not cause a rise in the uninsured. We will \nsimply cause better insurance by passing this bill.\n  This is good legislation. This goes to our most fundamental \nresponsibility to the American people. If this Congress and if this \nSenate does nothing else in this session, if nothing else is \naccomplished, we can reach the lives of millions of Americans who live \nin fear every day that during the night a child will get ill, a parent \nwill contract a disease, or someone in a family will suffer, and in \nspite of the fact that family members get up every morning, work every \nday and pay their health care premiums, when they need their insurance \nit will not be there for them.\n  It is not a theoretical fear; it is real. We can do something about \nit. It is reflected in this bill. If we are ever going to stand with \nthe American people, stand with them now. If we are ever going to do \nsomething to change their lives, do it with this bill.\n  I am proud to be associated with it. I am more than a little proud \nthat the first legislation brought to this floor by a new Democratic \nmajority in the Senate and by our majority leader, Tom Daschle, is a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. That speaks volumes about the Democratic \ncaucus in this Senate. It says everything you need to know about Tom \nDaschle, and it says a lot about why there is still a great chance to \nbe proud of this Senate and this session of this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, I want to thank my colleague, the senior Senator from New \nJersey, for his passionate commitment to affordable access to health \ncare and patients and families, and I appreciate being on the floor \nwith him today. We appreciate his leadership.\n  I come to the floor again to speak about this critical issue of \npassing a Patients' Bill of Rights for the families of our country. One \nof the reasons that I came to the Senate in January was because of this \nissue and what it means to the families I represent.\n  The very first opportunity and honor that I had to speak on the floor \nof the Senate was to speak about the importance of passing a Patients' \nBill of Rights. I am very pleased and thankful and grateful to our new \nmajority leader for his understanding of the priority of this \nlegislation and the fact that he would indicate that under his \nleadership the first bill to come to this floor would be the bill to \nguarantee that those who pay for insurance, who have health insurance, \nand the businesses that pay for insurance for their employees will know \nthat, in fact, care will be given when there is an illness or an \nemergency.\n  Yesterday, I spoke about young Jessica and her situation as a young \nperson under an HMO. Today, I want to share another story.\n  This comes from a letter that I received as a House Member 2 years \nago. I shared it on the House floor during the debate at that time. \nThis came from Susan and Sam Yamin. It was a very important letter \nabout the tragedy that befell their family and their fight with an HMO \nto get emergency care.\n\n  Sam Yamin owned his own business. He worked hard. He owned a tree-\ntrimming business. He was working on the job every day to support his \nfamily. He and Susan were working hard. One day on the job he had an \naccident with a chain saw that caused him to fall back and cut his leg \ndown to the bone. This is in Birmingham, MI, a business owner who had \nan accident. He was rushed to the nearest emergency room where he was \nprepared immediately for surgery to repair the nerve damage.\n  The doctors took him in, had him ready, and prepared to have surgery. \nThey called the HMO which said: He is at the wrong emergency room. You \ncan't proceed to save the nerve in this man's leg. You have to tell \nthis man that he has to go across town in metro Detroit to another \nemergency room in order to be able to be served.\n  With much distress, as you can imagine, his wife, Susan, packed him \nup, and drove him over to another emergency room where he waited, on a \ngurney, in the emergency room, for 9 hours. He didn't see a doctor \nuntil he finally literally tore a pay phone off the wall; he was in \nsuch pain; and he was crying out for help.\n  His ordeal continued when orthopedics began making decisions based on \nthe HMO point system for the approved hospital doctors. If a patient \nhas an unsuccessful operation or an expensive procedure, the doctor is \ngiven 5 to 10 points under this system. But if the doctor is able to \nprovide a low-cost, quick fix, the point range is 0 to 4. They receive \ncompensation based on how low the points are in this process of looking \nat payment.\n  Unfortunately, not only was he trapped by having to move to another \nemergency room, but this point system which rewards the low-cost fix \nput him in a situation where he didn't get surgery. He didn't have \nsurgeons who came to his rescue to fix the nerve in his leg. They just \nsimply sewed up the leg. Now Sam Yamin has permanent nerve damage that \nis spreading up his spine. He lost his business. His health care costs \nhave escalated and have become a serious burden to his family. After \nmany appeals, the HMO finally agreed to refer Sam to what they \nconsidered to be an adequate specialist, a podiatrist, a foot doctor. I \ncertainly respect podiatrists, but that is not what this gentleman \nneeds for the disability and the permanent nerve damage in his leg.\n  Finally, even when they made a referral, it was not to the \nappropriate specialist.\n  Sam Yamin is one example of somebody who worked hard, had his own \nbusiness, cared for his family, played by the rules, and had insurance. \nHe thought his family was covered. He goes to the emergency room, and \nhe is told that he cannot get the help that he needs.\n  That is what this is about. That is what this Patients' Bill of \nRights is about. It is about saying to those families who have health \ninsurance for\n\n[[Page S6485]]\n\ntheir family members that if you are in an emergency, you can go to the \nnearest emergency room and get care. If you need a specialist, you can \nhave the right to a specialist. If you need a test or a treatment, you \ncan have that, and the doctor or the nurse can make the medical \ndecision and not be overruled because of nonmedical reasons because it \nis just too expensive to give you the specialist that you need or the \ntest or the procedure.\n  We really have a choice in front of us this week and next week as we \ndebate the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is time to choose. Are we going \nto stand up for Susan and Sam Yamin and their family in Birmingham, MI? \nAre we going to stand up for the doctors and the nurses and the \ndentists and the therapists and all those who come into the health care \nprofession to be able to treat patients and give them the care they \nneed? Are we going to stand up for the people who pay the bills as \nconsumers of health insurance? Or are we going to side with the HMOs \nand the insurance companies that have created this problem?\n  That is the choice. To me, it is a simple choice. We know there are \nfolks in the HMO business and insurance companies that make good \ndecisions. There are HMOs in Michigan that do a good job.\n  But we also have situations where the wrong decisions are made and \npeople have been hurt. In the end, when the Yamins come to me and say: \nWhy is it that the only part of the health care system that is not held \naccountable for what they do and the decisions they make are HMOs? I \ncannot answer that. I cannot answer why the only two groups of people \nin the United States of America that are not held accountable--cannot \nlegally be held accountable for their decisions--are foreign diplomats \nand HMOs. I cannot answer the reason why that makes any sense because I \nbelieve it does not.\n  The Yamins are asking me to fight on their behalf. The damage is \nalready done. Mr. Yamin has lost his business. He has lost functioning \nin his leg. The mounting medical bills for their family will not be \nreversed. But they have asked me to fight to make sure this does not \nhappen to another family.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in a bipartisan bill before this body. A \nlot of hard work has gone on. There have been a lot of changes in the \nlast 5 years since this issue was first brought up. We have an \nopportunity to pass something meaningful that will make a difference in \nthe lives of our families. I urge we do so.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to address the issue today of \npatient protection legislation that is now before the Senate. I would \nlike to thank so many of my colleagues who have led the effort to enact \nsensible patient protection legislation that will protect patients \nmore, give patients more rights, and make sure we keep the costs down \nso that we will not decrease the number of insured in our country but, \nin fact, will increase the number of insured people. We would like a \ngoal of every American to have quality health coverage. To do that, we \nmust keep costs down as well as make sure that the quality part of the \ncommitment is kept.\n  Senator Frist, Senator Breaux, and Senator Jeffords have what I think \nis the best bill. Of all of the alternatives, I think there are parts \nof each that are similar, and I think all the three major bills will \ncertainly be able to come together. But I think the Frist-Breaux-\nJeffords approach is the one that makes the most sense and addresses \nthe issues that are of most concern.\n  Senator Frist, the Senator from Tennessee, is also the only medical \ndoctor in the Senate. Of all people, he would know the danger of \nturning over patient care to accountants and an insurance company. He \nalso knows the danger of turning patient care over to trial lawyers \nwhose first interest is not the well-being of the patient.\n  That is why I think his bill is the one that takes the balanced \napproach of giving more rights and addressing the major concern of \nquality patient care but also making sure that we do not open the \ncourts to frivolous lawsuits that would cause the cost of health care \nto increase exponentially.\n\n  We all know that quality health care in the United States is \nunparalleled. There is no argument from anywhere regarding that fact. \nThe question is, How do we maintain this level of quality while \nexpanding it to as many Americans as possible? This is a complicated \nquestion, but there is a deceptively simple answer: Cost.\n  When you review the statistics on the uninsured, it becomes very \nclear. Only 18 percent of the uninsured come from families who have no \nconnection to a workforce. The Kaiser Commission found that 82 percent \nof the uninsured come from working families. In fact, 71 percent of the \nuninsured come from families with one or more full-time workers.\n  According to a study done by the Center for Studying Health System \nChange, 20 percent of all uninsured people are offered health insurance \nby their employer, or a family member has an employer who offers health \ninsurance, and they could get coverage for his or her family, and they \nchoose not to enroll in the plan.\n  The most cited reason for not enrolling in an offered plan is cost. \nThe costs are a double-edged sword. They are of concern to the patient \nand the employer who would provide insurance. High costs have caused \npeople to choose to be uninsured in return for more money in their \npaycheck, feeling that they need that money for other priorities higher \nthan health care coverage. It also is the stated cause by employers \nthat say they cannot offer health insurance to their employees. That is \nwhy it is essential that any bill we pass not increase costs either for \nthe patient or for the employer.\n  If health costs continue to climb, the potential results could be \nalarming, as evidenced by a recent series of nationwide polls of \nemployers. In each one, an overwhelming majority of employers stated \nunequivocally they would have to pass on any new cost to their \nemployees, whether by raising the employees' premium or out-of-pocket \ncosts or by reducing benefits or eliminating coverage of certain \nservices.\n  As the American economy begins to cool, businesses are beginning to \ntighten their belts. We are seeing the unemployment rolls go up. This \ncould take a bigger toll on the rolls of the Nation's uninsured. We \ncannot fool ourselves that a minor increase would make no difference to \nbusinesses, especially small businesses with tight profit margins. \nIndeed, it would not take much at all for small businesses to drop \ncoverage of their employees.\n  According to a study done by the Employee Benefits Research \nInstitute, a 5-percent increase in premiums would cause 5 percent of \nsmall businesses to drop coverage, and a 10-percent increase would \ncause 14 percent to drop coverage.\n  There is also some good news in these figures, if we can just address \nthem; that is, this would also work in reverse, with decreases in rates \ncreating more coverage. In fact, just a 10-percent decrease in rates \nwould make 43 percent of small businesses more likely to offer \ncoverage.\n  We must keep these consequences in mind. We must also remember the \nconsequences of our own actions in another way. Remember the health \ncare debate that we had less than 10 years ago. I doubt that my \ncolleagues across the aisle want to relive the consequences of trying \nto force upon the American people a nationalized health care system in \nour fiercely independent, democratic Nation.\n  If Americans are currently unhappy with decisions being made by their \nHMO rather than their doctor, then just as in 1993, they are not going \nto want decisions to be made by a bureaucracy in Washington, DC. Yet \ntoday we are considering legislation that would impose numerous new \nFederal mandates and regulations. I know if we don't learn from the \nmistakes of the past, we are doomed to repeat them. I didn't think we \nwould be doomed so soon.\n  We all have the same goals: to ensure high-quality health care is not \ncompromised; that more Americans have access to health care; and that \nall patients have basic rights and guarantees concerning their health \ncare.\n\n[[Page S6486]]\n\n  This is about people, not lawyers. We understand that people care \nmore about getting health care, not about filing a good lawsuit. We \nunderstand patients want the care. They are not interested in filing a \nlawsuit later, when the injury may be irreparable. We have the support \nof the American people on this issue. A recent survey by Market \nStrategies showed that 83 percent of Americans say lawsuits with few \nrestrictions would make it even harder for the working poor to afford \ncoverage.\n  We should also listen to States that have already introduced some \nform of a Patients' Bill of Rights, such as my home State of Texas. One \nsize does not work on humans, and it should not be applied to all \nStates, either. Yet one of the bills that is before us, the Kennedy-\nMcCain bill, would make all States the same. It would penalize States \nsuch as Texas that have taken steps toward a Patients' Bill of Rights \nand where, in fact, it is working.\n  When Texas enacted the broad set of managed care reforms in 1997, \nthey addressed an issue that we are attempting to address in Congress. \nTexas successfully tackled even the sticky issue of appeals and \nlawsuits, one of the greatest hurdles in the debate on the bill today.\n  In Texas, if an HMO denies a claim, patients have the right to \ninternal and external appeals. Once you have exhausted your \nadministrative remedies and only then can you contemplate suing your \nHMO in court. The external review section was struck down by a Federal \ncourt as the State tried to apply these provisions to federally \nregulated HMOs. As you can imagine, that didn't stop Texas. They \nrevived their external review section of the law, this time making it \nvoluntary. Despite the ability to decline to participate, HMOs and \nother health plans are participating, and they are agreeing to be bound \nby the external review process.\n  This is how the external review process works in Texas. We let an \nexternal review board of professionals, who are not associated with the \nHMO, decide who is right concerning the patient's care. If the HMO \ndenies coverage for a certain procedure, the patient and the doctor \ndisagree with their decision, then the patient can make an internal \nappeal within the HMO first.\n  If after the HMO reviews the appeal they still refuse to change their \nstance, then the patient can appeal again to an outside panel of \nexperts not associated with the HMO in any way. It works.\n  In fact, of more than 300 appeals heard under the external review \nsystem, fewer than 10 lawsuits has emerged. At the same time, the \nsystem has proved to be fair. The conclusions of the appeals are \nvirtually 50/50 in favor of both the patients and the health plans.\n  I know all of us want the best health care for America. But it is a \nlot easier to jump on a rhetorical or political bandwagon, sometimes, \nthan to create good legislation. Rather than rushing a bill through \nCongress--and this bill has not even had a committee markup--it is \nimportant that we examine this bill carefully. We are going to have to \ndo that in this Chamber because the committee process was bypassed.\n\n  It is important that we ensure we are not creating more problems than \nwe are trying to solve. We must remember the rule of unintended \nconsequences, that sometimes the end results are vastly different from \nwhat we expect or intend.\n  We can't afford to take a chance with unintended consequences with \nour health care system. It is too basic to too many people in this \ncountry for us to make a mistake and go overboard and find that we have \nallowed so many lawsuits with not very many limits to create a cost \nincrease in our health care system that would cause people to lose \ncoverage or to start relying on lawsuits instead of talking to their \ndoctors and getting an outside appeal to get the care on a timely \nbasis.\n  A Patients' Bill of Rights is important. We must make sure that we \nwork together to get this high quality.\n  Let me describe some of the reasons I am supporting the Frist-Breaux-\nJeffords plan. It gives access to emergency rooms without any question \nand without any delay. In fact, all of the bills agree on these basic \nissues. I believe if we have a bill that has direct access to an \nemergency room, direct access, without going through a process, to get \nto an OB/GYN specialist or a pediatrician or specialty care by a \nspecialist in an area, when that is called for in a diagnosis, then I \nthink that will be a good Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  If we have a rapid, binding internal and external review process on \ndenials of claims, that would be a good Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  If we have access to Federal courts, after going through the external \nreview process, with reasonable limitations on noneconomic damages, \nthat will be a good Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  No one argues that we should have unlimited economic damages if a \nperson is found not to have gotten the proper care. That person needs \nto have the right to that care that was found to be denied in error.\n  It is the noneconomic damages that have caused so much rise in cost \nthroughout our health care system, that has caused premiums to go up, \nhospital costs to go up, equipment costs to go up, doctor visits to go \nup. We can come to a reasonable compromise that gives people rights to \nsue and rights to access but doesn't take the cap off responsibility so \nthat the patient care is secondary to the big court reward that you \nmight get even if it is unwarranted.\n  That hurts everybody in the system because the cost goes up. And who \nis hurt the most? It is the person who is barely able to afford that \ninsurance coverage but has access to it and might drop it or choose to \ngo uninsured because the costs become unbearable.\n  This has a ripple effect throughout the health care system. When a \nperson goes uninsured and then has a terrible accident, then the costs \nmust be shared by all taxpayers, by all the people in and out of the \nsystem. It is in everyone's best interest that we have quality, \naffordable health care coverage so people will have their needs met in \na responsible way.\n  That is what I think the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords plan will do. I hope \nvery much that my colleagues will make sure that we do the responsible \nthing because it would be a bigger harm to our country to do the wrong \nthing, to take a chance.\n  I was here during the debate in early 1994 on the health care plan \nthat was put forward, which would have basically nationalized our \nhealth care system. After 2 days of debate on that bill, it was pulled \ndown because people began to see that putting our health care system \ninto a government system was going to limit quality. It was going to \nlimit the access that people have to the great quality health care that \nwe have come to enjoy in our country.\n  When we talk about quality health care, we are talking about new \ninnovations in prescription drugs. We are talking about being able to \ntreat something with prescription drugs today that 10 years ago would \nhave been a huge operation and a 2-week stay in the hospital. We have \nbeen in the forefront of the innovation with the newest technologies \nand the newest prescription drugs that would allow America to have the \nvery best health care coverage of any country in the world. We don't \nwant to lose that. Our freedom to choose has been a big part of the \nsuccess of that system.\n  But we are in danger of losing it if we turn our system over to \npeople who are not interested in patient welfare. It could be the \naccountant in the insurance company office who makes a data entry error \nand causes the person to lose coverage; or it can be the trial lawyer \nwho is more interested in earning a big fee than in getting the patient \nthe coverage they need.\n  It is my intention to offer an amendment to this bill that would also \nmake sure that a person can't have coverage dropped without notice. \nToday, a person can walk into a pharmacy and order a prescription under \ntheir insurance policy and be told by the pharmacy that a family member \nhas been dropped from coverage, unbeknownst to the person who walked in \nthe door. What kind of system is it that someone can be told they don't \nhave insurance and, therefore, they can't get their prescription or \nthey must pay for it in full even though they have coverage, and then \nwhen the person calls the next week and says, excuse me, but I was told \nthis week, after 6 years of coverage by the same insurance company, \nthat a member of my family was dropped from coverage, and the person \nsays, oh, there was an error made in a data entry and it was a mistake \nthat\n\n[[Page S6487]]\n\nyour wife was dropped from coverage. That has happened with one of the \nbetter insurance companies in this country.\n  I am going to offer an amendment that would keep an insurance company \nfrom dropping without notification someone who has been approved for \ncoverage, so if there is a mistake, the person will have the ability to \ncorrect the mistake before suffering the embarrassment of being told \nthat they don't have coverage. I just wonder what would have happened \nif the person had showed up in the emergency room and was told they \ndidn't have coverage anymore, unbeknownst to them, because of a data \nentry error that was inadvertently made by a faceless bureaucrat in an \ninsurance company system.\n  So I do think it is important that we have a Patients' Bill of \nRights, and I think it is important that we proceed with the utmost \ncaution to make sure that everything we are doing is going to \ncontribute to the problem's solution and not make it worse. That is the \nchoice that we have today, and the reason that I am supporting the bill \ncreated by the only physician in the Senate, Senator Bill Frist, who \nhas seen firsthand the dangers of an insurance company making a bad \ndecision in an HMO and the dangers of putting patient care in the hands \nof trial lawyers.\n  What we want is a Patients' Bill of Rights that puts patient care \nfirst and foremost and makes sure that we don't increase costs with \nunintended consequences. That is the issue that we will be debating for \nthe next 2 weeks. I hope the people of America will take the \nopportunity to learn the differences between the two major bills that \nwill be before us today and the rest of this week, and probably next \nweek, because a person's insurance coverage and quality of care will be \ngreatly affected by what we do in the Senate in the next 2 weeks.\n  I urge my colleagues to take the responsible approach to make sure \nthat we keep the high level of quality care that we have been able to \nenjoy in our country--the best in the world--and let's not take a \nchance on lowering the quality while we give more people the ability to \nhave guaranteed rights, and that our eye is on more access for more \npeople in our country, not less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the \nBipartisan Patient Protection Act of 2001, which has been sponsored by \nJohn McCain, John Edwards, and Ted Kennedy.\n  I am a proud sponsor of this legislation because it meets my \nprinciples for managed care reform and, yet, at the same time, it meets \nthe day-to-day needs of my constituents in Maryland and the American \npeople. It is also supported by virtually every health care consumer \nand provider group.\n  Mr. President, the time to act is now--not weeks from now, not months \nfrom now, not years from now. We have been considering what is the best \napproach to have a Patients' Bill of Rights to protect people from the \narbitrary, capricious, and often dangerous decisions of insurance \ncompanies. We have been considering that now for more than 4 years.\n  Now, nobody said during the debate of the tax bill that we need more \ntime to analyze these amendments. Yet we have irrevocably made a fiscal \nchoice that I think will ultimately shackle us in what we can do for \nthe American people. We did that pretty quickly. They were all set to \nkind of ram a missile defense shield down our throats, where we were \ngoing to spend $80 billion to come up with a ``techno-gizmo'' to shoot \na bullet with a bullet that might or might not come to us. Yet after 4 \nyears, we need more time to look at the fine print on the Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  I say the time has come. We have to have this done by the Fourth of \nJuly, and I am ready to declare my declaration of independence and \nreally move this bill forward.\n  In the United States of America, we are geniuses at inventing the \nthird way. We don't have a socialist system. We don't have a comrade \nsystem. I agree, we don't want comrades and socialism. Also, we did \nbelieve people needed a safety net. We didn't want to leave them to the \nvagaries of who gets health care--where you could have the rich versus \nthose with no health care at all--kind of a Darwinian, predatory, free-\nmarket approach; but at the same time we invented the third way--\nprivate insurance that people could buy to protect themselves. We in \nthe United States wanted to give help to those who practice self-help. \nWe invented Medicare and Medicaid for those populations that were \neither too poor or too at risk for the private market.\n  So now here we are with the third way--private insurance. But some \nyears ago, in a place called Jackson Hole, where the insurance \ncompanies met with lots of tax subsidies to support them at that \nmeeting, they came up with managed care. Managed care is nothing but a \neuphemism for a moat around medical care. That is what managed care \nis--a moat around medical care. Jackson Hole created a black hole for \npatients to be able to go in and get the medical care they need.\n  So I think the time to act is now. I hope that we will follow some \nvery basic principles. Mr. President, I think we need to fight for \npatients, not for profits. Medical decisions should be made in the \nexamining room by the doctor, not in the board room by the insurance \nexecutive. Patients should have the right to receive the treatment that \nis medically necessary by the most appropriate provider using the best \npractices.\n  Patients need continuity of care. Just because an employer changes \ninsurance companies, you should not have to change your doctor, \nparticularly if you are pregnant or a family member is terminally ill \nor if you are in a rehab center.\n  Patients should be able to hold their insurance companies accountable \nfor medical decisions in the same way they hold their doctors \naccountable for medical decisions, and that is by having the \nopportunity for redress in court. The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill meets \nthose principles.\n  Let me give an example of continuity of care. It is absolutely \ncrucial. I worry about people who are undergoing care for serious and \ncomplex medical conditions. Often an employer will change insurance \ncompanies, but the employee should not be penalized. Again, if a woman \nis pregnant, she should have continuity of care. If a family has a \nchild who has leukemia, while they are fighting for their child's life, \nthey should not be fighting with their insurance company to keep their \ndoctor.\n  If a family member has a stroke and is getting rehab, certainly they \nshould be able to have continuity in that facility with that rehab team \nfor 90 days or until discharge from the facility.\n  These are the kinds of issues we are talking about in our legislation \nand what we are fighting for.\n  I came to the Senate to save lives, to save jobs, and to save \ncommunities. This is what we want to do: save lives and make sure we \nstop the horror stories about Americans who are denied medically \nnecessary treatment.\n  Mr. President, 31,000 people every year are forced to change doctors; \n35,000 people a year have needed care delayed. Thousands and thousands \nevery day have to wait for permission to get their bills paid.\n  Let me tell you about Jackie from Bethesda, MD. She is a go-getter, \nas many Marylanders are. She was hiking in the Shenandoah Mountains, \nlost her footing, and fell down a 40-foot cliff. Thank God there were \npeople there to help her. She was airlifted to a hospital. Guess what. \nThe HMO refused to pay her $10,000 hospital bill because she did not \nget prior authorization.\n  Then there is the story of a little boy who found his diabetic dad \nlying unconscious after days and days of trying to get an HMO referral \nto a specialist. This little genius called 911, but, again, though the \nfather was rescued, they then had to fight with the insurance company \nwhile they were fighting to bring him back to health so he could go \nback to work.\n  Fight, fight, fight always with the insurance company. I am joining \nwith Senator Jack Reed on an ombudsman bill that supports programs like \nthe one in Maryland where we actually pay people to deal with the \nentanglements of denial and dismissal of benefits to which they think \nthey are entitled.\n  The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill is terrific. It guarantees access to \nemergency care. It provides timely access to specialists.\n\n[[Page S6488]]\n\n  In this bill, if you have a child, you have access to a pediatrician. \nA woman has direct access to an OB/GYN. We guarantee continuity of \ncare, and we stop that dreaded practice of drive-by mastectomies. That \nis why we like the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill.\n  We know Dr. Frist and Senator John Breaux and even yourself, Mr. \nPresident, look at it another way, and we respect that, but we think \nthat bill has too many loopholes. It leaves out too many protections. \nThere is no protection for a health care provider that advocates on \nbehalf of a patient. It does not prohibit coercive financial incentives \nfor physicians to deliver health care. But I do not want to talk about \ntheir bill. I want to talk about the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill. I \nwant to talk about getting a bill now. I am talking about a bill that \nremoves the moat around medicine. I am talking about putting patients \nbefore profits.\n  I conclude by saying we are the discovery nation. In the 20th \ncentury, we made more scientific and medical breakthroughs than at any \nother time in world history, and the breakthroughs came from here. They \ncame because the American people funded the NIH and then the private \nsector and our universities value added to come up with new ideas and \nnew products that are saving lives.\n  When my mother was first diagnosed with diabetes, she could either go \non insulin, oral insulin, or nothing at all. Now there are over 300 \ndifferent forms of medication to help those patients. We are on our way \nto finding a cure for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.\n  While we are so busy discovering lifesaving pharmaceuticals, dramatic \nnew techniques, and new forms of prevention, we should not let the \ninsurance companies prevent our access to the very things we paid to \ninvent.\n  Let's pass this Patients' Bill of Rights. Let's do it before the \nFourth of July break, or I believe the American people will foment \nanother revolution, and we will have to stand out of their way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the McCain-Edwards-\nKennedy patient protection bill of which I am very proud to be a \ncosponsor.\n  It is time--it is past time--for us to help millions of Americans \nobtain their basic rights and protections in dealing with health care \nproviders.\n  It is time--it is past time--for health insurers to be held \naccountable when they show more concern for their own bottom line than \nfor the patients' health and safety.\n  It is time--it is past time--for medical decisions to be made by \npatients and doctors, not some HMO bean counter.\n  I am no stranger nor a Johnny-come-lately to this issue. Years ago I \nbecame a supporter of Congressman Charles Norwood's effort, my good \nfriend and Republican colleague from Georgia, as he went about in his \ncourageous effort to make this change. And I come from a State that \npassed a strong patient protection law 2 years ago which, by all \naccounts, is working very well.\n  Now it is time for Congress to pass a strong Federal law to protect \nthe millions of patients who cannot be protected by the Georgia law or \nby any other State's law.\n  This patient protection issue has been on our to-do list for a long \ntime. We often speak of something serious as being a life-or-death \nmatter, but it seldom is. Today this is truly a life-or-death matter \nfor many American families who cannot wait any longer for us to act.\n  When Georgia wrestled with this issue 2 years ago, at the heart of \nthe debate was the question of how we could best protect the interest \nof patients enrolled in managed care plans. That question has become \nincreasingly important over the past 20 years because managed care has \ncome to dominate the health care delivery system.\n  In 1980, managed care was a novelty. Today more than 70 percent of \nAmericans and close to 80 percent of insured employees are covered by \nsome form of managed care.\n  As the number of Americans enrolled in HMOs and managed care has \ngrown, so have the complaints grown and so have the horror stories \ngrown about being denied adequate care.\n  The proper role of managed care is to balance the cost of health care \nwith the medical needs of patients, but in too many cases the concerns \nabout cost always come out ahead of the concerns for the patient. In \nfar too many cases, managed care has become mismanaged care.\n  The Georgia law that was passed in 1999 brought balance to the \nequation by giving patients explicit access to specialists and \nemergency care. The law also created an independent external review \nsystem to address patients' grievances. These are the essential \ncomponents of any good bill, and they are the components of the bill I \nspeak for today.\n  When the Georgia Legislature debated this law, there were critics--\ncritics who made the same arguments that we are hearing in Washington \ntoday and that I heard last year and the year before.\n  In Georgia, the critics paid for ads saying the law would drive up \npremiums and cause more people to lose coverage. The critics paid for \nads claiming employers would be held liable for HMO mistakes. They paid \nfor ads predicting--and I love this alliteration--a ``flurry of \nfrivolous'' lawsuits. Oh, there was hissing and moaning, but you know \nwhat? None of those dire predictions has come true. By all accounts, \nGeorgia's patient protection law is working, and working well. In fact, \npatients are so satisfied with the independent review process that not \na single, solitary patient has filed a lawsuit. No, not one.\n\n  Let me read from an article in the Atlanta Constitution on Monday, \n``Georgia's Pioneer Plan Avoids Legal Side Effects.'' The first two \nparagraphs I will read:\n\n       When Georgia's Patient's Bill of Rights became law two \n     years ago, managed-care companies predicted they would be \n     spending a lot of time in court defending their decisions to \n     deny coverage. But there has yet to be a lawsuit filed by a \n     patient who first aired the grievance through the new \n     independent review system, state officials said.\n       ``The law is working as intended,'' said Clyde Reese, \n     Director of the Health Planning Division that oversees the \n     patient protection process. ``In the two years, no one who \n     has gone through this process and has been denied has filed a \n     lawsuit. It has not given rise to litigation. We're not aware \n     of even one suit that's been processed.''\n\n  There it is. The naysayers, Chicken Littles, never give up. Today on \nthis bill, they are telling you that if it is passed, the sky will \nfall. They claim that the patients' employers can be sued as well as \nthe HMO itself.\n  Wrong. Not so. This conservative, probusiness, Democratic Senator \nwould never support a bill that exposes employers to that kind of \nliability. The McCain-Edwards bill specifically protects employers, \ngives protection even to the directors of the HMO. Those individuals \ncannot be personally sued, as some would have you believe. Employers \nare shielded from lawsuits unless they directly participate in a \nmedical treatment decision.\n  This is also one of the very principles President Bush has said must \nbe included. When President Bush released his principles for a \nbipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights on February 7, he said: Only \nemployers who retain responsibility for and make medical decisions \nshould be subject to suit.\n  We agree with President Bush. The principle outlined in February is \nthe exact principle that is in our bill.\n  Now I am not a judge, and there is not enough of me to be a jury, but \nthat is pretty plain to me. Only the HMO itself can be sued. And who \ncan argue that HMOs should not be held accountable for mistakes? \nShouldn't HMOs be treated like any other health care organization or \ndoctor or business or individual?\n  While the Georgia law is a model for protecting patients, they \nunfortunately cannot protect all of Georgia's patients. No State law on \nthis issue can protect all the citizens because a Federal law, the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, also known as ERISA, \nexempts a large class of employees from State oversight. That means \nmillions of Americans are not covered under any patient protection law. \nThey have no legal recourse in dealing with their HMOs, and they are \nsuffering. It is, for too many, truly a life-or-death matter. That is \nwhy I believe so strongly that Congress must act, and act now.\n  The McCain-Edwards bill would also provide patients with their basic \nrights and protections in a balanced way. It\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\nguarantees access to medical specialists; it protects patients from \nhaving to change doctors in the middle of treatment; it provides fair, \nunbiased, and timely internal and independent external review systems \nto address patients complaints; it ensures that patients and doctors \ncan openly discuss all the treatment options without regard to costs; \nand it includes an enforcement mechanism that ensures these rights are \nreal.\n\n  The McCain-Edwards bill is also consistent with all of the principles \nlaid out by President Bush except one: President Bush, a man for whom I \nhave profound respect, wants the Federal courts to have exclusive \njurisdiction over patient protection lawsuits. Another bill introduced \nby Senators Breaux and Frist, colleagues for whom I also have great \nrespect, would comply with the President's wish on this point by moving \nall liability lawsuits to the Federal courts.\n  I am sorry, but I must respectfully disagree with the President and \nmy colleagues on this one point. A purely Federal solution is not the \nbest solution. The Breaux-Frist bill would preempt Georgia's law, as \nwell as the laws of seven other States that have passed similar patient \nrights bills. The traditional arena for resolving questions about \nmedical negligence is the State court. I submit that is where the \njurisdiction should remain. It is the courtroom that is the closest to \nthe people. Don't make my folks in Brasstown Valley have to go over the \nmountains, through Unicoi Gap, to get to that big, crowded, white \nmarble courthouse in faraway Gainesville. That ``ain't'' right. Let 'em \ngo to the county seat, to the courthouse in Hiawassee that they and \ntheir family have known for years.\n  Now, one more thing. Any bill on this issue is going to add to the \ncost of health insurance premiums. They all do. Ours, in my opinion, is \nthe most reasonable. The Congressional Budget Office estimates if the \nMcCain-Edwards bill is passed, premiums will increase by 4.2 percent \nover 10 years. That translates to slightly more than $1 a month for the \naverage employee. I believe most Americans will be more than willing to \npay an extra $1 a month for the protection this bill will afford them.\n  Let's not drag this thing on. Please, let's not play partisan games \nwith something this important. It has been an issue in three \ncongressional elections now and two Presidential elections. The time \nhas come to resolve this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Georgia leaves the \nfloor, I will say a word. I have one daughter--my oldest child is a \ndaughter--and she has four brothers. When she married, we were a little \nconcerned because she married someone from the South, from North \nCarolina. But he has been such a wonderful son-in-law and, with his \nfamily, we have gotten to know about something that I kind of refer to \nas southern common sense. My son-in-law, first of all, is very smart. \nIn addition to that, he has so much common sense. He can figure out \nproblems. He has been a great father to three of my grandchildren.\n  I give that background because the more I am exposed to southern \nlegislatures, the stronger I feel on an affirmative basis about my son-\nin-law. I think we need more of this southern common sense in the \nnational legislature. The two Members on the floor today epitomize what \nI think is the direction of the South in influencing legislation in the \nSenate.\n  I listened with interest and awe to the statement of the Senator from \nGeorgia. It was as good as I have heard in this Chamber, and I have \nheard some good ones. It was direct and to the point, as only the \nSenator from Georgia can be with his wealth of experience being an \nadministrator and legislator.\n  Another Senator on the floor with the Senator from Georgia is our \nfriend from North Carolina.\n  My son-in-law is from Kannapolis. We talked about that. It is a place \nwhere they made lots of sheets and towels and things such as that, for \nmany years.\n  I have not had the opportunity publicly to express my appreciation to \nmy colleague for lending his expertise to this legislation because he \nhas not only brought the southern common sense to this legislation but \nalso the respect we all have for him and his legal abilities.\n  To my two southern friends here today, I say thank you very much for \nmaking it possible for us to be able to pass this legislation. Because \nof the two of you--there are other reasons, of course--we are going to \npass this legislation. More than 5 years is enough. We are going to \npass this legislation, and we are going to do it in the immediate \nfuture, not way down the line. We are going to pass it as soon as we \ncan, which is going to be before the July recess begins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, first I say to my friend from Nevada, he \nis mighty lucky to have a son-in-law from North Carolina.\n  Mr. REID. I agree.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. We are glad he has a son-in-law from North Carolina.\n  I say to my friend from Georgia, who, some people may not know, lives \n6 or 8 miles from the North Carolina line, so North Carolina had a \nlittle good influence on him when he was growing up in Georgia. In \nfact, when I was in western North Carolina not long ago, in the closest \ntown to the Georgia border, they said they started to believe Senator \nMiller was their Senator, so I had to make it clear to them, no, it was \nnot true; I represented them, although he does a great job of \nrepresenting all the people of that area.\n  I thank the Senator for a number of things.\n  No. 1, for the eloquence of his speech, because it was so well \nthought out, so clearly spoken that anyone listening would have \nunderstood it.\n  No. 2, for talking about the actual experience as opposed to some of \nthe rhetoric we hear on both sides of this debate on the issue of what \neffect this kind of patient protection legislation will have on \nlawsuits and the potential for lawsuits.\n  Georgia in fact has a real experience. We do not need to guess about \nwhat has happened down there. They have legislation very similar to \nours. In the State of Georgia, there have not only been few lawsuits, \nthere has been none during the time that law has been in place. I know \nthe Senator played a role in helping, with his friends down there, to \nmake sure that law in fact happened.\n  Next, I thank the Senator for his leadership on this issue. As he \nsaid, he is no newcomer to this issue. He has been involved in it for a \nnumber of years. His expertise and involvement are critically \nimportant.\n  Finally, no one cares more about being certain we are not exposing \nemployers to lawsuits than the Senator from Georgia. He has made very \nclear from the day he walked in this institution that he is a man of \nstrong character, integrity, and independence. There is no doubt in my \nmind he means what he says. He would not be in support of this \nlegislation--I might add, nor would I, nor would the Senator from \nNevada--none of us would support this legislation if we believed it \nexposed employers to lawsuits. We all care a great deal about that \nissue, as we care about protecting patients and providing adequate \npatient protection against some of the HMO abuses that have occurred.\n  I wanted to stand briefly and thank my friend from Georgia, thank him \nfor his cosponsorship of our legislation and thank him for his very \nclear thinking on this issue which has now been expressed to the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I inquire how much time we have \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Let me speak briefly and then yield the floor to my \ncolleagues on the other side from whom we welcome hearing on this \nissue.\n  First, we have now had a number of speakers who have addressed the \nissues that have been discussed over the course of the last 2 days now, \nsince our legislation was introduced. We pointed out--and I hope we \nwill continue to point out throughout the course of this debate--that \nthere are areas of agreement but there are areas of disagreement. There \nare important differences between the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy\n\n[[Page S6490]]\n\nbill and the competing bill on the other side. Those areas of \ndisagreement go from the beginning of the bill through the end, \nincluding such things as access to specialists outside the plan, access \nto clinical trials--particularly FDA-approved clinical trials, access \nto a truly independent review process so when the claim of a patient is \ndenied by an insurance company that patient they can go to a group and \nget that decision reversed, knowing it is a totally impartial review \npanel, there being no question about the independence of that review \npanel; finally, as a matter of last resort, the case being able to go \nto court if in fact these other processes do not work.\n  But what we now know from the Senator from Georgia, plus the \nexperiences in Texas and California, is that when these appeal \nprocesses are in place, when a patient is wrongly denied care by an \nHMO, there are two places for that decision to be reversed before \nanybody goes to court. One is the internal review within the HMO; the \nother is the external review to a truly independent body.\n  I might add as to the cost--the Senator from Georgia referred to \nthis--our bill, according to the Congressional Budget Office, will \nraise insurance premiums 4.2 percent over 5 years. The Frist bill \nraises insurance premiums I believe 2.9 percent over the same period of \ntime.\n  The difference between the two, the 1.3-percent difference, the \nmajority of that difference has nothing to do with litigation. It rests \nin areas such as difference in access to specialists, difference in \naccess to clinical trials, difference in quality of care. So the bulk \nof the cost difference between the two bills goes specifically to the \nissue of the quality of care that children, families, and patients \nacross America will receive.\n  To the extent the argument is made that there is an explosion of \nlitigation, that this is going to cost a great deal of money, the \nreality is that there is a little over 1 percent difference between our \nbill and the competing bill. The bulk of that difference is accounted \nfor by difference in quality of care.\n  The American people are going to get a better product. They are going \nto get better health care. They are going to have a way to get access \nto clinical trials for their child who needs to be seen by a \nspecialist, to be seen by a specialist. They are going to have a way to \nreverse a wrongful decision by an HMO. That is what we are talking \nabout. None of that has anything to do with going to court or lawsuits.\n  As to the issue of going to court, as the Senator from Georgia \npointed out so clearly, we are only asking one thing, and that is that \nHMOs not continue to be treated as privileged citizens; that they be \ntreated as everyone else--they ought to be treated as every other \nAmerican, every other small business, every other large business--and \nthat they not maintain their status as being the only group in America \nthat cannot be held accountable for their actions. That is what this \ndebate is about. We are on the side of patients. That is the reason the \ngroups, AMA and others, support our legislation.\n\n  I think it is time now for me to yield the floor to my colleagues on \nthe other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. I will take a couple of minutes. I will be brief, and then \nthe Senator from Maine will address many of the issues we discussed.\n  Clearly, much of the debate centers on what the cost of this bill \nwill be. We both have patient protections. We want to give rights to \npatients that they deserve, rights to make sure we have medical \ndecisions made by doctors and patients working together, and not \nmedical decisions made by HMOs.\n  If HMOs make a medical decision, then they need to be held \naccountable. How do you hold them accountable? That is where much of \nthe difference lies.\n  In terms of cost, because I do want to clarify this and because the \nSenator from North Carolina is comparing the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill \nto the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, most of the quoted cost comparisons \nare from the Congressional Budget Office, upon which we rely. In truth, \nthey are projections. Nobody knows exactly what the cost will be, but \nit is important to understand how the increase in premiums relates to \nthe overall cost. Specifically, how much will premiums increase for the \n170 million people who rely on insurance to obtain their health care? \nThat is what we are discussing. The American people, who are the ones \nwho will be paying more for the cost of this Bill of Rights--what they \nwill pay is substantially different in our bill versus their bill.\n  In their bill, when you talk about these little percentages, the \nincrease itself is about a 4 percent increase in premiums. When you \ntalk about their 4.2 versus our 2.9 percent, the percentage is only 1 \npoint difference. However, the difference is significant, whether it is \n8 percent, or 5 or 4 percent, because for every 1 percent increase, we \nare talking about 300,000 people losing their health insurance.\n  In America, when you don't have insurance, you can still go to the \nemergency room, but you do not have the quality of care that you would \nhave with insurance.\n  Instead of trying to make these differences sound tiny and small, as \na physician, I see the faces of 300,000 individuals. Three hundred \nthousand individuals, who today have health insurance, but because of \nfrivolous lawsuits and paying trial lawyers too much with no increase \nin patient protections, they lose their health insurance.\n  We continue to talk about the relative cost.\n  One other thing, to clarify what has been said on the floor regarding \nthe civil remedies part, the Congressional Budget Office scores the \nFrist-Breaux-Jeffords bill versus the Kennedy-McCain-Edwards bill twice \nas much in terms of that increase. There is a big difference in terms \nof the cost. They score theirs .8 and ours is .4 in terms of the cost \ndue to civil remedies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is now considering the \nissue of how best to ensure that patients receive the health care they \nneed when they need it and that was promised by their insurance plan.\n  The last 10 years have been particularly turbulent ones for health \ncare providers and patients alike. Concerns about rising costs have led \nto extensive changes in how health care services are provided and paid \nfor in both public and private health plans.\n  As a consequence, there is a growing unease across the country about \nthe changes in the way we receive our health care. Families worry that \nif they or their loved ones become seriously ill, their HMO will deny \nthem coverage and force them to accept either inadequate care or \nfinancial ruin--or perhaps both. They feel that vital decisions \naffecting their lives will be made not by a supportive family doctor \nbut by an unfeeling bureaucracy. They fear that they will have to fight \ntheir insurance company as well as their illness.\n  These are the concerns that have prompted this important debate about \nhow we can ensure that HMOs are held accountable for promised care and \nthat medical decisions are made by individuals wearing stethoscopes, \nnot green eyeshades. People should not have to worry that their HMO \nwill unfairly deny them treatment or force them to accept inadequate \ncare.\n  Virtually every Senator agrees that medically necessary patient care \nshould not be sacrificed to the bottom line and that health care \ndecisions should be in the hands of doctors, not insurance accountants. \nBut we face an extremely delicate balancing act: as we respond to these \nconcerns, we must be careful not to impose overly burdensome Federal \ncontrols and mandates that will drive up costs and cause some people to \nlose their health insurance altogether. That is the whole crux of the \nmanaged care debate.\n  We should pass a strong, binding Patients' Bill of Rights, but we \nshould do so in a responsible way so that we don't add excessive cost, \nlitigation, and complexity to an already strained health care system. \nCongress should use the set of principles that President Bush has given \nus as a road map to develop a bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights--one \nthat applies meaningful patient protections where they are needed \nwithout unduly increasing health care costs.\n\n[[Page S6491]]\n\n  The biggest obstacle to health care coverage in the United States \ntoday is cost. American employers everywhere--from the giant \nmultinational corporation to the small corner store--are facing huge \nhikes in their health insurance costs. Rising health insurance costs \nare particularly problematic for people purchasing coverage in the \nindividual market and for small businesses and their employees.\n  Earlier this year, the dominant carrier in Maine's individual market \nincreased its rates by an average of 23.5 percent for indemnity plans \nand 32.6 percent for HMO plans. As a result of these increases, many \npeople in my state are either dropping coverage or switching to \n``catastrophic'' plans with very high annual deductibles.\n  Similarly, many small employers in Maine are facing premium increases \nof 20 to 30 percent, forcing them either to drop their health benefits \nor pass the additional costs on to their employees through increased \ndeductibles, higher copays, or premium hikes. This also adds to the \nranks of the uninsured as more lower-wage workers, unable to afford the \nincreased costs, drop coverage or turn it down.\n  No wonder the ranks of uninsured Americans have grown to 43 million. \nIf this happens at a time we have been enjoying a strong economy, just \nimagine what could happen in an economic downturn.\n  Higher health insurance premiums lead to significant losses in \ncoverage. Studies have shown that for every one percent increase in \ninsurance premiums, insurance coverage for as many as 300,000 people is \njeopardized. This is one of the primary reasons I am so concerned about \nthe McCain-Kennedy version of the Patients' Bill of Rights. According \nto the Congressional Budget Office, the McCain-Kennedy approach will \nincrease health insurance premiums by an additional 4.2 percent over \nand above the double-digit premium increases we have already \nexperienced. Moreover, this bill is even more expensive than previous \nversions of the legislation.\n  Congress should act to provide the important protections that \nconsumers want without causing costs to soar, and we can do so by \npassing a carefully crafted bill. I also believe that we should not \npre-empt or supercede, but rather build upon the good work that states \nhave done in the area of patients' rights and protections.\n  States have had the primary responsibility for the regulation of \nhealth insurance since the 1940s. As someone who has overseen a Bureau \nof Insurance in state government, I know that state regulators have \ndone a good job of protecting consumers.\n  One of the myths in this debate is that unless the federal government \npre-empts state insurance laws, millions of Americans will somehow be \n``unprotected'' in their disputes with HMOs. That simply is untrue.\n  For example, as this chart demonstrates, 48 states have passed laws \nprohibiting ``gag clauses'' that restrict communications between \npatients and their doctors. Forty-four states have requirements for \nemergency medical care; forty-seven have prompt payment requirements; \nthirty-seven require direct access to an OB/GYN; forty-one have \nrequirements for external appeals; and all fifty have requirements for \ninternal appeals and patient information.\n  As is so often the case, states have been the laboratories for \ninsurance reform.\n  They have acted without any mandate or prodding from Washington to \nprotect their consumers. They have been way ahead of us in enacting \npatients' rights.\n  Moreover, one size does not fit all. What may be appropriate for one \nState may not work well in another or may simply be unnecessary. For \nexample, what may be appropriate for California, which has a very high \npenetration of HMOs, may simply not be needed in States such as Alaska \nand Wyoming where there is virtually no managed care. In these States, \nimposing a new blanket of heavy-handed Federal mandates and coverage \nrequirements will simply drive up costs that will impede, not expand, \naccess to health care.\n  That is why the National Association of Insurance Commissioners \nopposes the approach taken in the McCain-Kennedy bill which would force \nall States to adopt virtually equivalent Federal standards.\n  Recently, I received a letter from Kathleen Sebelius, the president \nof the NAIC, in which she writes:\n\n       States have faced the challenges and produced laws that \n     balance the two-part objectives of protecting consumer rights \n     and preserving availability and affordability of coverage. \n     For the federal government to unilaterally impose its one-\n     size-fits-all standards on the states could be devastating to \n     state insurance markets.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this letter from the NAIC be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, under the McCain-Kennedy bill, the \nFederal Government could preempt existing State patient protection laws \nunless they had already enacted identical protections--not just similar \nones, identical ones. The approaches taken by the 50 States to the same \ntypes of patient protections vary widely and with good reason in many \ncases.\n  Why should a State that has already acted on its own to provide \nstrong, workable patient protections have to make extensive changes in \ntheir laws to comply with new Federal standards?\n  Let me give you a recent example from my home State of Maine. Maine \nis one of just 12 States that require health plans in the fully insured \nindividual and small group market to provide coverage for routine costs \nfor patients participating in clinical trials. During its consideration \nof this provision last year, the Maine Legislature made the decision to \ninclude only those clinical trials that were approved and funded by the \nNational Institutes of Health. I would note, parenthetically, that this \ndecision was one that was made by a legislature controlled by the \nDemocratic Party.\n  What would happen under the McCain-Kennedy bill? Under that approach, \nMaine would have to go back and rewrite its law to include clinical \ntrials approved or funded by the Department of Defense, the Veterans' \nAdministration, and the Food and Drug Administration.\n  Why should the State of Maine have to revisit its law? The law that \nthe State of Maine came up with to require coverage of certain clinical \ntrials was carefully debated. It was thoroughly considered. And the \nMaine State legislature decided that this was the best approach for the \ncitizens of Maine. Yet under the legislation we are considering today, \nMaine would have to change its law or have it completely superseded by \nthe Federal Government taking over control of its health \ninsurance market.\n\n  Let me be clear. I believe the Federal Government does have an \nimportant role to play in regulating the self-funded plans under ERISA. \nThat is because, under current Federal law, States are precluded from \napplying patient protections to these Federal plans. That is why we \nneed a Federal law to ensure that consumers enrolled in insurance plans \nbeyond the reach of State regulators enjoy the same kinds of strong \npatient protections that apply to State-regulated plans.\n  As I said, and as you can see from the chart, the States have been \nextraordinarily active in this area. It is all well and good if \nCongress decides that it wants to impose a specific requirement or \nmandate on federally regulated ERISA plans, since States are, by law, \nprecluded from regulating these insurance plans. But the Federal \nGovernment should not be in the business of second-guessing and \noverriding the carefully crafted patient protections that have been \nnegotiated by our State legislatures and Governors to meet the needs of \nthat State's citizens.\n  States that have seized the initiative and acted on their own should \nnot have to revise their carefully tailored laws simply in order to \ncomply with a Washington-knows-best, one-size-fits-all Federal mandate.\n  Moreover, what if the State has made an affirmative decision not to \nact in one of these areas for very good reasons, such as the reason I \npreviously gave where a particular State may not have much managed care \nso that this debate is largely not relevant to its citizens? What if \nthe State legislature, after much discussion and debate, has decided \nthat a particular consumer protection simply isn't needed because the \nmarketplace has already taken care of this issue?\n\n[[Page S6492]]\n\n  Let's look at the consequences under the McCain-Kennedy bill of a \nState failing to enact an identical provision to the consumer \nprotections in S. 1052.\n  The bill proposes, quite simply, a Federal takeover of State health \ninsurance regulation. The Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, \nwould be charged with enforcing the new Federal standard.\n  Talk about a right without a remedy. In a report issued in May of \nthis year--5 years after new Federal health insurance standards were \nenacted under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, \nthe Mental Health Parity Act, and the Newborns' and Mothers' Health \nProtection Act--5 years after those laws passed, five States are still \nout of compliance, and Federal fallback enforcement in these States is \nvirtually nonexistent.\n  Moreover, HCFA told the GAO that it has not even been able to fully \nassess whether or not the States have complied with the Mental Health \nParity Act enacted 5 years ago, and that law is scheduled to sunset \nthis year. Given the fact that the Patients' Bill of Rights--the \nversion we are considering right now--is replete with new health \nmandates, consumers should be very concerned that HCFA has already \nproven beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is incapable of enforcing \nexisting Federal insurance standards in States that do not conform. In \nfact, HCFA has shown that it is incapable of even assessing whether or \nnot the States have complied with these limited Federal insurance \nstandards. So what makes us think that HCFA could in any way take over \nthe responsibility of regulating health insurance in States that do not \ncomply to the letter with the standards in the McCain-Kennedy bill?\n  If HCFA has not been able to handle its limited responsibility under \nthe laws that I mentioned, how in the world would it benefit consumers \nto provide for a Federal takeover of health insurance regulation in \nthis area?\n  I think the answer is clear. It would be a tremendous disservice to \nconsumers to have HCFA take over health insurance regulation. I know \nthat my consumers, my constituents in Maine will have far better \nservice and far better luck dealing with the Bureau of Insurance in the \nState of Maine in Gardiner, ME, than trying to call the ERISA office in \nBoston or the HCFA office in Baltimore. It is that simple.\n  As we consider Federal patient protection legislation, I believe that \ntrue deference should be given to the expert decisionmakers who know \nbest what is appropriate for each State and who are most immediately \naccessible and accountable to that State's citizens.\n  Another of the myths--and there are many--in this current debate is \nthat you can't sue your HMO. That, too, is not true. HMOs--even self-\ninsured ERISA plans--can be sued in State court over quality-of-care \ntreatment decisions. They can also be sued, under current law, in \nFederal court for injunctive relief to force them to provide needed \ncare or to compensate the patient or provider for the value of the \nbenefit, plus any attorney's fees. This is the exact same legal remedy \nthat is currently available to us as Members of Congress under the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Plan.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I do not wish to yield at this point. I would like to \nconclude my statement.\n  We do need strong remedies to prevent HMOs from denying needed care. \nThere is no dispute over that point. All of us are deeply troubled by \ncases in which an HMO has acted in a way that was not in the best \ninterest of the patient. That is not what this debate is about. The \ndebate is about the best way to solve those problems, to ensure that \nevery patient gets the care that he or she needs when they need it. \nThat is what the debate is about.\n  That is why a strong, independent, and binding appeals process is \ncritical to ensure that patients get the care they need when they need \nit; that they get the care they were promised. They should not have to \nhire an attorney and file a lawsuit to get the health care they need. \nThey just can't sue their way to quality care. That is why the key is \nto make sure that we have an appeals process that is binding, that is \nindependent, and that will force the HMO to provide the care that has \nbeen promised.\n  I am particularly concerned that the liability provisions in the \nMcCain-Kennedy bill, as currently drafted, could well discourage \nemployers that currently voluntarily provide health insurance to 172 \nmillion employees and their families from continuing to offer coverage. \nWhile the McCain-Kennedy bill claims to protect employers, the fact is, \nas I read the bill, they would be subject to both new Federal and State \nlawsuits authorized under the bill.\n  Under the McCain-Kennedy bill, a trial lawyer just needs to allege \nthat an employer directly participated in a medically reviewable \ndecision to force that employer to court. The direct participation \nstandard in S. 1052 does not shield employers from being sued. It \nsimply gives them a defense that they can raise in court. Being subject \nto such lawsuits will be particularly hard, potentially ruinous for \nsmall business owners who cannot afford the tens of thousands of \ndollars they would have to spend on attorney's fees to fight these \nkinds of cases in court.\n  Many Maine employers have expressed their serious concerns about the \nliability and scope provisions of the McCain-Kennedy bill. I met, for \nexample, with the assistant director of human resources at Bowdoin \nCollege who talked about how moving to a self-funded ERISA plan enabled \nthe college to continue to offer affordable coverage to Bowdoin \nemployees when premiums for their fully insured plan skyrocketed in the \nlate 1980s. Since they were self-funded, they were actually able to \nlower their premiums for their employees and at the same time enhance \ntheir benefit package with such features as well-baby care, free annual \nphysicals, and prescription drug cards with low copayments. They told \nme that a proposal such as the one before us today could seriously \njeopardize their ability to offer affordable coverage for their \nemployees.\n  Similar concerns have been expressed by the Maine Municipal \nAssociation, L.L. Bean, Bath Iron Works, and many other very \nresponsible Maine employers that care deeply about providing the best \npossible health insurance for their employees.\n  Even though S. 1052 is certain to drive up health insurance costs, it \nalso does nothing to expand access to affordable health insurance. In \nfact, by driving up costs, it jeopardizes health insurance coverage for \npeople who already have it and puts the cost further out of reach for \nthose who lack it now.\n  As we proceed with our consideration of legislation to protect \npatients' rights, we should also be considering ways to expand access \nto coverage for millions more Americans by making health insurance more \naffordable.\n\n  As the Presidential Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and \nQuality noted in its report which was done for President Clinton, I \nnote: Costs matter. Health coverage is the best consumer protection.\n  As we proceed in this very important debate, I hope we can continue \nto work to improve S. 1052 so that it truly protects patients without \njeopardizing their insurance coverage and without wiping out the good \nwork of the States.\n  I was encouraged today by a conversation with Senator McCain in which \nhe indicated that he is very open to resolving some of the problems I \nhave raised in my statement. I hope that we can work together, and at \nthe end of the day I hope we can approve, by an overwhelming vote, a \nresponsible Patients' Bill of Rights that will help ensure that \npatients receive the care they need, when they need it, without having \nto resort to hiring an expensive lawyer and filing a lawsuit. That \nshould be a goal that should unite us all.\n  I look forward to the upcoming debate. I think it is an important \none. I hope we can come together on a bipartisan bill that the \nPresident will sign, that will make a real difference in the health \ncare for America's patients.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield to my friend from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I listened carefully to the Senator. As a member of our \ncommittee, I know she gives a good deal of attention and time to health \ncare and education issues, as well as the other matters that come \nbefore our committee. We take her words seriously.\n\n[[Page S6493]]\n\n  While listening to her, I was reminded that the Maine Medical \nSociety, which represents the medical community in the State of Maine, \nis in strong support of our proposal. Which proposal does the Senator \nsupport at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has the floor and she \nhas 1 minute.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have worked very closely with the Maine \nMedical Association on a variety of issues. I know that while they do \nwant to see liability provisions similar to those of the Senator, they \nare very concerned about the issue I raised about the preemption of \nMaine's law.\n  Maine has been very active in passing a number of laws to provide \nconsumer protections. They are carefully balanced laws. On this chart, \nthere is a check mark all the way across. I know the Maine Medical \nAssociation was very involved with the legislature in negotiating those \nprovisions. They are concerned about the preemption of Maine's laws \nwhich they helped to draft.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I ask one further question. The Maine law includes \nclinical trials, but does not include FDA clinical trials. The proposal \nof Senator Edwards and Senator McCain does include clinical trials. \nMost of the women's groups, including women's cancer groups are \nstrongly in support of this provision. They recognize that many \npharmaceutical companies are on the edge of breakthroughs in the \ndevelopment of these new products.\n  I am interested in this illustration. The provisions for clinical \ntrials in Maine are preferable, quite frankly, to the provisions \nincluded in Breaux-Frist, where there are a number of problems.\n  Wouldn't the Senator from Maine feel that including the patients in \nMaine in these FDA protocols might be helpful if they meet the other \nrequirements? For example, what if a doctor feels that participating in \nthese clinical trials means there is a real possibility of relieving a \npatient's medical condition?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Maine has led the way on insurance \nreform. Maine is one of only 12 States that cover clinical trials. The \nMaine legislators gave careful consideration to what the scope of that \ncoverage should be, and a Democratic legislature and an independent \nGovernor decided, for reasons of cost, to limit the clinical trials \nprovisions to those who were approved by the National Institutes of \nHealth. That is appropriate.\n  What I object to is that the Kennedy approach, the Kennedy-McCain \nbill, would say that if a State didn't cover clinical trials exactly as \nthe Senator from Massachusetts wants them covered, then Maine's law is \nwiped out. I don't think that is right. I notice that Maine has been \nfar more active than Massachusetts in the area of patients' protection, \nso perhaps that explains the difference in the approach that the \nSenator from Massachusetts, my friend, and I take.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                      Insurance Commissioners,\n\n                                   Kansas City, MO, June 19, 2001.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: As the Senate prepares to debate \n     legislation designed to protect the rights of health \n     insurance consumers I would like to reiterate the concerns of \n     the nation's health insurance regulators.\n       The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), \n     which represents all fifty-five insurance commissioners in \n     the states and territories, is primarily concerned about \n     federal preemption of state laws and regulations. All states \n     have passed and implemented legislation to protect the rights \n     of beneficiaries. Over 40 states have acted to ensure access \n     to emergency and OB/GYN care, require fair utilization review \n     and internal and external appeals processes, and prohibit \n     discrimination and gag clauses. Over half of the states have \n     laws ensuring access to specialists and non-formulary \n     prescription drugs, a point of service option, and continuity \n     of care.\n       As members of Congress know from experience, passing \n     patient protection legislation this can be a difficult task \n     with a variety of issues to consider. States have faced the \n     challenges and produced laws that balance the two-part \n     objectives of protecting consumer rights and preserving the \n     availability and affordability of coverage. For the federal \n     government to unilaterally impose its one-size-fits-all \n     standards on the states could be devastating to state \n     insurance markets.\n       Members of the NAIC are also concerned about enforcement. \n     As you know as a former state regulator, if there is no \n     enforcement then there is no protection. States have \n     developed the infrastructure necessary to receive and process \n     consumer complaints in a timely fashion and ensure that \n     insurers comply with the laws. The federal government does \n     not have this capability, and the proposals do not provide \n     any resources to federal agencies to develop such capability. \n     It has taken the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) \n     years to develop the infrastructure required to enforce the \n     Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) \n     which included only six basic provisions that most states had \n     already enacted. The proposed patient protection bills are \n     far more complicated than HIPAA and will require considerable \n     oversight.\n       To resolve these issues, the NAIC urges Congress to include \n     in any patient protection legislation provisions that would \n     preserve state laws and enforcement procedures, such as \n     internal and external review processes. Failure to maintain \n     state authority in this area could lead to the implementation \n     of regulations that are inconsistent with the needs of \n     consumers in a state and that are not enforced effectively.\n       Protecting patient rights is clearly a goal of both the \n     states and the federal government. Attaining this goal will \n     require cooperation and we look forward to working in \n     partnership with the federal government to implement \n     protections that are in the best interest of consumers in \n     each state.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Kathleen Sebelius,\n\n                                                  President, NAIC,\n                          Insurance Commissioner, State of Kansas.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will inquire of the Senator. If I may \nhave the Senator's attention, is the Senator supporting the Breaux-\nFrist bill at this time? Is the Senator going to work with Senator \nMcCain, a cosponsor with Senator Edwards, to try to see if we can find \ncommon ground within the next week?\n  Ms. COLLINS. My friend from Massachusetts may not have heard me when \nI said earlier--and I don't expect him to be on the edge of his chair \nthrough every moment, but I made very clear that my hope is that we can \ncome together on this important issue. It is important, and I think it \nis unfortunate that we didn't get through a conference on the Patients' \nBill of Rights last year. Then we would have had these protections \nalready in place.\n  It is a shame that last year when we had agreement on 90 percent of \nthe bill, we didn't enact it. Senator Breaux of Louisiana and I \nsuggested just that approach. So I look forward to continuing to work \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Just at noontime today, \nI had a discussion with Senator McCain and he indicated an openness to \nsolving some of the problems I have outlined in my statement. The \nSenator from Massachusetts knows I always enjoy working very closely \nwith him.\n  So I look forward to that because my goal is that we can pass a bill \nthat does the job on which we all agree, and yet that would not preempt \nStates' laws when States are doing a good job, and that would not cause \nhealth insurance costs to rise to the point where we jeopardize \ncoverage altogether.\n  I know those are goals we share, and I hope we can indeed work \nclosely together.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally--and I see the Senator from Connecticut here--\nthe point I would like to clarify is that the Edwards bill isn't \npreempting the States. They have identical provisions. The States' \nprovisions and protections, if substantial, will stand. They don't have \nto be identical. I just wanted to clarify that particular issue as we \ngo through the course of debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Very briefly, before the Senator from Connecticut \nspeaks, there were some points made by the Senator from Maine.\n  First, we very much appreciate her open attitude to work with us to \ntry to find a solution to a problem about which we all care a great \ndeal. We appreciate that. She was arguing, I believe, that because of \nincreased costs associated with a Patient Protection Act, people would \ngo from being insured to uninsured, and that is something about which \nthe American people should be concerned.\n  First of all, I point out that there are two competing bills, one of \nwhich will pass the Senate. The difference between those bills is \nminimal in cost. Second, in the three States that in fact\n\n[[Page S6494]]\n\nhave enacted patient protection--California, Texas, and Georgia--not \nonly has the number of uninsured not gone up but exactly the opposite \nhas occurred. During the time that patient protection has been in place \nin California, in Texas, and in Georgia, the number of insured has gone \nup. In California, for example, in 1998 and 1999, the number of insured \nwent up 2.3 percent. In Texas, it went up .9 percent--just under 1 \npercent. In Georgia, about which Senator Miller spoke so eloquently, it \nwent up .8 percent.\n  So the evidence from the three other States that have enacted laws \nsimilar to the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill is that because people have \na better product, better health care, better rights, not only does the \nnumber of uninsured not go up but it goes down. So these rhetorical \ncries of all of us needing to be greatly concerned about that issue--of \ncourse we are, but the actual evidence that exists from the three \nStates that have laws similar to the laws we are here talking about \nsuggests over a relatively short period of time, in fairness, that just \nthe opposite is true--that in fact, because of the quality of the \nproduct, the number of people insured can go up as opposed to going \ndown.\n  With that, I will yield the floor to my friend from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by, first of all, commending my \ngood friends and colleagues from Massachusetts, North Carolina, and \nArizona, Senators Kennedy, Edwards, and McCain, for their leadership on \nthis issue--bringing a series of reforms that seek to guarantee quality \nhealth care for more than 190 million of our fellow citizens.\n  This is extremely important. We know there are 43 million Americans \nwho have no health insurance at all. We hope at some point we can \ndevelop legislation to protect those 43 million fellow citizens who \nhave to go through the anxieties on a daily basis of hoping their \nchildren, their families will not suffer from some catastrophic illness \nwhich could wipe out whatever meager holdings they have. That debate \nwill have to be reserved for another day.\n  But there are 190 million Americans who obtain health care coverage \nthrough private insurance. So we begin the debate by trying to make \nsure that those 190 million people who are covered by private health \ncare coverage will be able to have the kind of rights we think they \nought to have as citizens of this country.\n  Mr. President, I also should begin with sort of a disclaimer to you. \nMy colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, and I represent what \nis oftentimes referred to as the insurance capital of the world. My \ngood friend, the Presiding Officer, is the Senator from, I suppose, the \nState of gaming and of family recreation. My State is well known for a \nvariety of insurance companies that have made significant and positive \ncontributions to the well-being of people not only here in the United \nStates, but around the globe. We are very proud of the fact that we \nrepresent insurance companies that have provided great security for \nmillions of people in so many different sets of circumstances.\n  But it is important to note that, as a Senator from that State, one \nof the things we are talking about here is the obligations of my \nconstituents, those insurance companies that are involved in providing \nprivate health care coverage. So today I suppose I engage in discussion \nthat you may not expect to hear from someone who comes from a State \nwhere I represent these interests.\n  I do so with a degree of sorrow because, unfortunately, in too many \ncases the industry does not understand the needs of millions of \nAmericans. This is not true of the entire insurance industry in my \nState. There are many who have reached out and are trying to make a \ndifference, to see to it that people do have access to specialists, \nemergency rooms, and clinical trials, and that they have an appeals \nprocess to turn to when they feel that they have been unfairly denied \ncare.\n  We have been at this debate now for 5 years. I recall a couple of \nyears ago being a member of a conference committee after this body had \ndealt with a Patients' Bill of Rights--partisan politics took over. We \nsat in the committee rooms for days on end and nothing happened. For \neach day we wait, each week that goes by, every month that passes, \nthese 190 million people in our country run a greater and greater risk \nthat their rights are being denied, that basic health care coverage is \nnot forthcoming.\n  I hope my colleagues who are engaged, as we have been over the last \nfew days, in delay tactics that won't allow for an amendment process to \ngo forward will cease and desist.\n  It is not what the American public wants. They may not agree with \nevery dotted ``i'' and crossed ``t'' in John McCain's and John Edwards' \nand Ted Kennedy's bill. I respect that. I understand their differences, \nbut not to have any amendments offered, not to be debating this, not to \nbe discussing it beyond the rhetorical comments is not going unnoticed \nby the American public.\n  As these days go by, I hope nothing happens to people, which could \nhave been prevented by the passage of this legislation or some \ncompromise version of it.\n  Let us begin the process of discussion. Let us begin the process of \nvoting. I am disappointed and saddened that we have not.\n  I mentioned my State and the fact that I represent some of the \nlargest, most successful insurance companies in the world. As many \nother States, my State has also taken action on this issue of a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. It has passed its own managed care \nprotections. The reforms included in the Connecticut law take an \nimportant step toward protecting patients and doctors, but today 41 \npercent of Connecticut employees are denied these very protections \nbecause of Federal law preemptions. Almost half of my constituents are \nnot protected by their State law.\n  Unless we adopt a Federal law, they will go unprotected, and that is \ntrue in State after State because of the adoption of ERISA, legislation \ngoing back years under the leadership of the former Senator from New \nYork, Jacob Javits, of blessed memory.\n  Under his leadership, ERISA was passed, but as a result of that fine \nlegislation and with the adoption of State laws providing protections \nfor people's health care rights, a lot of our fellow citizens are \npreempted by that Federal law.\n  That is the rationale for us engaging in this debate on a Patients' \nBill of Rights. There must be Federal law. If not, we are excluding \nmillions of Americans from the protections their fellow citizens living \nnext door to them, living down the street, working next to them at \ntheir businesses are provided under their State protections.\n  This debate is important, and we ought to be voting on amendments. \nEvery hour that goes by, every day that goes by that we do not do our \nbusiness raises even further risk that additional people will be \nharmed.\n  The increased role of managed care in our health system has brought \nsome very important improvements--better coordinated care, greater \nefficiency at lower costs, and an enhanced focus on preventive care.\n  The health maintenance organizations deserve credit for making these \npositive steps. The benefits, however, have been accompanied by some \nconcerns about the impact on the quality and delivery of care, and that \nis what the Kennedy-McCain-Edwards bill attempts to address.\n  Far too often the decision about whether you or your family can get \nthe health care you need is dictated by an insurance policy rather than \nyour doctors. That is why it pains me as a Senator from Connecticut to \nhave to talk about an industry of which I am so proud.\n  While we all agree on the goal of increasing efficiency and managing \ncosts in our health care system, we cannot do so at the expense of \ndenying needed care. We have to strike that balance, and today that \nbalance does not exist.\n  I want to take a minute to talk about a single case in my State. I \nrealize we are talking about 190 million people in the country who have \nprivate insurance insurance but do not have protections that a \nPatients' Bill of Rights would provide. I know there are 43 million \npeople who have no health care coverage at all. Sometimes we get to \ntalking about millions of people, millions of dollars, and billions of \ndollars and get lost in the morass of the\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\nFederal bureaucracy of how a Patients' Bill of Rights would work. We \nforget we are talking about individual people, families.\n\n  I want to take a minute, if I may, and share with my colleagues the \nstory of one family in my State and what happened to them as a result \nof our failure to have a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I just spoke with this family a few minutes before coming to this \nChamber. I did not want to talk about this family without their \npermission. I called the Moscovitch family in Connecticut and asked \nthem if I could talk about their 15-year-old son, Nitai. Let me tell my \ncolleagues what happened.\n  This family lives in Brookfield, CT, a small town in my State. They \nare a hard-working family. In fact, the father was not yet home from \nwork. He was on his way home from his job. Their son, Nitai Moscovitch, \nsuffered from very severe emotional problems. The family was wise and \nsmart enough to recognize their 15-year-old son, Nitai, needed help. He \nneeded medical help immediately.\n  This family sought that help, particularly after this young boy \nattempted suicide. He was admitted to the Danbury Hospital in the \nwestern part of my State. Despite the fact that the young boy had a \nhistory of trying to harm himself, the insurance company that provided \ncoverage for this family would only agree to cover his treatment for \nseveral days at the hospital, as if he had been in an automobile \naccident, or if he had stumbled and broken his leg or been in an \nathletic injury.\n  The idea that this was a child suffering from severe emotional \nillness was not under consideration: We will put on the Band-Aids, \nprovide the stitches, but beyond that, we are not going to provide that \ncoverage.\n  Even though Nitai threatened to commit suicide if he were removed \nfrom the hospital, they saw this as the rantings of a teenage boy, not \nto be taken too seriously.\n  Four hours after he was released, Nitai locked himself in a room, \nundid his belt on his trousers, and committed suicide.\n  If that is an isolated case I conjured up, then I ought to be ashamed \nof myself. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case. This goes on \nevery day, not necessarily with the tragic ending as in this case, but \ncoverage was denied not because someone looked at Nitai and said: We \ndon't think your emotional problems are severe enough to warrant \nhospitalization. Someone sitting behind a desk, I suppose at some \ncomputer terminal, was making the determination that the policy was not \ngoing to cover him. That was the medical analysis given to this young \nman and this family.\n  That has to stop. I am not suggesting that every medical examination \nor analysis is going to be right or there are not going to be tragedies \ninvolved, but we have to get away from the situation where the \ndecisions about what kind of care a patient needs, what kind of doctor \na patient ought to see is being determined by someone who has no \nmedical training, no medical background at all, and then to further say \nbasically they are not responsible.\n  Let me complete the story. On behalf of his son, Nitai's father, \nStewart Moscovitch, wanted to sue his health maintenance organization \nfor playing the role of doctor and refusing to cover extended treatment \nat the hospital. But the health plan argued that existing Federal law, \nthe very reason we are engaged in this debate, existing Federal law \nprevented the family from holding them liable.\n  After a 3-year battle, this family secured a ruling that the Federal \nlaw did not apply in his case. However, today there is still no \nguarantee that the Moscovitch family or any family would have the right \nto hold their plan accountable for making treatment decisions.\n  The bill we are debating will change that. I am not going to suggest \nthat somehow we could have entirely prevented this tragedy from \nhappening. As I said, it is conceivable that a doctor might have \narrived at the same decision. Do not assume for a second I was assuming \nthat Nitai's life definitely would have been saved but at least they \nmight have had more choices. At least the choice should have been left \nto the doctor looking at this young man and not a decision made by an \ninsurance company or an insurance employee who, with all due respect, \nhas no business making the decision of whether or not extended hospital \ncare for this child ought to be covered.\n  I thank the Moscovitch family for allowing me to talk about their \nson. I called them to seek their permission to talk about their son. I \nwas told by Nitai's brother that, in fact, the family had discussed it \nand hoped I would because it might, just might, make a difference. It \nmay convince some who are wavering about whether or not this bill is \nwarranted, whether or not this effort is worthwhile. It may be the case \nthat one family, one individual will have a more profound effect than \nall of the numbers and millions of people and billions of dollars we \ntalk about. It is family by family, patient by patient that the effects \nof not passing this legislation are most felt.\n  Putting patients first means guaranteeing access to emergency room \ncoverage when a rational person would say emergency care was needed. It \nmeans ensuring access to doctors qualified to treat a condition, and \nthat it is those doctors who will decide the best course of treatment. \nPutting patients first means making sure that patients with illnesses \nthat have not been cured by conventional treatment are not denied the \nchance to participate in potentially life-saving clinical trials. It \nmeans making sure that a patient and his family can have the \nprescription drugs doctors say they need, not just the drugs the \ninsurance company says are cheaper.\n  Other managed care bills have been introduced in this Congress that \nare watered-down versions. They are weaker versions. They are not truly \na Patients' Bill of Rights. The Bipartisan Patient Protection Act is \nthe only bipartisan legislation that will offer managed care patients \nand providers that serve them reasonable protections. The bill allows \npatients and doctors to determine the best course of care, establishes \nan independent appeals process for patients who believe they were \nunfairly denied care, and allows patients to hold health care plans \naccountable when they make those decisions.\n  I hope our colleagues allow this debate to go forward. Let not \nanother day pass in delaying a debate on amendments on this bill. It is \nblatantly unfair. Forget Democrats and Republicans. What you do to my \nparty, sitting on this side of the aisle, is not terribly relevant; put \nthat aside. If you will, think of the people you represent in your \nStates. Even if you don't like this bill, offer your ideas on your \napproach to this. But allow an amendment process to go forward.\n  It is unfair to these people, after 5 years, to not allow a full \ndebate on amendments on this bill. That is what this institution was \ncreated for. It is what we ought to be engaged in. Now after the second \nday of listening to statements about this bill, it is time we started \ndebating amendments. My hope is that will be the case.\n  I understand the commitment of our distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Daschle, when he says we will stay here, we will stay here \nuntil this bill is properly and fully considered. It may be defeated. \nAt the end of the day, 51 Members may decide to defeat this bill. I \nwould be terribly unhappy if that were the case, but at least we would \nhave had a chance to debate and consider amendments. Sitting here day \nafter day, hour after hour, without the chance to consider amendments \nand vote on an important subject such as this is dreadful. My hope is \nmy colleagues who are engaged in this delaying practice will cease and \ndesist.\n  I commend the authors of this bill and look forward to supporting \nthem in the amendment process. My sincere hope is at the end of this \ndiscussion we will have amended the law and that the millions of \nAmericans who are insured and preempted by Federal law as well as all \nthe others with private insurance, will get the protections they \ndeserve.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains in this block?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes remain.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Connecticut has covered\n\n[[Page S6496]]\n\nthe subject of needed patient protections well. Let me, in the few \nshort remaining minutes, make a couple of comments--some I have made \nbefore.\n  Let me narrow the issue down. It is about the right of patients to \nget the health care they deserve and that they think they have under \ntheir managed care plans. Often however, that care is actually denied \nthem.\n  Patients ought to have a right to understand all of their medical \noptions for treatment, not just the cheapest. They ought to have a \nright to medically necessary care without arbitrary HMO interference. \nThey ought to have a right to go to an emergency room when they have an \nemergency. They ought to have a right to see a specialist when they \nhave a need to consult a specialist. They ought to have the right to a \nfair and speedy process for resolving disputes.\n  Let me see if I can use a couple of pictures to describe what these \nrights mean. This young child was born with a horrible facial defect. A \ncleft palate which is a horrible defect of the top lip. Plastic \nsurgeons say in about 50 percent of the cases, a managed care \norganization says this is something that is not medically necessary to \ncorrect. It's correction is not medically necessary? Imagine having \nthis child and being told by a managed care organization that it is not \nmedically necessary to correct this defect!\n  I spoke yesterday about a young woman named Donna Marie McIlwaine. \nDonna is from New York. Her mother, Mary Lewandowski, testified before \na hearing I held on managed care. This beautiful young lady is not with \nus any longer. Donna died. Her mother described the circumstances of \nher death. For want of a $750 lung scan, this young girl died as a \nresult of a blood clot in her lung the size of a football. Donna's \nmother called the doctor and she called the hospital, but to no avail. \nThis young woman died because she didn't get a $750 lung scan that \nwould have shown a blood clot the size of a football in her lung. And \nshe died. She died on the evening of February 8, 1997. Her mother, God \nbless her, Mary Lewandowski, has been to Washington at her own expense, \nas a missionary to say ``pass this legislation and don't let this \nhappen to another child!''\n  I have described before, this young man, Christopher Roe, whom I \nlearned about at a hearing I held in November--and if you are tired of \nhearing about him--I have talked about Christopher several times--if \nyou are tired of hearing about him, tough luck because I will keep \ntalking of his tragic circumstance. His mother held this picture high \nas she began to sob when she testified about this 16-year-old boy who \ndied on his birthday. Christopher was fighting cancer, and fighting the \nmanaged care organization at the same time for the care he needed and \ndidn't get. This young boy had cancer. He needed some treatment. He \nneeded a chance. He needed some experimental treatment, a chance to get \nthrough this and successfully wage war against this dreaded disease.\n  But time ticked away and the managed care organization said, no, no, \nno. And finally this young boy, flat on his back in bed, died on his \n16th birthday. Before he died, his mother told us, crying: \n``Christopher looked up at me and said, Mom, how can they do this to a \nkid?''\n  This is not some ethereal debate about what you think or what I \nthink. This is about whether patients have the protections they believe \nexist in their managed care policies.\n\n  Are we going to say that we stand on the side of patients? Are we \ngoing to stand on the side of doctors? Are we going to stand on the \nside of nurses who know that the only real good health care that is \ndelivered is delivered by health care professionals in a clinic or in a \nhospital room? It is not health care delivered or decisions made in an \ninsurance company or managed care office by some junior accountant \n1,000 miles away. Yet all too often that is what is happening. It is \nwhy Christopher Roe is no longer with us. This young boy lost his \nbattle fighting cancer and he lost his battle fighting a managed care \norganization.\n  That, my friends, is not a fair fight. We know that. That is why we \npropose passing a piece of legislation called the Patient Protection \nAct or the Patient's Bill of Rights. There will be a lot of discussion \nand debate about this for a long period. At the end of the day, the \nonly question is, Whose corner are you in? With whom do you stand? Are \nyou with the patients, doctors, and the nurses? Or are you with the \nmanaged care organization and the insurance industry who say they don't \nwant this?\n  In the names of Christopher Roe and Donna, and so many others that I \nhave discussed previously on the floor of the Senate, we ought to do \nwhat is right. We ought to do the right thing. This legislation has \nbeen four years in the making. This is a long gestation period. We have \ndebated, debated, and debated again. We have compromised, compromised, \nand compromised on this legislation. It is now time for us to own up to \nthis responsibility. Let's pass this bill. Let's do it now and do it \nright.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are now debating the crucial issue of \npatients' rights. For better or worse, we have a health care system \nthat increasingly uses managed care to organize and deliver services. \nOver the next week or two or more, we are here to debate what we need \nto do to protect patients and to restore balance to our new system \ndominated by managed care companies, whether insurance companies or \nHMOs.\n  Let's be clear; patients need protections. For a variety of reasons--\nbad customer service, bad incentives that lead to a conflict between \ncare and the bottom line, and simple carelessness and neglect--too many \npatients have been mistreated by their health care insurance companies. \nThat is why every State in the Nation has acted on this measure to \nprovide protections because we have seen this mistreatment range from \nthe heartbreaking to the mundane.\n  We have all heard the rare but tragic horror stories in which a \nmanaged care company denies desperately needed care, sometimes with \ncatastrophic results for the patient. Many of us have actually \nexperienced the all too common phenomenon, nuisances of being forced to \nmake phone call after phone call to get routine care authorized or \nhaving to wait longer than should be necessary to get an appointment \nwith a doctor in a limited network of managed care providers.\n  That is why I voted in the past for comprehensive managed care reform \nbills that will deal with the federally regulated plans. This is why I \nhave confidence that I will again vote for a good patient protection \nbill at the end of this debate.\n  We have heard some statements on the floor--I think maybe we ought to \nbring a little reality to it--saying we have to pass this bill right \naway. This bill is a moving target; it is a shell game, trying to \nfigure out which version is the latest version, what version is the \noperative version. It did not go through the committee.\n  People talked about maybe we want to compromise some of it. Normally \nthe compromise, working out of these details, happens in committee. \nThat is why we send a committee markup to the floor. We did not do it \nthis time. So we are going to have to do the committee's work in this \nChamber.\n  But when I hear people talk about how there are 50,000 people being \ndenied insurance, we hear about tragedies that happen every day, some \nsay if we wait a day longer or a week longer, more patients are going \nto get denied care--just a little bit of reality. The effective date of \nthe McCain-Kennedy bill is October of 2002. That is October of 2002, a \nyear and a quarter from now. So while it is important that we deal with \nthis bill, it is important that we not pass a bad bill. We have the \ntime, and we must take the time, to make sure what we do is a good \nproduct.\n  Legislating is a difficult job. It inevitably involves striking a \nbalance between competing goals. In this debate, that tradeoff is \nbetween specific patient protections and the costs those protections \nwill impose on an already strained health care system.\n  Mr. President, 43 million Americans lack health insurance coverage. \nThat is an important fact to remember and one we have to keep in mind \nas we deal with assuring that patients are protected. Even if Congress \ndoes nothing here, that number is almost certain to go up, perhaps \ndramatically, in the\n\n[[Page S6497]]\n\nwake of health care costs that are shooting up 13 percent this year, \nfollowing a year in which they rose by 12 percent. That is more than a \n26-percent increase in just 2 years, a rate that is not sustainable. I \nmight add, in the next year or two cost increases are expected to rise \nby about the same amount.\n\n  The goal of managed care, of HMOs and others, is to assure health \ncare but to maintain some limit on the cost because anybody who has \nstudied economics 101 knows if costs are totally unreasonable, you are \nnot going to get the service. That service in this case is the vitally \nimportant service of health care coverage.\n  Employers, particularly small businesses, make a valiant effort to \nstruggle through and provide health care insurance to their employees. \nI have talked to and listened to an awful lot of small businesspeople \nand their employees who are concerned about this particular bill as \nwell as health care costs in general. As costs go up, fewer and fewer \nsmall businesses will provide care.\n  In our employer-based health care system, 75 percent of Americans \nwith insurance get all or some of that coverage through an employer. We \nhave to be careful. We have to be careful to ensure that we do not \ndrive, particularly small businesses, out of the business of providing \ngood health care coverage for their employees.\n  This is the dilemma. It is really the crux of what we will be talking \nabout over the next several weeks: Which patient protections are \nworthwhile and when is the price of lost coverage too high?\n  Let me emphasize that. What is the cost in terms of health care \ncoverage to increasing the cost of health care protection? After all, a \npro-patient protection bill that takes away a family's health insurance \ndoes not provide any protection at all. If they lose their coverage, we \nhave done exactly what we should not have done, and that is to deny \nthem any coverage.\n  With all this in mind--the importance of patient protections, the \ndanger of rising costs--what should we support? In the past I voted \nfor, and I will vote for again, a strong Patients' Bill of Rights that \ncontains basic, reasonable, commonsense patient protection.\n  This includes guaranteed access to emergency room care. Americans \nshould not have to worry their insurance company will not pay for \nnecessary emergency care or even for care that reasonably seems to be \nan emergency. I have gone to the emergency room with problems that \nlooked very serious and after treatment found out, although they were a \nproblem, they needed care but they were not a critical emergency. But \nthose should be covered.\n  Second, a guarantee that patients get all information on treatment \noptions. Doctors and patients need to be able to discuss openly all \npossible treatment options without gag rules.\n  Third, a right to a quick, independent, and expert appeal process. \nThere must be an appeal to a medical expert outside of the HMO to \nguarantee the HMO is not focusing too much on its bottom line and not \nenough on the patient's bottom.\n  The appeal must be quick so patients get care when they need it, \nstrong managed protections for our children, such as the ones I \nincluded in Healthy Kids 2000 legislation 2 years ago. These include \nthe right for a child to go see a pediatrician without being forced to \nsee a nonpediatrician gatekeeper. Pediatricians are not specialists to \nwhom children need to be referred. They should be a child's first line \nof care.\n  Next, the right for a child to see a specialist with pediatric \nexpertise, including going to children's hospitals when necessary. \nChildren are different from adults. Their care is different. Doctors \nwho primarily treat adults are not always prepared to interpret and \nattend the unique needs of children. A sick child needs to go to \nsomebody who specializes in taking care of sick children.\n  The right to have a pediatric expert review a child's case when \nappealing an HMO decision. Again, even an experienced medical \npractitioner who deals only with adults may not have the ability, the \nexpertise, and the training to make a decision about what kind of care \na child needs.\n  Let me tell you a few things about what I do not support in the \npatient protection debate. Unfortunately, I must put at the top of the \nlist of what I cannot support the McCain-Kennedy bill. The McCain-\nKennedy bill contains some good provisions--all of them do. There are \ngood provisions in all of these bills. But the McCain-Kennedy bill is \noverzealous; it goes much too far towards creating a litigation-heavy, \ncostly new world of health care.\n  I will take the opportunity in the following days and weeks to go \ninto detail on some of the glaring problems presented by the McCain-\nKennedy bill and the profound threat this legislation poses to \ncontinued health care coverage for millions of Americans. For now, let \nme begin by highlighting the major flaws in this significantly flawed \nbill.\n  Problem No. 1, the McCain bill will dramatically increase health care \ncosts and will take away the health insurance of more than a million \nAmericans. The new costs this bill imposes will be paid by everybody \nwho has health insurance. The lucky ones will just pay more. The \nunlucky ones will lose their coverage. That price is simply too high.\n  Next, the cost of this bill will hit small businesses and small \nbusiness employees particularly hard. Without the clout of larger \ncompanies, small businesses right now face higher prices and have more \ndifficult administrative hurdles when they try to buy health care. \nWhile this makes it far more difficult for small businesses to provide \nhealth care, millions of small companies try to find a way and do it \nanyway. I fear that will dramatically change if the McCain-Kennedy bill \npasses.\n  Since late last week when it was announced that we would be debating \nthe McCain-Kennedy bill, my office has been inundated with letters, \ncalls, and faxes from small businesses in Missouri. The message has \nbeen unanimous. Missouri's small businesses are struggling to provide \nhealth care despite high costs. They fear what the Kennedy-McCain bill \nwill do to their ability to pay for health care. Many say they will \ndrop their coverage if McCain-Kennedy passes.\n  This is not just a phenomenon related to my State. This is what we in \nthe Committee on Small Business are hearing from across the country.\n  Let me read excerpts from one of the many letters I have received. I \nwill not use his name, but I want to give you a flavor by telling about \nthe important parts of the letter.\n  He says:\n\n       I am writing this letter in regard to Senator Kennedy's \n     Patients' Bill of Rights, S. 283. My family owns a small \n     agriculture business selling certain kinds of farm equipment \n     and lawn equipment with a fully staffed sales, parts, and \n     service department. I offer health care coverage to my \n     employees and paid 100 percent on the premiums until about 5 \n     years ago when our health care costs got too high to \n     continue. So I went to 50 percent on both the employees and \n     their dependents, thus helping our business but strapping my \n     employees with added costs to raise their families.\n       This year our health insurance went up 34 percent. Last \n     year, it was only 24 percent. But where is this going to \n     stop? How am I, as a business owner who has 23 families \n     depending on me for their livelihood, supposed to make a \n     profit in order to pay them a livable wage and benefit \n     package in a severely depressed agriculture economy while our \n     liberal Government leaders are trying to further increase my \n     expenses? If these costs escalate much further, I anticipate \n     that I will have to drop my health plan altogether, \n     especially if I am to be held responsible for medical court \n     cases. I will, at a minimum, drop my group health coverage \n     and think very long and hard about closing down and counting \n     my interest and rent checks instead of continuing to run this \n     business.\n\n  We need relief from Government regulations that are sucking all the \nprofits out of our organizations causing us to employ one person to do \nnothing but Government paperwork. We need to eliminate the death tax or \ninheritance tax. Please just say no to Kennedy care disasters.\n  From time to time during the debate on this bill I will read from \nother letters from Missouri businesses to remind us of the real-world \nimpact of this legislation.\n  On this chart, I have an up to the minute count of the employees of \nMissouri's small businesses that would, as I understand, lose their \nhealth care coverage if McCain-Kennedy passes. These are letters from \nsmall businesses\n\n[[Page S6498]]\n\nin Missouri that say that, as of this date, if Kennedy-McCain passes, \nthey will drop their health care plan. Our running total on the number \nof employees who will lose health care if this bill is signed into law \nright now is 1,042.\n  That may not seem to be a lot, but that is a tremendous burden on \nthose employees and their families. These are real people. These are \nthe ones who will be totally unprotected if we pass the McCain-Kennedy \nlegislation.\n  Rest assured that I will seek opportunities during this debate to \nfind ways to shield small businesses and employees from the most \noutrageous aspects of this legislation.\n  I don't think anybody intended to cause health care coverage to be \ndropped. That was certainly not my understanding of the objective of \nthis bill, but sometimes what we do here in Washington has unintended \nconsequences. Very often the unintended consequences are far greater \nthan the beneficial consequences.\n  Cost-benefit is something we neglect too often. I intend to make sure \nmy colleagues focus on the costs as well as the benefits.\n  A second problem of the McCain-Kennedy bill is that it focuses too \nmuch on lawsuits and trial attorneys by encouraging endless litigation. \nLawsuits are an avenue for retrospective blame and incrimination after \nsomeone claims they are harmed. Lawsuits in no way contribute to high-\nquality care. Instead of turning health care over to lawyers, the focus \nshould be on making sure patients get the care when they need it before \nany harm occurs.\n  When you are sick, you want to see a doctor--not a lawyer. When I \nhear about all of these protections from subsequent lawsuits, I am not \nvery interested in leaving my heirs with a bunch of lawsuit claims \nagainst a bunch of defendants if I am gone. I want to have a bill that \nmakes sure that I can get the kind of care I need when I am really \nsick. That is what I think the American people have a right to ask.\n  A third problem of this bill is that it nationalizes the regulation \nof health care. State governments have traditionally overseen health \ncare and health insurance, and, as I mentioned, every State in the \nNation has done something in this area. They have tried different ways. \nMany of them have done good jobs.\n  I believe it was Justice Douglas who said ours is a laboratory where \nStates perform experiments to see which legislation works best. The \nStates have been out there doing it. In fact, as I said, every State \nhas passed some type of State level patient protection act. Now the \nMcCain-Kennedy bill comes along and threatens to impose a one-size-\nfits-all scheme that will do away with most or all of the tried and \ntested State law reforms. Some of them may be better than others. We \nwill not know if we pass the McCain-Kennedy bill that eliminates all \nthe State options.\n  Even worse, it will turn over much of the new Federal regulation of \ninsurance to the Health Care Financing Administration, one of the most \nheavyhanded, unresponsive, arrogant bureaucracies in all of Washington.\n  I have spoken in this Chamber before about the Health Care Financing \nAdministration. A couple of years ago, the Health Care Financing \nAdministration was overzealous in its effort to cut the cost of home \nhealth care. Instead of saving the $16 billion that Congress asked it \nto save, it is on the path to saving $60 billion by shutting down \nhealth care provided in homes.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I was contacted by \nmany small entities providing home health care services. I set up the \nhearing. I invited the representatives of these home health care \nagencies who believed they were being unfairly treated by HCFA to come \nto Washington. A number of my colleagues wanted to testify. I invited \nHCFA to come and listen to their comments and provide their response. \nIt seems reasonable, doesn't it? You have a Government bureaucracy that \nis the subject of all kinds of outrage. You let the people come in and \ntell what they see as the problem. Then you give the bureaucracy an \nopportunity to respond, to tell their side of the story.\n  Do you know what HCFA said? They didn't want to sit around and listen \nto the complaints of those they regulate. They would be happy to \ntestify if they could testify along with other Senators. I forgot to \ncheck to see how many States elected the officials of HCFA to serve in \nthe Senate. The best I can tell, none.\n  This is the agency that would tell State governments what kinds of \nhealth care provisions they could have. I don't think so. That is not \nthe way we need to go.\n  Finally, in what I think is a major oversight in the Kennedy-McCain \nbill, it doesn't do a single thing to help Americans get access to \nhealth coverage. At the same time, it is threatening coverage from \nmillions of Americans. If we are going to do harm, we ought to be \nprepared to help. That is why I intend to continue with my effort of \nintroducing an amendment that will immediately allow self-employed \nAmericans, including the 34.8 million uninsured Americans in families \nheaded by a self-employed individual, to fully deduct their health \ninsurance expenses.\n  Patients need protection through a Patients' Bill of Rights. But \nthere is a right way and a wrong way to do it. The right way limits \nitself to commonsense reforms that help patients get care when they \nneed it. The wrong way--the McCain-Kennedy way--encourages endless \nlitigation, nationalizes health care oversight, and takes away \ninsurance coverage from more than 1 million Americans.\n  There are some people who say this bill is a lawyers' bill of rights, \nnot a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  What is wrong with the right to sue?\n  The McCain-Kennedy bill is a trial lawyer's dream that will raise \nhealth care costs, subject our health care system to frivolous \nlawsuits, and will make trial attorneys rich. Despite Democratic \ninsistence, this will put employers at risk of being sued. The so-\ncalled cap on damages in the McCain-Kennedy bill is practically \nworthless because it applies only in one area and leaves a variety of \nother types of damages uncapped. There are no caps on attorneys' fees \nand the outrageous contingency fees many trial lawyers force on their \nclients.\n  What types of lawsuits should we allow?\n  Because of the destructive capacity of plaintiffs' attorneys, we must \nbe extremely cautious with any new lawsuits. I realize there are some \nsituations where we need to expand the right to sue, but first \neverything must flow through an appeals process through which a patient \ncan go outside the HMO to get an expert's second opinion.\n  Before we resort to lawsuits--which can't provide care--we must ask \npatients to complete this appeals process because it can result in a \npatient getting care. And that is what we should be talking about. But \nif a health insurer doesn't comply with a independent expert decision \nthat a patient should get care, on it acts in bad faith or extreme \nnegligence by denying care that the independent expert says is needed, \nthe patient should be allowed to sue for damages.\n  The McCain-Kennedy bill limits punitive damages--although they call \nit a ``civil assessment'' to $5 million in the new Federal lawsuits \ntheir bill will allow. But economic and noneconomic damages in Federal \nlawsuits are still uncapped. It won't be hard for trial lawyers to find \nways to milk these alternative types of uncapped damages for all they \nare worth.\n  At the State level, the McCain-Kennedy bill does nothing to impose \ncaps on damages, even for punitive damages. While some States have \ntheir own damage caps for malpractice lawsuits, in many States these \ncaps won't apply to the new lawsuits and the new Federalization of \nState health insurance regulation permitted under the McCain-Kennedy \nbill.\n  Bottom line--the caps in the McCain-Kennedy bill barely provide even \na fig leaf of protection for those who will be sued.\n  The State-level health care liability system that exists for doctors \nhas failed. It dramatically increases costs through defensive medicine. \nIt encourages doctors to quit the profession. And not only does it not \nencourage quality care, it hinders quality care by creating a code of \nsilence that prevents health professionals from talking about how to \nsystematically avoid medical mistakes.\n  Studies show that most people who get negligently harmed in health \ncare\n\n[[Page S6499]]\n\ndo not get compensated, and those that are compensated are often not \nharmed. Again, studies show that whether or not a patient was \nnegligently harmed has almost no connection to whether they get \ncompensated.\n  The American tort system is like a lottery in which most patients \nlose, a handful of patients win big on a random basis, and trial \nlawyers strike it rich by raking off the top of each lawsuit.\n  This is a huge flaw in the system to which the Kennedy-McCain bill \nwill subject us even more.\n  Some supporters of the McCain-Kennedy bill claim their bill exempts \nemployers from the new lawsuits permitted by the bill. That is a great \nline. My colleagues pointed out, on page 144 it says: This ``does not \nauthorize a cause of action against an employer or other plan sponsor \nmaintaining the plan . . .'' That is the good news. The bad news comes \nin the next paragraph. It says:\n\n       (B) Certain Causes of Action Permitted. Notwithstanding \n     subparagraph (A), a cause of action may arise against an \n     employer or other plan sponsor . . .'' And then it lists the \n     exceptions. It goes down this page, goes down this page, goes \n     down this page, goes down this page, and comes over to this \n     page. Those are the exceptions. That is what happens to you \n     if you are an employer.\n\n  That is why, with four pages of exceptions, a lot of employers of \nsmall businesses in my State and around the country are simply going to \nhave to get out of the business of providing health care. It scares the \nheck out of them, and it should.\n  As we heard from small businesses, this is their concern. They want \ngood health care for their employees, but they cannot afford to stay in \nbusiness and expose themselves to the lottery of a tort system out of \ncontrol.\n  If employers are so well protected, why are they scared? Well, \nsimply, they are not exempt. If the right to sue is so great, why not \nprovide all employees the right to sue--Federal Government workers, \nseniors in Medicare, all of the other causes? We look at it, and it is \nprobably too expensive for the Federal Government. Think of what it is \nfor the patients who are employees of small businesses. If they lose \ntheir health care coverage, it does little good for them to know that \nmaybe--just maybe--they would have had the right to sue.\n  We are having the right debate, but the McCain-Kennedy bill is the \nwrong solution. I urge my colleagues to take a look at this seriously \nflawed legislation and to help us improve it. If we succeed in making \nsubstantial changes, I hope we will pass a dramatically different bill \nthat represents a more reasonable and affordable approach.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, how much time is left on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Three minutes. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I will be very brief. I commend the Senator from Missouri for \noutlining what are really the fundamental problems in this legislation. \nIt boils down to the fact that essentially, with the same patient \nprotections that are in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, they offer it \nat a price which drives hundreds of thousands of people to the ranks of \nthe uninsured.\n  The Senator from Missouri just had up a chart in relation to the \nnumber of employees of small businesses who are going to lose their \ninsurance because of this bill. It tells the whole story. Over the next \nseveral days we will be able to weave together why. But it goes down to \nwhat the Senator from Missouri just outlined.\n  You have to read the bill. You have to look at the exceptions. In the \nbill there is the statement that employers are excluded, but then you \ngo through exception after exception after exception, where you have \nthese lawsuits where the employer can be sued. That creates insecurity \nand uncertainty for the future. Clearly, an employer is not going to \nmaintain that new liability which can put him or her out of business \nthe next day.\n  One of the problems we will get to in reading the bill--and I only \nhave a couple minutes now--is the fact that under the Kennedy bill, \nonce you get to court, you can go either to State court or Federal \ncourt. If you do not like Federal court, you can go back to State \ncourt. If you go to State court, since there are 50 different State \ncourts, you can shop from court to court.\n  If you are an insurance company, and you cover five or six States, \nand a patient sues you, that patient will say: Well, they cover, for \nexample, Alabama, and there are no caps, no limits there--the tort may \nbe very different--I can sue for an unlimited amount. You have forum \nshopping on the States.\n  You can go to State court or Federal court. If you go to State court, \nthere are unlimited economic damages under the Kennedy bill, and \nunlimited noneconomic damages, and, for pain and suffering, unlimited \npunitive damages.\n  Let's say you flip and go to Federal court. If you go to Federal \ncourt, again there are unlimited economic damages, unlimited \nnoneconomic damages, and, yes, there is this $5 million limit on \npunitive damages. You might decide to go back to State court: No caps, \nno limits--shopping back and forth. That is what is in the underlying \nbill.\n  Can it be changed? Hopefully, it can be changed during the debate. \nClearly, this sort of forum shopping between Federal court for \nnonmedically reviewable decisions--in the new bill, which is just \nintroduced three nights ago, there is a whole new provision which \ngreatly expands what you can go to Federal court for, and I quote what \nis in the new bill--it was not in the bill 5 days ago but is in the new \nbill--``violation of any duty under the plan,'' which is a brand new \nexpansive right to sue.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have at this juncture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 50 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Fifty seconds.\n  So we do have to read the bill. Again, it is going to take time as we \ngo through it line by line. When you see this expansive new right to \nsue in Federal court, which was not there last week or a month ago or 2 \nmonths ago or in last year's bill--I don't know if it was snuck in; it \nis in this new bill--all of a sudden it opens up a whole new category \nfor which you go to Federal court. But if you do not like that, maybe \nyou will decide to go to State court. There is no bifurcation in the \nbill as written.\n  Once again, that is just an example of why we need to read the bill. \nIt is critical that we do so as we move forward; otherwise, we are \ngoing to cause hundreds of thousands of people to lose their insurance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, during the next few days, we have the \nopportunity to finish important work that was started years ago. We can \nfinally enact meaningful patient protection legislation by passing the \nMcCain-Edwards-Kennedy Bipartisan Patient Protection Act. The time has \ncome to ensure that patients of managed care organizations receive the \nprotections that they deserve and HMOs can be held accountable when \nthey wrongfully delay or deny coverage.\n  Many times, it is difficult for people to understand how the issues \nwe debate here relate to their everyday lives, but that is not the case \nwith patients' rights legislation. The preponderance of managed care \norganizations makes it crucial that participants in these plans have \nbasic protections. Over 25 percent of the U.S. population is enrolled \nin an HMO. Over 60 percent of Americans and over 75 percent of insured \nemployees are in some form of managed care. Receiving health care \nthrough managed care organizations is not a matter of choice for most \nof the 160 million Americans in these plans and uniformly providing \nquality care should be the standard for health insurers.\n  I hear from my constituents about this issue constantly and they are \nanxious for this legislation to be debated, voted on, and signed into \nlaw. They want guaranteed access to specialists. They want to be sure \nthey can receive emergency services as soon as possible and from any \nappropriate provider. They want to be able to participate in life-\nsaving clinical trials. They want a fair, independent and timely \nappeals process when HMOs deny care. And they want to know that their \nHMOs will be held accountable for the harm\n\n[[Page S6500]]\n\ncaused by wrongful denials or delays in coverage. The Bipartisan \nPatient Protection Act ensures patients receive common sense \nprotections and this bill provides these protections without \nsignificantly increasing health care costs or unfairly opening \nemployers up to liability.\n  Like my colleagues, I have heard from hundreds of constituents who \nare deeply concerned about the unfair treatment they receive from their \nHMOs. They have been in situations that any of us would dread. They \ndiscover they are ill, or that their child or spouse is ill. These \nsituations are taxing enough, but many of my constituents and many \nAmericans throughout this country find that in addition to fighting a \npersonal or family illness, they have to muster extra strength to \nbattle their HMO. When people are at their most vulnerable, they are \nbeing treated unfairly and being denied the care to which they are \nentitled. This legislation will put a stop to these practices.\n  The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill would not subject an employer to \nliability for HMOs unless the employer ``directly participates'' in a \nhealth treatment decision. Only those very large employers who run \ntheir own HMO would be liable. So if an employer were not acting as an \nHMO, they would not be held accountable as an HMO. In addition, the \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated that this legislation would \nonly modestly increase costs--4.2 percent over 10 years. Of this modest \nincrease, only .8 percent is attributed to the liability provisions of \nthe bill.\n  As we debate this measure, the experience of one of my constituents \ncomes to mind. She is a young woman who loves the outdoors. One weekend \nduring a hiking trip in the Shenandoah Mountains, she lost her footing \nand plummeted to the ground from a 40-foot cliff. Though she suffered \nsignificant injuries, she was fortunate to have survived.\n  Unfortunately, her fight to get well was not the only challenge she \nfaced after her accident. Her HMO denied her claim on the grounds that \nshe had failed to gain pre-authorization for her emergency room visit. \nShe fractured her arms, pelvis and skull. Her survival was largely \ndependent upon her being airlifted from the trail to a nearby hospital \nand her bills climbed to over $10,000.\n  Apparently her HMO wanted her to call for preauthorization before she \nreceived emergency care. This would have been an impressive feat for \nher considering she was unconscious at the foot of a mountain. I am \nunsure exactly when this young woman was supposed to have made this \ncall to her HMO. When she was unconscious on the ground with broken \nbones? Or maybe when she was in the helicopter being flown to the \nemergency room?\n  The fact that she had to fight with her HMO to pay the claims for \nover a year illustrates the importance of this legislation. All this \ntime, the unpaid hospital bills stacked up and almost forced her into \nbankruptcy. Unlike many stories, this one did not end as tragically as \nit could have. This young woman did eventually get her insurer to pay \nher medical expenses, but only after the Maryland Insurance \nAdministration ordered the HMO to do so. Her unnecessary ordeal and \nother stories that end up in tragedy show us that the time has come to \nstop the delaying tactics and pass meaningful patient protection \nlegislation.\n  If an HMO wrongfully denies care, if it purposely limits diagnostic \ntests, if it refuses to cover necessary emergency care, if it withholds \naccess to a needed specialist all in the name of saving money, then the \npatient who was harmed by these actions should have the right to hold \nthat HMO accountable.\n  Now we have a bipartisan effort to move this legislation. The authors \nof this bill have worked tirelessly to try to please opponents and they \nhave made significant adjustments. They have limited punitive damages \nin Federal court to $5 million. They have allowed State caps on damages \nto stand. They have prohibited parallel causes of action in Federal and \nState court. However, they have not and should not refuse to abandon \nthe main principles of any true patient protection legislation. We have \nto make sure any bill we pass is as strong as the bill the House passed \nin 1999.\n  I commend Senator Daschle for placing such a high priority on \npatients' rights legislation. His decision to make it the first bill to \nbe debated on the floor under his leadership shows his commitment to \nthis issue. The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy legislation provides strong, \nenforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. This bill is long overdue and we \nshould pass it now.\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nyielding me time.\n  Families across our country are being denied the medical care they \nneed. These are people who have insurance. They paid their premiums. \nThey think they are covered, but when they need care, too often they \nfind their insurance company is most concerned about its immediate \nbottom line rather than their health care.\n  Like my colleagues, I cringe at the stories I have heard: A parent \ntaking a child with a 105-degree fever to the emergency room in the \nmiddle of the night only to be told later that their insurance would \nnot pay for the care that was needed; doctors offer their best medical \nopinions only to see them overruled by an insurance company. Too often \nthe system makes it harder for patients to get the care they need. \nThere is more of a focus on short-term costs than quality care.\n  The truth is those decisions by insurance companies and HMOs have \nreal consequences. A child's condition may worsen. A dad might not be \nable to go to work. A mom may need around-the-clock medical care. But \nunder the current system, these patients have no legal recourse. If the \ncompany they paid medical coverage to makes a bad decision, there is \nlittle recourse. That is wrong. That is one of the problems I hope we \ncan fix by passing the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act.\n  For several years, I have been working in the HELP Committee, with my \ncolleague presiding today, and here on the floor to make sure that \npatients get the kind of care they need. Last Congress, the other side \nput forth a very hollow bill that excluded many Americans and didn't \nprovide the protection patients needed. But this year, we finally have \na real chance to help families. That is why I am proud that this is the \nfirst major bill being offered in a Democratic-controlled Senate.\n  I support S. 1052, the Bipartisan Patient Protection Act. It gives \npatients the protections they need. During this debate, many amendments \nwill be offered. Some of them will weaken the bill and draw the debate \naway from patient protections. I will call those attempts as I see \nthem. I will work to make sure that patients' rights are not watered \ndown over the course of the debate.\n  Health care quality and access are top issues for people in my home \nState of Washington. A few weeks ago, I spoke at a forum on health care \nin Olympia, WA. We were expecting at the most maybe 100 people would \ncome to that event. When I arrived at the Olympia Center, I saw almost \n600 people packed into the auditorium and into rooms they had opened \nfor overflow. They turned out in tremendous numbers and spoke with such \ngreat passion because they are concerned about access to health care.\n  As we begin this year's debate in the Senate, I want to outline some \nof the problems of our current system and some of the reforms I believe \nare really needed. I do mention that we are not trying to eliminate \nmanaged care. In fact, it is important that we have ways to coordinate \ncare and focus on prevention and wellness and to diagnose problems \nsooner. When the incentives are right, managed care can work.\n  In Washington State, it has helped play a role in improving life \nexpectancy, lowering infant mortality, and ensuring women get \nmammograms. Unfortunately, however, today the incentives are all wrong. \nThey focus more on cost than on care, more on a company's short-term \nfinancial health than on a patient's long-term physical health. We need \nto change the incentives so people are fighting illness, not fighting \ntheir insurance company.\n\n  We need to make sure insurance protects you when you become ill and \nprevents you from becoming sick in the first place. We need a system \nwhere\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\ndoctors are not spending 45 minutes on the phone with an insurance \ncompany so a sick child can be admitted to a hospital. We need a system \nwhere parents can take an injured child to the closest emergency room \ninstead of one that is miles away because the insurer demands it. We \nneed a system where the ultimate decision rests in the hands of \npatients based on the best medical advice of their own physician.\n  We need simply to restore the doctor-patient relationship. Too often \ntoday a doctor is allowed to be little more than a consultant. \nSometimes his or her recommendations are accepted. Other times they are \nnot because someone else made a decision for that patient, someone who \nhas not even seen that patient and who is not even a qualified or \nlicensed health care provider. We need to help companies that are \ntrying to do the right thing but are being beaten out by some bad \nplayers. We need a system where patients will know up front what their \nown rights are.\n  These days it is only when they become seriously ill that patients \nlearn how good or bad their insurer or their HMO is. That is why we \nneed clear, uniform, Federal quality control standards that protect all \nconsumers. Those are some of the changes we should seek.\n  I now turn to a few specific points I will be fighting for in this \ndebate.\n  First of all, we need to guarantee access to specialty care. \nSecondly, we need to guarantee access to clinical trials and \ncomprehensive care. We need to cover emergency treatment and not just \nthe care provided in the emergency room itself. We need to make sure we \nprotect as many Americans as possible. Some bills have such a limited \nscope that many patients would get no protection.\n  Finally, we need to make sure that plans are held accountable for \nhealth care decisions and that the external review process is objective \nand timely.\n  Those are some of the things I will be fighting to make sure we keep \nin this debate.\n  We know that patients aren't getting the care they need. We know what \nthe problems are, and we have a bill in front of us that will fix them.\n  The American people have been waiting too long for real health care \nprotection, and we have an obligation in the Senate to give them the \ncoverage they need. That is what this coming debate will be about.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a number of our colleagues want to \naddress the Senate. So I will speak briefly this afternoon.\n  I want to come back to one of the provisions I believe is so \nimportant in our legislation. I don't think there really should be any \ndoubt about our strong commitment in the Senate to protecting American \npatients on the issue of clinical trials.\n  As I mentioned earlier when I had a brief exchange with my friend and \ncolleague from North Carolina, I think any Patients' Bill of Rights \nthat is going to be worthy of its name is going to provide good \nprotection for clinical trials. As I have mentioned on other occasions, \nwe have seen a vast expansion of basic research and commitment by this \nbody. We have doubled the NIH budget in recent times. Recently we have \nwitnessed the mapping of the human genome and the sequencing of genes.\n  Rarely does a day go by when we don't hear on radio, see on \ntelevision, or read in the newspapers about some new kind of medical \nbreakthrough. These breakthroughs can make a very important difference \nin the quality of health and life for American patients. Our whole \nbiotech industry has been increasingly effective at making progress in \nareas which we could not have possibly have imagined. It is true with \nthe orphan drug program, which we intend to reauthorize this year. On \njust about every front, we have seen the most remarkable progress. But \nin order for that progress to take life, we have to see the progress \nmade in the laboratory get to the patient. The key aspect of this \ntransition is clinical trials.\n  We believe clinical trials offer enormous hope for thousands of our \nfellow citizens. What we have seen in recent times is that one of the \nmost serious abuses by HMOs is the denial to participate in clinical \ntrials. Had these patients been involved in clinical trials, in many \ninstances their lives would have been saved. This has been commented on \nby our colleagues. Their lives would have been greatly enhanced if they \nhad been able to participate in these clinical trials.\n  I still remember very clearly the testimony we had before our HELP \nCommittee on this issue a number of months ago. We had the director of \nthe Lombardi Center, named after the great football coach, here in \nWashington. We asked him about what their principal challenges were as \na research center. He said they had hired a number of people, and the \npeople they hired were professionals. However, what they were hiring \nthem for was to wrestle with the insurance companies to permit those \nindividuals who ought to be included in the clinical trials to be so \nincluded. They had seen a significant expansion of that--far too many. \nHe said they could have used those resources for additional kinds of \ntrials and benefits for consumers. But he gave so many different \nexamples of people whose lives were basically diminished and, in many \ninstances, lost because of the failure of inclusion.\n  In the provisions of the McCain-Edwards bill, there are protections \nwhich are routine in terms of clinical trials that must be followed. In \norder to participate, there has to be the prospect that the individual \ncan make progress, and the patient also has to meet other kinds of \nbasic requirements. The last time we debated this issue on a Patients' \nBill of Rights, the Senate finally accepted a study on whether clinical \ntrials were really useful, productive, or helpful for American \npatients.\n  It is difficult for me to believe that was the final resolution for \nthis body, but it was. What concerns me greatly is the issue of how we \nare going to eventually resolve this issue.\n  Recently, the Medicare Program has expanded their clinical trials \nprogram. They had to deal with a number of issues. They had to deal \nwith unanticipated patient care costs as a result of participation in \nthe clinical trials. They had to deal with a number of these matters.\n  It is interesting to note that the alternative proposal from Senator \nFrist and Senator Breaux has a clinical trial provision, but their \nprovision will substantially delay implementation. A fair review of \ntheir provision reveals the clinical trials would not go into place for \nprobably 4 or 5 years and also their bill excludes unanticipated \npatient care costs as a result of participation in clinical trials.\n  The reason they delay implementation is they want a further study on \nthe allocation of costs between the clinical trials and the insurance \ncompanies. The fact is, that study has already been done. That review \nhas already been made. The facts are in and they have been examined, \nreexamined, and examined again. They are being implemented at the \npresent time and are virtually unchallenged.\n  We have to ask ourselves why we should have a whole other additional \nprocess that is going to delay clinical trials under the proposal of \nour colleagues. I have not heard the justification or the rationale for \nthat.\n  Also, the alternative to the McCain-Edwards proposal excludes the FDA \nclinical trials. That, I understand, is directly as a result of the \nrequest of the insurance industry.\n  That does raise important questions because the FDA reviews are some \nof the most advanced reviews, some of the most important reviews, and \nsome of the trials are at the edge of potential benefit to consumers. \nYet they are completely excluded. They are included in our proposal \nbecause we value those important clinical trials.\n  This provision of clinical trials may not seem as important, but if \none asks the breast cancer coalition in this country about what is \nextremely important in the protections of women and the treatment of \nwomen, they will mention clinical trials.\n\n[[Page S6502]]\n\n  If one talks about other dangers of cancer, by and large, the issue \nof clinical trials will be at the top of their list, a top priority, a \ntop patient protection, and we believe in that. We share that view. \nThis is something that is absolutely essential if we are going to move \nahead with the protections of patients.\n  We have done that previously. We have seen how there had been an \nallocation of resources historically between the insurance companies \nwhen they covered patients and the trial itself as a general \nunderstanding, as I mentioned, under Medicare, about those allocations \nof resources, what should be allocated for the clinical trial and \nexpenses associated with that, and also what would be allocated by the \ncontinuation of care which the HMO would be otherwise required to pay.\n  One of the loopholes that has been added to this is the issue about \nsome reaction to the clinical trial that may be related to the illness \nor not, say, someone going in under a cancer protocol and then having \nsome kind of adverse reaction as to make their situation more \ncomplicated. Yes, that may happen in certain circumstances, but it does \nseem to me we ought to address that. We have done that in the past. \nThere is no reason we should not. That has not presented itself as an \nimpediment to moving ahead on this issue. We ought to be able to get \nthat behind us.\n\n  I am strongly committed to ensuring that whatever comes out of this \nbody in terms of the Patients' Bill of Rights has these protections.\n  I might mention a note from the Cancer Society:\n\n       On behalf of the American Cancer Society and its 28 million \n     supporters, I am writing to respectfully request that you \n     allow debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights to move forward \n     and that you support the ``Bipartisan Patient Protection Act \n     of 2001.'' As the largest voluntary health organization \n     dedicated to improving cancer care, the Society has set the \n     enactment of a patients' bill of rights that provides strong, \n     comprehensive protections to all patients in managed care \n     plans as one of its top legislative priorities for this \n     session of Congress.\n       While the Society does not have a position on health plan \n     liability, we have identified several other provisions that \n     are critical to cancer patients.\n\n  This is what it is, Mr. President. We are concerned about what is \ncritical to cancer patients in this country. It is spelled out here. I \nwill take a few moments to mention them.\n\n       Specifically, we advocate the patient protection \n     legislation that provides all insurance patients with:\n       Increased access to clinical trials--assuring that cancer \n     patients who need access to the often life-saving treatments \n     provided in both federally and privately-funded or approved \n     high-quality, peer-reviewed clinical trials have the same \n     coverage for routine patient care costs (e.g., physician \n     visits, blood work, etc.) as patients receiving standard \n     care.\n       Prompt and direct access to the medical specialists. \n     Patients facing serious or life threatening illnesses, such \n     as cancer, need continuity of care--\n\n  This legislation provides it--\n\n     the option of designating their specialist as their primary \n     care provider--\n\n  This legislation provides it--\n\n     and the ability to have a standing referral to their \n     specialist for ongoing care.\n\n  Our legislation provides it.\n\n       Strong, independent, and timely external grievance and \n     appeals procedures.\n\n  Our legislation provides it.\n  Mr. President, the letter continues:\n\n       We are particularly pleased that--\n\n  McCain-Edwards--\n\n     includes a strong clinical trials provision that provides \n     access for cancer patients and others with serious and life \n     threatening diseases to both federally and privately-\n     sponsored high-quality, peer-reviewed trials.\n\n  The FDA trials as well as other trials.\n\n       Clinical trials are a critical treatment option for cancer \n     patients and are also essential in our nation's efforts to \n     win the War Against Cancer. Without clinical trials, new or \n     improved treatments would languish in the laboratory, never \n     reaching the patients who need them. Unfortunately, only \n     three percent of cancer patients currently enroll in clinical \n     trials. Part of the problem is that many health insurers \n     refuse coverage for a patient's routine care costs if the \n     patient enrolls in a clinical trial--effectively denying \n     access to life-saving treatment.\n\n  We are interested in dealing with the challenges of cancer in our \nsociety, which is the top killer and the one that is most dreaded.\n  I remember a great leader in the Senate, Warren Magnuson. He was \ninstrumental in setting up the National Institutes of Health, and \nstrongly supported the Cancer Institute. He said his dream of a \nnewspaper headline was ``Cancer Conquered.'' That is something most \nAmericans agree would be the best possible headline.\n  Clinical trials are indispensable. Nineteen percent of the children \nwho have cancers are involved in clinical trials. We have had the \ngreatest progress and breakthroughs in the area of children's cancers. \nResearchers say a very significant reason for that is because of their \ninvolvement in clinical trials. We have made slower progress dealing \nwith other cancers, and we have reduced numbers of people included in \nthose trials.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator is expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this bill is a very significant bill. It \nimpacts about everybody in America; about 200 million people presently \nhave health insurance. As a result, if we passed a bad law, the \nunintended, or intended, consequences of it could be dramatic.\n  It is important to take a hard, intense look at what is being \nproposed by Senator McCain and Senator Kennedy as their bill. This is \nin the context of bills which have already been proposed by Members \nfrom our side, some which are bipartisan such as the Breaux-Frist-\nJeffords bill; some do not have Democratic sponsorship, such as the \nNickles amendment. All have as their basic purpose the same intent \nunderlying--certainly I give credit to the McCain bill for this. The \nbasic intent is making sure individuals are properly treated when they \ninterface with their insurance companies; that they have an opportunity \nfor redress that is effective, which allows them to be sure that if \nthey get poor treatment, they have some way to correct it; and that if \nthey are harmed by their health care provider, they have the ability to \nrecover proper compensation for that harm.\n  That is a goal all Members have. Everyone who is debating in this \nChamber understands the importance of making sure that Americans who \nget health care have adequate recourse when that health care is not \nsupplied correctly. It is also equally important Americans have a \ncertain set of rights when they are dealing with their health care \nprovider in areas such as the type of physician they would see and the \ntype of referrals they would get and the issue of specialists. That is \nalso equally important.\n  All the proposals that have come forward address that issue. I have \nnot yet heard of a case from the other side of the aisle--and they have \npresented a number of anecdotal cases, and they are compelling, people \nwho have had problems with their insurers. I have not heard one of \nthose cases where that individual would not have had the ability for \nredress or be taken care of under either the Nickles or the Breaux-\nFrist-Jeffords bill. The issue is not about that. It is not about \nwhether or not we are concerned about individuals getting fair \ntreatment from their insurer. It is not about individuals having a set \nof rights which are protected when they deal with their doctor, who is \nrepresenting their insurance company, or whether they deal with their \ninsurance company. That is not what this issue is about.\n  It comes down to a couple of substantive questions as to the \ndifferences. The first involves States rights versus Federal rights. \nThat is called scope. It is a question of what authority do we have as \na Federal Government to take over authority which has traditionally \nbeen handled by the States, especially in the area of insurance. \nInsurance has traditionally been a State responsibility.\n  As a former Governor, I know it is something every State takes very \nseriously and is very committed to. New Hampshire's laws for protecting \npatients are much more aggressive than proposals in any of the three \npackages here. That is one element of difference. The other element is \nsomething I want to talk about, the area of liability. Liability is a \nterm that has huge implications. The practical effect of the McCain \nbill, no doubt about it, is that there are going to be created \ninnumerable opportunities for lawsuits to be initiated against not only \ninsurers but equally against employers, small employers and large \nemployers. Mom-and-\n\n[[Page S6503]]\n\npop grocery stores, mom-and-pop gas stations, mom-and-pop restaurants, \nsmall, struggling production facilities, software companies, and large \nemployers--Wal-Mart, Ford, whatever, the big ones--those employers are \nsuddenly going to find themselves drawn into literally hundreds of \npotential opportunities for liability.\n\n  What is the effect of that? The effect of that is a large number of \nemployers, especially small and midsize employers, are going to throw \nup their hands and say: Hey, listen, I can't afford the risk.\n  The average malpractice lawsuit in this country costs about $77,000 \nto defend if you are in an employer situation. There are a lot of small \nemployers for whom $77,000 is their entire profit margin for the whole \nyear. They may get hit with a multiplicity of lawsuits under this bill \nthat do not exist today. This is a new law created for the purposes of \ncreating new lawsuits. This is a bill that is of the lawyer, for the \nlawyer, and by the lawyer--for the trial lawyer. And the practical \nimplication is that a lot of employers, a lot of people who want to \ntake care of their people they work with, are not going to be able to, \nand they are going to simply have to drop their insurance. They are \nprobably going to replace--some of them, the more substantive, will be \nable to replace their insurance by saying to the employee: Go buy your \nown insurance. Here is the money.\n  They will never get as good a package in most instances as their \nemployer could get for them because they will not have the ability to \nnegotiate with the strength of a large number of individuals. \nIndividuals seeking individual policies simply get charged a lot more \nthan groups that have been pursued as a result of a group of employers \nbanning together or even one large employer banning together and \npursuing an insurance company. The quality of the insurance will drop \nfor those individuals. An even greater number of employees are simply \nnot going to have insurance at all because small and midsize employers \nare simply not going to be able to afford it and they will simply \neliminate it as an option they present as a benefit in their workplace. \nSo there will be more uninsured.\n  How can you possibly call something a Patient's Bill of Rights when \nthe practical effect of the bill is to create more people who don't \nhave any insurance at all? So they don't have any rights; they don't \nhave any insurance.\n  If that is the practical effect of the bill, and it is--you don't \nhave to listen to me. Listen to an independent group such as CBO which \nhas scored this bill as putting 1.2 million people out of insurance. \nThat is the conclusion they came to because of the additional costs \nthat result from the lawsuits, in large part. Those people are not \ngoing to have insurance. They don't get any new rights under this bill. \nThey lose all the rights they had. Yet this is claimed to be a \nPatient's Bill of Rights. Very inconsistent, to say the least.\n  In the process of setting this bill up, there has been a presentation \nfrom the other side that they actually took the other bills that had \nbeen pursued in the last couple of years--remember, we have not had a \nhearing on any of these bills in our committee now for 2 years, which I \nthink is a little bit much--to bring a bill of this size to the floor \nwithout any hearings at all so the people who are going to be affected \ncould have a forum to make their points.\n  Independent of that, there were over the last couple of years bills \nbrought to the floor. There was the prior McCain bill, the prior \nKennedy bill, and the prior Norwood-Dingell bill.\n  The representation has been that the McCain bill has moved to the \ncenter from those two bills that were introduced before. In fact, that \nis not true at all. This bill is much more to the left, and by the left \nI mean it is much more oriented towards undermining the rights of \npeople to buy insurance and have health insurance. By moving to the \nleft, I mean it interferes much more with States rights and it places \nmuch more liability on the backs of small employers and also large \nemployers.\n  This bill moves significantly to the left, not to the center. There \nare ways to move this bill to the center. Breaux-Frist-Jeffords is a \nbill that has moved to the center from the Nickles bill that was \ndebated and passed in the Senate last year. If you want to argue \ncenter, left, right, this bill moves way out into left field, as \ncompared with the original bills which were introduced and were already \npretty far out in left field. This bill, if it were in Fenway Park, \nwouldn't be in left field; it would be in the bullpen. Well, actually \nthat is in right field. It would be behind the Green Monster.\n  I point out a few areas where this occurs. First, as I have \nmentioned, it significantly expands liability for employers. Sponsors \nof the McCain bill say they have compromised by including a $5 million \ncap on punitive damages. However, the cap only applies in the Federal \nliability provisions added to the bill--it is sort of a bait-and-switch \nthing--and not to the more expansive liability provisions under State \nlaw.\n  One of the ironies of this bill is you can go forum shopping. This is \none of the favorite things trial lawyers like to do. I used to do a \nlittle bit of trial work. You love to forum shop. You find out what \ncourt has the best judge; you find out what court historically has the \njuries that give the highest award; you find out what court has the \nbest rules to improve your capacity to win your case on procedural \ngrounds; and you move to that court. If it is a Federal court, you go \nFederal. If it is a State court, you go State. Under the present law, \nyou cannot do that. You cannot bring an ERISA claim in a State court. \nBut under this bill, it expands dramatically the opportunity for forum \nshopping. Then it says: But, hold it, we put in a cap so you don't have \nto worry about that.\n  Unfortunately, there are a lot of States that have no cap. They have \nno limitation at all on damages.\n  Further, the bill itself allows unlimited damages for economic and \nnoneconomic losses--damages within the Federal court system. It expands \nthe right to sue for violations of duty under the plan. This is a \nbrandnew concept. It creates a whole new cause of action out there \nwhere employers will suddenly become liable for contractual activity on \nHIPAA or COBRA or ERISA that they are not liable for today, relative to \na private lawsuit.\n  I have a chart. I don't have it on the floor today because I had it \nup so often I thought people might be getting tired of it. But it shows \nthere are potentially 200 new causes of action just on this one point \nalone.\n  Then it says it does not have punitive damages. In fact the earlier \nbills did not have punitive damages. At least H.R. 990, which I think \nis the original Norwood bill, did not. But, in fact, it creates a new \nterm of art, which is essentially punitive damages, and it allows those \ndamages, as I mentioned, to be recovered at the rate of $5 million.\n  Here is a bill that says it is moving more to the center when, in \nfact, in the liability area it dramatically expands forum shopping, it \ndramatically expands punitive damages opportunities, it dramatically \nexpands the number of lawsuits that can be brought on the issue of \ncontracts and contractual obligations of the employer--all of this is \ndirected at the employer--and it dramatically expands, in Federal \ncourt, economic and noneconomic damages that can be recovered against \nthe employer. All of this is new. A brandnew attack on the employer by \nthe trial bar will be allowed under this bill.\n\n  This is not moving to the center. This is moving to the left.\n  Another example, the McCain-Kennedy bill effectively requires that \nall States pass new patients' protection laws identical to the new \nFederal requirement. This is a huge step, an intrusion into States \nrights. Earlier versions of the legislation, both the Daschle-Kennedy \nbill last year and the Norwood bill, used the standard under the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act to determine whether or \nnot State laws would be preempted by the new Federal patients' \nrequirements. That standard does not prevent the application of this \nFederal law versus requiring the application of the Federal law.\n  The latest McCain bill adds new barriers for States by requiring that \nState laws be substantially equivalent to and as effective as each new \nFederal patient protection requirement. This two-part standard will \neffectively require every State to renegotiate and pass a whole new \ngroup of provisions in order that their laws be virtually identical \nwith the Federal provision. If the State fails to do so, the Federal \nGovernment will take over and enforce those rules in every State.\n\n[[Page S6504]]\n\n  So I cannot see how you can claim this bill moves to the center when \nthe practical effect of this section is to essentially usurp and wipe \nout States' activities in this area.\n  My colleague from Maine just spoke a little while ago. She put up a \nlist that showed literally almost every State in the country has \naggressively addressed the issue of patients' rights and has \nestablished a set of requirements and rights which flow to the patient \nthat are fairly consistent with what we all seek in the Senate. But if \nthey are not exactly or substantially equivalent to and as effective as \nthe Federal law, they will be overruled and the Federal Government will \ncome in and usurp the State authority and actually take over the \nState's insurance enforcement.\n  We have had State insurance enforcement in this country for quite a \nwhile and it has worked pretty well. So you cannot say a bill moves to \nthe center when it essentially says ``to heck with the States, we are \ncoming in, we are the big boys, you are out of the game because we know \nbetter than you, State legislatures. You, the State legislature, are \nnot interested in the people who live in your States. We here in \nWashington are.''\n  That is not a movement to the center. That is a dramatic, if not \nradical, move to the left, to centralization of power here in \nWashington at the expense of the States.\n  In addition, another example of the fact this bill does not move to \nthe center but moves way off beyond the Green Monster, out beyond left \nfield, out past Lansdowne Street, probably down by the Massachusetts \nFreeway--actually it is not a freeway; it costs money--the \nMassachusetts Turnpike is the effect this bill has on the ability to \nbypass the appeals process.\n  The prior proposals, earlier versions which were pretty far left, out \nthere in left field, as I said, of the bill provided where injury or \ndeath had already occurred, and therefore the appeals process would be \nfutile, the patient would not be required to exhaust the appeals \nprocess before going to court. The new version permits a person to \nbypass the appeals process and go directly to court to seek monetary \ndamage if the harm would occur by going through the process.\n  That may sound reasonable, but you have to read behind that language \nfor the practical impact of what it is.\n  It is noteworthy that this exception would allow lawsuits for \nvirtually unlimited monetary damages rather than simply allowing \npatients to get the care they need if they would be substantially \nharmed by completing the review process.\n  The new version of the McCain bill also contains a late manifestation \nprovision. This is an amazing provision because this provision \nessentially says that if the appeal process period has run and you \ndecide that you have a manifestation of harm as a result of being \ntreated, you no longer have to go to the appeal process; You can go \ndirectly to court.\n  The practical effect of this language is essentially to eliminate the \nstatute of limitations. Under this law there is a total abrogation, in \nmy humble opinion, of the statute of limitations. That is a move to the \nleft.\n  As a trial lawyer, I love the idea that I never have to worry about \nthe statute of limitations because if my office happens to make a \nmistake and not reach that 3-year window or that 6-year window, I am \nnot going to be subject to the errors and omissions suit that I might \nget hit with by my client because, if there is no statute of \nlimitations, I will never miss the filing requirement.\n  But going back beyond the manifestations language, this concept that \nis totally different than what was in the original Dingell-Norwood bill \nand the original Daschle-Kennedy bill that you as a patient do not have \nto exhaust your administrative remedies before you go into court, but \nyou simply have to claim harm, and then you can go right after monetary \ndamages, is a dramatic undermining of the capacity to have an effective \nappeal process. You essentially have no appeal process.\n  Now all you have are court decisions. Nobody is going to go down the \nappeal process route. Everybody is going to race to the courthouse with \nthis bypass language.\n  The way it should be structured, obviously, is that, sure, if you are \ninjured and you are going to suffer as a result of having to go through \nthe appeal process and you are not getting a response, you should be \nable to go to court, but you shouldn't get the monetary damages at that \ntime. You should get whatever you need in order to get the right \nmedical care, then go back to the appeal process and find out what the \nproper resolution should be and then move into the court system for the \nmonetary issues.\n  That is the logical approach. It is actually the approach, for all \nintents and purposes, that was in the original bill. Now we have \nanother example of moving way over to the left and not moving back to \nthe center, which this bill claims to do. It doesn't move to the center \nat all.\n  These are not minor issues--the liability issue, going straight to \ncourt issue, and the States rights issue. These are not minor issues. \nThese are big questions in the scheme of how we deliver health care. \nThe reason they are big questions is because, if this bill passes, it \nis going to fundamentally change the way health care is delivered in \nthis country. It will push a lot of people into the uninsured ranks. As \na result, you are going to have this huge momentum for the \nnationalization of our system.\n  At this point, I see our leader coming on the floor. I know he has \ncomments that he wants to make. So I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, timewise, what is the situation now? Has the \ntime been divided? Is it in blocks of an hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 6 minutes 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you very much. Mr. President, I will try to take \nadvantage of that time and make a few remarks. Maybe then I can come \nback and talk again later.\n  First of all, I wish to comment briefly with the time we are using \nnow. I think it is an important part of the process that we have \nopening statements and descriptions of what is in the pending bills--\nboth the Kennedy-McCain-Edwards legislation as well as Breaux-Frist and \nother legislation--so we can see where the similarities are and find \nwhere the problems are.\n  We did not want to go forward with the amendment process on Monday \nbecause there had been changes made in the underlying bill on Thursday \nof last week, June 14. I presume there will still be more changes \noffered by the sponsors of the legislation, whether it is Senator \nMcCain, or Senator Edwards, or others, as problems are identified and \nas consideration is given to the reservations. Those will be either \namendments or substitutes that will be offered.\n  I make the point that we are not interested in prolonging the \nconsideration of this legislation. We are prepared to go to the vote in \nthe morning on the motion to proceed. We are prepared to begin the \namendment process on Thursday afternoon. Hopefully, we can make \nprogress on amendments on Thursday and Friday and on into next week.\n  I also hope we will find a way before the Fourth of July recess to \ncomplete action on a supplemental appropriations bill. A lot of that \nwill depend on whether or not the Committee on Appropriations can act \ntomorrow on what is in that legislation. We need to get that done or we \nare going to see more problems develop with the Department of Defense \nbeing able to keep our ships steaming and our planes flying. We will \nneed to do both of these issues as much as we can during the next week.\n  Let me emphasis a couple of points. Others have noted that many of \nthe core components of the various bills that have been offered, \nwhether it is the original Nickles proposal, the Breaux-Frist-Jeffords \nproposal, or the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy proposal, have a lot of \nsimilarities.\n  Let me talk a minute about where we agree. We agree that we want a \nPatients' Bill of Rights to protect patients and to ensure those \npatients get the care they have been promised. That is why we believe \nso strongly that we need an immediate review process that will get a \nresult hopefully within a managed care entity or an outside review if \nthat is not satisfactory inside of the managed care entity and that it \nbe\n\n[[Page S6505]]\n\ndone on an expeditious basis and not drawn out. Get a result.\n  That is why the idea of going immediately to court has such little \nappeal to me because legal action, while it might get beneficial \nresults that would be helpful to the heirs, may be of no value to a \npatient who will have had all kinds of problems, and perhaps even die, \nbefore the conclusion of a lawsuit.\n  All of the bills have a review process. The important thing, in my \nopinion, is that the review be quick and that it get the results. If \nthe result is not satisfactory, then there has to be some process to \nget it considered in the courts. I think we will find a way to do that.\n\n  We agree that patients have to have access to specialists. That is \nwhat caused us to get into the need for a Patients' Bill of Rights. \nAfter the managed care concept was established and started going \nforward, it was doing a good job. It was providing care at a reduced \ncost. But some of the managed care entities started to make mistakes. \nThe difficulty is they wouldn't make medical records available to \npatients, which were their own medical records. You can't have that. \nThe idea that you would have to get permission from some other \norganization to go to an emergency entrance is unacceptable. You have \nto have access to emergency care in case of an accident, or whatever. \nOr if you have an OB/GYN doctor seeing a pregnant woman who then leaves \nthat managed care operation, she should be able to continue to have the \ncare of that OB/GYN.\n  There is no question that we need to make sure that common sense \napplies and that there is access to physicians. We need to have some \nway that cancer patients can have access to clinical trials. We need to \nmake sure there is access for women to surgical treatments or for \nbreast cancer. We need to make sure that patients will be able to \ncontinue to see their doctor, if the doctor no longer works for the \nhealth care plan.\n  There is a long list of places where we agree that there needs to be \naccess to information that patients and beneficiaries need. We need to \nmake sure that there are new quality measures available.\n  We should not ignore the fact that there is a lot of common ground. \nWe, clearly, have some areas where we disagree. Of course, primarily it \nis when, where, and how you have a lawsuit.\n  I was a lawyer years ago. I was with a trial firm. We did defense \nwork. But we also occasionally filed some plaintiffs' lawsuits.\n  I am not opposed to having access to the court systems. Americans \ndeserve that right. The question is, Who can be sued? Should a person, \nor an entity, an employer, that has no involvement in the decision that \nis made based on business reasons, costs, or medical purposes be sued? \nNaturally, a good lawyer will throw out his dragnet and bring in \nemployers, doctors, nurses, the managed care entity, the insurance \ncompany--everybody who is within range and, by the way, look for the \none with the deep pockets. That is what you really want. You want the \none from whom you can get the money.\n  I think we need to be very careful about who is covered by these \nlawsuits and when they can be filed. Unless and until the review \nprocesses are exhausted, we should not be resorting to legal action.\n  Also, where a lawsuit is filed does make a difference. I know for \nsure from my own personal experience, since some of my very closest \nfriends and relatives are plaintiff lawyers, that there is this little \nthing of forum shopping: Let's look around and find the county in the \nState where we could get the highest judgment. Or maybe it is in a \nFederal court; let's pick and choose. Or maybe let's file in both \nFederal and State court.\n  In my own State of Mississippi, there are a series of articles being \ndone by a Gannett newspaper, the Clarion-Ledger, that would not \nordinarily do an article such as this, noting that there are one or two \nparticular counties in my State that are considered a plaintiff's \nwonderland, where you can get massive damages if you go into these \nparticular counties. By the way, our insurance commissioner--a very \nfine insurance commissioner of many years a Democrat--has noted that 46 \ninsurance companies have said: We are leaving this State. We are not \ngoing to face these exorbitant, ridiculous judgments in this particular \ncounty, Jefferson County, MS.\n  So where you file does make a difference. We need to pay attention to \nthat.\n  Of course, there is also the question of how much in damages. Is this \nabout a result or is this about a lawsuit? Do we want health care or do \nwe want legal action? Do we want a reasonable judgment for losses that \nyou have incurred or do we want pain and suffering and punishment? \nThose are basic questions.\n  But I hope we can bring all sides together and get a result. I want a \nresult. I want us to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. I think we need \nit. It is the right thing to do. And I am tired of hearing about it. It \nis time to act. It is kind of like what we did in the tax relief bill \non the marriage penalty. We have been talking about it for 10 years, \nabout how it is unfair, and that we ought to get rid of it. My question \nwas, Why haven't we done it?\n  We can do this if both sides can be reasonable. I talked to the \nPresident yesterday. There is no doubt in my mind the President wants \nto sign a reasonable and fair Patients' Bill of Rights. But there is \nalso no doubt in my mind he will veto the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill \nin its present form.\n  I hope we can go through this amendment process, address the delivery \nquestions, the liability questions, and also see if we can find a way \nto make health care more accessible to many Americans who are not now \ncovered. Small business men and women have a hard time, even when they \nreally want to, making sure all of their employees are covered because \neven if they offer them the coverage, and pay half the cost, many \nemployees say: We just can't afford it. We are not going to do it. So \nthey are not covered.\n  Can't we find a way to give them access to coverage or to help them \nwith the expenses of that coverage? I think we can. I think this is a \nbill where we can help address that.\n  Let me note that the distinguished Senator from Nevada is on his \nfeet. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I just want to say to the Republican leader, you do not \nhave to use leader time. You should not be rushed. Even though you are \non Democratic time, you are welcome to it.\n  Mr. LOTT. That was about the nicest way I have ever been told my time \nhas expired. That is why I was talking fast. I did want to get in a few \nremarks. I appreciate Senator Reid noting that.\n  At this point, I will yield the floor because we have had very good \ncooperation in going back and forth every 30 minutes.\n  I would like to continue that. I will take advantage of leader time \nanother time. But thank you very much, I say to Senator Reid.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder. There was an agreement that \nwe would go into morning business at 5 o'clock and that I would be \nrecognized at that time.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend from Alaska, we were told the \nRepublicans would have no one to speak at 4:30. But that was not \nfactual. People did come. And they have used 35 minutes of the 30 \nminutes. Senator Reed has been waiting.\n  We would ask, under the agreement that we entered into earlier today, \nthat he use his time. I wanted to speak, but I say to my friend from \nAlaska, if you are the last speaker for the Republicans, I have to be \nhere to close anyway. Senator Reed wants to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  I say to the Senator, you can speak for however long you desire.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I respond to the assistant majority leader, I would \nprobably need not more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island be recognized for up to 10 minutes--is that adequate?\n  Does the Senator from Massachusetts wish to speak anymore today?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I look forward to addressing the Senate \ntomorrow morning.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Chair \nrecognize the Senator from Rhode Island for 10 minutes; following that, \nthe Senator\n\n[[Page S6506]]\n\nfrom Alaska for 10 minutes; and then I will close out the evening with \nwhatever time is necessary for that to be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to support the McCain-Edwards-\nKennedy bill and to commend the authors. They have done some great work \nin trying to reconcile a very pressing need in this country; that is, \nto give patients the ability to get the health care they need and, \nindeed, that they either paid for or their employer paid for.\n  Today I have heard discussion that this is just about lawyers who are \ngoing to enrich themselves. But I think that argument misses the point. \nThe point is, there are lots of lawyers on the other side, on the HMOs' \nside, who are using their skills to deny patients what they thought \nthey purchased with their health care plan, where they are able to use \nall the loopholes that are rife throughout our statutes, not to provide \ncare but to provide the insurance companies with an out.\n  The McCain-Kennedy-Edwards bill clarifies the rights of patients. It \nmakes them specific. It makes them less debatable. Let's make these \nrights less a contest of lawyers on both sides and more something that \nthe patients of America, the citizens of America, can expect will be \ntheir right to demand and receive when they pay for health insurance.\n  So when you have situations where, instead of specifying, as the \nMcCain-Kennedy-Edwards bill does, the right to a pediatrician as the \nprovider of health care services for a child or a pediatric specialist \nfor a child, you have something nebulous like a physician with age-\nspecific qualifications, that is the type of ambiguity that is rife for \nthe competing proposals, and that leads to the denial of care to \nAmericans. In fact, it leads to lots of controversy, strife, \ndiscussion, and debate.\n  So this legislation has been well crafted over many months to \nspecify, delineate, and clearly give patients their rights; in fact, to \ngive them what they believe they are paying for. And they are already \npaying a lot.\n  So I believe that this bill has made great progress in moving from \nthe version we considered in the last Congress in this Senate Chamber, \nand the version that has been proposed by Congressman Norwood and \nCongressman Dingell in the other body; and we are moving close, I hope, \nto legislation that can receive the support of this Senate, which can \ngo forward and be combined with a very similar bill on the House side \noffered by Congressman Norwood and Congressman Dingell, and then go to \nthe President for his signature.\n  What it would do, I believe, is to, again, specify clearly, \nunequivocally, what Americans can expect from their health care \nprovider.\n  There has also been lots of discussion that this really is going to \npull in countless numbers of employers, small businesses, who are going \nto be ensnared in a web of litigation because of this legislation. But \nthat ignores the very specific language in the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy \nbill that says that an employer can only be liable if that individual \nplayed a direct role in a decision to deny a treatment of health care \nservices to a patient. This is not the situation where a small business \nbuys a Blue Cross plan or buys an HMO plan. This is a situation where \nan individual in that business organization makes the decision to say: \nNo, don't give that service to that individual who is covered by my \nplan--a very unlikely circumstance, but one I think most people would \nagree, if you are making those types of decisions, you should at least \nbe potentially liable for the consequences of those decisions.\n  I believe the discussion of an employer as being ensnared in this web \nof lawsuits misses the very specific language of the bill. It certainly \nis not the intent of this legislation. It never has been. With the \nrefined language and the very specific language, I don't think it will \nbe the effect of the legislation either.\n  We know that this issue is creating a great deal of controversy \naround the country. It is generating the activity of interest groups \nleft and right. This morning, early today, the junior Senator from Utah \nspoke about a doctor who was contacted by the American Medical \nAssociation to call the Senator and support the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy \nbill. In the course of the discussion, he discovered that he really \ndidn't support the bill but he favored the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords \napproach.\n  That is not the only calls that are being made out there in America \nas we speak and debate here. My office received a call from a \nbusinessman in Rhode Island instigated by the National Association of \nManufacturers who said: Call your Senator and tell him not to vote for \nKennedy-Edwards-McCain. But when we spoke with the individual, when we \nexplained the provisions of the bill, particularly the provisions with \nrespect to potential lawsuits against employers, he concluded that the \nKennedy-McCain-Edwards bill was the type of legislation he could \nsupport because he is not just an employer; he is just not a \nbusinessperson; he is a family man. His wife had recently been sick, \nand he understood the difficulties that are faced in trying to get \nhealth care out of an insurance company that is committed to the bottom \nline, not the health care, principally, of their insured members. He \npreferred, after discussion, the type of protections included in this \nbill.\n  I hope that is a sign that when we can come here to the Chamber and \nclearly explain the contents of this legislation, we can convince many \npeople across the country that this legislation is in the best interest \nof the families of America.\n  Now, I have for several years been working to ensure that this type \nof legislation pays particular attention to children. I am very pleased \nto say that the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill incorporates many of the \nprovisions of legislation I have submitted along with many colleagues. \nIt protects the right of families to have a pediatrician as a primary \ncare provider and the right to make referrals to a pediatric \nspecialist, not just a specialist. There is a vast difference between \nan adult cardiologist who may have seen a child 1 or 2 years ago and a \npediatric cardiologist who specializes in those types of problems for \nchildren. If you are a parent, that is the specialist you want to see. \nThis legislation provides for that access clearly, unequivocally.\n  The alternative legislation would say the company can find someone \nwho has a specific qualification. Again, the lawyers for the insurance \ncompany can find many ways to suggest that that is the gentleman or \nwoman who might have seen a child 2 years ago, a cardiologist, rather \nthan the more expensive doctor not in their plan who is, in fact, a \npediatric cardiologist.\n  This is real progress on the bill. I commend the authors for doing \nthis and pushing forward.\n  There is one area I would like to see included in addition to what \nhas been done. That is a proposal I have made previously on a \nbipartisan basis with Senators Jeffords and Collins to create for each \nState an ombudsman, someone who can be a point of reference and \nreferral to individuals who have questions about their health care \nplan. Before you even get into a long, protracted internal review or \nexternal review, there should be an individual you can contact and say: \nDo I have a problem here? I think I am covered for this procedure. Am I \nreally covered for this procedure? That type of advice, that type of \nobjective information on a systematic basis can do much to resolve the \npotential specter of a plethora of lawsuits.\n\n  It is a worthwhile initiative. I hope my amendment can be \nincorporated into this bill. Indeed, I am preparing to offer such as \namendment along with Senators Wellstone, Wyden, and Clinton. I hope \nwhen the process begins for amendments, we can make that improvement to \nwhat is already a very fine bill.\n  This is a very clear issue when you boil it all down. Do you stand \nwith the families of America who deserve health care coverage they paid \nfor or do you stand with the insurance companies whose major concern is \ntheir financial solvency and well-being? This legislation stands with \nand for the families of America. I support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlaska is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6507]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/20/senate-section/article/S6507-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6507-S6508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        ENERGY CRISIS IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I recognize that we are debating a \nmotion to proceed to the Patients' Bill of Rights. I am tempted, \nhowever, to ask unanimous consent that we set the Patients' Bill of \nRights aside and go to the energy legislation that is pending before \nthis body. I shall not do that, in deference to my colleagues on the \nother side, although I must admit, it is somewhat ideal and timely.\n  What I am going to do is call on the majority leader of the Senate to \nset a date to take up the energy crisis in America. Polling indicates \nthe No. 1 issue in this country and concern is not education. It is \nenergy.\n  Under the previous leadership--and hindsight is cheap--this was the \nweek we were going to be debating a comprehensive energy bill in this \nbody. Senator Lott had indicated that that was the next order of \nbusiness after education. Where are we in the order of business? We are \non the Patients' Bill of Rights. We are supposedly going to be on the \nsupplemental next week. We may take up the minimum wage. We may be on \nappropriations. Where is energy in the Democratic list of priorities \nfor this body? I am very disappointed that evidently it has been tossed \naside under the new leadership.\n  Where have we been on this matter? We have been busy. The Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, which I previously chaired and on which I \nworked with Senator Bingaman--Senator Bingaman now chairs the \ncommittee--has been busy inasmuch as we have held 24 hearings. We have \nhad 164 witnesses over the last year. We clearly know what this country \nneeds. We need to produce more energy. We need to develop alternatives. \nWe need to develop renewables. We need to do a better job of \nconservation. But we have to come to grips with this crisis. We can't \nignore it. It is not going to go away.\n  The issue is ripe for debate in this body, ripe for debate on the \nSenate floor. We should proceed forward on behalf of the American \npublic who is looking to Congress to provide a solution.\n  We all know prices are too high; supplies are too low. We all know \nthat too little is being done as evidenced by the calendar with which \nwe are confronted.\n  I therefore ask the majority leader at this time to agree to bring \nthe energy policy legislation to the floor of the Senate at a time \ncertain, and certainly no later than July 23. I look forward to his \nresponse.\n  To give some idea of the timeliness of this, one only has to look at \nwhat is going on in the committees. Yesterday, the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee heard from FERC. We heard from the five members of \nthe Commission.\n  Today, in Government Affairs, we had the Governor of California, Gray \nDavis, along with other Western Governors, appearing to tell of the \nenergy crisis in their States. We also heard from the FERC relative to \nthe action they had taken unanimously to reach a conclusion to \nbasically take the pressure off what was proposed as legislation to \nmandate wholesale caps and prices.\n  I think it is fair to say that we can commend the administration, the \nPresident and the Vice President, for holding the course because \nwholesale caps do not encourage investment. We need investment in new \npower-generating facilities. As the President knows, if you put very \ntight caps in, investment will not come in regardless of how many \npermits for construction are issued. The incentive for a reasonable \nrate of return has to be there.\n  Now, FERC has come out with an order that addresses this. It takes \ncare of not only investor-owned but municipally owned utilities. It \ncovers both. It sets a 15-month timeframe in which to work, and it \nbases its great structure at the lowest efficient contributor into the \nenergy pool.\n  I commend FERC. We can argue why they didn't do it sooner, but it is \nimportant to recognize that FERC has just been functioning with its \nfive members for a relatively short period of time, less than 2 weeks. \nWhere were they last year? There is no use going back and trying to \nfigure out why they didn't act sooner. In any event, it is fair to say \nthat what California needs is not political excuses; they really need \npractical solutions.\n  FERC, while working out the solution, found that some in California \ncontinue to spin the issue away in the hopes that somehow the blame \nwill be deflected. We heard from Governor Davis. He has been blaming \nvirtually everyone for the problems in California--his predecessor, the \nState legislature, and he even blamed the Texas ownership that \ncontributes only about 12 percent of the energy that comes into \nCalifornia from Texas-owned energy companies. Twelve percent is \nsignificant but not overwhelming. He has blamed the President and the \nVice President for problems that began 9, 10 months before they even \ntook office. He has not recognized that, indeed, the President and the \nVice President, in their proposal in the energy task force, proposed \nrealistic ways to correct the problem--to correct it for California and \nnationally--by a balanced comprehensive energy policy. He also blamed \npower producers for price gouging. He hired the head of one of these \ngroups, David Freeman, of the Los Angeles Department of Water and \nPower, as his energy adviser.\n  One has to look at the list of those that allegedly have overcharged \nCalifornia. They contribute about $505 million. Among them is the city-\nowned Los Angeles agency that distributes water and power in Los \nAngeles--somewhere in the area of about $17 million in overcharging. \nAnother significant overcharge allegation was leveled against the \nColumbia River producers on the Columbia River in Bonneville. Nearly \n$173 million were BC hydro, which constituted about two-thirds of the \n$505 million.\n  I suggest that California spends more time discussing the problem of \nspinning off responsibility than looking forward to how they can \naddress changes by increasing more production in California. I commend \nFERC, and I share the President's commitment to market competition, not \nFederal Government command and control. We must never forget that \nGovernment itself doesn't generate one kilowatt of electricity, \nand neither do controls, if you will, on private investment. Only \nindustry can generate the electricity the public needs. Price controls \nhave never spun a turbine and have never stopped a rolling blackout.\n\n  In the pursuit of just and reasonable rates, Congress need not pursue \nnew legislation. As we saw yesterday from the FERC, the system is \nworking. The FERC order clears the way for our work on the long-term \nsolution. We must come together now on focusing our attention on \nputting in place a comprehensive national energy strategy that will \nhelp get us out of this crisis and keep us out. That must be our \npriority. And recognizing the contribution the administration has made \nin submitting the energy task force to us, the introduction of bills by \nboth Senator Bingaman, myself, and a number of Members, which is a \ncomprehensive proposal for relief, should be on the calendar of this \nbody. It should be on the calendar for action now. It is beyond me why \nthose on the other side have chosen to ignore it at a time when it is \nthe No. 1 priority in the country.\n  Further, on a sidenote, on May 23 of this year, the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources, which I formerly chaired and now am the \nranking member, reported the nomination of Steven Griles to be the \nDeputy Secretary of the Interior. It has been 28 days and we are still \nwaiting to even get a time agreement, which was noticed to us that \nwould be required. The significance of this particular nominee in the \nDepartment of the Interior is that the only confirmed position at the \nDepartment of the Interior is the Secretary of the Interior.\n  That is simply irresponsible. It is time for the Senate to let Steven \nGriles' nomination go. We look forward to trying to work with the \nmajority to achieve this. There is absolutely no excuse to hold this \nnominee from being confirmed. He has been voted out of the Committee on \nEnergy, and there is little we can offer the majority. The excuse is \nthat they are holding up the nomination until such time as the \ncommittees are determined. But we all know the committees are going to \nbe determined with at least one more Member of the majority going on \nthe committees. I don't know what the minority can do other than to \nrecognize that the Department of the Interior serves all of us--both \nRepublicans and Democrats--and to hold up the functional responsibility \nwhen we have had\n\n[[Page S6508]]\n\nthe hearing and this nominee is waiting to serve the country bears \nanother examination by the majority. I would certainly be glad to get \nany explanation anybody might care to provide at this time, or at any \nother time.\n  I will leave you with one thought. Back in 1992, we had a similar \nconcern in this country that we were facing--an increase in imports. As \na consequence of imports, we were increasing domestic production, as \nwell as domestic demand, and as a consequence, we became concerned and \npassed out of committee a number of items that are shown on this chart. \nIt is interesting to note, though, what we got out of the process when \nit went to the floor. We had given on all the supply increases \nassociated with increasing domestic production and reducing dependence \non foreign oil. As a consequence, it is rather interesting to see on \nthe current energy plan that there is little relief proposed. Yet in \nour comprehensive bill on the right, clearly we tried to cover all the \nareas of concern.\n  The reason that things are different--and I will show you this on the \nsecond chart--things aren't the same as they were in 1992--we have kind \nof a ``perfect storm'' scenario. We were 37-percent dependent in 1973. \nNow it is 56 percent. The Department of Energy says it will be 66 \npercent by 2010. Natural gas prices soared three to four times. They \nwere $2.16 per thousand, and now it is somewhere between $4 and $5. We \nhaven't built a new nuclear plant in over 10 years, no new refineries \nor new coal plants.\n\n  I thank you for the time. I yield to the majority whip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend that I am still the \nchairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, and we have \na number of nominations waiting to help Governor Whitman. We have \napproved a deputy, Linda Fisher. I wanted to make sure she called, and \nshe said she needed that help very badly; and we worked it out so when \nthe Republicans were under control, I made sure that was released and \nthat she could get over there and help.\n  We have a number of people waiting to go to the EPA. Governor Whitman \nneeds help also with running that important entity.\n  I think the Senator should check with people on his side. The reason \nis that we have been waiting since we took control of the Senate to \nhave a simple organizational resolution passed to allow the committee \nstructure to be effectuated.\n  Rather than having an arrangement where the minority leader, Senator \nLott, speaks with the majority leader, Senator Daschle, a committee was \nformed to meet with Senator Daschle.\n  As we know, any time committees are chosen, it usually slows things \ndown. Someone told me once that a committee was formed to come up with \na horse, and the committee came up with a camel. That was their version \nof a horse. I think the committee is not really serving the Senate \nwell.\n  I have knowledge, and I am sure their intent is good, nothing has \nhappened in all this time. It seems to me the time has come that \nsomething should happen. There has been a lot of passing back and forth \nof memoranda and meetings, but that is what is holding things up.\n  As I indicated, we have people for EPA. Senator Leahy has said \npublicly on a number of occasions he wants to start hearings in the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  This is not, as far as I am concerned, payback time. The fact is that \n45 percent of President Clinton's nominations for the appellate court \nnever made it through the process--45 percent. When we were in control \nlast time, the average waiting time for a judicial nomination was 85 \ndays. The last full Congress when the Republicans were in control, the \nwaiting time was 285 days.\n  This is not going to be payback time. Senator Daschle has said that. \nWe are going to conduct the Senate and the committee system in an \nappropriate way.\n  We have vacancies in Nevada. We have three vacancies for Federal \njudges in the small State of Nevada that need to be filled. We hope \nthat can take place quickly. Senator Ensign and I have agreed on the \njudges who should be nominated and sent to President Bush. They are \ndown there now.\n  I say to my friend from Alaska, we also want the organization of the \nSenate to formally take place, and we hope the committee of five will \nget together and take care of the other 44 Senators they represent and \nmove on to what we believe is the appropriate function of this Senate.\n  I will be happy to yield to my friend from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I very much appreciate the comments of my friend from \nNevada who has outlined, I think accurately, the overall situation. I \ndid not in my request highlight the overall resolve of this dilemma \nassociated with the committee and the structuring of the committee. \nWhat the Senator said certainly is relevant to having the committees \ntake action.\n  This issue of Steven Griles is entirely different. The reason it is \ndifferent is he has been waiting 28 days. That was before the Senate \nchanged hands. For the majority whip to indicate he is part of this, in \nreality, his nomination was pending before Senator Jeffords left our \nside and joined the other side.\n  At that time, we were negotiating with the Democrats in good faith to \nagree to a time agreement, and there was an indication that they would \nrequire at least several hours, and we were willing to do that.\n  I want the record to note Steven Griles is different than the other \npending nominations because he was proposed and held up prior to the \nDemocratic Party taking control of the Senate.\n  I again renew my request that special consideration be given him \nbecause his is truly a special case.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Alaska, I have not \nspoken to the majority leader about Steven Griles, but I am confident \nonce this organizational resolution is in effect, that will happen \npretty quickly.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If the Senator will yield on one more point.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I can appreciate that, but we are still saying Steven \nGriles is, in effect, held hostage as a consequence of the policies of \nthe majority now when we could have taken action when we had the \nmajority, but we were trying to work with the minority at that time.\n  Clearly, we are left in this dilemma of him being caught, if you \nwill, in the tidal backwater which affects us all, whether Republican \nor Democrat.\n  As the Senator from Nevada knows, he is from a public land State. He \nneeds some help at the Department of Interior. This action of delaying \nsimply puts off Mr. Griles' ability to serve our country and the \nDepartment. That is, indeed, unfortunate, particularly in view of the \nfact he was voted out of the committee and his nomination is still \npending.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I feel confident that it will be in \neveryone's interest--the minority, the majority, and every State in the \nUnion--if we can get this organizational situation completed. We have \nwaited far too long. The committee of five should meet as often as \nnecessary with Senator Daschle. We only have one representing us and \nfive representing them. I think Senator Daschle would make himself \navailable any time of the day or night to get this organizational \nsituation resolved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/20/senate-section/article/S6508-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6508-S6510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there has been a concerted effort since the \nfirst day of this week to stall, hinder, slow down--whatever term one \ncan use--the movement of this legislation which is before the Senate, \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. This method to slow down legislation has \ncome about because the managed care entities and the people who work \nwith them, who make a lot of money, have said to the minority: Do not \nlet this legislation move. And the minority is trying to live up to \ntheir request. Keep this legislation boxed up. Tie it up for as long as \npossible.\n  I announce to everyone within the sound of my voice and I spread over \nthe Record of the Senate that the ``as long as possible'' has come to \nan end. We are going to move this legislation. Five years is long \nenough. We are going to move this legislation now.\n  In the morning, we are going to vote on a motion to proceed that \nshould\n\n[[Page S6509]]\n\nhave taken place a long time ago. We should not even be having a vote \non a motion to proceed, but that is the way they decided to slow it \ndown, recognizing if they slow it down this week, then maybe next week \nwe will not want to work very hard. We have the Fourth of July parades, \nour 10 days at home, and then they will wait until after the Fourth of \nJuly, and we will have appropriations bills and maybe there will not be \na Patients' Bill of Rights for the sixth year.\n  That is not going to happen. Tom Daschle--whom I have known since \n1982; I served with him in the House and I have the good fortune of \nserving with him in the Senate; we came here together--has said we are \ngoing to complete this legislation before the Senate recesses for the \nFourth of July break.\n  Tom Daschle is a man of his word. That is what is going to happen, \nand everyone should understand that.\n  Why is this legislation called the Patients' Bill of Rights? It is \ncalled the Patients' Bill of Rights because it will create a law that \ngives patients the rights to which they are entitled, which they now do \nnot have. In short, it will once again allow a doctor to care for his \nor her patient. That is the way it used to be.\n  Just think, a doctor can prescribe medicine for his or her patient \nthat will heal that patient in the mind of the doctor, relieve pain, \nprevent disease. The doctor can do that because that doctor thinks that \nis best for his or her patient.\n  Imagine a doctor can refer a patient to a specialist if he believes \nit is appropriate. That is the way it used to be. That is the way it is \ngoing to be in the future.\n  We have heard all kinds of excuses that if this legislation passes, \nthe sky is going to fall. This is not the first time we have heard \nthese statements.\n\n  Senator Dorgan and I spoke today to a person who is a very successful \nbusinessman. He said: The reason I like Democrats, but the reason you \ncause businesspeople concern, is you want to change things: Social \nSecurity, Medicare. There are things you are trying to do differently. \nThey work out well, but people don't like change.\n  Just a few years ago, the Family Leave Act was talked about. The \nDemocrats thought it would be a good idea if America was like most \ncivilized countries. If a woman, for example, had a baby, she would not \nlose her job. It was called the Family Leave Act. We said: Employer, \nyou don't even have to pay the woman, but she should be guaranteed her \njob when she finishes 6 weeks of maternity leave.\n  We can't do that. It will drive us out of business. We cannot have \ntemporary employees. It will be awful.\n  I defy anyone to go home and have anybody raise the question that the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act has hurt their business. Of course, it has \nnot. It helps their business.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights is in the same category. It is going to \nhelp our society. In the long run, it will help businesses because it \nwill make the employees feel better about the businesses. We are being \ntold the Patients' Bill of Rights will be like the Family and Medical \nLeave Act; it will drive businesses into bankruptcy. This is not going \nto happen.\n  Everything possible is being brought up about this legislation. What \nare some of the things I have heard this week? Kill the lawyers--they \ngo back to biblical times. Kill all the lawyers. They have not said \nthat, but that is what they mean. They even know how many people are \ngoing to be driven out of the insurance protection field because of \nthis legislation. They say keep legislation in Federal court and not \nhave any in State court; it is too expensive. One dollar a month is too \nmuch money? Or nothing happened in committee; we need to go back to \ncommittee and hold hearings.\n  This legislation has been going on for 5 years. We have had days of \ndebate on the floor. We have had numerous committee hearings all over \nthe country. The best way to sum this up, with all the crying and \nwhining and stalling from the other side, is with who favors their \nlegislation. The managed care industry, HMOs, that is who favors their \nlegislation. Who favors McCain-Edwards-Kennedy? Everybody else. Does \nthat mean everybody else is dumb? Everybody else is being led around by \nthe greedy lawyers? The greedy doctors? The greedy nurses? Or does it \nmean this legislation solves a problem in our country? Is this the \nreason that 85 percent of everybody--Democrat, Republican, \nIndependent--supports this legislation? I repeat: Who does not support \nit? The managed care industry, HMOs.\n  Our Patients' Bill of Rights is a bill that is authored by the very \ncourageous John McCain. When we talk about John McCain, why do we add \n``courageous''? That is what he is. He is a war hero. But he is also \nlegislatively courageous. He is joined by John Edwards, a person in \nthis Senate of great intellect, and also Ted Kennedy, a man who has a \nlifetime of experience dealing with this issue. They have written a \nbill that is uncompromised. I will be surprised if this side offers \namendments. This is a good piece of legislation. We will take it as it \nis. We know we will put up with a lot of frivolous stalling, \nmischievous amendments on this side.\n  Last night, I ran into a journalist. He said to me: Senator Daschle \nthinks he is bluffing. I talked to a Republican Senator, and they think \nSenator Daschle is bluffing because it can't be done in that short a \nperiod of time.\n\n  This legislation has been handled in a short period of time in the \npast under the Republican leadership. When this bill came up in 1999, \nit finished in 4 days. We had a time certain it would pass--4 days. The \nbill was introduced and placed on the calendar on July 8. We began \nconsideration July 12. There were no committee hearings either. All \namendments were limited to 100 minutes of debate; no more than one \nsecond-degree amendment in order per side per amendment. Just prior to \nthe third reading, we agreed that the majority leader, then Senator \nLott, could be recognized to offer a final amendment to which no \nsecond-degree amendment was in order. Final passage occurred on that \nbill. Of course they killed it in conference. Everybody knows that. \nFinal passage was completed in 4 days. We had 17 amendments and 13 \nrollcall votes. So we can do this in 4 days and complete it by next \nThursday if people have the will to do so.\n  If they don't have the will to do it Thursday night sometime, we will \nbe here Friday, Saturday, Sunday. The Fourth of July is our first day \noff, a Wednesday, because we are going to work Friday, Saturday, \nSunday, Monday, Tuesday, and take Wednesday off and come back on \nThursday, the 5th, to complete this legislation. Everyone should know \nthis. It has been done in the past in 4 days. We can do it again.\n  This afternoon I received a letter. I have a friend in Nevada. He is \none of my wife's physicians, a wonderful, kind, thoughtful, considerate \nman. His name is Frank Nemec. Frank Nemec is not some person who does \nmedicine from the back seat of his car, the trunk of his car. Frank \nNemec is an extremely well-known physician around the country. He is \npublished and has written articles for medical journals. He had a \nFulbright scholarship to the University of California at Berkeley, \ngraduated with honors from the University of California at Berkeley, \nattended with a full scholarship the university of California at Los \nAngeles Medical School, and graduated with honors. He has been \npresident of the State medical society, president of the Clark County \nMedical Society, Las Vegas, chief of staff of the largest hospital in \nNevada, board certified in internal medicine, gastroenterology. This is \na fine physician and not somebody out stirring up trouble. He is a man \nwho has been involved in politics only because he believes his patients \nare being affected.\n  Here is a letter to me from Frank Nemec:\n\n       As you have heard from so many Nevadans over the past \n     several years, we need a mechanism where patients have \n     options when care is denied. The following case is a clear \n     illustration.\n       On April 20th, 1999, Joseph Greuble died at the age of 47 \n     from malnutrition. Joseph's malnutrition was a direct \n     complication of his lifelong battle with Crohn's Disease.\n\n  I am familiar with Crohn's disease, Mr. President. There are two of \nwhat are called digestive bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and \ngastroenteritis. They are both bad, but the worst is Crohn's. My wife \nis fortunate not to have such a dread disease as that; she has \ngastroenteritis. She has spent many months of her life in hospitals.\n\n[[Page S6510]]\n\n  So I know something about Crohn's disease. The letter continues:\n\n       Joseph's gastrointestinal problem was quite complex. His \n     disease was complicated by ulcerations, fistulae, bleeding, \n     obstruction, electrolyte disturbances, seizures, and chronic \n     pain, and Joseph required multiple operations. Continuity of \n     care is most important when dealing with an incurable, \n     chronic, debilitating disease. In Joseph's case, the system's \n     failure to provide continuity of care proved tragic and \n     fatal.\n       I served as Joseph's personal physician for 11 years. As \n     Joseph's condition worsened he was no longer able to live \n     independently, and he moved into his mother's small apartment \n     in Las Vegas. His mother would accompany him to my office for \n     all of Joseph's visits and as a result, I came to know his \n     mother Marion quite well.\n       For over a decade, I performed needed physician \n     examinations, arranged for appropriate diagnostic studies, \n     wrote Joseph's prescriptions, and attended to him in the \n     hospital whenever he required admission due to complications \n     of his disease. One of Joseph's most pressing needs was for \n     nutritional support. Joseph had become malnourished as a \n     complication of his Crohns Disease, and required TPN \n     (intravenous nutrition).\n\n  I am also familiar with that, Mr. President.\n\n     Joseph's weight had fallen to just over 110 pounds, and at 5' \n     10\" tall Joseph needed the TPN to maintain his weight and \n     prevent death due to malnutrition.\n\n       In January of 1999, Joseph was told by his HMO that I could \n     no longer treat him. Appeals by both myself and Joseph to \n     have this decision reversed were denied. My offer to see \n     Joseph free of charge was rejected by the HMO, as I still \n     would not have been permitted to write his prescriptions, \n     direct his nutritional support, order any diagnostic testing, \n     or request needed consultations.\n       While I do not have any of the medical records of Joseph's \n     treatment for the three months after he left my care, \n     Joseph's mother informs me that his TPN had been \n     discontinued, that his malnutrition worsened, his weight \n     dropping to less than 100 pounds. Joseph, malnourished and \n     unable to fight off infection, subsequently developed \n     pneumonia, sepsis, and died.\n       I have received permission from Mrs. Grouble to share this \n     story. Marion hopes that sharing her son's story will help \n     achieve the needed legislation to prevent this from happening \n     in the future. Holding health plans accountable when they \n     harm patients is not about suing insurance companies and \n     driving up the cost of health care, it is about stopping \n     abuses and bringing compassion back to medicine. Until the \n     health plans are accountable, people like Joseph and his \n     family will continue to suffer.\n       Again, thank you for all the hard work on this important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Frank J. Nemec, M.D.\n\n  Doesn't this say it all? Why are we here? Are we here to talk about \npeople dropped from insurance rolls? Are we here to talk about some \nlawyer fighting a lawsuit that doesn't exist?\n  Zell Miller was on the floor today. Georgia has a Patients' Bill of \nRights. Not one single solitary lawsuit has been filed. In the State of \nTexas they have a Patients' Bill of Rights that the President of the \nUnited States vetoed on two separate occasions. They have a Patients' \nBill of Rights there. In over 4 years they have had 17 lawsuits, one \nevery quarter. It doesn't sound too overwhelming to me. I don't think \nit is going to drive the HMOs out of business. So let's get real.\n  This is about money. It is about the Frank Nemecs of the world who \nwent to medical school to take care of his patients and he is told he \ncan't take care of his patients. He said: I'll do it for nothing. They \nsaid: No, you might write a prescription we don't like.\n  I don't know, this man might have died soon anyway, but he would not \nhave died as soon as he did. I guess the HMO decided his life wasn't \nworth anything anyway--he's going to die. He's 5 foot 10, weighs 110 \npounds. Let's just terminate it more quickly.\n  We are going to finish this legislation. We are going to finish this \nlegislation and send it over to the House. They can play whatever games \nthey want with it, but I think the games will end over there because we \nhave very courageous Republicans on that side of this institution, led \nby Charlie Norwood from the State of Georgia, who have said they have \ntaken all they can.\n  I almost cried when I read this letter. Maybe if I were not here in \nfront of the world I might admit when I read it in my office I shed a \ntear.\n  This is sad. If you knew Frank Nemec, this gentle, big man, you would \nknow how sincere he is.\n  So why is this taking place? It is taking place because of money. It \nis taking place because the HMOs want to hang on as long as they can to \nkeep those stock prices up and make as much money as they can in \nsalaries. They are still going to do just fine after we pass this \nlegislation, but they are not going to do as fine as they have been. \nThey are not going to be able to terminate the care of someone such as \nMr. Greuble.\n  Yesterday I read into the Record those organizations with names \nstarting with the letter A that support this legislation. I am going to \nread for a while tonight. I am not going to read them all. This is a \npartial list. But I want this spread across the Record of this Senate \nthat this legislation is supported by America.

Mr. President, I am here to wish a happy birthday to a \ncelebrant near and dear to my heart. The thirty-fifth child in the \nfamily, grown from a difficult beginning as a child of war\n\n[[Page S6511]]\n\nand conflict into a robust 138-year-old, the birthday girl is entering \nthe new century with confidence and strength.\n  The birthday party in question is, of course, for the wild and \nwonderful, great and beautiful State of West Virginia, celebrated this \nThursday, June 20. In 1863, West Virginia was born by proclamation--the \nonly state so created. Like Caesar Augustus, West Virginia was wrested \nfrom her mother, Virginia, at the point of a sword. Also like Caesar, I \nforesee greatness ahead for West Virginia.\n  West Virginia is not a large State, ranking 41st at 24,231 square \nmiles. But the stars shone on her birth, blessing her with natural \nriches, water, and a central location as the northernmost southern \nState and the southernmost northern State. I might wish for her more \nflat land, but, on the other hand, I would not trade a level plain for \neven a single glorious hillside blanketed by lush tangles of wild \nrhododendron bisected by a clear, cold stream tumbling over rocky drops \namid dense stands of oak and maple. Her mountains are her crowning \nglory, molding her history and her character. They will continue to \nshape her future. The steep slopes that so complicate development \npreserve forests and wildlife. Nearly 75 percent of West Virginia is \ncovered with forest. The slopes capture snow for great skiing. They \nshelter coursing whitewater rivers that attract kayakers, rafters, and \nfishermen from around the world. In a nation increasingly concerned \nwith urban sprawl, West Virginia remains an oasis of serenity amid the \nsurging tide of advancing humanity, an island of tranquil forest where \neagles still soar and the crime rate is the lowest in the Nation.\n  The mountains have also shaped the character of her people, \nreinforcing and sustaining the independence of character and the strong \nwork ethic that are necessary in isolated and challenging environments. \nWest Virginians are friendly, caring neighbors, meeting bad weather and \nhard times with a community spirit that is itself a force to be \nreckoned with. West Virginians are patriotic as well. The youngest \nsoldier of World War I, Chester Merriman of Romney, enlisted at the \ntender age of 14. And West Virginians are close to the Creator, \nreminded daily of His presence by the natural cathedral of sky, wind, \nwater, wood, and stone that is their environment. With a mean altitude \nof 1,500 feet, the highest average altitude east of the Mississippi, \nWest Virginians are literally nearer to God, as well.\n  Over the course of the last 138 years, West Virginia has had her \nshare of firsts. In 1756, the first spa open to the public was \nestablished at Bath, VA, now Berkeley Springs. The Golden Delicious \napple was first grown in Clay County. The Grimes Golden apple was first \ngrown in Brooke County. In 1787, the first steam-powered motor boat was \nlaunched in the Potomac River by James Rumsey at New Mecklensburg, now \nknown as Shepherdstown. One of the first papers in the nation devoted \nmainly to the interests of women was published in Harper's Ferry on \nFebruary 14, 1824. One of the first suspension bridges in the world was \ncompleted in Wheeling in November 1849.\n  The Civil War brought a number of ``firsts'' to West Virginia history \nbooks. The first major land battle fought between Union and Confederate \nforces in that conflict was the Battle of Philippi, on June 3, 1861. \nThe first Union soldier had been killed a few days earlier, at \nFetterman, Taylor County.\n  West Virginia has had other notable ``firsts'' since achieving \nstatehood. West Virginia was also the site of the first rural free mail \ndelivery in the nation. It began in Charles Town on October 6, 1896, \nbefore spreading throughout the rest of the United States. About 1908, \noutdoor advertising had its start when the Block Brothers Tobacco \nCompany painted bridges and barns around Wheeling with the words \n``Treat Yourself To the Best, Chew Mail Pouch.'' Some people now spend \ntheir vacations hunting down and photographing those old barns.\n  On the political front, in 1928, Mrs. Minnie Buckingham Harper became \na member of the House of Delegates by appointment and was, according to \nthe West Virginia Archives, the first black woman to become a member of \na legislative body in America. A less popular political first for West \nVirginia is its place as the first state to enact a state sales tax, \nwhich took effect on July 1, 1921. As a final ``first,'' I would be \nremiss not to note here that Mother's Day was first observed at Andrews \nChurch in Grafton, WV, on May 10, 1908. So West Virginia can claim \nmotherhood and apple pie to offset that more sinister pair--death and \ntaxes. We really do have it all.\n  West Virginia has experienced great change over the last 138 years. \nShe remains a great resource for the country. Her coal and natural gas \nwill continue to fuel the nation, just as her forests will provide \nhomes and paper that the electronic age still has not supplanted. She \nhas greatness still in store, nurtured in the bright minds of her young \npeople, encouraged by the wisdom and foresight of her elders, carried \non the strong shoulders of her workers and innovators, who love the \nstate and want not to leave it for greener economic shores but to carry \nthat tide into the mountains.\n  It has given me great pleasure over the years to help West Virginia \ngrow. I may not have been born a West Virginian, but this transplant \nhas taken well to the soil there. I have grafted. I hope that my \nefforts on her behalf have borne fruit that will help sustain her \nthrough the next 138 years. That is the best birthday gift that I can \nthink to give her.\n\n       West Virginia, how I love you!\n       Every streamlet, shrub and stone,\n       Even the clouds that flit above you\n       Always seem to be my own.\n\n       Your steep hillsides clad in grandeur,\n       Always rugged, bold and free,\n       Sing with ever swelling chorus:\n       Montani, Semper, Liberi!\n\n       Always free! The little streamlets,\n       As they glide and race along,\n       Join their music to the anthem\n       And the zephyrs swell the song.\n\n       Always free! The mountain torrent\n       In its haste to reach the sea,\n       Shouts its challenge to the hillsides\n       And the echo answers ``FREE!''\n\n       Always free! Repeats the river\n       In a deeper, fuller tone\n       And the West wind in the treetops\n       Adds a chorus all its own.\n\n       Always Free! The crashing thunder,\n       Madly flung from hill to hill,\n       In a wild reverberation\n       Makes our hearts with rapture fill.\n\n       Always free! The Bob White whistles\n       And the whippoorwill replies,\n       Always free! The robin twitters\n       As the sunset gilds the skies.\n\n       Perched upon the tallest timber,\n       Far above the sheltered lea,\n       There the eagle screams defiance\n       To a hostile world: ``I'm free!''\n\n       And two million happy people,\n       Hearts attuned in holy glee,\n       Add the hallelujah chorus:\n       ``Mountaineers are always free!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/20/senate-section/article/S6511-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6511-S6512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SPECIAL AGENT TIMOTHY F. DEERR, FORMER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AIR FORCE \n                    OFFICE OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a dedicated and \ninnovative public servant, Timothy F. Deerr, the former Executive \nDirector of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations, who \nrecently retired after more than 26 years of loyal and selfless \nservice.\n  As any citizen of the United States should know, two major powers \nemerged from the ashes and ruins of World War II--the United States of \nAmerica and the now defunct Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The \nideologies and interests of these two nations were diametrically \nopposed and the aspirations of Soviet communists for global control \nmade it imperative that America's foot soldiers and leaders in national \nsecurity affairs exercise vigilance and sacrifice in defense of \nfreedom. For almost fifty years, these two superpowers engaged in a \n``cold war,'' where conflict was waged through proxies, brinksmanship, \nespionage, and counterespionage. It was in this environment in 1975 \nthat Timothy Deerr joined the battle as a civilian Special Agent of the \nAir Force Office of Special Investigations.\n  By the time he completed his career earlier this year, Timothy Deerr \nhad spent most of his professional life as a cold warrior and spy \ncatcher. But, before he entered what has alternately been called the \n``world's second oldest profession'' and the ``wilderness of mirrors,'' \nhe started out as a criminal investigator in Dayton, Ohio. It was here, \nat Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, that Special Agent Deerr learned \nand\n\n[[Page S6512]]\n\nhoned his skills as an investigator, gaining invaluable experience in \nhow to read people, analyze facts, and test hypotheses.\n  After 6 years of working criminal cases in Ohio, Special Agent Deerr \nswapped the Buckeye State for the divided city of Berlin. Since renamed \nas the Capital of a united Germany, Berlin was then a city carved into \nsectors of control--a virtual battleground of espionage and counter-\nespionage activities. Intelligence operatives from the east and west \nworked feverishly against one another, both to steal secrets and to \nprotect secrets from being compromised. For two years, Special Agent \nDeerr conducted critical and successful counterintelligence operations \ndefending against foreign intelligence services stationed in the \ncommunist sector of Berlin. As a demonstration of the sensitivity of \nthe operations he conducted, his experiences and cases in Berlin remain \nclassified to this day, twenty years after he initially reported for \nduty there and ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n  From 1987, when he left Berlin, until 1994, Special Agent Deerr \nearned and held positions of increasing responsibility and importance \nwithin the Office of Special Investigations, including those of Chief, \nCentral European Counterintelligence Operations, Wiesbaden, West \nGermany. Later, as the OSI Director of Counterintelligence, he managed \nOSI counterintelligence investigations and operations around the world \nand represented OSI and the Air Force on a number of senior policy \nboards that crafted our national counterintelligence strategy and \npolicies.\n  While freedom loving people in the United States and throughout the \nworld heralded and celebrated the implosion of communism in the early \n1990s, an ironic byproduct of the end of the Soviet Union ensured \nAmerica's Cold Warriors would enjoy little respite. While the USSR was \na threat to peace and security for almost fifty years, it was a threat \nthat we were able to identify and engage. After the Cold War, the world \nbecame, in many regards, a puzzling patchwork of active and potential \nadversaries of the United States and American citizens. Not only were \nforeign governments targeting our secrets and threatening our security, \nso were criminal and terrorist organizations. In recognition of this \nnew dynamic, in 1994, the President of the United States directed a re-\nexamination of the U.S. Counterintelligence Program, including ways to \nimprove coordination, integration and accountability of American \ncounterintelligence efforts. As a result, Presidential Decision \nDirective 24 was issued in May 1994. The directive, in part, mandated \nthe establishment of the National Counterintelligence Center, and \nSpecial Agent Deerr was tapped as the Deputy Director of the new \nNational Counterintelligence Center, an impressive distinction and a \ntestament to his reputation and success as one of America's premier spy \ncatchers.\n  In 1996, Special Agent Deerr returned to Air Force OSI as its \nExecutive Director--the senior civilian Special Agent in the United \nStates Air Force. During his five-year tenure in the top civilian \nposition within OSI, Mr. Deerr earned a reputation for innovation and \nexcellence in leadership. He took the helm at an interesting and \nchallenging time in the history of OSI. As a result of the end of the \nCold War, diminishing budgets, and retirements of personnel who entered \ngovernment service at the height of the Cold War, he faced personnel \nupheaval and institutional reorganization. America and our Armed Forces \nwere faced with new and daunting challenges that required institutional \nagility, professional creativity, and cutting-edge technical skills. \nUnder Executive Director Deerr's steady stewardship, OSI ``re-\ninvented'' itself as a model for the 21st Century in the fields of \ncounterintelligence, anti-terrorism, and crime fighting.\n  OSI built DoD's Computer Forensics Laboratory--America's premier \nelectronic media forensics lab dedicated to ferreting out evidence of \ncomputer crime, network intrusions, and felony tampering with DoD \ncomputer systems. OSI started and still manages the Defense Computer \nInvestigations Training Program--DoD's ``graduate school'' for those \ntasked with investigating cyber-related crimes. Furthermore, Executive \nDirector Deerr emerged as a visionary leader of the Defense Criminal \nInvestigative Organizations, DCIO, Enterprise-Wide Working Group, the \nDEW Group. Mr. Deerr and the DEW Group devised innovative enterprise-\nwide pilot programs to leverage scarce DoD resources, improve training \nand deployment of America's front line investigators, and save taxpayer \ndollars.\n  Executive Director Deerr's influence and innovations extended far \nbeyond DoD. Through his active membership in the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police and the IACP International Policy \nCommittee, Tim Deerr was instrumental in proliferating enduring \nprinciples of policing professionalism, integrity, civil liberties, and \nselfless service to the international policing executive community \nacross the globe.\n  After 26 years of service, Executive Director Timothy Deerr left Air \nForce OSI an even better agency than the one he joined in 1975. His \ncareer ran the gamut from criminal investigations to catching spies, \nand from being a rookie agent to the top civilian on the payroll. \nDuring his almost three decades of service, the world changed \ndramatically from a bipolar one where there was a constant threat of \nnuclear war to one where the United States must be prepared to counter \nthreats on a multitude of new fronts. Through his uncommon dedication \nand selfless devotion to duty he has left an indelible mark on the face \nof counterintelligence within the U.S. Government. I am certain that \nall my colleagues will want to join me in commending Mr. Deerr on a \nsuccessful career and a job well done as well as wishing him, his wife \nTerri, and their daughter Alexandra, great health, happiness, and \nprosperity in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/20/senate-section/article/S6512-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6512-S6513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LOOMING NURSE SHORTAGE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I am enormously pleased to bring to my colleagues' \nattention not only a serious problem that threatens health care \nthroughout this Nation, but my optimism that the Department of Veterans \nAffairs can serve as a pathfinder in seeking solutions to this problem.\n  On June 14, the Committee held a hearing to explore reasons for the \nimminent shortage of professional nurses in the United States, and how \nthis shortage will affect health care for veterans served by Department \nof Veterans Affairs, VA, health care facilities. Quality of care issues \nhave always been important to this committee and to me, and skilled \nnurses are indispensable to high quality health care. Representatives \nof nursing associations, unions, and VA testified about the conditions \nthat have created this critical nurse shortage and what VA--the largest \nemployer of nurses in the United States--can do to address them.\n  The problem can be stated simply: too few nurses are caring for too \nmany patients in our Nation's hospitals. Fewer young people seek \nnursing careers every year, while the demand for skilled nursing care, \nespecially long-term care, is climbing. Although we have faced health \ncare staffing shortages before, experts warn that we are on the brink \nof a severe and long-lasting crisis. Unless we take steps to address \nthis problem now, the demand for nurses will exceed the supply for many \nyears to come.\n  Working conditions for nurses--never easy--have become even more \nchallenging. Managed care principles lead hospitals to admit only the \nvery sickest of patients with the most complex health care needs. As \nthe pool of highly trained nurses shrinks, many health care providers \nrely heavily upon mandatory overtime to meet staffing needs. Several \nregistered nurses, including Sandra McMeans from my state of West \nVirginia, testified before the committee that unpredictable and \ndangerously long working hours lead to nurses' fatigue and \nfrustration--and patient care suffers.\n  Astonishingly, VA has not been included in the other hearings on the \nnurse shortage that have taken place during this session of Congress. \nVA is the largest employer of nurses in the Nation, and its nurses are \ncloser to retirement age than those in other health care systems. This \nmakes the problem even more critical in VA\n\n[[Page S6513]]\n\nhealth care facilities. However, VA enjoys a lower rate of nurse \nturnover, and a handful of VA nurses have managed to carve out \ninnovative programs to improve nurse recruitment and retention. Several \nof these innovators testified at the hearing on June 14.\n  Programs initiated within VA to improve conditions for nurses and \npatients have focused on issues beyond staffing ratios and hours. A \nhighly praised scholarship program that I spearheaded allows VA nurses \nto pursue degrees and training in return for their service, thus \nencouraging professional development and improving the quality of \nhealth care. Nursing administrators in an award-winning program at the \nTampa VA Medical Center have looked for ways to include nurses in \ndecisionmaking, and to keep up with technical innovations that can make \nthe job safer and less physically demanding. In the Upper Midwest, the \nspecial skills of nurses and nurse practitioners are being recognized \nin clinics that provide supportive care close to the veterans who need \nit.\n  As nursing careers have dropped from favor for young women, the sort \nof training programs that provided so many with their first glimpses of \npatient care have fallen by the wayside. Much to my surprise, one of \nour witnesses testified that the ``candy striper'' programs of the past \nno longer exist to serve as training grounds for future nurses. Through \na ``nurse cadet'' program at the VA Medical Center in Salem, VA, VA is \nattempting to fill that void by providing leadership in testing \ncommunity mentoring programs designed to spark the next generation's \ninterest in nursing careers.\n  Clearly, more can be--and must be--done to address this problem. \nAlthough the nursing crisis has not yet reached its projected peak, the \nshortage is already endangering patient safety in the areas of critical \nand long-term care, where demands on nurses are greatest. We must \nencourage higher enrollment in nursing schools, improve the work \nenvironment, and offer nurses opportunities to develop as respected \nprofessionals, while taking steps to ensure safe staffing levels in the \nshort-term.\n  We do not have the luxury of reflecting upon this problem at length; \nwe must act now. Fortunately, we have as allies hardworking nurses who \nare dedicated to helping us find ways to improve working conditions and \nto recruit more young people to the field. I look forward to working \nwith VA to provide a model for the Nation on how to accomplish these \ndifficult tasks.\n  In closing, I ask unanimous consent that a Raleigh, North Carolina, \nNews and Observer article that focuses on the innovative nursing \nprograms, and the enthusiastic and committed nurses, at the Durham VA \nMedical Center be printed in the Record. It is just this sort of \ncommitment which gives me confidence that VA can indeed assume a \nleadership role as we as a Nation confront the nurse shortage.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    [From the Raleigh North Carolina News and Observer, May 6, 2001]\n\n               Durham VA Nurses Serving Those Who Served\n\n       The Durham Veterans Administration Medical Center provides \n     care to Armed Forces veterans through three inpatient \n     critical care units, three acute medical-surgical units, two \n     extended-care rehabilitation units and one in-patient \n     psychiatric unit, all of which coordinate care with a large \n     out-patient service. ``Nursing care is provided to veterans \n     in a traditional nursing service structure by a staff of over \n     300 RNs,'' said Kae Huggins, RN, MSN, CNAA, and director of \n     nursing. ``They are empowered to deliver patient-centered \n     care within a shared-leadership environment.''\n       Durham VA nurses said they are given the opportunity to \n     provide quality patient centered care, which creates a \n     culture that supports problem solving, risk-taking and \n     participation in decision-making.\n       When asked to share their reasons for choosing to pursue \n     their careers at the Durham VA Center, several registered \n     nurses were eager to tell their story.\n       Irene Caldwell, RN, nursing instructor and Vietnam veteran \n     Army nurse said, ``There is no greater honor than to care for \n     those who through their service allow us to enjoy all that we \n     have in this nation. The VA Medical Center in Durham is part \n     of the network that is `keeping the promise.' Having over 30 \n     years of employment as a registered nurse at the VA in \n     Durham, I am proud to be one of the `Promise Keepers'.''\n       Ken O'Leary, RN, staff nurse (USAF) in the Surgical \n     Intensive Care Unit, said, ``Being a vet, it is great to take \n     care of fellow vets. Hearing their stories and sharing their \n     memories of history in the making is so rewarding. It is nice \n     to do for those who have done so much for the freedom we \n     enjoy in this country.''\n       Laura Smith, RN in psychiatry and critical care, said, ``It \n     is a real pleasure to serve those who gave us the freedom to \n     live the way we do. The veterans are the most caring and \n     appreciative group of patients I have ever known and are \n     fiercely independent.\n       ``Nursing here gives you pride in your country, and the \n     DVAMC gives you support to stay in nursing. The nursing field \n     is every-changing and the education staff at DVAMC works very \n     hard to keep us up to date on all the latest items involving \n     our careers. They also support innovations to make our jobs \n     easier, such as lift equipment, computerized medication \n     administration system and electronic charting.''\n       Jackie Howell, RN, community health nurse, said, ``Working \n     at the Durham VA Medical Center not only affords us an \n     opportunity to give back to those veterans who so bravely \n     served our country, but it also affords us the opportunity to \n     advance professionally. It is one of the few hospitals that \n     truly values nurses and nursing. The philosophy of shared \n     leadership has empowered the nursing staff to be decision \n     makers and innovators, thus maintaining quality of care. \n     Nursing at the Durham VA allows us to be all we want to be.''\n       Reginald Horwitz, RN, Coronary Care Intensive Care Unit, \n     had this to say: ``As a Filipino-American given the chance to \n     serve out veterans, it gives me a different outlook, in that \n     I have the opportunity to give back to the very group of \n     people who have given their all for the freedom in this \n     country we now all enjoy and cherish. Moreover, the VA nurse \n     is allowed to grow personally and professionally in an \n     environment that takes the entire health care team into \n     account in making decisions that best serve the interests of \n     our veterans. It is an honor to be a VA nurse.''\n       Linda Albers, RN, IV team, said enthusiastically, ``Just \n     today a patient said to me, `I like coming here, YOU KEEP \n     YOUR WORD.' How accurately he described the VA. As federal \n     employees, we do keep the promise Congress made to veterans \n     who are unfailingly grateful for the care we provide. The VA \n     also kept its word to employees. We are involved in clinical-\n     based research, which improves patient outcomes, impacts \n     healthcare and is certainly healthy for our careers, as are \n     the educational opportunities provided. Everyone at the VA is \n     committed to keeping our promise to veteran patients, which \n     enhances our culture of camaraderie and cooperation. In one \n     sentence--The VA keeps its word--to veterans and employees.''\n       Suchada Dewitya, nursing home RN, said emphatically, \n     ``These patients have risked their lives for our freedom. \n     When they get sick, they should be treated with dignity and \n     respect. We now have an increasing number of women veterans \n     who come here for their care. We have a Veteran Women's \n     Department that provides primary care. They all deserve \n     quality, complete service. I am proud to deliver that.''\n       Ester Lynch, RN, said: ``I started here as a nursing \n     student, new graduate, surgical floor nurse, and now I'm a \n     nurse manager! There is no other place I'd rather be in \n     nursing. It is so rewarding to serve veteran patients.''\n       Virginia Brown, RN and retired from the Army Nurse Corps, \n     said, ``Some of the brightest, the best and the most \n     professional nurses I've met were VA nurses. The patient \n     population and their families become a special community \n     throughout North Carolina and the nation. I especially like \n     being a staff nurse with direct patient care. And only at the \n     VA can a nurse choose to be a staff nurse and be supported \n     financially for their contributions. I, too, am a veteran, \n     and retired from the ANC through the U.S. Army Reserve.''\n       Mary Kay Wooten, enterostomal therapy clinical nurse \n     specialist, said ``I have been a nurse at this VA Medical \n     Center for my entire professional nursing career. I have \n     stayed here for many reasons, but the overwhelming one is our \n     patients. Our patients have given so much to our country and \n     many times have received so little in return. I am proud to \n     be able to give them something in return. Professionally, I \n     have had the opportunity to do everything that I have wanted. \n     I have had a variety of roles and worked in a variety of \n     settings in the acute-care setting. I have also received many \n     educational opportunities. As our nurse recruiter, Joe Foley, \n     says, ``The VA is the best-kept secret around.' Having worked \n     here for 29 years, I can't imagine working any other place.''\n       Wooten said VA nurses have state-of-the-art equipment \n     available to them, and cited the Wound Vac as an example. The \n     Wound Vac is a method of treatment for management of acute \n     and chronic wounds that VA nurses have been using since 1995, \n     shortly after its FDA approval. This advanced technology has \n     allowed VA nurses to focus on other aspects of patients' care \n     as it has decreased length of stay, improved wound healing \n     and increased patient satisfaction, all at a cost savings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/20/senate-section/article/S6513-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6513-S6514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    KEY INFLUENCES ON YOUTH DRUG USE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to key \ninfluences in youth drug use as reported in\n\n[[Page S6514]]\n\na national study, released by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration, SAMHSA, entitled Risk and Preventive Factors \nfor Adolescent Drug Use: Findings from the 1997 National Household \nSurvey on Drug Abuse.\n  As summarized in the Spring 2001 edition of the magazine SAMHSA News, \nthis study reported ``[p]eer use and peer attitudes are two of the \nstrongest predictors of marijuana use among all young people.'' For \nyouth in the age range of 12-17, using marijuana in the past year was \n39 times higher if close friends had used it versus if they had friends \nwho had not used it. The odds for the same age group were 16 times \nhigher if adolescents thought their friends would not be ``very upset'' \nif they used marijuana. While peer attitudes were more influential than \nparental attitudes, youth were still 9.6 times more likely to smoke \nmarijuana if they viewed their parents ``would not be very upset'' \nversus ``very upset.''\n  Other risk factors for past-year marijuana use were the youth's own \nuse of alcohol and tobacco, the parent's attitude about alcohol and \ntobacco, if youth could not talk to their parents about serious \nproblems, if youth were not enrolled in school, if youth were receiving \npoor grades in school, or if they did not attend religious services \nonce a week. Interestingly, the factors that most correlated with \ncigarette use were the same factors associated with alcohol, marijuana, \nand other illegal drugs. Finally, youth who had not received in-school \ndrug/alcohol education were slightly more likely to have used marijuana \nin the past year than those who had not. The analysis results were \nuniform across race/ethnicity.\n  The average person, much less a teenager, does not wake up one day \nand decide to do a line of cocaine or take a hit of heroin. There is a \ngeneral progression of both actions and attitudes. The so-called \n``softer'' drugs of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, and other club or \nsynthetic drugs are actually ``gateways'' that precede the use of \ncocaine and heroin. According to a 14-year veteran of drug treatment in \nNew York City, the average age of new users she sees has dropped from \n17 or 18 years to now 13. Quoting her from a recent newspaper article, \n``[w]e've seen the age of first use drop dramatically''. . .``[k]ids \nare going from doing marijuana to drugs like ecstasy and rohypnol in \nmonths.'' A Spartanburg County South Carolina sheriff, also quoted in a \nrecent newspaper article, reminds us ``[t]hat the first responsibility \nof parenthood is to protect the child.'' Backing up the SAMSHA \nobservations on peers and peer attitudes, he concluded ``parents need \nto pay close attention to the way their children act and who they're \nhanging around with.''\n  It may be difficult to raise teenagers or keep your children off all \nillegal substances, but there are some easy first steps and warning \nsigns to heed. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA, \nhandbook ``Preventing Drug Abuse Among Children and Adolescents,'' the \nbest ``protective factors'' include ``strong bonds with parents, \nexperience of parental monitoring with clear rules of conduct within \nthe family unit, involvement of parents in the lives of their children, \nsuccess in school performance, strong bonds with prosocial institutions \nsuch as family, school, and religious organizations, and adoption of \nconventional norms about drug use.'' With respect to family \nrelationships, NIDA research shows that ``parents need to take a more \nactive role in their children's lives, including talking to them about \ndrugs, monitoring their activities, getting to know their friends, and \nunderstanding their problems and concerns.''\n  These are simple, positive actions that all of us, as friends, peers, \ncoworkers, concerned adults, or parents can start today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/20/senate-section/article/S6514-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6514-S6515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMEMORATION OF WORLD REFUGEE DAY\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I commemorate World Refugee Day, a \nday designated for our country to celebrate the multiple contributions \nthat immigrants have made to make America a richer, more perfect union.\n  It is tragic that while immigrants continue to make the fabric of our \nNation stronger, many immigrants continue to be barred from vital \nsafety net services including access to health care.\n  For the past several years there has been heated discussion regarding \nthe number of uninsured in America.\n  There are uninsured children in every State, county and community in \nAmerica. States have sought to address this issue through programs such \nas Medicaid and the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Through \nthese Federal-State programs, States have been able to insure millions \nof eligible children.\n  There has been recent success in providing coverage for those \nfamilies and children who have gone without health insurance. We were \npleased by the new census date on the number of uninsured in America. \nThe data shows that the number of Americans without health insurance \nfell from 44.3 million to 42.6 million in 1999. This is the first \ndecline since 1987. And this is good news.\n  In the last Presidential campaign, Vice President Gore and then-\nGovernor Bush focused on the critical importance of insuring our \nnation's children and families. Today Congress is struggling with how \nbest to cover the nations uninsured. The national press is writing \narticle after article regarding outreach and enrollment of children in \nto the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program. These are \nlaudable discussions, but there is a critical element that was missing \nin Presidential rhetoric, congressional deliberations and the media's \nstories. This ``missing piece'' is the regrettable fact that the \ncurrent federal policy, denies public health insurance to legal \nimmigrant children and pregnant women.\n  While we are seeing declines in the overall level of uninsured in \nAmerica, the fact is that the proportion of immigrant children who are \nuninsured remains extremely high. A report by the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities, shows that in the last year, nearly half of low-\nincome immigrant children in America had no health insurance coverage.\n  Additionally, the percentage of low-income immigrant children in \npublicly-funded coverage--which was low even before enactment of the \n1996 welfare reform law--has fallen substantially, Providing Medicaid \nand CHIP to legal immigrant children is critical in order to guarantee \na healthy generation of children in America.\n  We all know that if we are lucky enough to have health insurance, \nregular health care services, particularly preventive care, is critical \nfor maintaining good health. Children who need these services should \nreceive them, regardless of how long they have lived in this country.\n  Pregnant women, regardless of their immigration status, want to make \nsure that their unborn children are growing and healthy. A child who is \nsick just wants to feel better. She does not understand that laws or \nher immigration status could prevent her from seeing a doctor.\n  Legal immigrant children, regardless of their date of entry, should \nhave the opportunity to be treated and cared for by a doctor. Access to \nearly medical attention can often mean the difference between curing a \nminor illness and dealing with a serious, potentially life threatening, \nmedical emergency. No parent in America should have to stand by and \nwatch their child suffer unnecessarily through an illness.\n  Five years is too long to wait.\n  Moreover, all children should be able to see a pediatrician when they \nare well--to prevent problems before they start. For example, \nimmunizations in the first few years of life are critical to keep \nchildren protected from terrible diseases and to protect those around \nthem. And for pregnant women, prenatal care helps to ensure that their \nnewborns will be born healthy, without the worries and costs that come \nwith a sick or premature baby.\n  Giving States the option to provide health insurance coverage to \nnewly arrived legal immigrant children would help states in their \nefforts to enroll more low income children. States could simplify their \nchild application and enrollment procedures by dispensing with complex \nimmigrant eligibility determinations. In addition, outreach messages \ncould be simplified, making it easier for community groups such as \nschools and churches to help enroll legal immigrant children.\n  I believe that providing Medicaid and CHIP to legal immigrant \nchildren is\n\n[[Page S6515]]\n\ncritical in order to guarantee a healthy generation of children in \nAmerica. To this end, I, along with my Senate and House colleagues, \nhave introduced the Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act, 582 \nand H.R. 1143, to give States the option to provide health care \ncoverage through Medicaid and CHIP.\n  Legal immigrant children who came to this country after August 22, \n1996 are no different than those who arrived before that date or kids \nwho were born on American soil. Our children go to school together, \nstudy together and play together.\n  On this World Refugee Day, I call upon the Congress and the President \nto work in earnest to eliminate the arbitrary designation of August 22, \n1996 as a cutoff date for allowing children to get health care.\n  Let us treat the hard working people in our nation, regardless of \ntheir immigration status, with fairness and dignity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/20/senate-section/article/S6515-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am increasingly concerned about the \nstalled promise of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. There are many \nindications that the pro-competitive course we charted in 1996 when we \nenacted the Telecommunications Act is not moving as quickly as we \nintended. In response to that landmark law, hundreds of companies \ninvested billions of dollars in an effort to bring a choice of service \nprovider to local consumers. Yet the competitive telecommunications \nindustry has virtually collapsed in the past year. Every day brings \nreports of competitors declaring bankruptcy, shutting down operations, \nor scaling back plans to offer service. Even in my home State, five \ncompetitive local exchange carriers with major operations in Tennessee \nhave gone bankrupt.\n  We have all read recent reports of the difficulties that competitive \ntelecommunications firms are facing in the current economic downturn. \nFor those that continue to struggle in operation, stock prices have \nplunged, and the capital market has virtually dried up. While \ntelecommunications companies captured an average of two billion dollars \nper month in initial public offerings over the last two years, they \nraised only $76 million in IPOs in March, leading numerous companies to \nwithdraw their IPO plans.\n  The difficulty in entering local markets has also caused nearly all \ncompetitors to scale back their plans to offer service. Covad had \nestablished offices in Chattanooga, Knoxville, Memphis and Nashville, \nbut is now closing down over 250 central offices, and will suspend \napplications for 500 more facilities. Rhythms has cancelled plans to \nexpand nationwide. Net2000 has put its plans for expansion on hold. \nNumerous other competitors, such as DSL.net, have resolved to focus on \na few core markets. Each of these decisions has been accompanied by \nhundreds of eliminated jobs. In all, competitive local carriers \ndismissed over 6500 employees nationwide in the last year while \nattempting to remain in business. Tennessee is among the hardest hit \nStates.\n  The repercussions of these events on consumers is significant. \nCompetitors reinvested most of their 2000 revenues in local network \nfacilities. Competitors that declared bankruptcy in 2000 had planned to \nspend over $600 million on capital expenditures in 2001. Those \ncompetitive networks will not be available to consumers.\n  In this uncertain financial climate, it is imperative that we \nmaintain a stable regulatory framework. The 1996 Telecom Act \nestablished three pathways to a more competitive local \ntelecommunications marketplace: a new entrant could purchase local \ntelephone services at wholesale rates from the incumbent and resell \nthem to local customers; a competitor could lease specific pieces of \nthe incumbent's network on an unbundled basis, using what the industry \ncalls unbundled network elements; or a competitor could build its own \nfacilities and interconnect them with the incumbent's network. Each of \nthese alternatives must remain available to new entrants. Making \nfundamental changes to the structure of the 1996 Act will destabilize \nthe already shaky competitive local exchange industry, depriving \nconsumers of even the prospects for meaningful choice.\n  Recent press reports indicate that investors will not sink more money \ninto local competitors when there is a ``growing view that regulators \nare working against the new entrants.'' We need to ensure that the \nmarket-opening requirements of the 1996 Act are vigorously implemented. \nWithout a supportive regulatory environment, there will be no more \ncapital flowing to new entrants in the local telecommunications market \nspurring competition and lower consumer prices. This was not the \npromise of the Telecommunications Act I voted for in 1996.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/20/senate-section/article/S6515-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

I would like the record to reflect that Senator \nBoxer and Senator Reid should have been listed as original cosponsors \nof amendment #805 to H.R. 1, the Better Education for Students and \nTeachers Act.\n  I regret this unfortunate oversight, as these two Senators are \nlargely responsible for the passage of this amendment. They have as \nmuch claim to authorship of this important effort as any Member of this \nbody. If not for their commitment to the protection of our Nation's \nchildren, we would not be celebrating the passage of this amendment \ntoday. Were it not for Senator Boxer's unwavering commitment to \nprotecting our children, as she has done with the introduction of the \nChildren's Environmental Protection Act, the Senate would not even be \nhaving this debate. Were it not for Senator Reid's understanding of the \nimportant issues facing the Senate, and his advocacy as a member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, this amendment would not have \nenjoyed the support that it has.\n  I thank my friends for their support and ask that the Senate \nrecognize Senator Boxer and Senator Reid as original cosponsors of the \nSchool Environmental Protection Amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/20/senate-section/article/S6515-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6515-S6516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

EDWARDS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a \nremarkable person from my home State of Michigan, the Reverend Eddie K. \nEdwards, who celebrates his retirement as CEO of Joy of Jesus, Inc. on \nFriday, June 22. Reverend Edwards, has received national acclamations, \nfor having developed and implemented a strategy that served to \nrevitalize the Ravendale Community, one of Detroit's most distressed \nand underserved areas. He has embodied the work of his ministry and \nfulfilled his mission of providing positive direction and opportunities \nfor those in need of such guidance.\n  In 1976, Reverend Edwards established Joy of Jesus, Inc. a nonprofit \norganizations which set as its primary goal, the task of promoting \npositive values and healthy lifestyles as a means to help \nunderprivileged youth become responsible citizens who can make a \nmeaningful contribution to society. For this work, he has received \nnational attention: a Points of Light Award and was featured in a \nnational award-winning TV documentary entitled, ``A Neighborhood \nRedeemed.'' Reverend Edwards serves on the board of numerous community \nand civic organizations, all of which he devotes an inordinate amount \nof time. He is in frequent demand as a speaker on the topics of church \nempowerment, collaboration of churches, neighborhood revitalization, \nand various other community issues. He has repeatedly demonstrated his \nexpertise is developing non-traditional partnerships and collaboratives \nwhich have had significant impact on his community and in particular, \nthe lives of our younger generation. And, in spite of his commitment \nand involvement in community, he is a devoted husband and father of six \nadult children.\n  I can only hope that in Reverend Edward's retirement he finds future \nendeavors are as successful and fulfilling as the previous ones. For \ncertain, he will remain active in his many church and community \nactivities, but will have more time to dedicate to his favorite \nhobbies--golfing and jogging. I am pleased to join his colleagues and \nfriends in offering my thanks for all he has accomplished in making his \ncommunity a better place.\n  Reverend Eddie K. Edwards can take pride in his long career of \nservice and dedication to Church, Community and Family. I invite my \ncolleagues to join me in saluting Reverend Edwards' work, and in \nwishing him well in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/20/senate-section/article/S6516-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/20/senate-section/article/S6516-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/20/senate-section/article/S6516-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 819.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish procedures for determining payment amounts for new clinical \ndiagnostic laboratory tests for which payment is made under the \nMedicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Medicare Patient \nAccess to Preventive and Diagnostic Tests Act. This bipartisan \nlegislation will establish new procedures under Medicare for \ndetermining the coding and payment amounts for clinical diagnostic \nlaboratory tests. I am pleased to have my colleague, Senator John \nKerry, as the lead Democratic sponsor of this bill. Similar legislation \nhas been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman \nJennifer Dunn and Congressman Jim McDermott. \n  Innovative clinical laboratory tests help save lives and reduce \nhealth care costs by detecting diseases, such as cancer, heart attacks, \nand kidney failure in their early stages, when they are more treatable. \nHowever, there are serious flaws in the way that the Center for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, formally known as HCFA, currently \nsets reimbursement rates for diagnostic tests.\n  This cumbersome bureaucratic system makes it difficult for physicians \nand laboratories to offer these diagnostic tests to their patients who \nneed them. Due to institutionalized flaws in the current Medicare \nreimbursement system, revolutionary and innovative diagnostic tests may \nnot benefit patients for years to come. In addition, it has been shown \nthat lower laboratory payments correlate with lower utilization. The \npayment rates vary significantly from region to region and State to \nState.\n  For example, in my home State of Utah, a patient is sent for blood \nwork to test for kidney disease. Based upon the 2001 Medicare Lab \nReimbursement schedule, the Utah lab would receive $2.12 for performing \nthe test. However, labs in Arizona, Nevada, Montana, New Mexico and \nWyoming, would receive $6.33 to perform the same test. This makes no \neconomic or medical sense to me.\n  A recent Institute of Medicine, IoM, report stated that Medicare \npayments for outpatient clinical laboratory services should be based on \na single, rational fee schedule. Medicare should account for market-\nbased factors such as local labor costs and prices for goods and \nservices in establishing the fee schedule. In addition, CMS should \nprovide opportunities for stakeholder input and develop better \ncommunication with contractors while policies are being developed and \nafter these policies are adopted.\n  Our bill, based upon the principles of this IoM report, would require \nCMS to establish a national fee schedule for new and current tests, \nbased upon an open, transparent, and rational public process for \nincorporating new tests, as well as to provide clear explanations of \nthe reasoning behind its reimbursement decisions. This new process \nwould be based upon science based methodologies for setting prices for \nnew technologies that are designed to establish fair and appropriate \npayment levels for these items and services.\n  CMS's procedures would provide that the payment amount for tests \nwould be established under either the so-called gap-filling or cross-\nwalking methodologies, and they would specify the rules for deciding \nwhich methodology will be used and how it will be employed. In \nparticular, the legislation would require that if a new test is \nclinically similar to a test for which a fee schedule amount has \nalready been established, through cross-walking, CMS will pay the same \nfee schedule amount for the new test. In determining whether tests are \nclinically similar, CMS will not take into account economic factors.\n  Finally, this new process would provide a mechanism for any \nlaboratory or other stakeholder to challenge CMS fee schedule \ndecisions. The cost of these changes is small in light of the \nsignificant impact on improving the quality of patient care.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring this bill. The \nlaudable goal of this bipartisan legislation is to establish an open \nand transparent public process for incorporating new laboratory tests \ninto the Medicare program. Many seniors currently do not have full \naccess to the medical care they need due to the antiquated process for \nassigning billing codes and setting reimbursement rates. We need to \nbridge the gap between seniors and the life-saving lab tests they need \nto preserve their health and promote their well-being.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in supporting this legislation \nand ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1066\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe availability of Archer medical savings accounts; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, on behalf of myself and my \ncolleague, Senator Torricelli, I am introducing legislation, the \nMedical Savings Availability Act of 2001, which would make the \navailability of medical savings accounts permanent and would make it \npossible for any individual to purchase a medical savings account. Our \nbill would liberalize existing law authorizing medical savings accounts \nin a number of other respects.\n  Medical savings accounts are a good idea. They are basically IRAs, an \nidea everybody understands, which must be used for payment of medical \nexpenses.\n  The widespread use of medical savings accounts should have several \nbeneficial consequences.\n  They should reduce health care costs. Administrative costs should be \nlower. Consumers with MSAs should use health care services in a more \ndiscriminating manner. Consumers with MSAs should be more selective in \nchoosing providers. This should cause those providers to lower their \nprices to attract medical savings account holders as patients.\n  Medical savings accounts can also help to put the patient back into \nthe health care equation. Patients should make more cost-conscious \nchoices about routine health care. Patients with MSAs would have \ncomplete choice of provider.\n  Medical savings accounts should make health care coverage more \ndependable. MSAs are completely portable. MSAs are still the property \nof the individual even if they change jobs. Hence, for those with MSAs, \njob changes do not threaten them with the loss of health insurance.\n  Medical savings accounts should increase health care coverage. \nPerhaps as many as half of the more than 40 million Americans who are \nuninsured at any point in time are without health insurance only for \nfour months or less. A substantial number of these people are uninsured \nbecause they are between jobs. Use of medical savings accounts should \nreduce the number of the uninsured by equipping people to pay their own \nhealth expenses while unemployed.\n  Medical savings accounts should promote personal savings. Since pre-\ntax monies are deposited in them, there should be a strong tax \nincentive to use them.\n  As I understand it, there are approximately 100,000 MSA accounts \ncovering a total of approximately 250,000. I understand also that \napproximately one-third of those who have set up medical savings \naccounts were previously uninsured.\n  But medical savings accounts have fallen short of their promise \nbecause of various restrictions in the authorizing law.\n  The present law has a sunset of December, 2001, which has discouraged \ninsurers from offering such plans. Current MSA law prohibits around 70 \npercent of the working population from purchasing them because purchase \nis limited to the self-employed or to employees of small businesses of \nless than 50 employees.\n  The bill we are introducing today would eliminate the restrictions \nthat have limited the availability of MSAs: First, it would remove the \nDecember, 2001, sunset provision and make the availability of MSAs \npermanent; second, it would repeal the limitations on the number of \nMSAs that can be established; third, it stipulates that the \navailability of these accounts is not limited to employees of small \nemployers and self-employed individuals; fourth, it increases the \namount of the deduction allowed for contributions to medical savings \naccounts to 100 percent of the deductible; fifth, it permits both \nemployees and employers to contribute to medical savings accounts; \nsixth, it reduces the permitted deductibles under high deductible plans \nfrom $1,500 in the case of individuals to $1,000 and from $3,000 in the \ncase of couples to $2,000; seventh, the bill would permit medical \nsavings accounts to be offered under cafeteria plans; and finally, the \nbill would encourage preferred provider organizations to offer MSAs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1067\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide refunds for unjust and unreasonable \ncharges on electric energy; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, earlier this week the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission issued an order to provide price mitigation to \nCalifornia's electricity market. This order is a stunning turnaround \nfor an agency that refused to recognize that this energy crisis is a \nregional problem and that cost-based pricing is in order. However, \nFERC's order does not adequately address past grievances regarding \nrefunds for overcharges by the generators.\n  Therefore, today I am introducing the Electricity Gouging Relief Act \nin an effort to bring much needed relief to consumers, businesses and \nthe State of California from price gouging by electricity generators. \nThis legislation helps to right past wrongs by providing rebates in \ncases where companies were engaged in gouging.\n  Generators' profits increased on average by 508 percent between 1999 \nand 2000. One company, Reliant Energy, experienced a 1,685 percent \nincrease in profits in the same time period. This compares to a 16 \npercent increase in profits across the electric and gas industry and an \nincrease in demand of only four percent.\n  My bill would require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, \nto order refunds for past electricity purchases in cases where FERC \ndetermined that the prices charged by the generators were ``unjust and \nunreasonable.'' The bill would affect electricity sales that took place \nbetween June 1, 2000--when price spikes first occurred in San Diego and \nJune 19, 2001--the day before FERC's order became effective.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. FERC's actions on \nMonday are a step in the right direction. Now, we need to refund \novercharges by the generators to consumers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1068\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Electricity Gouging Relief \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFUNDS FOR EXCESSIVE CHARGES.\n\n       Section 206 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824e) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Refunds for Excessive Charges.--\n       ``(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, \n     the Commission shall, within 60 days after enactment of this \n     subsection, order a refund for the portion of charges on the \n     transmission or sale or electric energy that are or have been \n     deemed by the Commission to be unjust or unreasonable. Such \n     refunds shall included interest from the date on which the \n     charges were paid.\n       ``(2) The refunds ordered under paragraph (1) shall apply \n     to charges paid between June 1, 2000 and June 19, 2001.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mr. Johnson, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 1069. A bill to amend the Natural Trails System Act to clarify \nFederal authority relating to land acquisition from willing sellers \nfrom the majority of the trails in the System, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Willing Seller \nAmendments of 2001 which would amend the National Trails System Act, \nNTSA, to provide Federal authority to acquire land from willing sellers \nto complete nine national scenic and historic trails authorized under \nthe Act. The legislation gives the Federal agencies administering the \ntrails the ability to acquire land from willing sellers only. The \nlegislation would not commit the Federal Government to purchase any \nland or to spend any money but would allow managers to purchase land to \nprotect the national trails as opportunities arise and as funds are \nappropriated.\n  For most of the national scenic and historic trails, barely one-half \nof their congressionally authorized length and resources are protected. \nWithout willing seller authority, Federal trail managers' hands are \ntied when development threatens important links in the wild landscapes \nof the national scenic trails or in the sites that authenticate the \nstories of the historic trails. With willing seller authority, sections \nof trail can be moved from roads where hikers and other trail users are \nunsafe, and critical historic sites can be preserved for future \ngenerations to experience. Moreover, this authority protects private \nproperty rights, as landowners along the nine affected trails are \ncurrently denied the right to sell land to the Federal Government if \nthey desire to do so.\n  Willing seller authority is crucial for the North Country National \nScenic Trail, which runs through my home State of Michigan, because \ncompletion of the Trail faces significant challenges. These challenges \nwhich relate to development pressure and the need to cross long \nstretches of private and corporate held lands are common themes \nthroughout the seven states linked by the 4,600-mile long North Country \nTrail.\n  This legislation is also vital on a national level and accomplishes \nseveral important goals. First, it restores basic property rights--\nSection 10 (c) of the National Trails System Act as currently written \ndiminishes the right of thousands of people who own land along four \nnational scenic trails and five national historic trails to sell their \nproperty or easements on their property, by prohibiting federal \nagencies from buying their land. Many of these landowners have offered \nto sell their land to the Federal Government to permanently protect \nimportant historical resources that their families have protected for \ngenerations or to maintain the continuity of a national scenic trail. \nProviding this authority to Federal agencies to purchase land from \nwilling sellers along these nine trails will restore this basic \nproperty right to thousands of landowners.\n  Second, it restores the ability of Federal agencies to carry out \ntheir responsibility to protect nationally significant components of \nour nation's cultural, natural and recreational heritage. The National \nTrails System Act authorizes establishment of national scenic and \nhistoric trails to protect important components of our historic and \nnatural heritage. One of the fundamental responsibilities given to the \nFederal agencies administering these trails is to protect their \nimportant cultural and natural resources. Without willing-seller \nauthority, the agencies are prevented from directly protecting these \nresources along nine trails--nearly one-half of the National Trails \nSystem.\n  Third, it restores consistency to the National Trails System Act, \nNTSA. Congress enacted the National Trails System Act in 1968 ``. . .to \nprovide for the ever-increasing outdoor recreation needs of an \nexpanding population and . . . to promote the preservation of, public \naccess to, travel within, and enjoyment and appreciation of the open-\nair, outdoor areas and historic resources of the Nation . . . by \ninstituting a national system of recreation, scenic and historic trails \n. . .'' The agencies are authorized to collaborate\n\n[[Page S6523]]\n\nwith other Federal agencies, State and local governments and private \norganizations in planning, developing and managing the trails; to \ndevelop uniform standards for marking, interpreting and constructing \nthe trails; to regulate their use; and to provide grants and technical \nassistance to cooperating agencies and organizations. The NTSA is \nsupposed to provide these and other authorities to be applied \nconsistently throughout the National Trails System. However, land \nacquisition authority, an essential means for protecting the special \nresources and continuity that are the basis for these trails, has been \ninconsistently applied. The Federal agencies have been given land \nacquisition authority for thirteen of the twenty-two national scenic \nand historic trails but have been denied authority to acquire land for \nthe other nine trails. This bill restores consistency to the National \nTrails System Act by enabling the Federal agencies to acquire necessary \nland for all twenty-two national scenic and historic trails.\n  Finally, this legislation enables Federal agencies to respond to \nopportunities to protect important resources provided by willing \nsellers. The willing seller land acquisition authority provided for \nthese nine trails and subsequent appropriations from the Land and Water \nConservation Fund will enable the Federal agencies administering them \nto respond to conservation opportunities afforded by willing \nlandowners.\n  I am pleased today to introduce this important legislation to restore \nparity to the National Trails System and provide authority to protect \ncritical resources along the nation's treasured national scenic and \nhistoric trails.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1070. A bill to amend the XXVII of the Public Health Service Act \nand part 7 of subtitle B of title 1 of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 to establish standards for the health quality \nimprovement of children in managed care plans and other health plans; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that I \nbelieve is very pertinent to the current debate over managed care \nprotections. My longstanding concern has been to ensure that the needs \nof children in managed care are not left out of the debate. That is why \nI am reintroducing the Children's Health Insurance Accountability Act.\n  This legislation sets the standard for what kinds of protections \nought to be in place for children who receive care through health \nmaintenance organizations. Specifically, this bill provides common \nsense protections for children in managed care plans such as: access to \nnecessary pediatric primary care and specialty services; appeal rights \nthat address the special needs of children, including an expedited \nreview if a child's life or development is in jeopardy; quality \nmeasurements of health outcomes unique to children; utilization review \nrules that are specific to children with evaluation from those with \npediatric expertise; and child-specific information requirements that \nwill help parents and employers choose health plans on the basis of \ncare provided to children.\n  I am pleased that the major provisions of this legislation are \nincorporated into the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy Patient Protection bill, \nS. 1052. It is difficult enough to have a sick child, but to face \nbarrier after barrier to necessary care for your child is \nunconscionable. Our current system is often failing our kids when they \nmost need us. It is this simple: if we do not have health plan \nstandards, there is no guarantee that we are providing adequate care \nfor our children. And when it comes to our children, we should not take \nrisks.\n  Not one of us can deny that managed care plays a valid role in our \nhealth care system. Managed care's emphasis on preventive care has \nbenefits for young and old alike. And HMOs have resulted in lower co-\npayments for consumers and higher immunization rates for our children. \nHowever, many questions have arisen about patient access to medical \nservices and the consequences of cost-cutting measures and other \nincentives under managed care.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Accountability Act seeks to address \nthese concerns as they relate to children. Children are not small \nadults and often have very different health and developmental needs. We \nshould be sure that we are always vigilant when it comes to their \nhealth and well-being, not only in the context of patient protection \nlegislation, but in other policy measures we consider this year.\n  I am pleased that this legislation is supported by a number of \nchildren's health and advocacy organizations, including the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics, the Children's Defense Fund and the National \nAssociation of Children's Hospitals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1070\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Health Insurance \n     Accountability Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Children have health and development needs that are \n     markedly different than those for the adult population.\n       (2) Children experience complex and continuing changes \n     during the continuum from birth to adulthood in which \n     appropriate health care is essential for optimal development.\n       (3) The vast majority of work done on development methods \n     to assess the effectiveness of health care services and the \n     impact of medical care on patient outcomes and patient \n     satisfaction has been focused on adults.\n       (4) Health outcome measures need to be age, gender, and \n     developmentally appropriate to be useful to families and \n     children.\n       (5) Costly disorders of adulthood often have their origins \n     in childhood, making early access to effective health \n     services in childhood essential.\n       (6) More than 200 chronic conditions, disabilities and \n     diseases affect children, including asthma, diabetes, sickle \n     cell anemia, spina bifida, epilepsy, autism, cerebral palsy, \n     congenital heart disease, mental retardation, and cystic \n     fibrosis. These children need the services of specialists who \n     have in depth knowledge about their particular condition.\n       (7) Children's patterns of illness, disability and injury \n     differ dramatically from adults.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n       (a) Patient Protection Standards.--Title XXVII of the \n     Public Health Service Act is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating part C as part D; and\n       (2) by inserting after part B the following:\n\n            ``Part C--Children's Health Protection Standards\n\n     ``SEC. 2770.

A bill to establish a National Commission to Eliminate Waste \nin Government; to the Committee on Government Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I rise to bring attention to an \nissue that affects all Americans, government waste. As we all know, the \nFederal Government is infamous for its profligate programs and \napproaches to problem solving. In the last decade, we have seen \ninefficiency of mammoth proportions within the government.\n  As a result, I have introduced legislation that would establish a \nnational commission to eliminate government waste. This act would \nresurrect President Reagan's work to find an equitable way to enact \nfiscal responsibility and accountability within the government. During \nthe Reagan Administration, a private sector study of government was \ncommissioned to dispose of Federal waste, mismanagement, and abuse. Led \nby industrialist J. Peter Grace, the Grace Commission produced 47 \nreports with 2,478 recommendations. As a result of this study, \nPresident Reagan issued executive orders that saved the Federal \nGovernment more than $110 billion.\n  Today, many Federal agencies still use cumbersome bureaucratic \nprocedures. The National Commission to Eliminate Waste in Government \nAct would establish a commission to conduct a private sector survey on \nmanagement and cost control within the government. It would also \nprovide an opportunity for the commission to review existing reports on \ngovernment waste. Because the commission would be funded, staffed, and \nequipped by the private sector, it would not cost the government one \ndime.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this end to government waste and the \nbeginning of discipline and efficiency within our government.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Smith of Oregon, and \n        Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 1075. A bill to extend and modify the Drug-Free Communities \nSupport Program, to authorize a National Community Antidrug Coalition \nInstitute, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nre-authorize the Drug Free Communities Act. I am pleased to be joined \nby my colleagues Senator Biden, Senator Smith, and Senator Daschle in \nintroducing this legislation which will continue for another 5 years \nthe successes that we have found with Drug Free Communities Program. In \naddition, it builds upon the successes that coalitions have had by \nencouraging them to establish a coalition mentoring program for nearby \ncommunities. Finally, this act will authorize funding for the National \nAnti-Drug Coalition Institute, which will provide education, training, \nand technical assistance to leaders of community coalitions.\n  Substance abuse remains a problem in communities across the country. \nSubstance abuse is the cause of or associated with many of today's \nproblems, but is a preventable behavior. Community anti-drug coalitions \nare implementing long-term strategies to address the problem of \nsubstance abuse in their communities. By bringing together a cross-\nsection of the community to address a common problem, community \ncoalitions are discovering and implementing unique community solutions \nto reduce and prevent the incidence of substance abuse in their \ncommunities. And that idea, that communities are best suited to address \ntheir own problems, is the underlying premise that has been proven with \nthe success of the Drug Free Communities program.\n  There are three key features to the Drug Free Communities Act. First, \ncommunities must take the initiative. In order to receive support, a \ncommunity coalition must demonstrate that there is a long-term \ncommitment to address teen-drug use. It must have a sustainable \ncoalition that includes the involvement of representatives from a wide \nvariety of community activists.\n  In addition, every coalition must show that it can sustain itself. \nCommunity coalitions must be in existence for at least 6 months before \napplying. They are only eligible to receive support if they can match \nthese donations dollar for dollar with non-Federal funding, up to \n$100,000 per coalition.\n  An Advisory Commission, consisting of local community leaders, and \nState and national experts in the field of substance abuse, has worked \nclosely with the Office of National Drug Control Policy to oversee the \nsuccessful management and growth of this grant program. Because of this \npartnership, grants have gone to communities and programs that can make \na difference in the lives of our children.\n  Today, we have better evidence that coalitions are working, that they \nare making a difference. A recent study sponsored by the Annie E. Casey \nFoundation documented the difference that\n\n[[Page S6527]]\n\neight community coalitions, all of which have received funding through \nthe Drug Free Communities program, from around the country have made in \ntheir communities.\n  In addition to continuing this successful program, this re-\nauthorization legislation adds the possibility for a supplemental grant \nto the Drug-Free Communities Grant Program. The supplemental grant is \navailable to any coalition that has been in existence for at least 5 \nyears, achieved measurable results in youth substance abuse prevention \nand treatment, have staff or Coalition members willing to serve as \nmentors for persons interested in starting or expanding a Coalition in \ntheir community, identified demonstrable support from members of the \nidentified community, and have created a detailed plan for mentoring \neither newly formed or developing Coalitions.\n  Coalitions receiving the supplemental grant must use these funds to \nsupport and encourage the development of new, self-supporting community \ncoalitions focused on the prevention and treatment of substance abuse \nin the new coalition's community. This supplemental grant can be \nrenewed provided the recipient coalition continues to meet the \nunderlying criteria and has made progress in the development of new \ncoalitions.\n  Starting a new anti-drug coalition is a difficult exercise, which \nmakes the success of these coalitions I mentioned earlier all the more \nremarkable. But I also know this from personal experience. For the past \n4 years, I have worked with leaders from across my State of Iowa to \nstart and grow the Face It Together Coalition, a State-wide, anti-drug \ncoalition designed to bring together people from all walks of life, \nbusiness leaders, doctors and nurses, law enforcement, school \nprofessionals, members of the media, and so on, to work together toward \na common goal: keeping kids drug free.\n  In working with FIT, it has become clear that by working together, \neveryone can accomplish more. This is a solid, grass-roots initiative \nthat can work. But it hasn't been an easy process, and it will continue \nto require the dedication and commitment of all of our board members. \nOne of the biggest challenges that we face has not been finding ideas \nof what to do, or even finding effective ongoing projects in the State, \nbut identifying and securing funding to support the expansion of our \nactivities. Much can and has been done by volunteers, and through the \nnetworking connections that the Board members are able to bring to the \ntable.\n  In addition, this legislation will authorize $2 million in federal \nfunding for two years for the National Community Anti-Drug Coalition \nInstitute. Modeled after the success we have seen from the National \nDrug Court Institute, this national non-profit organization will \nrepresent, provide technical assistance and training, and have special \nexpertise and broad, national-level experience in community anti-drug \ncoalitions.\n  The funding for the Institute will be to 1. provide education, \ntraining, and technical assistance to key members of community anti-\ndrug coalitions, 2. develop and disseminate evaluation tools, \nmechanisms, and measures to assess and document coalition performance, \nand 3. bridge the gap between research and practice by providing \ncommunity coalitions with practical information based on the most \ncurrent research on coalition-related issues. The Institute is expected \nto last for more than 2 years, and to pursue and obtain additional \nfunding from sources other than the Federal Government.\n  In conclusion, I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this legislation. It is supported by the Administration. It \nhas the support of communities all across the Nation. The Drug Free \nCommunities Program works. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nhere and in the House to ensure quick passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1075\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF DRUG-FREE COMMUNITIES SUPPORT \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the next 15 years, the youth population in the \n     United States will grow by 21 percent, adding 6,500,000 youth \n     to the population of the United States. Even if drug use \n     rates remain constant, there will be a huge surge in drug-\n     related problems, such as academic failure, drug-related \n     violence, and HIV incidence, simply due to this population \n     increase.\n       (2) According to the 1994-1996 National Household Survey, \n     60 percent of students age 12 to 17 who frequently cut \n     classes and who reported delinquent behavior in the past 6 \n     months used marijuana 52 days or more in the previous year.\n       (3) The 2000 Washington Kids Count survey conducted by the \n     University of Washington reported that students whose peers \n     have little or no involvement with drinking and drugs have \n     higher math and reading scores than students whose peers had \n     low level drinking or drug use.\n       (4) Substance abuse prevention works. In 1999, only 10 \n     percent of teens saw marijuana users as popular, compared to \n     17 percent in 1998 and 19 percent in 1997. The rate of past-\n     month use of any drug among 12 to 17 year olds declined 26 \n     percent between 1997 and 1999. Marijuana use for sixth \n     through eighth graders is at the lowest point in 5 years, as \n     is use of cocaine, inhalants, and hallucinogens.\n       (5) Community Anti-Drug Coalitions throughout the United \n     States are successfully developing and implementing \n     comprehensive, long-term strategies to reduce substance abuse \n     among youth on a sustained basis. For example:\n       (A) The Boston Coalition brought college and university \n     presidents together to create the Cooperative Agreement on \n     Underage Drinking. This agreement represents the first \n     coordinated effort of Boston's many institutions of higher \n     education to address issues such as binge drinking, underage \n     drinking, and changing the norms surrounding alcohol abuse \n     that exist on college and university campuses.\n       (B) The Miami Coalition used a three-part strategy to \n     decrease the percentage of high school seniors who reported \n     using marijuana at least once during the most recent 30-day \n     period. The development of a media strategy, the creation of \n     a network of prevention agencies, and discussions with high \n     school students about the dangers of marijuana all \n     contributed to a decrease in the percentage of seniors who \n     reported using marijuana from more than 22 percent in 1995 to \n     9 percent in 1997. The Miami Coalition was able to achieve \n     these results while national rates of marijuana use were \n     increasing.\n       (C) The Nashville Prevention Partnership worked with \n     elementary and middle school children in an attempt to \n     influence them toward positive life goals and discourage them \n     from using substances. The Partnership targeted an area in \n     East Nashville and created after school programs, mentoring \n     opportunities, attendance initiatives, and safe passages to \n     and from school. Attendance and test scores increased as a \n     result of the program.\n       (D) At a youth-led town meeting sponsored by the Bering \n     Strait Community Partnership in Nome, Alaska, youth \n     identified a need for a safe, substance-free space. With help \n     from a variety of community partners, the Partnership staff \n     and youth members created the Java Hut, a substance-free \n     coffeehouse designed for youth. The Java Hut is helping to \n     change norms in the community by providing a fun, youth-\n     friendly atmosphere and activities that are not centered \n     around alcohol or marijuana.\n       (E) Portland's Regional Drug Initiative (RDI) has promoted \n     the establishment of drug-free workplaces among the city's \n     large and small employers. More than 3,000 employers have \n     attended an RDI training session, and of those, 92 percent \n     have instituted drug-free workplace policies. As a result, \n     there has been a 5.5 percent decrease in positive workplace \n     drug tests.\n       (F) San Antonio Fighting Back worked to increase the age at \n     which youth first used illegal substances. Research suggests \n     that the later the age of first use, the lower the risk that \n     a young person will become a regular substance abuser. As a \n     result, the age of first illegal drug use increased from 9.4 \n     years in 1992 to 13.5 years in 1997.\n       (G) In 1990, multiple data sources confirmed a trend of \n     increased alcohol use by teenagers in the Troy community. \n     Using its ``multiple strategies over multiple sectors'' \n     approach, the Troy Coalition worked with parents, physicians, \n     students, coaches, and others to address this problem from \n     several angles. As a result, the rate of twelfth grade \n     students who had consumed alcohol in the past month decreased \n     from 62.1 percent to 53.3 percent between 1991 and 1998, and \n     the rate of eighth grade students decreased from 26.3 percent \n     to 17.4 percent. The Troy Coalition believes that this \n     decline represents not only a change in behavior on the part \n     of students, but also a change in the norms of the community.\n       (H) In 2000, the Coalition for a Drug-Free Greater \n     Cincinnati surveyed more than 47,000 local seventh through \n     twelfth graders. The results provided evidence that the \n     Coalition's initiatives are working. For the first time in a \n     decade, teen drug use in Greater Cincinnati appears to be \n     leveling off. The data collected from the survey has served \n     as a tool to strengthen relationships between\n\n[[Page S6528]]\n\n     schools and communities, as well as facilitate the growth of \n     anti-drug coalitions in communities where they had not \n     existed.\n       (6) Despite these successes, drug use continues to be a \n     serious problem facing communities across the United States. \n     For example:\n       (A) According to the Pulse Check: Trends in Drug Abuse Mid-\n     Year 2000 report--\n       (i) crack and powder cocaine remains the most serious drug \n     problem;\n       (ii) marijuana remains the most widely available illicit \n     drug, and its potency is on the rise;\n       (iii) treatment sources report an increase in admissions \n     with marijuana as the primary drug of abuse--and adolescents \n     outnumber other age groups entering treatment for marijuana;\n       (iv) 80 percent of Pulse Check sources reported increased \n     availability of club drugs, with ecstasy (MDMA) and ketamine \n     the most widely cited club drugs and seven sources reporting \n     that powder cocaine is being used as a club drug by young \n     adults;\n       (v) ecstasy abuse and trafficking is expanding, no longer \n     confined to the ``rave'' scene;\n       (vi) the sale and use of club drugs has grown from \n     nightclubs and raves to high schools, the streets, \n     neighborhoods, open venues, and younger ages;\n       (vii) ecstasy users often are unknowingly purchasing \n     adulterated tablets or some other substance sold as MDMA; and\n       (viii) along with reports of increased heroin snorting as a \n     route of administration for initiates, there is also an \n     increase in injecting initiates and the negative health \n     consequences associated with injection (for example, \n     increases in HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C) suggesting that there \n     is a generational forgetting of the dangers of injection of \n     the drug.\n       (B) The 2000 Parent's Resource Institute for Drug Education \n     study reported that 23.6 percent of children in the sixth \n     through twelfth grades used illicit drugs in the past year. \n     The same study found that monthly usage among this group was \n     15.3 percent.\n       (C) According to the 2000 Monitoring the Future study, the \n     use of ecstasy among eighth graders increased from 1.7 \n     percent in 1999 to 3.1 percent in 2000, among tenth graders \n     from 4.4 percent to 5.4 percent, and from 5.6 percent to 8.2 \n     percent among twelfth graders.\n       (D) A 1999 Mellman Group study found that--\n       (i) 56 percent of the population in the United States \n     believed that drug use was increasing in 1999;\n       (ii) 92 percent of the population viewed illegal drug use \n     as a serious problem in the United States; and\n       (iii) 73 percent of the population viewed illegal drug use \n     as a serious problem in their communities.\n       (7) According to the 2001 report of the National Center on \n     Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University entitled \n     ``Shoveling Up: The Impact of Substance Abuse on State \n     Budgets'', using the most conservative assumption, in 1998 \n     States spent $77,900,000,000 to shovel up the wreckage of \n     substance abuse, only $3,000,000,000 to prevent and treat the \n     problem and $433,000,000 for alcohol and tobacco regulation \n     and compliance. This $77,900,000,000 burden was distributed \n     as follows:\n       (A) $30,700,000,000 in the justice system (77 percent of \n     justice spending).\n       (B) $16,500,000,000 in education costs (10 percent of \n     education spending).\n       (C) $15,200,000,000 in health costs (25 percent of health \n     spending).\n       (D) $7,700,000,000 in child and family assistance (32 \n     percent of child and family assistance spending).\n       (E) $5,900,000,000 in mental health and developmental \n     disabilities (31 percent of mental health spending).\n       (F) $1,500,000,000 in public safety (26 percent of public \n     safety spending) and $400,000,000 for the state workforce.\n       (8) Intergovernmental cooperation and coordination through \n     national, State, and local or tribal leadership and \n     partnerships are critical to facilitate the reduction of \n     substance abuse among youth in communities across the United \n     States.\n       (9) Substance abuse is perceived as a much greater problem \n     nationally than at the community level. According to a 2001 \n     study sponsored by The Pew Charitable Trusts, between 1994 \n     and 2000--\n       (A) there was a 43 percent increase in the percentage of \n     Americans who felt progress was being made in the war on \n     drugs at the community level;\n       (B) only 9 percent of Americans say drug abuse is a \n     ``crisis'' in their neighborhood, compared to 27 percent who \n     say this about the nation; and\n       (C) the percentage of those who felt we lost ground in the \n     war on drugs on a community level fell by more than a \n     quarter, from 51 percent in 1994 to 37 percent in 2000.\n       (b) Extension and Increase of Program.--Section 1024(a) of \n     the National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988 (21 U.S.C. \n     1524(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (4);

Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the Drug Free Communities Act, a program which currently \nfunds more than 300 community coalitions across the country that work \nto reduce drug, alcohol, and tobacco use.\n  Four years ago, I worked with Senator Grassley, Representatives Sandy \nLevin and Rob Portman, and others to create this important program to \nfund coalitions of citizens--parents, youth, businesses, media, law \nenforcement, religious organizations, civic groups, doctors, nurses, \nand others--working to reduce youth substance abuse.\n  Community coalitions across the country--including two in my home \nState of Delaware--are galvanizing tremendous support for prevention \nefforts. They are helping fellow citizens make a difference in their \ncommunities. And they are helping all sectors of the community send a \nconsistent message about alcohol, drugs, and tobacco.\n  I have been fighting for this type of anti-drug program for local \ncommunities for over a decade because I believe that prevention is a \ncritical--but too often overlooked--part of an effective drug strategy.\n  Substance abuse is one of our Nation's most pervasive problems. \nAddiction is a disease that does not discriminate on the basis of age, \ngender, socioeconomic status, race or creed. And while we tend to \nstereotype drug abuse as an urban problem, the steadily growing number \nof heroin and methamphetamine addicts in rural villages and suburban \ntowns shows that is simply not the case.\n  We have nearly 15 million drug users in this country, 4 million of \nwhom are hard-core addicts. We all know someone--a family member, \nneighbor, colleague or friend--who has become addicted to drugs or \nalcohol. And we are all affected by the undeniable correlation between \nsubstance abuse and crime--an overwhelming 80 percent of the 2 million \nmen and women behind bars today have a history of drug and alcohol \nabuse or addiction or were arrested for a drug-related crime.\n  All of this comes at a hefty price. Drug abuse and addiction cost \nthis Nation $110 billion in law enforcement and other criminal justice \nexpenses, medical bills, lost earnings and other costs each year. \nIllegal drugs are responsible for thousands of deaths each year and for \nthe spread of a number of communicable diseases, including AIDS and \nHepatitis C. And a study by the National Center on Addiction and \nSubstance Abuse at Columbia University (CASA) shows that 7 out of 10 \ncases of child abuse and neglect are caused or exacerbated by substance \nabuse and addiction.\n  Another CASA study recently revealed that for each dollar that States \nspend on substance-abuse related programs, 96 cents goes to dealing \nwith the consequences of substance abuse and only 4 cents to preventing \nand treating it. Investing more in prevention and treatment is cost-\neffective because it will decrease much of the street crime, child \nabuse, domestic violence, and other social ills that can result from \nsubstance abuse.\n  If we can get kids through age 21 without smoking, abusing alcohol, \nor using drugs, they are unlikely to have a substance abuse problem in \nthe future. But there are still those who shrug their shoulders and say \n``kids are kids--they are going to experiment.'' Others find the \nthought of keeping kids drug-free too daunting a task, and they give up \ntoo soon.\n  But the truth is that we are learning more and more about drug \nprevention as researchers isolate the so-called ``risk'' and \n``protective'' factors for drug use. In other words, we now know that \nif a child has low self-esteem or emotional problems; has a substance \nabuser for a parent; is a victim of child abuse; or is exposed to pro-\ndrug media messages, that child is at a higher risk of smoking, \ndrinking and using illegal drugs. But the good news is that we are also \nlearning what decreases a child's risk of substance abuse.\n  The Drug Free Communities program allows coalitions to put prevention \nresearch into action in cities and towns nationwide by funding \ninitiatives tailored to a community's individual needs.\n  In my home State of Delaware, both the New Castle County Community \nPartnership and the Delaware Prevention Coalition's Southern \nPartnership are working to prevent youth substance abuse by helping \nkids do better in school, addressing their behavioral problems, and \nteaching them the dangers associated with drug, alcohol, and tobacco \nuse. The Delaware coalitions know that teachers who have high \nexpectations of their students and help them develop good social skills \nalso help to prevent substance use. And they know that if kids think \nthat drugs, alcohol, and tobacco are bad for them, they will be less \nlikely to use them.\n  Other coalitions are working to engage the religious community. In \nFlorida, the Miami Coalition for a Safe and Drug Free Community has \ndeveloped a substance abuse manual for religious leaders so that they \nwill know how to identify substance abuse and help people who need \ntreatment find it. They are also teaching religious leaders how to \nincorporate messages about substance abuse into their sermons.\n\n[[Page S6530]]\n\n  Still other groups are working with the business community. A \ncoalition in Troy, MI, is working with the Chamber of Commerce to form \nan Employee Assistance Program for a consortium of small businesses who \ncould not otherwise afford to have one.\n  These are just a few examples of the efforts that are making a \ndifference and just a few of the reasons why I am proud to support \ncommunity coalitions.\n  Drug abuse plagues the entire community. We all feel the \nconsequences--crime, homelessness, domestic violence, child abuse, \ndespair--and we all need to do something about it. Prevention messages \nmust come from all sectors of the community, from a number of different \nvoices. Coalitions bring those groups together, give them information \nthey need, help develop programs that work, and nurture them to \nsuccess.\n  I believe that the Drug Free Communities program is a powerful \nprevention initiative and I urge my colleagues to support its \nreauthorization.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to join my \ndistinguished colleagues to support the reauthorization of the Drug-\nFree Communities Support Program. Drug-Free Community grants have had \nan extremely positive impact on my home State of Oregon, and I know \nthat the program has benefitted a great number of communities all \nacross this country. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this \nimportant bill.\n  Federal Drug-Free Community grants serve programs in 14 Oregon \ncommunities in urban, suburban, and rural areas alike. All Drug-Free \nCommunity grants go directly to communities to support a wide variety \nof innovative drug-abuse prevention programs, ranging from community \neducation programs and after-school programs to parenting classes and \nyouth camps. Communities are invested in the process through a dollar-\nfor-dollar match requirement, ensuring their interest in getting \nresults, and they are getting results. With help from Federal Drug-Free \nCommunity dollars, Oregon drug abuse prevention groups are increasing \ncitizen participation and they have produced a measurable decrease in \nboth adult and youth substance abuse.\n  Portland's Regional Drug Initiative, RDI, for example, has promoted \nthe establishment of drug-free workplaces among the city's large and \nsmall employers. Over 3,000 employers have attended an RDI training \nsession, and of those, 92 percent have instituted drug-free workplace \npolicies, resulting in a 5.5 percent decrease in positive workplace \ndrug tests. At the Southern Oregon Drug Awareness program in Medford, \nOR, 320 young people have participated in its violence prevention \ncourse, and upon completion, two-thirds of those students report having \nno additional discipline referrals in school. These are two fine \nexamples of how the Drug-Free Communities Support Program is directly \nresponsible for positively impacting lives in Oregon and all across our \nNation.\n  This bill will reauthorize the Drug-Free Communities Support Program \nto provide grants for an additional five years. The bill will also \nauthorize the creation of a National Community Anti-Drug Coalition \nInstitute, which will serve as a valuable information clearing house \nfor programs seeking to improve themselves by using the best practices \nof other successful community programs. The bill also establishes a new \ncoalition mentoring program which will enable established coalitions \nlike the Oregon Partnership to help communities develop their own local \ndrug prevention coalitions.\n  Substance prevention works, and drug abuse is becoming less common \nthrough community prevention efforts, but this is no time to rest on \nour laurels. Over the next fifteen years, the youth population in the \nUnited States will grow by 21 percent, and we must ensure that the \nprograms are in place to prevent these youths from succumbing to drug-\nrelated problems, such as academic failure, drug-related violence, and \nHIV infection.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 67, S. Res. 91.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 91) condemning the murder of a United \n     States citizen and other civilians, and expressing the sense \n     of the Senate regarding the failure of the Indonesian \n     judicial system to hold accountable those responsible for the \n     killings.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign \nRelations with an amendment and an amendment to the preamble, as \nfollows:\n\n       Whereas on September 6, 2000, a paramilitary mob in the \n     West Timor town of Atambua brutally killed 3 United Nations \n     aid workers, including United States citizen Carlos Caceres, \n     in an unprovoked attack;\n       Whereas Caceres, an attorney originally from San Juan, \n     Puerto Rico, whose family now resides in the State of \n     Florida, had e-mailed a plea for help saying that ``the \n     militias are on their way,'' and that ``we sit here like \n     bait'' before he and the others were killed;\n       Whereas on May 4, 2001, an Indonesian court in Jakarta \n     handed down only token sentences to the murderers of Carlos \n     Caceres and the other United Nations workers, and failed to \n     allot any punishment to the Indonesian military personnel \n     alleged to have sanctioned this attack;\n       Whereas these token sentences were condemned as ``wholly \n     unacceptable'' by United Nations Secretary General Kofi \n     Annan, and described by the Department of State as acts that \n     ``call into question Indonesia's commitment to the principle \n     of criminal accountability'';\n       Whereas the self-confessed killer of Carlos Caceres, a pro-\n     government militia member named Julius Naisama, was sentenced \n     to spend not more than 20 months in jail, and remarked \n     afterwards, ``I accept the sentence with pride'';\n       Whereas the murders of Carlos Caceres and the other United \n     Nations workers fit a pattern of killings perpetrated, \n     sanctioned, or condoned by certain elements within the \n     Indonesian military in Timor, both during and since the end \n     of the Suharto regime;\n       Whereas, despite the stated intent of the Government of \n     Indonesian to put into place a system of increased judicial \n     accountability, since the initiation of democratic rule in \n     Indonesia in 1998, no senior military official has been put \n     on trial for human rights abuses, extrajudicial killings, \n     torture, or incitement to mob violence; and\n       Whereas the Government of Indonesia could probably have \n     prevented both the murder of the United Nations workers and \n     the subsequent miscarriage of justice if the government had--\n       (1) upheld its explicit commitment, made after the August, \n     1999, referendum in East Timor, to ensure that Indonesian \n     military forces would safeguard United Nations workers and \n     Timorese refugees from attacks by the paramilitary militias \n     on the island who had killed approximately 1,000 East \n     Timorese civilians in the preceding weeks;\n       (2) brought charges of murder or manslaughter against the 6 \n     men who admitted to killing the United Nations workers, \n     rather than only the lesser charge of conspiring to foment \n     violence; and\n       (3) brought charges against senior military commanders who, \n     according to the United Nations, the Department of State, and \n     the Government of Indonesia itself, are suspected of arming \n     and directing the paramilitary militias responsible for the \n     carnage on Timor: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That (a) the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the brutal murder of Carlos Caceres, a United \n     States citizen, and the other United Nations aid workers, and \n     offers condolences to their families, friends, and \n     colleagues;\n       (2) decries the inadequately disproportionate sentences \n     handed down by the Indonesian court to the self-confessed \n     killers of the United Nations aid workers;\n       (3) calls on the prosecutorial organs of the Government of \n     Indonesia to indict and bring to trial the senior military \n     commanders described in a September 1, 2000, statement by \n     that government as suspects in the mass killings following \n     the August, 1999, East Timor referendum.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) officials of the Department of State should, at every \n     appropriate meeting with officials of the Government of \n     Indonesia, stress the importance of ending the climate of \n     impunity that shields those individuals, including senior \n     members of the Indonesian military, suspected of \n     perpetrating, collaborating in, or covering up extra-judicial \n     killings and abuses of human rights in Indonesia; and\n       (2) the President should consider the willingness of the \n     Government of Indonesia to make substantive progress in \n     judicial reform, and in the criminal accountability of those \n     responsible for human rights abuse on the island of Timor, \n     among those factors taken into account when determining the \n     level of financial support provided by the United States to \n     Indonesia, whether directly or through international \n     financial institutions.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the President.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I, along with my colleagues \nSenators Feingold, Harkin, and Leahy, have introduced S. Res. 91, a \nresolution that condemns the brutal murder of Carlos Caceres, an \nAmerican citizen, decries the inadequately disproportionate sentences \ngiven by the Indonesian judicial system to the self-confessed killers \nof the three U.N. aid workers, and offers condolences to the family, \nfriends and colleagues of Carlos Caceres and the other victims of the \nSeptember 6 attack.\n  This resolution also expresses the sense of the Senate that:\n\n       (1) the officials at the U.S. Department of State should, \n     at every appropriate meeting with officials of the Indonesian \n     government, stress the importance of ending the climate of \n     impunity which shields those individuals, including senior \n     members of the Indonesian military, suspected of \n     perpetrating, collaborating in, or covering up extrajudicial \n     killings, and other abuses of human rights.\n       (2) the President should consider the willingness of the \n     government of Indonesia to make rapid and substantive \n     progress in judicial reform, and in the criminal \n     accountability of those responsible for human rights abuses \n     on the island of Timor, among those factors taken into \n     account when determining the level of U.S. financial support \n     provided to Indonesia, whether directly or through \n     international financial institutions.\n\n  On September 6, 2000, a paramilitary mob killed three United Nations \naid workers, including the United States citizen Carlos Caceres, in the \nWest Timor town of Atambua. Mr. Caceres and the other victims were \nstabbed and hacked to death with exceptional brutality, and their \nbodies were then set on fire and dragged through the streets. Mr. \nCaceres previously had emailed a plea for help saying that ``The \nmilitias are on their way'' and that ``we sit here like bait.''\n  Several weeks ago, an Indonesian court in Jakarta meted out only \ntoken sentences to the murderers of Carlos Caceres and the other U.N. \nworkers, and failed to allot any punishment whatsoever to the \nIndonesian military commanders alleged to have sanctioned this attack. \nIn addition, the self-confessed killer of Carlos Caceres, a pro-\ngovernment militia member was sentenced to spend no more than 20 months \nin jail, and remarked afterwards, ``I accept the sentence with pride.''\n\n[[Page S6532]]\n\n  The murders of Carlos Caceres and the other U.N. workers fit a \npattern of killings perpetrated or sanctioned by the Indonesian \nmilitary in Aceh, Irian Jaya, and other parts of the nation. Despite \ngovernment promises of judicial accountability, since the initiation of \ndemocratic rule in Indonesia in 1998 no senior military official has \nyet been put on trial for human rights abuses, extrajudicial killings, \ntorture, or incitement of mob violence. I propose that the U.S. Senate \ngo on record to stress the importance of ending the climate of impunity \nwhich shields those individuals--especially senior members of the \nIndonesian military--suspected of perpetrating, collaborating in, or \ncovering up extrajudicial killings, torture, and other abuses of human \nrights. The Senate urges the President and Congress to make every \neffort to consider the need for reform when determining policy towards \nIndonesia.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment be agreed to, the resolution, as amended, be agreed to, the \npreamble, as amended, be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 91), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The preamble, as amended, was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/20/senate-section/article/S6532-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 21, 2001\n\n  Mr. REID.
