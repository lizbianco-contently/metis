Intercession \nchanges our understanding of what and how to pray, changes our \nrelationship with the people for whom we pray, and actually changes \nwhat happens in their lives because we pray. You are constantly seeking \nto enable deeper relationships and are delighted when, out of love, we \ncome to You and pray about our loved ones and friends.\n  Today we focus our prayers on the spouses and families of the \nSenators. They are such a vital part of these leaders' lives. And yet, \nthe very demands of being in the Senate cause strain and stress on \nmarriage and the family. Family members bear the burden of high profile \nliving with its lack of privacy and abundance of public scrutiny and \ncriticism. Although the spouses are not elected to office, often \nconstituencies place heavy responsibilities and demands on them. \nKeeping pace with schedules, the demands of the family, and the \npressures of social calendars creates a formidable challenge.\n  Father, bless the Senators' spouses, the children, and extended \nfamilies of parents, brothers, and sisters. We focus them in our mind's \neye in this moment of intercessory prayer. Grant each one the healing \nhelp and hope that he or she needs today. Through our Lord and Saviour. \nAmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3903-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Zell Miller led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3903-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaties transmitted to the Senate on May 6, 2002, by the President of \nthe United States:\n  Extradition Treaty with Lithuania, Treaty Document 107-4; and \nStockholm Convention on Organic Pollutants, Treaty Document 107-5.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the treaties be considered as \nhaving been read the first time, that they be referred with \naccompanying papers to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered \nto be printed, and that the President's messages be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty Between the \nGovernment of the United States of America and the Government of the \nRepublic of Lithuania, signed at Vilnius on October 23, 2001.\n  In addition, I transmit for the information of the Senate, the report \nof the Department of State with respect to the Treaty. As the report \nexplains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.\n  The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content \nof modern extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States \nand will replace the Extradition Treaty of April 9. 1924, between the \ntwo countries and the Supplementary Extradtion Treaty of May 17, 1934. \nIn conjunction with the new U.S.-Lithuania Mutual Legal Assistance \nTreaty that took effect in 1999, the Treaty will, upon entry into \nforce, enhance cooperation between the law enforcement communities of \nthe two countries. It will thereby make a significant contribution to \ninternational law enforcement efforts against serious offenses, \nincluding terrorism, organized crime, and drug-trafficking offenses.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W.

I transmit herewith the Stockholm Convention on \nPersistent Organic Pollutants, with Annexes, done at Stockholm, May 22-\n23, 2001. The report of the Secretary of State is also enclosed for the \ninformation of the Senate.\n  The Convention, which was negotiated under the auspices of the United \nNations Environment Program with the leadership and active \nparticipation of the United States, commits Parties to take significant \nsteps, similar to those already taken by the United States, to \neliminate or restrict the production. use, and/or release of 12 \nspecified persistent organic pollutants (POPs). When I announced that \nthe United States would sign the Convention, I noted that POPs \nchemicals, even when released abroad, can harm human health and the \nenvironment in the United States. The Convention obligates Parties to \ntake measures to eliminate or restrict the production, use, and trade \nof intentionally produced POPs, to develop action plans to address the \nrelease of unintentionally produced POPs, and to use best available \ntechniques to reduce emissions from certain new sources of \nunintetionally produced POPs. It also includes obligations on the \ntreatment of POPs stockpiles and wastes, as well as a science-based \nprocedure to add new chemicals that meet defined criteria.\n  The United States, with the assistance and cooperation of \nnongovernmental organizations and industry, plays an important \ninternational leadership role in the safe management of hazardous \nchemicals and pesticides. This Convention, which will bring over time, \nan end to the production and use of certain of these toxic chemicals \nbeyond our borders, will positively affect the U.S. environment and \npublic health. All relevant Federal agencies support early ratification \nof the Convention for these reasons, and we understand that affected \nindustries and interest groups share this view.\n  I recommend that the Senate give prompt and favorable consideration \nto the Convention and give its advice and consent to ratification, \nsubject to the understanding described in the accompanying report of \nthe Secretary of State, at the earliest possible date.\n                                                      George W.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand that the conference report \nbefore the Senate is the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of \n2002. As I understand the unanimous consent agreement, there are 6 \nhours of debate evenly divided today and 6 hours of debate evenly \ndivided on tomorrow.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the bipartisan farm bill conference report \nnow before us has been approved overwhelmingly in the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of about 2 to 1, and President Bush has \npledged to sign it, calling it a significant piece of legislation and, \nof course, touting the great efforts we made to reach agreement.\n  Now we have the crucial bill before us, and the Senate has the \nopportunity to join the House and the President with our approval of \nthis legislation.\n  The President said he wants this bill on his desk promptly, and I \nhope we\n\n[[Page S3905]]\n\ncan do that. I intend to do all I can to make sure that happens. I am \nsorry we could not have taken this up last week and passed it on \nThursday. The President could have signed it this week. But, as I \nunderstand, the other side insisted on having a minimum of 12 hours of \ndebate on this. If that is what they want, that is certainly their \nright. So we are going to have another 2 days of debate on this farm \nbill.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I am proud to \nsponsor it. I am proud of all the hard work the conferees and our staff \nhave done. I am proud of the work that the farm groups, conservation \ngroups, anti-hunger, and others across the country have done in seeing \nthis bill through to the end. I am proud of those who lent their ideas \nin support of this bill. I am especially proud of all the members of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee on both sides of the aisle who worked \ndiligently last year through some very trying times--need I mention the \nperiod of time after September 11 when our attention was focused on the \nterrorist threat to our country? But the members of our committee, \nincluding the Presiding Officer, continued to work to make sure we met \nthe business of our country's agriculture and to make sure we came up \nwith a farm bill that addressed a broad variety of needs all over \nAmerica.\n  I compliment and commend all of the members of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, as I said, on both sides of the aisle who worked very hard \nto get this bill both through the committee and to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  I compliment all the conferees for making sure we have a good \nproduct--a product that was reached by compromise between the House and \nthe Senate. The bill is truly a product of cooperation and \ncollaboration across party lines--and across the Capitol between the \ntwo Houses.\n  I commend my colleague and ranking member, my good friend, Senator \nLugar from Indiana, for all of his courtesy and cooperation throughout \nthe process of developing this bill.\n  To be sure, we have some very substantial disagreements on the \nconference report. But Senator Lugar and his staff have been closely \ninvolved and have made major contributions throughout the provisions of \nthis bill.\n  I also thank Chairman Combest and Congressman Charlie Stenholm for \nall of their hard work and cooperation through the course of a \nchallenging conference. I compliment publicly Congressman Combest for \nhis fair and diligent leadership and for his chairmanship of the \nconference committee as we worked through this bill. This conference \nreport reflects a tremendous amount of work and careful consideration \nby both the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n  The House Agriculture Committee began hearings on the new farm bill \nin 2000. Our committee began hearings on the new farm bill, under the \nleadership of Senator Lugar, in January of 2001. When the leadership \nchanged hands, under my chairmanship we continued to hold an aggressive \nschedule of hearings over the summer. We marked up the bill in November \nand reported it to the Senate on November 27.\n  Final Senate action was delayed because we were repeatedly unable to \nobtain cloture before the holiday recess. But we came back and passed \nthe bill on February 13.\n  Since then--up until May 1--we have been in conference. We began the \nconference with a very large number of critical issues in disagreement \nbetween the Senate and the House on this comprehensive, complicated, \nand far-reaching bill. We worked long and hard and made our way through \ndisagreements to produce this new, strong farm bill.\n  I will be the first to admit that this conference report is not any \none person's idea of perfection. It is, however, a very good bill. It \nis a solid, balanced piece of legislation, a product of the crucible of \nrigorous debate, hard work, and tough negotiating.\n  The conference report also reflects the necessary give and take of \nthe conference on a major piece of legislation and the imperative of \nreaching compromises and settling differences for the sake of the \nlarger objective of getting the bill completed and passed. The bottom \nline is that there is far too much at stake in this bill for farm \nfamilies, rural communities, and our Nation as a whole, for us to let \nthis bill die over a stalemate or to send it back and deadlock in \nconference.\n  For anyone looking for faults to criticize, they are there. I could \nget points for several myself. Each of us could. But given the rigor of \nthe negotiations and the strongly held views on each side, I can assure \nyou that further negotiation--if this bill were to be sent back to \nconference--would not and cannot produce an outcome appreciably \ndifferent from that which is now before the Senate. I can say that if \nthis conference report is defeated and sent back to conference, there \nwill not be a farm bill this year.\n  As I said, each of us can look and say: Well, I don't like the \nspecifics, or, I don't like these two items which I voted for in the \nSenate, or which I voted for in committee, and it is not in there. Yes, \nwe can all do that. We can pick it apart. But, again, if you look at \nthe overall aspects of the farm bill for commodities, for nutrition, \nfor conservation, and for rural development, when you look at it in its \nbroad aspect, this is a bill worthy of support.\n  This trial by fire of going through the procedures means we have a \ncomprehensive and forward-looking bill. This bill restores sound farm \nincome protections. It offers predictability and stability to \nagricultural producers, suppliers, and others. It greatly strengthens \nour commitment to conservation, to investing in jobs, to economic \ngrowth, and to the overall quality of life in rural communities. And, \nfor the first time ever, we have an energy title in this farm bill to \nboost farm-based renewable energy.\n  Last week, President Bush said this bill has ``the strongest \nconservation provisions of any farm bill ever passed by Congress. The \nfinal provisions of the farm bill are also consistent with America's \ninternational trade obligations, which will strengthen our ability to \nopen foreign markets for American farm products.''\n  That is a quote from President Bush.\n  (Mr. WELLSTONE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Rural America is waiting for this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to send this critical legislation to the White House without \nfurther delay.\n  Again, I am proud that we have got this bill through. When we look \nback to 1996, that farm bill was signed into law about 6 months after \nthe previous farm bill expired. I am proud to say we have this farm \nbill before us 5 months before the present farm bill expires.\n  I would like to go through, as briefly as I can, the various titles \nof the farm bill.\n  First, I will go through the commodity programs. Then we will take up \nthe different areas of energy and conservation, and some other aspects \ndealing with trade and WTO just to set the record on where we are with \nthis conference report before us.\n  The conference put together a balanced package that includes three \nelements of support: direct payments, countercyclical payments, and \nmarketing assistance loans.\n  The first chart I have in the Chamber shows the protection levels for \ndifferent commodities: corn, soybeans, wheat, sorghum, and barley. This \nis not all of the commodities; this is just representative of many of \nthe commodities we cover.\n  The income protection levels are shown in green on the chart for the \npresent 1996 farm bill, plus the emergency payments are in kind of a \npurple color. What it shows is that for all these major crops, the farm \nbill before us will provide much higher income protection levels than \nthe existing farm bill.\n  For example, on soybeans, the income protection level under the farm \nbill before us is $5.80 per bushel. Under the farm bill we are now \noperating under--the old farm bill; the 1996 farm bill--it is $5.04 a \nbushel. And going on through all the rest: for wheat, the income \nprotection is $3.86 a bushel under this bill. It is only $3.24 under \nthe previous farm bill.\n  The next chart shows the commodity program spending by crop-year. \nThere has been some talk that we are somehow cheating farmers out of \nmoney, that we are spending less. But that is not true. This chart \nshows the spending by crop-year from 1996 on through 2002. The total \nincludes AMTA payments, the marketing loss assistance and \ncountercyclical payments, LDPs, marketing loan gains, and certificate\n\n[[Page S3906]]\n\ngains. We have bundled everything together to show the total income.\n  After enactment of the 1996 farm bill--and we had all these emergency \nprocedures--the high water mark was $19.73 billion in 2000. Last year--\n2001--that dropped to $16.17 billion. And in 2002, we bring it back to \n$17.91 billion in spending for the total amount of crops. So you may \nhear arguments that the total spending this year is less than before, \nand that simply is not true.\n  I have heard some talk that a typical farmer would get less this year \nthan they got under the farm bill before, the 1996 farm bill, plus the \ndouble AMTA payments they got last year. So we took an Iowa farmer--I \ndid not do any other State--with 1,000 acres, growing corn and \nsoybeans. And it was assumed that the loan rate would be frozen at the \ncurrent levels for the 1996 farm bill, which basically the Secretary \ndid.\n  For that typical Iowa farmer, under the farm bill now before us, the \npayments would total about $83,884. Under the old farm bill, it would \ntotal about $73,987--a difference of about $10,000. So a typical Iowa \ncorn farmer this year is going to be a heck of a lot better off under \nthis bill than if we were to continue with the old bill, even plus all \nof the double AMTA payments and the emergency payments.\n\n  This chart shows an even more drastic difference. Again, the $83,884 \nis the payment to that typical Iowa farmer this year. The $57,947 would \nrepresent the 1996 farm bill and a loan rate that was at the lowest \nrate. In other words, if the Secretary lowered the loan rate, that \nwould be the payment to an Iowa farmer.\n  I must say, there has been a lot of talk that the Secretary has \ntalked about lowering their loan rates. That would be $1.67 a bushel \nfor corn, for example, and $4.92 for soybeans. What we did in this farm \nbill, Mr. President, as you well know, is we not only raised the loan \nrates but we removed the ability of the Secretary to lower those loan \nrates. That provision has been in the law, and this is how low we would \ngo if the Secretary exercised it. In this farm bill, the Secretary does \nnot have that discretion.\n  I am going to talk about the WTO aspects in a moment, but let me \ncomment a little bit further about the present farm bill.\n  We continue the planting flexibility in the current farm bill. The \n1996 farm bill allowed farmers to plant however they wanted to, on \nwhatever acres they wanted. Farmers liked that, so we have continued \nthe planting flexibility.\n  The producers will be eligible for direct and countercyclical \npayments as long as they comply with soil conservation and wetland \nprotection, use the land for an agricultural or conserving use, and do \nnot plant prohibited fruits and vegetables on base acres.\n  The countercyclical program is a major improvement over the 1996 farm \nbill. Owners of farmland will have a one-time opportunity to update \ntheir crop acreage base and to partially update their payment yields \nfor countercyclical payments. The countercyclical program is designed \nto supplement farm income during times when commodity prices are low.\n  As I said, we have rebalanced the commodity loan rates to minimize \nmarket distortions. Loan rates under the conference agreement are not \nas high as in the Senate-passed bill, but the loan rates in this bill \nwill provide an adequate level of support for crop producers without \nstimulating surplus production. We have tried to assure that producers \ncan choose to produce alternative crops, such as minor oilseeds, dried \npeas, lentils, and small chickpeas. Producers will be able to \ndemonstrate minimal price supports for these alternative crops, which \ncan make all the difference to their lenders.\n  The conference report includes allotments to limit U.S. sugar \nproduction to keep production in line with demand and ensure that the \nsugar program can operate without cost to the Federal Government.\n  The conference report also includes a major reform of the peanut \nprogram to help U.S. peanut producers and processors survive in a \nchanging world market and trade environment.\n  This bill complies with all of the WTO commitments. I would refer to \nthis chart in the Chamber. There has been some talk--and we may hear \nsome talk in the ensuing 12 hours of debate--about the possibility that \nwe could violate WTO. We have looked at this very carefully. Under a \nworst case scenario, there is only minimal possibility that we violate \nour WTO agreements. Right now, as you well know, we have a provision \nunder WTO that puts things in amber boxes, green boxes--and I don't \nneed to belabor what that is all about. Let's just say, under the green \nbox, you can spend as much as you want. That does not violate any of \nour trade agreements. Under the amber box, for specific payments, we \nhave a $19.1 billion cap. In other words, if we go above $19.1 billion \nin any year in spending, then our trade partners could, if they want, \ntake us to a dispute settlement panel in terms of violating the WTO \nagreements.\n  So here, under the amber box, as you can see, is the $19.1 billion, \nas shown on the chart, that we are allowed in a year. Right now we are \nspending about $11 billion a year in that amber box. The likely effect \nof the bill before us--the conference report before us--is about $12 \nbillion a year under likely scenarios.\n  Under a situation with very low prices, such as we saw in 1999, when \npayments went up, we faced absolutely devastating circumstances and the \nrest of the world had strong production--under that, we get about $16.7 \nbillion under the amber box. So we are still nearly $3 billion below \nthe ceiling we are allowed under the amber box.\n  Under the green box, we are about $13.3 billion. We have come up, \nwith our conservation programs, to about $16.3 billion under the green. \nThat doesn't violate anything. It just means we are giving farmers more \nnon-trade-distorting protection under the green box, which is not only \nallowed but encouraged under WTO. We are giving them more support under \nthe amber but not to the extent it is very likely that we would violate \nour trade agreements. I will get to conservation. But before I do, I \nwanted to specifically talk about the fact that we will not in any way \nbe violating our WTO agreements.\n  When the Senate considered this bill, it adopted stricter commodity \nprogram payment limitations. The House bill not only did not reduce \npayment limits, it expanded them. In conference we argued aggressively \nfor the Senate's position of stronger payment limitations. The House \nconferees took an extraordinarily strong stance against lower payment \nlimits. So it should be no surprise to anyone that the conference \nreport contains a compromise.\n  Under existing law the limit is $460,000. The House bill had a \npayment limit of $550,000 for an individual or a married couple. The \nSenate bill contained a $225,000 limit for an individual or $275,000 \nfor a couple. For the past several years, under the previous farm bill, \nthe limit has been set at $460,000.\n  So the conference agreement includes a limit of $360,000 for an \nindividual or a couple--well below the House bill level. Again, the \npresent level is $460,000. The House went to $550,000. We reduced that \ndown to $360,000--much closer to the Senate-passed level of $275,000.\n  I just saw a press report the other day that a Congressman, a Member \nof the other body, had specifically lambasted this bill because of the \nhigh payment limits. He pointed out that Ted Turner, Scottie Pippen \nand--I forget who else he mentioned--a couple of other wealthy people \ncould still continue to get all these big payments. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth, I am sorry to tell the Congressman. In the \nconference report, we changed one other provision, another reform in \npayment limits.\n  We include a new eligibility test that will prevent any individual or \nentity--that is very important, individual or entity--with an adjusted \ngross income of $2.5 million or more from receiving any commodity or \nconservation payments--$2.5 million. If that person is actively engaged \nin agriculture and their income all comes from agriculture, then that \ndoes not apply. But for someone like Scottie Pippen and Ted Turner--\nobviously their income comes from other places--they not only would not \nbe eligible for the payment limits, they are not eligible for any \npayments, period, zero. So that was another reform we made.\n  In addition--this is most significant--under our compromise, the\n\n[[Page S3907]]\n\nUSDA will be required to track payments through entities such as \npartnerships and corporations, cooperatives, so that we can determine \nexactly what amounts an individual is receiving. This transparency will \nprovide much more accurate data for Congress in order to make better \ninformed decisions about payment limit issues in the future. Again, for \nthe first time ever we are going to have full transparency. The \nSecretary is required to come up with a methodology so that we can \ntrack payments through any kind of partnership, cooperative or \ncorporation, so that we can find out exactly who is getting what. We \nhave never had that before.\n\n  The conference report also establishes a commission to review who \nreceives benefits and to recommend changes in the law regarding how \npayment limits operate. As I understand it, the Senate will get three, \nthe House gets three, and the President appoints four. That is how the \ncommission will be set up, if I am not mistaken.\n  Some will argue and will continue to argue that the Senate conferees \nbrought back too little on payment limitations in this conference \nreport. However, this is the reality: If we Senate conferees had issued \nan ultimatum on our position, we would not be here today with a \nconference report on the farm bill. That was clearly indicated to us by \nHouse conferees and, quite frankly, by some on our own side.\n  I am greatly disappointed this conference report does not contain \nstronger payment limitations. But failing to produce this farm bill \nwould have been far worse for farm families, rural communities, and our \ncountry as a whole than getting the compromise we did on payment \nlimitations. Simply put, it would have been irresponsible to walk away \nfrom this new farm bill over the failure to reach a compromise on \npayment limitations and thereby forfeit the desperately needed farm \nincome protection our bill contains for farms of all sizes, including \nsmall and modest-sized farms.\n  As far as this Senator is concerned, this bill is far from the final \nword on payment limitations. We will continue to examine this issue. We \nwill get our commission established. We will continue to look, through \nthe transparency, at exactly who is getting these payments. At some \npoint down the road, I am sure this committee will come up with further \nlegislation to refine and reform payment limitations.\n  We made some important strides in this bill regarding specialty \ncrops. Not only did we provide funding for farmers' market nutrition \nprograms and for commodities for The Emergency Food Assistance Program \nand the School Lunch Program, a portion of which are specialty crops, \nwe also directed USDA to increase their average spending on specialty \ncrops by setting a floor of $200 million annually for the amount of \nfunds that must be devoted to the purchases of fruits and vegetables \neach year.\n  This is vitally important, both for our specialty crop producers, and \nfor the health of our kids and low-income individuals. Before we didn't \nhave a floor. Some years we went as low as $100 million a year in the \nlevel of spending for fruits and vegetables. This bill sets a floor of \n$200 million minimum. We can go higher than that, but we can't go lower \nthan that. I believe that is going to be good for our fruit and \nvegetable farmers and also good for nutrition of all Americans.\n  Mr. President, on the dairy issue--this is one that always perplexes \nand bedevils us in this country, but I believe we have come out with a \ndairy provision that represents, as best as possible, all the interests \nacross our country. I think it is a significant victory for our smaller \ndairy farmers. We maintain a permanent $9.90 price support for milk. We \nestablished a new 3.5-year national dairy program to provide assistance \nto all U.S. producers. This national dairy program will provide a \npayment based on the difference between $16.94 and certain prices in \nthe Northeast, but I will try not get into the convoluted details of \nit.\n  Basically, we said that for up to 2.4 million pounds of production \nper dairy farm per year, we will support your prices up to about \n$16.94. So really, this is targeted to helping our smaller dairy \nfarmers. That 2.4 million pounds of production per dairy farm per year \nis about 137 cows--or 125 to 140 cows. That is really our smaller dairy \nfarms.\n  The conservation section is one of which I think all of us can be \nproud. It is the one section that President Bush highlighted in his \ncomments when talking about this bill. In addition to producing food \nand fiber, America's farmers and ranchers play a critical role as \nstewards of our natural resources for today and for future generations. \nThe conservation title in the farm bill recognizes conservation as a \ncornerstone of sound farm policy, adding $17.1 billion in new funding. \nIt is an 80-percent increase above the baseline. This reflects a strong \ncommitment to helping agricultural producers and landowners conserve \nand improve water, air, plants, and wildlife. The bill strikes an \nimportant balance between conservation programs that idle land, such as \nthe Conservation Reserve Program and the Wetlands Reserve Program, and \nprograms that focus on lands of production, such as the EQIP program--\nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program--and the new Conservation \nSecurity Program. Together all the programs in the conservation title \nprovide the full array of options to producers who voluntarily \nincorporate conservation practices on their lands.\n  The Conservation Reserve Program is expanded to 39.2 million acres \nfrom the current cap of 36.4 million acres. The WRP program--Wetlands \nReserve Program--cap is more than doubled to 2.275 million acres. EQIP \nfunding--so important to our livestock producers, our dairy farmers--is \nincreased 5.5 times, from a 10-year baseline of $2 billion, to $11 \nbillion.\n  The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program is so important to our \nsportsmen all over America for increasing and preserving wildlife \nhabitats all over this country. Funding for the WHIP program is \nincreased 14 times--fourteen-fold--to $700 million, from a total of $50 \nmillion over the life of the last farm bill.\n  Funding for the Farmland Protection Program, to provide protection \nfor farmland around some of our urban areas and keep it in farmland \nrather than being developed--funding for the Farmland Protection \nProgram jumps nearly thirty-fold--nearly 30 times--from the $35 million \nin the last farm bill, to nearly $1 billion in this bill.\n  The farm bill contains important, new programs as well as increasing \nfunding for existing ones. To address the growing need for water \nconservation, the bill contains $600 million for a national ground and \nsurface water conservation program, including $50 million for producers \nlocated in the Klamath Basin in California and Oregon.\n\n  The new Grassland Reserve Program will help conserve and restore 2 \nmillion acres of grassland across the country. This important new \nprogram is funded at $254 million. The bill also contains $275 million \nfor the Small Watershed Dam Rehabilitation Program, to restore ailing \ndams across the country. Many of these dams out in Iowa, and in \nMissouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, are rapidly deteriorating. This \nprogram will rebuild those dams to preserve, to protect the safety of \nthose living near them and save our precious water.\n  Finally, an important, new component in our conservation bill is the \nnew Conservation Security Program. Through the CSP, all agricultural \nproducers who can receive payments for implementing conservation on \nworking lands. By encouraging producers to address critical resources \non their operation at a non-degradation level, CSP will lead to \nsubstantial, new environmental benefits and help maintain those gains \nalready made.\n  The time has come to recognize farmers and ranchers as good stewards \nof the land, the basic stewards of our Nation's natural resources. The \nimportance of maintaining the conservation achievements of the past \ncannot be over-stated. Paying good stewards to maintain their good work \nis clearly the right thing to do. And now we can do that through the \nConservation Security Program.\n  In order to ensure successful implementation of the conservation \nprograms, we include funding for technical assistance, including for \neducation, monitoring and assessment activities, directly from the \nconservation programs. Without strong technical assistance, \nconservation programs could not be fully implemented. This farm bill \nrecognizes that and provides for funding for technical assistance.\n\n[[Page S3908]]\n\n  Overall, the conservation title provides a balanced approach to \nconservation--the largest increase in a farm bill ever--and provides \ncritically important resources for our agricultural producers.\n  I will point to this chart, which gives an official representation of \nwhat we have done in conservation. Under the 1996 farm bill, we have a \ntotal 10-year baseline of $21.4 billion. That provides $19.4 billion \nfor land idling programs, like CRP and WRP, and only about $2 billion \nfor conservation programs directed toward working lands to help farmers \nbecome better stewards. The new farm bill tries to restore a balance \nthat ensures strong land-idling and working lands programs. Of the \nnearly $17.1 billion in new funds, we put $14 billion in new funds in \nworking land programs and $3 billion in new funds in land idling \nprograms. That gives us a more balanced approach.\n  In this farm bill, we have a total of $38.5 billion for conservation. \nOf that total, there is about $16.1 billion that will go to \nconservation on working lands and about $22.4 billion that will go to \nland idling. Again, you get back a historical balance of what we had in \nthe past and recognize that as farmers produce crops across our country \nthey are stewards of the land. There are some people who seem to think \nthat if you raise corn or soybeans or rice or cotton--whatever--if you \nare growing crops or raising livestock, then you are destroying the \nland, the soil, the water and other natural resources. Well, that could \nbe true, depending on how you farm.\n  If you farm up and down the hills, in the gullies, and you don't put \nin grass strips or buffer strips, or you don't ridge till, perhaps, or \nno till, you are right; you can lose a lot of soil. If you do it in the \nright way, you can grow crops and you can preserve soil, water and \nwildlife habitat, our natural resources. That is why we directed much \nof the new funding toward working lands programs--to help farmers be \nthose good conservationists, yet still produce the food and fiber we \nneed for our country. This balance was struck while ensuring that \nprograms like WRP and CRP remain strong.\n  Mr. President, as I said, we have strong spending for the existing \nprograms: Conservation Reserve Program, Wetlands Reserve Program; \nFarmland Protection Program; Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program; and \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program. These are all the programs \nthat are in existence in the present farm bill. We strengthened and \nexpanded them, as you can see. The Farmland Protection Program is \nincreased from $35 million to nearly $1 billion--$985 million.\n  The wetlands reserve has been increased from 975,000 acres in the \n1996 Farm Bill to 2.275 million acres. Even with the addition of \n100,000 acres through a appropriation bill, that is still more than \ndouble the current level.\n  EQIP has been increased from $2 billion to $11 billion.\n  We heavily boost existing programs.\n  We added new programs. The Ground and Surface Water Conservation \nProgram was not in the last farm bill. We have $600 million in this \nbill for that program.\n  For the Conservation Security Program, there is a $2 billion \nestimated cost.\n  For the Small Watershed Rehabilitation Program, there is $275 \nmillion.\n  For the Agricultural Management Assistance Program for certain under-\nserved States, there is $50 million.\n  We have a provision that helps at-risk natural desert terminal lakes. \nWe need to protect and preserve those lakes. There is $200 million in \nthe bill for that program.\n  I want to put up the last chart again. I heard and read some reports \nthat because of the new conservation programs we put in this bill, \nespecially the Conservation Security Program and others, we are taking \nmoney out of EQIP or we are hurting funding for existing conservation \nprograms. In fact, there is a conservation group--I am sorry, I cannot \nremember the name now--that basically is saying that we are taking \nmoney out of these programs.\n  Again, the facts are just the opposite. We have increased many \nexisting programs. As I said, the Wetlands Reserve Program has been \nincreased from 975,000 acres to 2.275 million acres. EQIP has a 5.5-\nfold increase. The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program has a fourteen-\nfold increase. The Farmland Protection Program has nearly a thirty-fold \nincrease. We are not taking money away from any of these programs. We \nenlarged the pie. When people say we are hurting existing programs, \nthat simply is not true. We are providing more options for producers \nand opening conservation programs to all those producers who are \ncurrently left out of conservation programs because they are already \ndoing the right thing. Or, out of commodity programs because they do \nnot grow a covered crop. The CSP reaches all of those producers--it \nexpands the conservation programs and is money well spent.\n  Let me talk about trade. The trade title offers major gains to \nagricultural producers and agricultural export industries. The Market \nAccess Program will be ramped up to a $200-million-a-year program by \n2006. This is the level that has been sought by supporters of the MAP \nprogram. It represents a 122-percent increase over the current funding \nlevel of $90 million a year.\n  The trade title also provides additional funds for the Foreign Market \nDevelopment Cooperators Program--otherwise known as the FMD Program--\nfrom $27.5 million to $34.5 million annually.\n  The trade title of the farm bill also expands use of U.S. commodities \nin food aid shipments both under the existing Food for Progress Program \nand to continue the pilot International Food for Education Program, \notherwise known as the International School Lunch Program.\n  The bill provides an increase in transportation spending for the Food \nfor Progress Program from its current level of $30 million to $40 \nmillion and increases funds to cover administrative costs for these \norganizations running the projects within country from $10 million to \n$15 million.\n  The conference report provides $100 million to be available next \nfiscal year to continue support for existing projects under the GFEI \nProgram established in 2000.\n  Lastly, there are two other issues I want to mention. The nutrition \ntitle is a very strong part of this conference report. We can all be \njustly proud of that title. The House bill provided $3.6 billion in new \nfunding for nutrition. The Senate bill had $8.4 billion, as we reported \nit out of the Senate. The compromise is $6.4 billion for nutrition and \nfood assistance. That is a level that is much closer to the Senate \nposition and not quite as close to what the House had in their bill.\n  We restore food stamp benefits to legal immigrant adults who have \nlived in the United States for at least 5 years, and to legal immigrant \nchildren and the disabled without residency requirements. President \nBush wanted the first part of the provision, and we complied with his \nwishes and put it in the bill. The second part of the provision \nrestoring food stamp benefits to children and the disabled without a 5-\nyear waiting period originated in the Senate.\n  We provide transitional benefits for people moving from welfare to \nwork, and we increase the benefits for families with children.\n  We have simplified some food stamp program rules and have reduced the \nadministrative burden for States.\n  We have increased funding for commodity purchases and distribution to \nthese programs. The nutrition title is certainly a part of the bill we \ncan all proudly support.\n  Again I thank all of the members of the committee. I especially \ncommend Senator Lugar for his contributions to this title, both in the \ncommittee and on the floor, and as we went through conference.\n  I want to remind everyone that the food and nutrition assistance \nprograms affect our entire country. A lot of people say this is just \nthe urban portion of the bill. Again, nothing could be further from the \ntruth. Hungry people do not know city boundaries. They live in our \nsmall towns and communities. They live in the most rural areas in our \ncountry--in all parts of our country. In fact, ten percent of America's \nhouseholds face hunger. They include the working poor, single working \nmothers with children, seniors forced to choose between paying for food \nor paying for prescription drugs, families forced to choose between \nheating and eating.\n\n[[Page S3909]]\n\n  The cornerstone of our safety net, the Food Stamp Program, is the \nmost effective and efficient program ever for low-income families, the \nelderly, and the disabled. It is a critical work support program, one \nthat boosts low-income families' wages and helps them make ends meet \nevery month and put food on the table.\n  We have successfully addressed these issues head on and have produced \na nutrition title that stands out in several respects: We have improved \naccessibility; we facilitate the transition from welfare to work; we \nreduce paperwork and redtape; and, as I said, we correct one of the \nharsh aspects of welfare reform, and that is, we restore food stamp \nbenefits to legal immigrant children and the disabled right away and to \nlegal immigrant adults who have been here at least 5 years.\n  The title includes other important provisions as well. It includes \nfunding for The Emergency Food Assistance Program to help food banks \nand food pantries meet the needs they face, and it re-authorizes a \nnumber of other commodity distribution programs. It includes funding \nfor both the WIC and the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Programs. It \nprovides additional money for commodities for schools with a focus on \nspeciality crops.\n\n  Again, our bill also directs USDA to increase their average spending \non speciality crops by setting a floor of $200 million a year for the \namount of funds that must be devoted to fruit and vegetable purposes.\n  We succeeded not only in maintaining but enhancing the nutrition \nsafety net for families around the Nation. I say to my colleagues, yes, \nyou may pick one or two parts of this bill you do not like, that you \nwish were different; but think about the families in this country who \nrely upon food stamps; think about those making the transition from \nwelfare to work, the fact they need additional assistance as they \nprovide more income for their families; think about the children and \nthe disabled all over this country; think about the people who go to \nfood banks and food pantries who need this just to keep food on their \ntable every month. That is in this bill.\n  Do we want to vote this bill down and send it to a conference and \nnever have it come back? Because that is what will happen. Mr. \nPresident, I say to my colleagues, when they vote on this bill, think \nabout the tremendous work we have done and the increases in nutrition \nwe have provided.\n  The credit title reauthorizes farm money programs. We provide greater \naccess for beginning farmers and ranchers by doing a number of things, \nsuch as increasing the percentage that USDA may lend for downpayment \nloans for beginning farmers and extending the term of those loans. We \nalso take the opportunity to improve a number of the administrative \nprovisions in farm lending programs.\n  There is a very strong rural development title in this farm bill. \nRural communities really are part of the backbone of our whole \nagricultural structure, but they have not fully shared in our Nation's \nprosperity. For too long they have lagged behind. Rural America needs \nfacilities and services that meet the standards of the 21st \ncentury from basic services such as sewer and water, to full broadband \nInternet access. Without them, the quality of life in rural communities \nwill be impaired and businesses will not thrive.\n\n  One of the largest obstacles facing rural businesses and job growth \nis the lack of adequate equity capital. To help generate the investment \nneeded in rural America, this bill funds a new rural business \ninvestment equity program. While many rural businesses are not directly \nassociated with agricultural ventures to increase the value of \nagriculture, commodities in rural areas hold great potential as an \nengine for growth. When these value-added enterprises are owned by \nagricultural producers, there is a double benefit of economic growth \nand increased farm income. This bill provides $240 million for value-\nadded agricultural product market development grants to help develop \nsolid new enterprises owned by producers for adding value to \nagricultural commodities.\n  This program can also be used to support farm-based renewable energy \nprojects, an important new provision to help stimulate a wider variety \nof value-added enterprises owned by farmers.\n  The bill includes $360 million to reduce significantly the backlog in \nthe applications we already have on hand for drinking water and \nwastewater projects, crucial basic needs for rural Americans.\n  We also have critical provisions in this bill which will help ensure \nthat rural America is not left behind in the information age. \nCurrently, the Rural Utilities Service has a small pilot program that \nprovides loans to those that want to provide broadband services to \nareas that do not have it. The farm bill would authorize this \ninitiative and provide $100 million in mandatory spending over the next \n6 years. This would translate into at least $400 million a year in \ndirect loans for private and nonprofit entities to provide high-speed \nInternet service in rural America. This is a critically needed service \nthat will not come to rural Americans anytime soon if we wait for the \nmarket to take care of it.\n  A recent report found less than 5 percent of towns of 10,000 or less \nhave access to broadband technology. In Iowa, more than 50 percent of \nrural communities do not have access to broadband services, according \nto the Iowa Utilities Board. This loan program provides the incentive \nneeded to ensure all Americans have the opportunity to be full \nparticipants in our digital economy and the information age.\n  I might add that this provision on broadband access was in the Senate \nfarm bill. We provided this money for broadband in the Senate farm bill \nas it was marked up in committee. We kept it through floor debate. The \nHouse farm bill did not have this provision, but were able to keep the \nSenate provision on broadband in conference. I feel very strongly that \nthis is one of the most important aspects of this bill in terms of \nrural economic development.\n  We also provide a program of $10 million per year for firefighter and \nfirst responder training. That is very important for our rural \ncommunities.\n  In research, the bill continues the process we began in 1998 of \ntrying to increase the amount of money directed toward agricultural \nresearch. Over the life of the bill, funding for the Initiative for \nFuture Agriculture and Food Systems will increase from $125 million per \nyear to $200 million per year.\n  We have included a new title in this farm bill that began in our \ncommittee, came through the floor, and survived in conference. It is a \nnew energy title which has never been in the farm bill. It is the first \ntime it has ever been done. Not only do we have an energy title, but it \nincludes over $400 million in mandatory spending, for renewable energy, \nbiofuels, energy efficiency, the development of biowaste programs, as \nwell as research on climate change. The energy title will help reduce \nthe use of oil and gas by promoting alternative energy sources on farms \nand in rural communities. The energy title is a major victory for our \nfarmers and rural communities, for national security, energy \nindependence, and the environment.\n\n  Think again about this bill and what may happen. If this goes back to \nconference, if the conference report is defeated, there goes the energy \npackage and all that we have to start producing renewable forms of \nenergy.\n  In competition, the conference report includes a number of provisions \nthat address the issues of fairness and transparency in the \nagricultural marketplace. The measure includes two important measures \naffecting livestock and poultry producers. The first provision amends \nthe Packers and Stockyards Act to provide protections from unfair \npractices for swine contract producers. The second provides that all \nlivestock and poultry producers have the right to discuss contracts \nwith close advisers and family members.\n  In a major victory, the agreement includes a provision that will \nfinally provide consumers with the information on the country of origin \nof meat, fish, fruits, vegetables, and peanuts. This has been \nchampioned by consumers and family farmers alike. A country of origin \nlabel will provide crucial information sought by advocates for years.\n  After months of fighting, we were not able to retain the provision \nthat prohibits packers from owning livestock. The House was simply \nintransigent on this issue. Not one House conferee indicated support \nfor the Senate ban on packers ownership. We had our votes in the \nSenate, but the House would not\n\n[[Page S3910]]\n\nbudge. As I could detect, not one of the House conferees on this issue \nsupported the measure. Although we lost the ban on packer ownership, we \ngot country of origin label and we now put swine production contract \ngrowers under the Packers and Stockyards Act. And farmers have the \nright to discuss their contracts with their advisers, their families, \ntheir bankers.\n  However, I will say for the record, the ban on packer ownership is \nnot a conclusion; it is just the beginning. As chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, for however long I am privileged to have the \nchairmanship, we will continue to fight intensely against unfair \npractices in agriculture markets and, perhaps looking down the road, we \nwill have specific legislation targeted just at this one issue of \nensuring that packers cannot own livestock prior to 14 days before \nslaughter.\n  In conclusion, this is a sound, comprehensive farm bill that will \nbenefit all Americans--rural, urban, and suburban. It restores a sound \nsystem of countercyclical income protection for our farmers. It makes \nthe greatest investment of any farm bill in history for the \nconservation of our natural resources. It promotes our exports. Our \nnutrition provisions go a long way to keep Americans from going to bed \nhungry at night. We include rural development policy that will promote \neconomic growth, jobs and a higher quality of living in small towns and \nrural communities. We continue our strong support of agricultural \nresearch, and for the first time ever, an we include an energy title \nthat will promote the development and use of farm-based renewable \nenergy and other products.\n  All in all, this is a strong new farm bill for this new century. As I \nsaid at the beginning, I know people will say they don't agree with \nthis or that. I have indicated some issues I don't agree with in the \nbill, but it has to be looked at overall. It is a product of compromise \nand hard work over a long period of time. We are a large country. What \nis best for my farmers and farm families in Iowa may differ for farm \nfamilies in Washington State or Mississippi or Alabama or Florida. We \ndon't grow citrus in Iowa; that is in Florida. We have to balance all \nof the interests of this country to come up with a bill that meets the \nlegitimate needs of our farmers and farm families and our people in our \nsmall towns and communities, that provides a safety net, provides a \nbetter ability for our farmers to have a better income and a better \nlife, yet reaches out to make sure people who need food assistance get \nthe food assistance they need.\n  This conference report is on the verge of becoming law. The only \nthing that is needed now is a Senate vote. The President has already \nsaid that he supports it and will sign it, and that he wants it on his \ndesk promptly.\n\n  As I said, this conference report restores predictability and \nstability. It will replace this ad hoc system of emergency payments \nthat every year we have come out here on the floor and passed.\n  Those who propose to send this bill back to conference are proposing \nto take the new stability and predictability away from America's \nfarmers and ranchers and rural communities and throw the entire \nsituation into turmoil and chaos. Those who would defeat this and send \nit back to conference will introduce a whole new dimension of \nuncertainty into American agriculture at just the time that farmers, \nranchers, and rural America are within a hair's breadth of a new 6-year \nfarm bill.\n  The conference committee has been dissolved. If this bill were to go \nback, we would have to reconstitute the committee. Beyond that, there \nis no indication that a new conference would lead to any different \nresult than what we have before us now. It is not in the interests of \nour farmers and ranchers to have no new farm bill. They do not want to \nwatch as we struggle on through the summer on the farm bill, and into \nthe fall, to try to patch something together. They want and they need \nthis bill now. If we delay this bill any further, we stand a high \nlikelihood that we will lose some of the money in the budget that we \nused to write this bill. We would lose an important part of the $73.5 \nbillion that should go to agriculture.\n  If we do not have this in place. We will have to have yet another \nemergency bill, which will leave even less money to write a new farm \nbill. Again, if we pass this up, we forego the opportunity for better \nconservation, for better rural development, and a better safety net for \nour farmers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na number of letters in support of the farm bill.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that the statement of the President of \nthe United States be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  The White House,\n\n\n                                     President George W. Bush,\n\n                                                      May 2, 2002.\n\n                      President To Sign Farm Bill\n\n       I congratulate Chairman Combest and the other House and \n     Senate conferees for a job well done in completing the Farm \n     Security and Rural Development Act of 2002.\n       I am pleased that the compromise agreement on the farm bill \n     resulted in better balanced commodity loan rates; spending \n     that is no longer front-loaded; and the strongest \n     conservation provisions of any farm bill ever passed by \n     Congress. The final provisions of the farm bill are also \n     consistent with America's international trade obligations, \n     which will strengthen our ability to open foreign markets for \n     American farm products. While this compromise agreement did \n     not satisfy all of my objectives, I am pleased that this farm \n     bill provides a generous and reliable safety net for our \n     Nation's farmers and ranchers and is consistent with the \n     principles I outlined.\n       I thank the conferees for their hard work and urge Congress \n     to send the farm bill to my desk promptly for signature to \n     help ensure the immediate and long-term vitality of our farm \n     economy.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent to enter a statement by the \nSecretary of Agriculture, the Honorable Ann Veneman, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Statement of Secretary of Agriculture Ann M. Veneman, Regarding \n        Conference Committee Farm Bill Agreement, April 26, 2002\n\n       We are encouraged by the efforts of the House and Senate \n     Conferees in reaching an agreement on the framework of a new \n     farm bill. As President Bush said on Wednesday, ``the farm \n     bill needs to be completed quickly.'' With this action, \n     farmers should soon know the details of the long-awaited farm \n     bill, which would bring certainty in the coming years.\n       We commend Chairman Combest for his leadership in achieving \n     a compromise agreement. Many objectionable provisions have \n     been eliminated that we believe would not have been in the \n     best interests of America's farmers and ranchers.\n       While details still need to be completed, the agreement \n     appears to include more market-oriented and rebalanced loan \n     rates as well as increased emphasis on conservation programs \n     for working lands. However, we look forward to examining more \n     closely the specific provisions of the agreement, including \n     final cost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office to \n     ensure the agreement adheres to the intent and the spirit of \n     the Congressional Budget Resolution.\n       This is a most critical time in regard to farm bill \n     implementation for the 2002 crop year. Final action must be \n     concluded now to enable farmers and ranchers to make the \n     necessary business decisions. While USDA has been working \n     hard to prepare for implementation, there is no doubt that \n     this will be a formidable task in the coming months.\n       Again, we are pleased that an agreement has been reached \n     and look forward to continuing our work with the Conferees \n     for a timely resolution to completing this important \n     legislation.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have a letter signed by 30 organizations. I will not \nread all of them, but I will read a couple of paragraphs.\n\n       The organizations listed below extend our gratitude to \n     members and staff of the Farm Bill Conference Committee for \n     their tireless efforts in achieving a workable compromise. . \n     . .

With farmers in their fields now \n     planting this year's crop, it is imperative that the Senate \n     also take immediate action and adopt the farm bill conference \n     report. Adoption of this farm bill will assure them that they \n     will have an adequate, long-term safety net in place now and \n     in the future.\n       This farm bill has been debated in field hearings \n     throughout the country, in House and Senate committees and on \n     the floor of both chambers for more than two years. It is now \n     time to end debates as well as farmers uncertainty. We urge \n     the Senate to immediately adopt the farm bill conference \n     report and send it without unnecessary delay to the President \n     for his signature and implementation for the 2002 crop.\n       Sincerely,\n       Agricultural Retailers Association.\n       Alabama Farmers Federation.\n       American Cotton Shippers Association.\n       American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       American Society of Farm Managers & Rural Appraisers.\n       American Soybean Association.\n       American Sugar Alliance.\n       American Sugarbeet Growers Association.\n       American Sugar Cane League.\n       CoBank.\n       Fresh Solutions.\n       National Association of Wheat Growers.\n       National Barley Growers Association.\n       National Corn Growers Association.\n       National Cotton Council.\n       National Farmers Union.\n       National Grain Sorghum Producers.\n       National Milk Producers Federation.\n       National Pork Producers Council.\n       National Sunflower Association.\n       Ocean Spray, Inc.\n       Rice Millers' Association.\n       South East Dairy Farmers Association.\n       Southern Peanuts Farmers Federation.\n       U.S. Canola Association.\n       U.S. Rice Producers Association.\n       U.S. Rice Producers Group.\n       USA Dry Pea & Lentil Association.\n       United Egg Producers.\n       Western United Dairymen.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent several statements from different \nU.S. commodity groups and broad-based groups be printed.\n  I have a letter from the National Farmers Union that I ask be printed \nat this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       National Farmers Union,\n\n                                                      May 1, 2002.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the 300,000 family farmer and \n     rancher members of the National Farmers Union I write to \n     encourage your support of the conference report on ``The Farm \n     Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002'', the 2002 farm \n     bill adopted by the House and Senate conferees.\n       Due to depressed commodity prices and failure of the 1996 \n     Freedom-to-Farm legislation to provide an adequate safety net \n     for producers, approval of this legislation is of critical \n     importance to America's farmers, ranchers and rural \n     communities. The legislation represents meaningful progress \n     in providing a more stable and reliable farm income for \n     producers and greater certainty for their lenders. In \n     addition, it makes available significant additional \n     investments in the conservation of our natural resources, \n     research, development and commercialization of viable \n     renewable and bio-based energy production, enhanced rural \n     development programs, improved domestic and international \n     nutrition assistance and expanded consumer information \n     concerning the origin of their food supply.\n       In short, it is a comprehensive measure that represents a \n     positive step forward on many issues important not only to \n     commodity producers but also rural communities and the \n     population as a whole.\n       While we fully recognize that the legislation is not \n     perfect, and we will seek to correct those shortcomings in \n     the future, we believe the economic certainty the farm bill \n     provides farmers along with its renewal investment in rural \n     America warrants a positive vote for its adoption by the \n     Congress.\n       Thank you for your consideration and support on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            David J.

That is from the Coalition for Food \nAid.\n\n[[Page S3912]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Coalition for Food Aid,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Larry Combest,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen Combest and Harkin: The members of the \n     Coalition for Food Aid would like to thank you and the \n     Conferees on the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of \n     2002, H.R. 2646, for strengthening and expanding US \n     international food aid programs. Coalition members are US \n     private voluntary organizations and cooperatives (jointly \n     called ``PVOs'') that conduct food aid programs overseas \n     directly engaging 30 million beneficiaries each year, with \n     collateral assistance reaching 200 million more. By providing \n     food aid through PVO programs, the assistance is leveraged \n     greatly through our networks in developing countries and \n     emerging democracies. We are grateful to work in partnership \n     with the US Government, and thank the Conferees for \n     incorporating provisions to strengthen the cooperation \n     between USAID and USDA with PVOs.\n       The Trade Title of H.R. 2646 will increase the minimum \n     tonnage used for the PL 480 Title II program by nearly \n     500,000 metric tons each year. It also requires 75 percent of \n     that tonnage to be used in programs in persuasively poor \n     communities to improve people's health, living conditions and \n     incomes. To help populations that suffer from chronic hunger, \n     merely creating welfare programs of large-scale food \n     distribution is not the answer. Thus, we appreciate the \n     Conferees reassertion of the importance of using food aid in \n     programs that help people help themselves. We also appreciate \n     the increased availability of cash assistance to support \n     program management and logistics costs.\n       In food deficit, import-reliant countries, monetization \n     provides a boost to the economy and allows needed commodities \n     to be provided through the market. The generated proceeds \n     supports the cost of program implementation and management, \n     and allows effective grassroots development in poor \n     communities. Where monetization is feasible, rather than just \n     exporting cash to support program costs, US commodities can \n     be exported providing an additional benefit to the US \n     agricultural sector. We appreciate the Conferees support for \n     uniform monetization procedures at USDA and USAID, including \n     sales for the local market price and sales for either dollars \n     or local currencies. This will allow the use of the \n     appropriate commodity for monetization, even if it is a \n     hi-value product.\n       We are most grateful that H.R. 2646 sets a of 400,000 \n     meteric tons minimum for CCC-funded Food for Progress \n     programs. We are greatly concerned, however, that the \n     Administration will no longer permit nongovernmental \n     organizations, such as PVOs, to carry out Food for Progress \n     programs. PVOs provide effectiveness and accountability to \n     the Food for Progress program. These organizations are \n     required under US law to have transparent management and \n     accounting procedures. Further, eliminating PVO participation \n     in Food for Progress would run counter to the intent of the \n     program, which emphasize private sector development in \n     countries that are making economic reforms in their \n     agricultural economies.\n       We applaud the Conferees decision to include report \n     language informing the Administration that PVOs and other \n     nongovernmental organizations should continue to have access \n     to this program. We are still concerned that the \n     Administration's Food Aid Review concluded that USDA programs \n     should no longer involve PVOs. Before the Administration \n     finalized plans for FY 2003 Food for Progress, we ask that \n     you continue to urge the Administration to assure that PVOs \n     will be allowed to participate in this program.\n       Moreover, we believe it would be very disruptive to remove \n     Food for Progress from the Secretary of Agriculture's \n     authority and shift it to USAID. USDA's Foreign Agricultural \n     Service is well-suited to manage these programs which \n     emphasize private sector and agricultural development in \n     emerging markets. Further, it would take a very long lead \n     time for USAID to establish procedures for administering a \n     new food aid program.\n       One of the most beneficial aspects to the legislation is \n     its emphasis on flexibility for choosing the appropriate \n     commodities and interventions to meet local needs and to \n     require streamlined program management. If the flexibility \n     and streamlining provisions are implemented within the spirit \n     of the legislation, then the result will be more effective \n     programming and the elimination of redundancy and unnecessary \n     paperwork. These changes are particularly important for the \n     PL 480 Title II program, and we pleased that the Conferees \n     required USAID to implement changes within one year and to \n     keep the Congress informed of progress made.\n       The establishment of the International Food for Education \n     and Nutrition program will allow the continuation of pilot \n     programs initiated under the USDA FY 2001 Global Food for \n     Education Initiative. PVOs have a great deal of experience \n     with food for education and look forward to participating in \n     this expanded pilot program. The legislation sets appropriate \n     objectives and focus for the program on young school children \n     and mothers and infants. Further, the objectives of improving \n     educational opportunities and food security, rather than \n     short-term feeding programs, would allow these funds to have \n     an impact beyond the short period in which the commodities \n     are made available.\n       Overall, the legislation makes many improvements in US food \n     aid programs and requires higher tonnage levels for PL 480 \n     Title II and Food for Progress. As organizations that conduct \n     food aid programs overseas, we wish to express our gratitude \n     and support for these changes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ellen S. Levinson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the American Public Human \nServices Association letter, on behalf of food stamp program directors \naround the country, asking we give immediate passage to this \nlegislation, be printed in the Record. I also want to mention other \nletters we received in support of the nutrition title of the farm bill. \nThese include letters from the Food Research and Action Center, \nAmerica's Second Harvest, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, \nthe National Conference of State Legislatures, and the American \nDietetic Association.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   American Public\n\n\n                                   Human Services Association,\n\n                                                      May 2, 2002.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Capitol Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Capitol Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Daschle and Minority Leader Lott: We \n     write concerning the conference report filed yesterday for \n     the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, H.R. \n     2646. The American Public Human Services Association, which \n     represents the nation's public human service administrators, \n     is very pleased with the nutrition title of this bill and \n     urges passage of this legislation.\n       The nutrition title contains significant reforms and \n     improvements in the Food Stamp Program. These reforms are \n     consistent with the principles contained in APHSA's 2001 \n     policy document, Crossroads--New Directions in Social Policy. \n     In Crossroads, we strongly advocated reforms that include \n     simplified eligibility; streamlined application processing; \n     restoration of benefits to legal immigrants; other benefit \n     reforms and updates; a rational resource policy; transitional \n     benefits and other strengthened supports for working \n     families; administrative flexibility; and other changes that \n     will make the program simpler and more accessible. The farm \n     bill has achieved many of these goals and represents a \n     milestone in the efforts to strengthen this vital safety net \n     program.\n       Thank you for your consideration and for your efforts to \n     secure passage of this critical legislation. If you have any \n     questions, please contact me or Elaine Ryan, Director of \n     Government Affairs, at (202) 682-0100.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jerry Friedman,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. This is a letter from the Farm Credit Council asking we \nget this bill passed immediately. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The Farm Credit Council,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing in support of the \n     conference report on The Farm Security and Rural Investment \n     Act of 2002 and to urge its speedy passage in the Senate. The \n     conference report would provide much needed assistance to our \n     nation's farmers, ranchers and rural communities, many of \n     which have been suffering through the longest round of low \n     commodity prices in memory.\n       We appreciate that the conference report is a product of \n     long negotiations and commend you and your colleagues for \n     shaping legislation that will provide a long-lasting safety \n     net for our nation's agricultural producers. With record low \n     commodity prices and sluggish export demand for U.S. farm \n     products, this legislation is critical to ensuring that U.S. \n     farmers and ranchers can continue to supply the world with \n     the safest and most cost efficient food and fiber.\n       As you know, Farm Credit's mission is to maintain and \n     improve the quality of life in rural America and on the farm. \n     This legislation will help Farm Credit continue our mission. \n     We especially want to commend you for\n\n[[Page S3913]]\n\n     your leadership in building a strong rural development \n     component of the bill. Specifically, the Rural Business \n     Investment Company program, we believe, will spur needed \n     equity investment in rural businesses, particularly value-\n     added agricultural businesses. For too long, our rural \n     communities have suffered from a shortage of equity capital. \n     The RBIC program will help alleviate some of this shortage.\n       We also commend you and your colleagues for a sound, \n     constructive credit title. The changes made will help Farm \n     Credit maintain its commitment to provide reliable and \n     competitive credit to agricultural producers, rural \n     businesses and rural communities.\n       Thank you for your leadership in advocating for rural \n     America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kenneth E. Auer,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. This letter is from the Environmental And Energy Study \nInstitute pointing out the important energy title in this bill, asking \nthis bill also be passed as soon as possible. I ask unanimous consent \nit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Environmental and\n\n\n                                       Energy Study Institute,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2002.\n\n           Innovative Energy Title Included in 2002 Farm Bill\n\n       The Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) today \n     congratulates the Senate and House Farm Bill conferees for \n     including an innovative new energy title in the conference \n     report, especially Chairman Tom Harkin and Senator Richard \n     Lugar for their leadership in crafting this important \n     legislation. The title provides $201 million over the life of \n     the bill to assist farmers and ranchers in making energy \n     efficiency improvements and developing their renewable energy \n     resources.\n       ``While this small, bipartisan, non-controversial new title \n     has not gained much media attention, it is perhaps one of the \n     most important provisions in the Farm Bill for the future of \n     American agriculture. The only solution to the current farm \n     crisis is the development of new markets, new uses for crops, \n     and new revenue streams for farmers. Renewable energy can be \n     the new cash crop for the 21st Century,'' said Carol Werner, \n     Executive Director of the Environmental and Energy Study \n     Institute. The energy title:\n       Establishes federal agency purchasing preference for \n     biobased products;\n       Creates a program to educate the public about the benefits \n     of biodiesel (a renewable fuel made from vegetable oils);\n       Provides financial and technical assistance to farmers, \n     ranchers and rural small businesses for the purchase of \n     renewable energy systems and to make on-farm energy \n     efficiency improvements;\n       Extends and funds the Biomass Research and Development Act \n     through 2006; and\n       Establishes new authorized programs to fund energy audits \n     and renewable energy assessments and to establish \n     biorefineries for the production of electricity, fuels, and \n     biobased products.\n       The Farm Bill also opens up existing rural development and \n     ``value-add'' grant and loan programs to renewable energy \n     projects. In addition, it would allow wind energy and \n     bioenergy projects on Conservation Reserve Program lands \n     where compatible with the established conservation goals of \n     the program.\n       ``EESI salutes the members of Congress and the diverse \n     coalition of groups we worked with to make the energy title a \n     reality,'' said Werner. ``Developing our nation's on-farm \n     renewable resources is key to diversifying our energy market, \n     enhancing national security, protecting our environment, and \n     revitalizing rural America by spurring development of new \n     businesses and jobs--truly a `win-win-win' opportunity that \n     is good for American farmers and good for the country.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we have a broad array of producer groups \nsupporting this bill, a broad array of human services organizations \nthat recognize what we have done in this bill for nutrition and for \nfood support and organizations involved in trade and export supporting \nthis bill. We also have support from conservation and wildlife groups \nwho work with producers participating in the conservation programs. \nThose involved in rural economic development broadly support this bill \nfor the work we have done to invest in our rural towns and communities. \nI am not saying every single person or organization supports this bill. \nWhat I am saying is, if you look at the broad array of the groups I \nmentioned, you will see there is broad and deep support for passing \nthis bill and sending it to the President as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Indiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nrequire.\n  Madam President, let me commence by thanking our distinguished \nchairman, Senator Harkin, for his leadership. It is not an easy task to \nbe chairman of a committee during a farm bill consideration, given all \nof the requirements for equity and forethought throughout America. \nEqually, the chairman of the House committee and the ranking member, \nMr. Combest and Mr. Stenholm, have guided a very large committee for \nits consideration and an equally complex conference.\n  Those who have served on the staffs of both the majority and \nminority, in both Houses, have given extraordinary service in the past \nfew weeks. Sometimes they alone, really, have understood how \ncomprehensive and how complex this issue is, and they have been \nextraordinarily helpful to Members, members of the press, and other \nconstituent groups.\n  This bill comes to the floor with an extraordinary amount of work and \ndevotion by persons who have strong motives and strong ideals. Let me \npoint out, as I have during the debate in committee as well as on the \nfloor, very strong achievements have occurred. The chairman has \noutlined a number of these in the areas of conservation and rural \ndevelopment and research and nutrition and energy. In the Senate \ncommittee and in our bill on the floor, Members included those items \nwith a great deal more strength and money than our House colleagues.\n  One of the predicaments from the beginning was that our bill, as it \nleft the Senate floor, as it turned out, cost $6 billion more than the \nlimits. So immediately a scaling back of those items in which there was \nstrong bipartisan support had to occur, and further scaling back \noccurred as we tried to reach a compromise with House colleagues, who \nwere much more focused on the commodity sections of the legislation.\n  Let me outline the arguments I am going to make this morning and then \nreturn to fill in the details that I think would be helpful to Senators \nas they consider their vote on this conference report.\n  I start with the thought that the Senate, in a very real sense, is a \nboard of directors that has governing responsibilities for our country. \nOur responsibilities are broader than a corporate board and deal with \nthe economic and humanitarian concerns of private firms. We really have \na trusteeship regarding the funds, the security, and continuity of our \ncountry. Each of us takes that seriously. And each of our votes on this \nfarm bill conference report we know must withstand the scrutiny of \nhistory. This is not a temporary bill; it is one of many in a long saga \nof developing farm bills, but it will have ramifications for millions \nof Americans.\n  Second, most Senators--perhaps all of us--take very seriously the \nobligations we have as a part of that trusteeship to the Social \nSecurity trust fund and to the Medicare trust fund. From time to time, \nwe have vowed merely to protect the importance of the so-called lockbox \nidea; namely, that these very important social funds and safety net \nfunds for all Americans must be protected.\n  That enters into this consideration because, very clearly, as this \ndebate has continued, the estimates of the Federal deficit for the \nfiscal year in which we are now have grown to $100 billion. Pessimists \nbelieve the deficit for the fiscal year that ends September 30 may in \nfact be more than $100 billion. That means we are having this debate \nafter a time in which there were budgetary assumptions--well over a \nyear ago--that our country would have a surplus this year, in terms of \nour current accounts, and throughout many years. In fact, in the \neuphoria of those days, $3 trillion was often mentioned in discussions \nof a surplus, giving ample room to Social Security reform, Medicare \nreform, and such items as the farm bill. But those times are gone, and \nthe cost of the farm bill still continues to rise with each subsequent \nestimate by the Congressional Budget Office or by others.\n  I mean specifically that even as we completed our work in the Senate \nand believed that on a 10-year basis we were adding $73.5 billion of \nadditional spending, in fact the Senate farm bill cost $6 billion more \nthan we had been allotted by the Senate Budget Committee.\n\n[[Page S3914]]\n\n  Just yesterday--the Congressional Budget Office wrote to our \nchairman, Senator Harkin, indicating that, sadly enough, the conference \nreport that we thought comprised $73.5 billion of spending in addition \nto the current baseline is, as a matter fact, $9.5 billion over what \nthe Budget Committee allocated for additional spending. In short, this \nargument we have been having about holding spending below $73.5 billion \nis now rendered moot by the fact that, based on the most recent CBO \nestimates, we are talking about $82.8 billion.\n  The Congressional Budget Office does not leave us in doubt as to what \nhas occurred. It says essentially that the increase stems primarily \nfrom our current assumptions that prices for many commodities will be \nlower in 2003 and beyond than they had assumed just last year.\n  But, in fact, I will argue in due course that it is very probable \nthat prices will go lower still, that the effect of this farm bill is \nan inevitable vast oversupply of agricultural commodities and lower \nprices. Therefore, given the technical way in which the bill has been \nput together, we are almost bound to have increasing costs for the bill \neach year for the duration of the farm bill.\n  Some would say that should this spending lead to humanitarian aspects \nfor all Americans--better nutrition--better conservation of our natural \nresources, breakthroughs in terms of our energy dilemmas, opportunities \nfor young farmers to come into agriculture--that these are important \nexpenditures. And, as trustees for our national wealth, we have to \nbalance them with Social Security and Medicare.\n  Of course, overhanging all of this discussion, since September 11 and \nour nation being at war, there are vastly increased financial demands \nregarding our national security and homeland defense.\n  But the moneys that are involved in this farm bill do not primarily \ngo to considerations of conservation, nutrition, energy, and \ndevelopment of rural communities. This conference report costs an \nadditional $82.891 billion on a 10 year basis. That is an increase of \nalmost $9.5 billion since we finished the conference report. Of that \n$82.8 billion, $56.7 billion goes to the commodity programs--title I. \nThat is roughly 70 percent of all of the spending. A specific area of \ncommodity programs has almost all the additional money added to it; \nnamely, the so-called program crops. It came out of conference at $41 \nbillion, and it is now about $49.5 billion. That is where the money is, \nand that is where the increases are occurring because of lower price \nestimates and policies that are almost guaranteed to lower the prices \nmore.\n  If this large expenditure for commodity prices were going in some \nequitable way to farmers throughout America this might be somewhat \ntolerable. It is estimated that there are roughly 2 million persons in \nagriculture, using a definition that each entity which has $1,000 of \nagricultural income is certified as a farmer. In our debates, we have \nnoted that perhaps of these 2 million farmers, approximately 150,000 \nproduce as much as 80 percent of the value of all agricultural \ncommodities produced.\n  I am not here to debate about the structure or definition of \nagriculture. But a lot of the rhetoric that has accompanied this bill \nand previous farm bills revolves around trying to save the small family \nfarmer, or even the medium-sized family farmer, or even the very large \nfamily farmer. In fact, two-thirds of the payments under this program \ncrop section--$49.5 billion on a 10-year basis--are going to go to 10 \npercent of farmers who are in the commodity row crop business. That is \na minority of the farmers in America about whom we are talking. Only 40 \npercent of farmers, in fact, are going to be involved in producing \nprogram crops. Sixty percent of farmers are not in that ball game at \nall.\n\n  So when we talk about $49.5 billion going to program crops, we are \ntalking about 40 percent of farmers, and we are talking about the fact \nthat two-thirds of the money goes to 10 percent of the farmers.\n  Any way you look at it, this is a highly concentrated system of \npayments. It is not new. We did not just discover this. The evidence \nwas very clear, as conferees looked at the figures of the past, even as \nthey projected these payments into the future.\n  Therefore--and here there are winners and losers--if you are now a \nlandowner in America, it is highly probable that your land will \nincrease in value. Why? Because with some predictability, as the \nchairman pointed out, with some degree of certainty, you can count upon \nreceiving substantially more money. If you own the land, that will be \nof benefit to your banker if, in fact, you borrowed to put the crop \nin--the banker having some certainty that the collateral, namely, the \nland behind the loan, will be worth more year by year.\n  If you are one of 42 percent of farmers in this country who rent land \nas opposed to owning land, you face a very tough set of circumstances. \nYour rents are very likely to go up each year as the value of the land \ngoes up. Worse still, if you are a young farmer who hopes someday to \nown land, then your prospects of getting the money to do that, and \nbeing able to pay the price, of course, diminishes year by year. And \nthat has been occurring in America. As a result, there are young \nfarmers who are in farm families who are hopeful that with the \nreduction or, hopefully, the repeal of Federal estate taxes, that they \nmight inherit the land. Others who are not in such situations are \nlikely to be out of luck. So as a result, it is predictable that the \naverage age of farmers in this country will continue to increase, as it \nhas been increasing in recent decades. That contributes, in part, to \nthe consolidation in farm ownership.\n  In spite of all of the rhetoric and all of the attempts to talk about \nperpetuating the small family farm, or the medium or even the large \nfarms, the facts are, that consolidation is increasing, and this bill \nwill increase it by leaps and bounds.\n  Some have pointed out--I heard this in the conference committee--we \nare not discussing a welfare bill, we are not talking about everybody's \nplight. We are talking about agricultural policy principally for those \nwho have some power and authority in America now and who have expressed \nthat through farm organizations and commodity groups. Their voices have \nbeen heard, and their views are reflected in this conference report.\n  Word of all of this has gone abroad. Our world trading partners are \nalready outraged. Some members of the conference have already dismissed \nthis and said, essentially, that is simply too bad, what we are talking \nabout are American farmers, not European farmers or South American \nfarmers or Australian or New Zealand farmers. We are talking about \nAmericans who need this money and need it in a hurry. They have simply \nindicated that already we are discriminated against by countries abroad \nand blocked at almost every turn as we try to export more; and, \ntherefore, if the rest of the world is outraged, so be it.\n  I understand that feeling and the frustration that each one of us has \nin seeing the lack of success that our trade negotiators have had in \nrecent years in this administration and the last. That frustration is \nvery great. But it does not hide the fact we have to be successful in \nexporting much more agricultural produce into this world, or the \nsurpluses that we build in this farm bill will come up around our necks \nwith much greater tragedy not only for farm families but, I believe, \nfor the American people as the cost of this bill continues to rise and \nprices continue to fall.\n\n  Perhaps worse still, I believe a pattern has been perpetuated in the \nconsideration of this farm bill that is very serious for this body and \nfor the American people to consider. Essentially, this bill is largely \nan attempt to respond politically to deeply felt economic issues in \nspecific States and districts. It is an attempt, in a very closely \ndivided Congress, to try to think through individual situations of \nSenators and Members of the House, with the thought that party control \nof either body may be a much more important objective than careful \neconomic analysis or maybe even careful stewardship of the funds for \nwhich we are responsible.\n  Therefore, my prediction would be that this farm bill does not bring \nstability, certainty, or finality. The criticism has been that the last \nfarm bill was overtaken by events and, thus, we\n\n[[Page S3915]]\n\ncame to the floor for the last 4 years with supplemental farm \nlegislation, meaning more money, supplemental funds to augment whatever \nwas in the bill. This was followed--usually in the appropriations \ncycle--by our colleagues in the agriculture subcommittee noting \ndisasters around our lands: sometimes weather disasters, sometimes \ndisasters of whatever may have come along the pike. So at least we have \nbecome accustomed to two additional rounds of farm spending annually. \nIt may be that I have misread the situation. If so, the history of the \nnext few years will indicate that. But I would predict, given the \nhighly politically competitive, sensitive aspects of this bill, and the \nfact that the bill is likely, in my judgment, to lead to overwhelming \nsurpluses, continually lower prices, and expressions of agony by \nfarmers who say, ``What are you going to do to raise prices?''--that \ndespite the thought that there is certainty involved in this, the most \ncertain fact is that we are likely to return with proposals to spend \nmore money on farm programs, and principally programs in the commodity \nareas, which are deserving of 70 percent of the attention or more in \nthis farm bill.\n  Meanwhile, the bottom line is that a large transfer payment of money \nin this country will occur if this farm bill reaches conclusion, is \npassed, and signed. The money that Americans hold, on which they are \ntaxed, the money going through the taxation process, goes from a \nprohibitive majority in this country to very few persons in this \ncountry.\n  That is important to note because if, this transfer from the many to \nthe few produced stronger farm prices and prospects for greater trade \nsuccess, perhaps one could argue that this approach is justified. What \nI am arguing is precisely the opposite.\n  This large transfer of money from ordinary taxpayers to a very few \ntaxpayers is going to result in lower prices, overwhelming surpluses, \nand aggravated trade circumstances that are not going to be healthy for \nAmerican agriculture, that will attract fewer young people coming into \nfarming, and mean higher rents for those who do not own land. The value \nof land based upon annual, sometimes biennial appropriations by the \nCongress that has poured more and more money into farming situations \nthat have the greatest loans, that have the greatest output of \nproduction. At some point there may come a year in which the public \nunderstands the farm bill situation and says: Enough. And at that \npoint, land values will come down, as they have again and again in the \nhistory of American agriculture.\n  My experience on the committee spans about 25\\1/2\\ years. I can \nrecall the excitement in my home State of Indiana and throughout the \ncountry as land values rose in the 1970s, in some cases doubling and \ntripling. I can remember likewise the terrible jolt brought by the very \nhigh interest rates in the latter part of the 1970s and early 1980s as \nwell as other factors that led to a decline in those very same land \nvalues by 50 and 60 percent on average and worse in some cases. Now we \nhave noted steady accumulation of values over the course of time.\n  I have had the good fortune, at least with regard to my own land, of \nfarming throughout that period and watching the prices of land go up \nand go down and go up again and so forth, without being hurt in the \nprocess. Most other people in agriculture have not been so fortunate.\n  I would simply say that we are headed for economic disaster if--for \nthe farm bill that we are about to pass in the commodity area--high \nland values are based upon the political competition--as has happened \nin this farm bill.\n  Let me review quickly some arguments that buttress this general \noutline. First of all, we got into the farm bill debate this year with \na very unusual budgetary estimate. By that I mean, in a bipartisan way, \nSenators and members of the administration were deeply excited over the \nfact that our country was beginning to run surpluses; that is, we were \nspending less money than we were taking in. We seemed to have stronger \neconomic growth, much higher productivity in the entire economy.\n  As a result, I remember the President's State of the Union Address in \nwhich he discussed the broad objectives that might be met; namely, a \nstrong safety net under Social Security, allaying the anxieties of \nmiddle-age and young people; even more complex, that Medicare not only \nmight be shored up but prescription drugs for the elderly might come to \npass.\n  There were a whole raft of other reforms that are terribly important \nto a population of this country that grows older, that has more people \nin the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, and that is likely to be our situation \nbecause of medical miracles and better health care. These are very \nexpensive situations involving hundreds of billions of dollars. But \nnevertheless, those were days in which it appeared that those \nobjectives were on the horizon and might be met.\n  We are not debating those issues in this session of the Senate, \nimportant as they are to the American people. Again and again, we are \nreminded, whether it is by the pollsters or by advisers and so forth, \nthat these are the issues the American people want to talk about. We \ncan't talk about them because we are running a deficit. That deficit \ncontinues to grow.\n\n  That was apparent in the early fall when the House of Representatives \npassed the farm bill. One of the reasons suggested for such early \npassage of that farm bill, a full year before the current farm bill \nruns out, was that some Members said: ``Listen up, in the event you do \nnot pass a farm bill quickly, the $73.5 billion allocated by the Budget \nCommittee back in the spring of 2001 is likely to be revised, \ndowngraded to a much smaller number.'' In essence, there will be much \nless money to spend on a farm bill. So, therefore, get on with it. Pass \nit, and pass it quickly to pin down that money.\n  We heard the same argument on the floor of the Senate during the \nlatter part of the fall. Something had changed in the interval that was \nvery fundamental for our country; namely, we were at war. We were \nhaving simultaneously debates, as the Chair will recall, on upgrading \nthe defense budget, on a loan situation to shore up the airlines so we \nwould not lose that service, the first outlines of a huge new category, \nhomeland defense. All of that was occurring as economists pointed out \nmonth by month, we think we may be in a recession.\n  By the time we finished at least last year's session and had our last \ndebate on the farm bill in December, economists said: We are in a \nrecession. We are experiencing recession, in addition to war.\n  I noted at the time we debated the farm bill, whether it was in the \nHouse or in the Senate, an almost Alice-in-Wonderland world prevailed \nin Congress, as if somehow the war, the recession, the problems of \nMedicare and Social Security were for some other group to talk about \nbut not this Congress. We were intent upon talking about additional \nsubsidies for farmers. We already had, as people point out, the so-\ncalled baseline of about $100 billion for agricultural spending over 10 \nyears. We developed a habit of having additional debates and adding to \nthat baseline--now at $73.5 billion over 10 years.\n  That situation has continued. As a matter of fact, the recession and \nthe Government's deficit have become reality. And the assumptions that \nwere made in the farm bill debates of last fall have all led to much \nhigher scoring, which means the Congressional Budget Office finds that \nthings we thought would cost X number of dollars inevitably cost a \nwhole lot more.\n  Prices deteriorated further during the debates, and that led to \nurgency on the part of some who have said: ``Don't stand there, do \nsomething about it--shore up those prices, give greater certainty to \nfarmers.''\n  Madam President, the deficit is not going to go away. As we now \nobserve on the Senate floor, we have yet to discuss a budget for this \nyear, and some suggest we may not. This means that the appropriations \ncommittees will move ahead without at least the mild restraint that a \nbudget resolution might give to our work. In fact, we know that in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill that is coming up for defense \nexpenditures of an emergency nature, we are going to spend a lot more \nmoney. We know that because of the discussion all over the country in \nthe 50 States about the requirements for homeland defense.\n\n[[Page S3916]]\n\n  Now, at some point, some Senator will arise--certainly not in a farm \nbill debate, but in another debate, and point out: ``Whatever happened \nto the Social Security lockbox? How secure is Medicare? What are we \ngoing to do about prescription drugs for the elderly?''\n  What indeed. We are about to spend those moneys--or simply run up a \ndeficit that is huge. That is the message of this conference report to \nthe American people. Whatever may be the desire for some certainty that \na farmer can get almost $2 a bushel for corn, the certainty for all \nother Americans is that we are going to have a larger deficit; that the \nprospects for solving Social Security and Medicare are set back; that \nwe as trustees for the American people either do not understand that \nfarm bills cannot be discussed in a vacuum, divorced from the rest of \nthe world, or that we are so deliberate about our intent to spend this \nmoney, come hell or high water, that we plunge ahead.\n  I mentioned some specifics, and I will not get into the program \ndetails that the distinguished chairman pointed out. Let me tell from \nmy own anecdotal experience as a farm owner--one who participates in \nthe management of my farm through the farm plan, through the \nbookkeeping, the legal work, and the other things that need to be done \nfor a family farm situation. I am aware that, at least in Indiana, if I \nproduced corn in the last few years, I could get $1.89 a bushel for \nevery bushel under the so-called loan deficiency payment. That meant \nsimply if the market price was $1.75, at some point I was going to get \nthe other 14 cents through the loan program. Now, most farmers would \ntestify that $1.89 is a pretty low price. In fact, some have come into \nthe Agriculture Committee and said our average cost per bushel is \ncloser to $2.50 a bushel. But others have mentioned that, in fact, the \nmarginal cost--that is, the next bushel if they were to add it to their \nfarm operation--frequently costs less than $1.89. That is true of many \nof the largest, most efficient farms in the country that have the \nequipment and the capital to do that kind of a job. I am suggesting \nthat even at the current $1.89 loan rate, inadvertently--because most \nof us felt that, at $1.89, this would be a floor--we have set up an \nincentive. Farmers were beginning to produce more and more corn \nbecause, at $1.89, they were guaranteed a price and they went for it. I \ncan understand that and so can you.\n  In this current bill, however, we have said that this is not enough. \nFirst of all, we will set the loan rate up higher, at $1.98 for the \nfirst two years, and $1.95 for the remaining 4 years.\n  Madam President, for each farmer--myself included--attempting to \ncalculate the best interest of whether to use past history with regard \nto acres planted, with regard to yields and the percentage of those who \nwere allowed into this bill, to apply the target price, this is not an \neasy task. Once you make the decision, you are stuck with it.\n\n  My judgment is that a great number of farmers are going to believe \nthey made an error, and that they are going to want relief. Every FSA \noffice, and other groups in the country that help farmers, are going to \nspend a great deal of money trying to figure out what the situation is \nfor these individual farmers long before payments can be made.\n  I do not fault the authors of the bill. In order to keep scaling down \nthe costs, they had to keep making it more and more complex--almost to \nthe point that Senators sitting around the conference table found it \nvery difficult to calculate and to understand precisely what we were \ndoing--quite apart from members who must vote on this conference \nreport, and apart from farmers throughout America who must somehow \nfigure out what it all means.\n  But what most farmers will think it means is that out there somewhere \nis $2 loan rate for a bushel of corn. That is quite an incentive. That \nis well beyond $1.89. As a matter of fact, it was interesting; last \nThursday, in commodity trading in America, the futures prices of almost \nall farm commodities went down, largely under the assumption--which I \nthink is correct--that if this bill passes, the prices of everything \nare going to go down, and stay down. Nevertheless, there was some \nglimmer of hope. If you were a cotton farmer taking a look at this bill \non the date the bill passed the House, for early contracts on cotton, \nit was about 33 cents a pound. Well, the target price for cotton in \nthis bill is 72.4 cents a pound. That is double the current market \nprice.\n  How could this be? How could we have something that is so divorced \nfrom reality in terms of supply and demand in this country and in this \nworld? Well, we can have it because there were sufficient votes on the \nconference committee, and in the House, to put 72.4 there as a target \nprice and, further, on top of that, to offer subsidies to some \nindustries that are attached to cotton.\n  One can say that things have not been going well for cotton farmers \nand for the communities and the infrastructure that support them. I \nunderstand that. One can say the same for rice farmers, wheat farmers, \ncorn farmers, and soybean farmers. In fact, such things have been said \nabout all five of them. But that is where the money is, that is where \nthe trail went from the beginning.\n  I can remember in the Agriculture Committee, the chairman was trying \nto patiently conduct the markup dealing with areas in which both he and \nI believed we were on the threshold of doing some very important \nthings. Some of this, in fact, was accomplished, and still is \npreserved. The chairman wanted to discuss conservation. He has been \ndiscussing that for some time. I share his enthusiasm. He wanted to \ndiscuss energy and young farmer loans and community development. Before \nlong, there got to be a rumbling around the committee table and people \nsaid: When do we get to the money? Where is the money?\n  Well, they were not talking about money for conservation, although \nthe chairman pointed out some might come to farmers who did the right \nthing on their land; and, likewise, there might be real help for most \nof rural America who will not be involved in farm payments. A majority \nof our members, were intent upon targeting the money on commodity \npayments and subsidies.\n  Then the question was, How much does that cost? And, therefore, as \nsome suggested, we were spending too much money and time on \nconservation, on nutrition for the poor, on problems of young farmers.\n  The House of Representatives did not have those problems. They fairly \nrapidly put the money in commodity supports, and filled in as \nafterthoughts, in my judgment, funding for other issues such as \nconservation, etc. I congratulate specifically Congressman Dooley, a \nDemocrat on the conference committee, who held firm to a research \ninitiative that I think is vital and that the chairman of our \ncommittee, Senator Harkin, agrees is important.\n  There were a few valiant spirits. On a bipartisan basis, however, \nclearly those thinking about the other aspects of the farm bill were in \na distinct minority. This bill was guided by how do we fill in the \ncommodities and not do so in a way in which we keep exceeding the $73.5 \nbillion which I kept pointing out simply was not there. The refutation \nto that was by the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, one \nof the conferees, Senator Conrad, who said, ``It was there; it was in \nthe budget a year ago.'' I said all the assumptions are gone, life has \nchanged--war, recession, homeland defense. To which the stalwarts said: \n``It is still there, every penny of it.''\n  How they dismiss the new estimate, this $9.5 billion overage, I do \nnot know. I simply say they will have to keep explaining this as the \ncost of their bill increases year after year, as lower prices, \ninevitable given these new loan rates target prices, just \narithmetically cause it to expand.\n  Therefore, I come back to the initial thought I had of the Senate as \nstewards of our security, of our moneys, of the rights and privileges \nof all Americans, not specific ones that we happen to be discussing on \none day or another.\n  It is a coincidence that on this very day the distinguished chairman \nof the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Senator Levin of \nMichigan, is conducting a hearing in which a number of the witnesses \nare directors of Enron. Enron came up during all of this and so did a \nwhole spate of articles that continue on corporate governance. Business \nWeek has a headline across the front of it: Is Wall Street corrupt?\n  The question is raised: Are our boards of directors of our major \nfirms\n\n[[Page S3917]]\n\nto be trusted, quite apart from the chief executives, who supposedly \nthe boards supervise or oversee, quite apart from all the practices of \nthe firms, whether it be accounting practices, which are dubious, the \ninformation that goes out to ordinary investors in the country about \nwhich many now have severe doubts? We have been having a shakeup in \nthis country of thoughtfulness, of about telling the truth, about what \nis involved in governance.\n  We have that responsibility here. Senators can take the position that \nbecause this new farm bill is so complex, there is no conceivable way I \ncan understand it; therefore, I will rely upon the Agriculture \nCommittee, or at least a few people in the Senate who generally seem to \nhave good judgment on these issues, sort of wise men. Many Senators \ntake that position with regard to other types of legislation from time \nto time.\n  That is not going to be good enough for those who are testifying \nbefore Senator Levin on Enron. The questioners will say: Why didn't you \nknow about strange practices in which assets left the balance sheet, in \nwhich strange loans were made, options were issued, and extraordinary \npayments?\n  The front page of the papers today suggest Enron, in fact, may have \nmanipulated the power situation in California, the allegation of \npersons for some time. Maybe so, maybe not.\n\n  This is serious business. I am simply charging that each one of us \nwho is going to vote on this conference report needs to at least take \nresponsibility. We go into this with eyes wide open. Many people have \npointed out, and I have given a number of speeches at every stage along \nthe way, that the money was not there. It was not there for a long \ntime, even though a fiction exists that $73.5 billion over 10 years was \nthere at one time. Nor is it $82.8 billion over 10 years, $9.5 billion \nmore. It simply was never there.\n  Second, even if we knew it was not there, we could still have said: \nThis has the same urgency as the war, as homeland defense, as \nprescription drugs for the elderly. It is so urgent and the ability we \nhave to transform 2 million farmers and farm families and the \ninfrastructure that supports them in America, is that imperative, if we \nare going to do it anyway with eyes wide open?\n  In fact, it has been clear that the bulk of the money goes to a very \nfew farmers--a very few. That has been clear throughout. This is not a \ngreat humanitarian effort. Granted, the Senate finally got $6.4 billion \nin the nutrition section. We started out in the Senate, in fact, with \nwell over $10 billion.\n  This is a bill that is targeted for farms in America that are large. \nI hope we all understand that because it is not obscure. One of the \nthings that occurred during this debate was that a group called the \nEnvironmental Working Group--and universally despised by many people in \nthe agricultural community--got through the Freedom of Information Act \ninformation about the subsidies paid to farmers all over the country \nduring the years 1996 to 2000; they published this on a Web site--\newg.org. You can find out what your neighbor received. I found out in \nMarion County, IN, that our farm got the 22nd largest amount of \npayments. There are not many farms in Marion County because it is a \nfarm inside the city. The fact is, we now know exactly who got what. \nThis is not obscure.\n  The Senate responded by saying ``no farmer ought to get more than \n$275,000 in any 1 year--not in 10 years, but in 1 year.'' We passed \nthat, but it went the way of all good things in this conference report.\n  I pointed out during the debate on the floor, that in my State of \nIndiana, only six farmers could possibly have exceeded the $275,000 out \nof 50,000 who are receiving payments. Yet the debate on payment limits \nreached such a volatile situation that people claimed the South would \nbe abnormally hit, that a good number of apparently medium-size or even \nlarge farms would be decimated in the process, this even at the time \nthat the target price for cotton was being raised 72 cents plus with a \nmarket price of 33.\n  I hope as Senators we go into this with eyes wide open. We clearly \nmust understand our responsibility. Whether we understand all the \ncomplexities of the program, we know where the money went. We know in \nthis bill where the money will go. We even know it is money we do not \nhave, and if we thought we had it, it has to have a priority with \nregard to Medicare, Social Security, homeland defense, defense of our \ncountry, and some other areas that are very vital in a year in which we \nhave a recession and declining tax revenues.\n  Therefore, Madam President, I respond to my distinguished colleague \nwho says: What if this conference report fails? My own judgment is it \nshould. I will vote against it. I would advocate every Senator who sees \nhis or her responsibility, vote against it.\n\n  We have a farm bill on the books now--sometimes it is dismissed--\nbased on a $100 billion baseline. The distinguished Senators have \npointed out we could have a debate, if Senators desire, for \nsupplemental payments that we have had for a while at much less expense \nthan what we are about to enact, with all the rigid formulas that \ndeliberately stomp down prices and will stomp them down for the \nduration of the entire bill.\n  I hope we understand that. It is a basic principle of supply and \ndemand. This farm bill provides huge incentives to produce more. \nRegarding exports, we can see the outrage of our exporting partners. \nSome Senators have given the impression that: ``We could not care less \nabout them.'' This conference report is a recipe for a great deal of \nhurt and sadness in the wake of the huge transfer payment from the \nmajority of Americans to a very few producers.\n  Finally, in committee deliberations--whether Chairman Harkin was \npresiding or whether I did in the previous 6\\1/2\\ years--we had some \nvery important discussions about agricultural income and the future of \nagriculture in this country. That means a great deal to me, to the \nchairman, and to the members of our committee. Not a single member \naround the table is not committed to trying to think through how we \nmake the process better. Agriculture is a tough business. I have stated \non this floor, that in the last 45 years of my stewardship of Lugar \nfarms, we have had about a 4-percent return on invested capital. Many \nfarmers have said: That sounds too high. In almost any other business \nmeeting, people ask: Why have you stayed at it for 45 years? You could \nhave gotten 6 percent on government bonds or 30 year treasuries without \nthe problems of weather, risk of exports, and so forth.\n  We stay at it because we believe in farming, we believe in the soil, \nwe believe in the life, in the tradition of our families. But we are \ngoing to have to improve our ability to make money. That comes down to \nresearch, development of good practices, proper conservation, a number \nof fundamental issues that are tough properly address, but are \nessential.\n  Unhappily, in this farm bill our farm associations and commodity \ngroups have chosen an easy way out. They have said: Let's not worry \nabout the market--which is always spiraling down. Just pay an \narbitrarily high price for cotton, rice, corn, wheat, or soybeans. The \nAmerican people will fill in the gap.\n  As I have illustrated, the gap will not be filled in that easily \nwithout the loss during the course of this bill of tens of thousands of \nfarms, of the folks who will never get into the game, of those who will \npay more, and of a distortion upward of land values.\n  I ask for Senators to give thoughtful consideration to these \narguments and to a vote to reject the conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I thank the chair of the committee.\n  I thank my colleague and very good friend, Senator Harkin, for his \nwork on this bill. I thank Senator Lugar for his work, especially in \nthe area dealing with nutrition, and for his thoughtful comments.\n  I will start out with just a practical Minnesota point of view and \nthen review broader questions.\n  This coming year, Minnesota farmers will see $1.16 billion in \nassistance from\n\n[[Page S3918]]\n\nthis legislation--an increase of approximately $395 million over the \n1996 farm bill. Over the next 6 years, my State will see about $5.7 \nbillion from this farm bill. Or about a $2 billion increase above the \n1996 farm bill for the State of Minnesota.\n  Now, if I had my way--and I don't think my colleague would disagree \nwith me--I would love to have higher loan rates and rely less on direct \npayments so that farmers would have more leverage to get a better price \nthrough the marketplace.\n  However, the 1996 farm bill or the ``Freedom to Fail'' bill was one \nof the worst things that ever happened to Rural America. I went home \nthe day it was passed, and I said to my wife Sheila: This is the worst \nthing that has happened in the Senate. This year, without a new farm \nbill, the Freedom to Farm bill would give us a 20-percent drop in farm \nincome. All that has kept farmers going is all the AMTA payments and \nthe Government subsidy.\n  If Members are worried about payment limitation, which I am and which \nmy colleague said we will come back to again, this fight is not over. A \nlot of these direct payments to the largest producers have been the \nepitome of subsidy in inverse relationship to need.\n  However I don't make apologies as a Senator from Minnesota for \nsupporting this bill. I would have liked to have had the ban on packer \nownership. I tried to pass that amendment in committee. We lost. Then I \njoined Senators Johnson, Grassley, and Harkin to offer a ban on packer \nownership on the Senate floor. We won. Then it was knocked out in \nconference. Unfortunately the House conferees refused to support it. \nHowever, we will come back to it again.\n  In the Senate, we passed a bipartisan payment limitation amendment. \nThe Senate bill established a reasonable limitation on payments to the \nvery largest farming operation, that would have affected fewer than 100 \nfarms in my State of Minnesota. My colleague from Indiana has spoken to \nthat. It was the right thing to do, and I continue to strongly support \nthose payment limitations. I regret what came out of conference, but \nagain we were blocked by the House conferees. But as Senator Harkin \nsaid, are we going to let a conference committee stop a whole farm bill \nand continue with ``freedom to fail''? There is too much economic pain \nin the countryside.\n  I didn't like what happened with the Environmental Quality Incentives \nProgram. I passed an amendment in the Senate that limited payments to \n$30,000. The amendment, which Senators Harkin and Lugar supported, also \nsaid: Do not let the Smithfields of this world own six, seven, eight \nconfined animal feeding operations and get a big subsidy for every one \nof them. I would preferred that EQIP, an important environmental \nprogram, be targeted to our family farmers. There are certainly some \nmissed opportunities. But, on the positive side, my colleague from Iowa \nalready talked about the dairy front. This is hugely important for my \nState of Minnesota. This is the first really good, positive thing I \nhave seen happen in dairy for over a decade.\n\n  In addition, while I will continue to fight for higher loan rates, in \nthe House bill, the Secretary of Agriculture had the discretion to \nlower loan rates. This administration, the President in his budget \nproposal, went on record in support of lower loan rates. So at least \nthe loan rates go up for the first time in a couple of decades and the \neffective safety net or target price is much higher. I am hoping and \npraying our producers can cash-flow so they will have a future. I think \nthis legislation will give them that opportunity.\n  Again, for this coming year, to talk about $394 million of addition \nassistance to Minnesota agriculture, I make no apologies for that as a \nSenator from Minnesota. Over the next 6 years, an average of $330 \nmillion more of it is targeted to Minnesota family farmers so they can \ncontinue to farm. You better believe I support that.\n  An increase of net farm income averaging $4.5 billion a year for the \nNation--you better believe I support that. It is a darned sight better \nthan ``freedom to fail.''\n  When I hear some of my colleagues say actually supporting family \nfarmers is in competition with the Social Security trust fund or making \nsure we support Medicare, I just have to smile and say: Wait a minute. \nWhere were you when you voted for these Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax cuts \nwhich bleed the economy of trillions of dollars? Where were you?\n  Don't be pitting family farmers in Minnesota against Medicare or \nagainst Social Security. We are not going to let you get away with \nthat, not in this debate and not ever.\n  On the plus side, above and beyond arguments made already, I would \nlike to thank the chairman, Senator Harkin, and I am proud to be part \nof this effort as well. I would also like to thank the other Senate \nconferees--Senators Daschle, Conrad, and Leahy.\n  Senator Harkin's success on this bill is irrefutable. Senator Harkin \nfrom Iowa, with the Conservation Security Program, he led the way. The \nConservation Security Program will provide assistance to producers who \nadopt conservation practices on working lands. I love the Conservation \nReserve Program, which we were able to increase with this bill. I love \nthe Wetlands Reserve Program, which we were also able to increase. I \nlove working with Ducks Unlimited, Pheasants Forever, and other great \nconservation groups. Now, with the Conservation Security Program we \nwill be focusing on land in production with economic incentives for \nfarmers to utilize wise conservation practices. This is win-win-win.\n  I have loved seeing Senator Harkin, the environmental community, and \nthe agricultural community working together. This is really a sea \nchange for the better. It is a huge change for the better and the \nSenator from Iowa deserves all the credit in the world for this.\n  Above and beyond that we have Country of Origin Labeling, that was an \namendment I did in committee. I am proud to pass that amendment. I \nthank the conferees for keeping it in.\n  I know these big conglomerates don't like it because it gives our \nindependent producers a leg up, because these big conglomerates are \nshipping out and shipping in and not relying on our independent \nproducers here in this country. In addition consumers have a right to \nknow what they are eating and where it is from. It is hugely important. \nFrankly--I can say it now because the conference report is over--I am \namazed it is in the conference report, but I thank the Chairman for his \nhelp.\n\n  Then for the first time ever we have an energy title. People are \nexcited in Greater Minnesota, in rural America, about this energy \nsection, because rural America has part of the answer. We talked about \nethanol and biodiesel, but there is another part of this--it's wind, \nsolar, and biomass. In Minnesota it is a no-brainer. We are a cold \nweather State at the other end of the pipeline. We import barrels of \noil. We export $11 billion a year, but we are rich in wind and biomass \nto electricity; we are rich in saved energy, we are rich in clean \ntechnology, small business. This is a marriage ready to be made in \nheaven. This bill moves us down that path--a clean energy path.\n  It is respectful of the environment, keeps capital in the community, \nit is small business intensive, jobs intensive, keeps capital in our \nStates--this is great.\n  The economic development piece is hugely important. I heard my \ncolleague, the Senator from Iowa, talking about telecommunications, \nthat we don't want to be left out. I am so pleased my Rural Telework \nInitiative has been included. Again, it is my work and I am bragging \nabout it, but setting up a telework institute is a major victory for \nrural communities. Information technology companies, have said: Listen, \nwe know the work ethic of people in rural America. We want to make \nsure, if the Federal Government is willing to provide the grants and \nwilling to get this going--then we have a real opportunity for people \nto be able, out of their homes, out of a satellite office, to work for \ncompanies halfway across the world much less halfway across our own \ncountry.\n  People do not have to leave our rural communities. Our young people \ndo not have to leave. I meet so many young people in Greater Minnesota, \nin our rural communities. Basically they are following the advice to \nget ahead, get a good education, which means get out of here. That is \nthe death knell for our communities.\n\n[[Page S3919]]\n\n  One thing they are asking about is whether or not they could stay in \nthe community. Are they going to be able to? If they farm, are they \ngoing to get a decent price, job opportunities, a small business going? \nWill there be good education and health care and environment?\n  And on the job opportunities--I love this--the Rural Telework \nInitiative means people in our rural communities can work for companies \nhalfway across the world. Let's make sure this happens. We don't want \nrural America left behind with this information technology economy. We \ncan be a part of it. I think there is huge bipartisan support for this.\n  Of course I am bragging, but I want my State of Minnesota to be the \nleader. I think we can.\n  My final point: We are going to be back on this fight on packer \nownership. We are going to be back on this fight on payment \nlimitations. I talked to the chairman and he said we are going to do \nadditional investigative work, we are going to do additional public \nhearings. In addition, one of the things I can't wait to do, and albeit \nit is easier said than done, I want to write an antitrust bill looking \nat the food industry.\n  In summary, this conference report perfect, but I do not want to keep \ngoing on with this ``freedom to fail'' bill. I want to see a change. \nThis bill represents that change.\n  I agree with some of the critiquing from some of my colleagues, but \nall in all, this is a step forward for agriculture in Minnesota. It is \na big step forward for the farm structure in Minnesota. It is a big \nstep forward for the environment. It is a big step forward for a better \nenergy policy. It is a big step forward for economic development. It is \na big step forward for people who live in Greater Minnesota and live in \nour rural communities.\n\n  I am willing to come out here and debate and fight for this bill and \nsupport this bill. An finally would like to ask for a commitment from \nSenator Harkin that we are not done with this battle on the reform \nbattle on payment limitations, and on the ban on packer ownership. \nLet's go after some of these conglomerates. It's the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself the time I consume.\n  First, I thank my colleague and friend from Minnesota for all of his \nwork on this farm bill and for being such a valuable member of our \ncommittee. It was the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, who first \noffered the country of origin labeling in committee and won it in \ncommittee and we kept it on the floor. Consumers need to thank Senator \nWellstone for making sure our they will have the right to know where \ntheir meat and fish, fruits and vegetables come from. And for the \nrecord, another great champion of country of origin labeling, and he \nhas been for years, is Senator Johnson. These two have fought \ntirelessly to bring this measure into law.\n  We were able to keep it in there. I think the Senator is right, this \nis going to be a very important provision for our producers in this \ncountry--and for our consumers. So I thank him for that.\n  I thank the Senator also for all his strong work on conservation and \non rural development.\n  Again, I say without any fear of contradiction that the people in \nMinnesota--people in rural America, but I say Minnesota because that is \nthe State the Senator represents--and the people who live in small \ntowns and communities all over rural America have no better fighter for \ntheir interests and no better friend they can count on consistently \nthan Senator Wellstone of Minnesota.\n  When it comes to the things we have in this bill that invest in rural \neconomic development, rural equity funds, broadband access, taking care \nof the backlog on sewer and water grants, and providing for value-added \ngrants for small towns and communities--all of these bear the imprint \nof the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone.\n  I thank him so much for that on behalf of all who are interested in \nthe environment and in conservation.\n  I say to the Senator before he leaves the Chamber that he has this \nSenator's ironclad commitment. As long as I am privileged to chair this \ncommittee, we are not going to give up on the fight to ban packer \nownership of livestock prior to 14 days before slaughter. We are going \nto get to that.\n  We are also going to continue to fight on better payment limitations \nin the future.\n  Again, the farm bill is before us. It represents a very balanced \ncompromise. Again, we need to get this to the President as soon as \npossible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, Senator Grassley has been waiting for an \nhour and a half to speak but knew there wouldn't be time for his \ncomments before the 12:30 recess. So I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the recess he be allowed to be the first speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I would like to yield myself such time as I might have for comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the farm \nbill conference report. The opportunity to write a farm bill comes \nalong rarely in a Senator's career on Capitol Hill. It is an \nopportunity to survey the road and set the course for agriculture and \nrural America, in this case, for the next 6 years. And in the next 6 \nyears, we will stick to that course and walk that road. In studying the \nconference report we have before us today, I fear that we have \nengineered agriculture's road through the swamp. Once in the mud, it is \ngoing to take more than a new farm bill in 6 years to unstick our \nwheels, pull us out and reverse the damage to America's food and fiber \npolicy.\n  We have a bill before us that ramps up the subsidies farmers are \nreceiving to extraordinary amounts. Now, there is nothing wrong with \nhelping our farmers and guaranteeing a safe and sufficient food supply. \nHowever, we should fairly and equitably assist all of agriculture. The \nHouse Agriculture Committee says that this bill will cost $45.1 billion \nof additional spending in the next 6 years. Of that amount, $31.2 \nbillion is going to commodities. The largest portion is for our \ntraditional crops: wheat, corn, cotton and rice. Now in Wyoming, \nagriculture means more than just farming. Producers are farmers, but \nthey are also ranchers. And the ranchers in Wyoming don't see much \nbenefit to this bill.\n  Seventy percent of the new spending is going to commodities. The rest \nof the money is being split between other things the farm bill funds \nlike nutrition programs, research and conservation, all important \nthings. I am pleased with the increase in Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program--EQIP--funds. However, even these are cost share \nfunds and not the direct payments that so many farmers will receive.\n  Ranchers like their independence from government handouts and they \nusually wouldn't mind being overlooked in the farm bill, but they have \na need this year. That need was ignored.\n  There was a proposition that would have given $7,000 to a rancher to \nfeed the best of his breeders from the herd throughout the drought. \nTalk about extreme cases, we put them at zero. Yes, my State is \nentering the third year of a drought. Yes, in response to the disaster \nin my State and other States, I, along with a majority of this body, \nadded an amendment to the farm bill that would have provided $500 \nmillion to livestock producers for feed shortages.\n  That amendment passed 69-30. Compared to the billions spent on \ncommodities, this was a small package of assistance for an industry \nknown for refusing Federal assistance. In this farm bill, commodities \nare the focus of 70 percent of the additional funding. The amount that \nI wanted to devote to livestock producers is a mere 1 percent of the \nadditional spending. One percent! And the assistance was refused in \nthis final conference report.\n  The conference refused ranchers assistance the same month they are \nbeing prevented from moving to their drought-stricken Federal grazing \nallotments. Since they can't feed their livestock, they must consider \nselling their\n\n[[Page S3920]]\n\nherds in a cattle market that is no longer rational and with tax \nbenefits that have run out. The safety net and benefits of the farm \nbill are not being shared with the ranchers.\n  The producers in my State do have a reason to be thankful. Country of \norigin labeling is a part of the bill. This is a victory that I have \nbeen working toward since I entered this body. It is my fervent hope \nthat the forces that rose unsuccessfully to defeat this program in the \nfarm bill do not undermine the provision in the rulemaking process \nduring the initial, 2-year voluntary period.\n  Also, the conference report does not contain the language that would \nhave appropriated my State's water rights. We fought against this \nharmful provision that in my State would have allowed the Federal \nGovernment to usurp State water rights through implementation of the \nEndangered Species Act and done it at bargain basement prices.\n  For ranchers, this bill should be labeled, ``Do no harm, do no good'' \nbecause another provision vital to ranchers in my State was pulled from \nthe final report. The ban on packer ownership of livestock more than 14 \ndays before slaughter was removed. This tells my producers that the \nU.S. Senate is unconcerned about the impacts of market manipulation on \ntheir family ranches. Not only are we unwilling to provide them \nfinancial assistance when they need it in the third year of the worst \ndrought, we won't give them the opportunity to extract their own \nlivelihood from an open and fair market. They are trapped on every \nside. We had an opportunity to assist all of agriculture with this farm \nbill, but we did not take it.\n  I have been discussing the repercussions of this bill on my State. \nThere also are repercussions to our national budget. I previously said \nthat this bill is being quoted as costing $45.1 billion in additional \nspending in the next 6 years. Based on the April 2001 budget resolution \nbaseline, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this bill \nwould increase direct spending by $73.5 billion in budget authority \nthrough 2011. This spending under the fanciest of accounting definitely \naffects the budget parameters.\n  However, this is 2002 and crop prices are lower this year. A CBO \nestimate using an April 2002 baseline would add several billion dollars \nover $73.5 billion in the next 10 years, but the latest numbers are not \nbeing taken seriously. When my staff contacted the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee to ask about the April 2002 CBO cost estimate, they were told \nthat it did not matter. In fact, the committee staff said an estimate \nbased on the April 2002 baseline was an ``academic exercise.'' This is \nreal money. This is not an academic exercise. We cannot use accounting \nto ignore the exorbitant cost of this legislation.\n  For example, I have been discussing the farm bill's additional \nspending. It hasn't been heard often, but this additional spending is \nbeing added to a huge base of current spending on agriculture. When we \nadd the $73.5 billion of additional spending, this bill will cost us \nover $180 billion throughout the next 10 years. Now that is a number \nthat is flung around these halls flippantly, but $180 billion in \nWyoming is a big deal. I think it is probably a big deal all over the \ncountry. It is a big deal to our trading partners, too.\n\n  Madam President, $45.1 billion, $73.5 billion, $180 billion, that is \nmore than a rounding error, that is a gross misstatement of the facts. \nEveryone is entitled to their own opinion, but they are not entitled to \ntheir own facts.\n  There are repercussions to this bill that move beyond our borders to \nother countries and our trading partners. We have a WTO responsibility \nto our trading partners to keep our agricultural subsidies below $19.1 \nbillion. Did any of those numbers I used before sound anywhere near \n$19.1 billion? I don't think so. In the past years, we have stayed far \nbelow that level, but this bill threatens to send us over the top. It \nwill be very difficult to convince our trading partners to lower their \nown subsidy levels--and they are starting to talk about that--and \nincrease our access into their markets if we so boldly ramp up our own \nsubsidy levels. They are watching.\n  The Australian Agriculture Minister, Warren Truss, said our farm bill \n``sends an appalling signal to agricultural trade negotiators seeking a \nfreer and fairer international trading regime.''\n  Canada's Agriculture Minister, Lyle Vanclief, said: ``The farm bill \nis a serious blow to the US's credibility in the current round of World \nTrade Organization negotiations.''\n  Do not fool yourself, they are watching us this moment to see if we \nare really interested in fair trade. What signals are we going to send \nthem?\n  I know what signal we will send if we accept this conference report. \nWe are signaling that the United States really isn't interested in \nincreasing our agricultural exports to other countries. Realizing this, \nI look down the road we have surveyed for agriculture. We are \nsignificantly expanding our commodity subsidies, the great incentive \nfor overproduction. We already know we cannot possibly consume what is \nproduced in this country. With this subsidy increase, we are \nsystematically closing the doors on increased exports. With no outlet \nfor their production, we are condemning our farmers to a downward \nspiral of prices. And countercyclical payments will not stop that \nspiral. In fact, they intensify the spiral.\n  So we have a conference report before us that will eventually harm \nthe farmers it is trying to help and that ignores the plight of the \nother half of agriculture, the livestock producers. And it does it with \nphony and illusive numbers that will appall everyone else.\n  For these reasons, I am voting against this conference report. I urge \nmy fellow Senators to seriously consider whether this is the road they \nwill condemn their farmers and ranchers to for the next 6 years. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote against this bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. Feinstein. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Feinstein are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Harkin). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed beyond \nthe hour of 12:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished chairman of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee for the farm bill before us.\n  As one of seven Senate conferees on the farm bill, I want to make a \nfew initial remarks today about this major effort.\n  First, I urge my colleagues to vote for this conference report. This \nfarm bill helps farmers by providing a safety net; it helps consumers \nby keeping our food costs low; it expands our nutritional safety net to \nthose most in need; it will mean cleaner waterways, better soils, \nprotected open space, and the preservation of family farms; it will \nmake our drinking water safer, improve the environment, and will give \nrural America a strong economic boost.\n  I thank Chairman Harkin who worked day and night on this effort.\n  As I know from being chairman of the committee during the 1990 farm \nbill, it is no easy task to balance the needs of various regions, \nvarious commodities and various other priorities within a fixed budget.\n  Make no mistake--this bill is great for all regions, it represents a \nwell-balanced effort.\n  I enjoyed working with the chairman of the conference, Larry Combest. \nHe was fair and patient, and strove to listen to all sides of an issue \nand to offer helpful ideas as we sought to craft the final product.\n  His chief of staff, Bill O'Connor, has worked on many agriculture \nissues with me. He is one of the finest examples a truly professional \nhill staffer--smart and tough, and able to get the job done for his \nchairman. Also, Lance Kotschwar, the chief counsel for Chairman \nCombest, deserves a great deal of credit.\n  Ranking member Charlie Stenholm, also an expert on farm bill details, \nwas very helpful in trying to work through some of the complex issues. \nHe is well served by his senior agriculture staff, including Vernie \nHubert.\n  I will have more kind words to say about the other body, but I want \nto\n\n[[Page S3921]]\n\nmake a couple points regarding the Senate. I will have more to say at \nanother time about Ed Barron and his team from my office. Many parts of \nthis bill would not be here without them.\n  The Democratic conferees in the Senate consisted of three chairmen of \nmajor committees, and the majority leader. That is quite a batting \nlineup. We had the majority leader and the chairmen of the Agriculture, \nBudget, and Judiciary Committees.\n  Leader Daschle, and his superb staff Bart Chilton, Jonathon Lehman \nand Bev Paul--did a tremendous job trying to balance everyone's \ninterests.\n  Chairman Conrad helped get us the budget to complete a farm bill--and \nprovided the conferees with valuable insights, as did his able staff \naide, Tim Galvin.\n  I will make more extensive remarks later in this debate but I want to \nfocus on a few highlights today.\n  This farm bill provides--for the first time--strong provisions for \nall regions of America.\n  The farm bill provides regional equity--all of America will share in \nits benefits.\n  For example, for the first time, ever, we have a farm bill which \nprovides national counter-cyclical support for dairy farmers. I have \nvoted many times for programs which have helped cotton, rice, wheat or \nsoybean farmers.\n  This farm bill continues to help them--but also creates a national \nsafety net for all family-size dairy farmers--whether they live in \nWisconsin, Minnesota, Mississippi, Louisiana, West Virginia, or \nVermont.\n  I am pleased that we were able to forge bipartisan coalitions in the \nSenate and the House, from many states, and from all regions, in \nworking out this national effort.\n  Dairy farm families work very hard they get up at 5 in the morning \nwhether it is freezing cold, whether it is a Sunday or a Tuesday, \nwhether they are feeling fine or lousy that day, whether it is a \nholiday or not.\n  They need a safety net or America may lose its fresh, local supplies \nof milk.\n  America can not afford to take the risks involved in concentrating \ndairy production in just a couple areas of the country.\n  Snowstorms, floods, earthquakes, or other emergencies could disrupt \ntransportation or production facilities.\n  This farm bill is not just about farmers. It is about assisting rural \ntowns and communities, and families in need.\n  The Food Research and Action Center notes that:\n\n       Given the scope of the hunger and food insecurity problem \n     facing our nation's people, we believe that passage of the \n     Farm Bill Conference Report with its investments in the \n     nutrition safety net must be a very high priority for the . . \n     . Senate.\n\n  They are right. This farm bill provides $6.4 billion to help the \nneediest families. Most Americans do not realize that the food stamp \nprogram is America's largest child nutrition program with the great \nbulk of assistance going to families with children.\n  In her letter of endorsement, Marian Wright Edelman points out that:\n\n       We also strongly support the improvements for working \n     families in the Food Stamp program. Adjusting the standard \n     deduction for cost-of-living increases and family size will \n     help the value of food stamps keep pace with inflation. Many \n     provisions in the nutrition title will make it easier for \n     working families to apply for or renew benefits, and will \n     streamline requirements on states so they will find it easier \n     to serve working families.\n\n  Bob Greenstein, with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities notes \nthat: ``Many of the title's provisions are targeted toward low-income \nfamilies with children, particularly the working poor.''\n  This farm bill includes President Bush's strong proposal to assist \nlegal immigrants who--throughout history--have come to America in \nsearch of a better life, and have made America a stronger nation.\n  The bill also improves America's first line of defense against \nhunger--the Emergency Food Assistance Program.\n  Also, the farm bill saves two great farmers' market programs from the \nchopping block.\n  The WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program, and the much newer \nfarmers' market program for seniors, has provided tremendous incentives \nfor local communities to create local farmers' markets. Anyone shopping \nat these hundreds of new farmers' markets knows that these programs are \ngreat for local farmers, families on WIC, our seniors, and the local \ncommunities.\n  On a international theme--I am very pleased that the farm bill \nincludes $100 million in guaranteed funding for the McGovern-Dole \nGlobal Food for Education Initiative which I authored with Senator \nHarkin and others in the Senate.\n  This initiative taps America's agricultural bounty to become a \ncatalyst for lasting change in many struggling nations.\n  Former Senators McGovern and Dole supported this vision and pointed \nout that this initiative would ``help our farmers while putting food in \nthe stomachs of desperately hungry and malnourished children.''\n  It has been pilot-tested, and enrollment by children, especially \ngirls, has dramatically increased in the poorest areas of the world.\n  Clearly, the events of September 11, make this initiative even more \nimportant.\n  The final bill also contains an unprecedented $1 billion in mandatory \nfunds to assist rural areas in improving the rural infrastructure, \nattracting jobs, and improving high-speed internet access to businesses \nand homes.\n  Our farmers and small businesses will get a boost from $240 million \nincluded for value-added market development grants.\n  Modeled after the successful pilot program currently run by USDA, \nthis program will provide grants up to $500,000 to help develop, \npromote, and market, value-added goods--to help build their wealth and \nexpand their enterprise.\n  The bill reauthorizes important water programs that are critical to \nthe infrastructure of rural America--over $360 million will be \navailable nationally to reduce the backlog of loan and grant \napplications for construction or expansion of water and wastewater \nsystems.\n\n  Even our firefighters and emergency personnel will receive much \nneeded assistance to help provide for critical training in rural areas. \nThese men and women work tirelessly, often on a volunteer basis, to \nprotect our families and our homes. I am pleased that $50 million has \nbeen included to give these forces a boost.\n  Also within the package of conservation programs lies an historic \nincrease in the Farmland Protection Program--which was first pilot-\ntested in Vermont under a provision which I wrote for the 1990 Farm \nBill.\n  Previously funded at only $35 million, and hugely oversubscribed by \ninterested farmers, the Farmland Protection Program will now be funded \nat almost $1 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Since 1996, the FPP program in Vermont has protected more than 80,000 \nacres of the State's most precious farmland. It can preserve farmland \nin many other states under this new farm bill.\n  I am very pleased that this bill sets forth several new initiatives \nfor organic agriculture.\n  This coming October, the National Organic Standards Program will be \nfully implemented and will create tremendous possibilities for organic \nproducers by enhancing national and international market opportunities \nfor organic products.\n  This farm bill makes strides toward providing the information and \nresources needed to continue to grow this industry. For the first time, \ndedicated funding is provided for the organic research and extension \ninitiative, which is also expanded in this bill.\n  In addition, in this farm bill we provided for new organic production \nand market data initiatives and we establish an organic certification \ncost-share program.\n  As more and more farms transition to organic production methods, \nthere is a substantial environmental benefit. In many cases organic \nfarming also provides sustainability to the profession of farming, and \noffers rewards to small farms in particular. In Vermont, the growth of \nthe organic industry means that more farmers will be able to make a \ndecent living doing what they love.\n  The New York, Washington State and Vermont delegations, among others, \nworked to add $94 million to the bill for direct aid for apple growers \nwho have suffered crop losses in recent years. National apple growers, \nincluding several\n\n[[Page S3922]]\n\norchards in Vermont, have sustained losses totaling $1.5 billion over \nthe past five years, including an estimated $500 million during the \npast year.\n  The farm bill also invests $1.3 billion in research to help keep \nAmerica's farmers competitive in world markets.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this farm bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, speaking only as the Senator from \nIowa, thanks the distinguished Senator from Vermont for all his great \nsupport and work on this farm bill.

Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, the manager \nof the bill can request whoever he wants, but I note that Senator Akaka \nwants to be put in the mix.

How long will Senator Domenici speak?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Can we set it up so Senator Conrad follows Senator \nDomenici, whenever that might be?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I amend my request so that Senator Grassley \nwill speak, then Senator Akaka will be recognized, then Senator \nDomenici will be recognized, and then Senator Conrad will be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. I note to my friend from Indiana that Senator Akaka will \nnot spend his time on the bill, but it will be counted against our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today is a very bad day for the family \nfarmer. I am extremely disappointed by the effort that was made by the \nSenate conferees to maintain the provisions that were added to the \nSenate version of the farm bill on the floor.\n  A number of folks have been saying this is a good bill, and I would \nsay those folks are part right, it's a good bill if you are a cotton \nand rice producer. The problem is we don't grow those commodities in my \nstate of Iowa. I plan to vote with the family farmers from Iowa.\n  I'll sum it up in four words to explain why this is a bad bill for \nIowa and why I'm so adamantly opposed to this conference report: \ncompetition, competition, competition, competition.\n  My first reference to competition pertains to competition for grain \nfarmers. The conferees threw out my amendment on reasonable payment \nlimits. In fact I think what they did will cause more harm than good \nbecause the Senate Democrats are calling it legitimate reform. If this \nis their version of ``legitimate reform'' they're not talking to and \nrepresenting the same farmers I'm listening to and representing.\n  The American people recognize the importance of the family farmer to \nour nation, and the need to provide an adequate safety net for family \nfarmers. In recent years, however, assistance to farmers has come under \nincreasing scrutiny. Critics of farm payments have argued that the \nlargest corporate farms reap most of the benefits of these payments. \nThe reality is, 60 percent of the payments have gone to only 10 percent \nof our Nation's farmers.\n  What is more, the payments that have been designed to benefit small \nand medium-sized family farmers have contributed to their own demise. \nUnlimited farm payments have placed upward pressure on land prices and \ncash rents and have contributed to overproduction and lower commodity \nprices, driving many family farmers off the farm.\n  What is really disturbing though it the fact that the conference \nreport failed to address this issue and even worse, the authors are \nacting like they did.\n  This conference report fails to address the use of generic commodity \ncertificates which allow farmers to circumvent payment limitations. The \nsupposed ``reform'' in this bill is worthless due to the lack of \ngeneric certificate reform. In recent years, we have heard news reports \nabout large corporate farms receiving millions of dollars in payments \nthrough the use of generic certificates. Generic certificates do not \nbenefit family farmers but allow the largest farmers to receive \nunlimited payments. This bill will not even make the big corporate \nfarmer blink.\n  The Senate agreed, by an overwhelming vote of 66 to 31, to a \nbipartisan amendment sponsored by Senator Dorgan and me to target \nfederal assistance to small and medium-sized family farmers. The \namendment would have limited direct and counter cyclical payments to \n$75,000. It would have limited gains from marketing loans and LDPs to \n$150,000, and generic certificates would have been included in this \nlimit. No subterfuge. The amendment would also establish a combined \npayment limitation of $275,000 for a husband and wife.\n  This amendment was critical to family farmers in Iowa. I feel \nstrongly the conference report failed Iowa when it failed to \neffectively address the issue of payment limitations. This will do \nnothing to help restore public respectability for federal farm \nassistance by targeting this assistance to those who need it the most.\n  The second reference to competition refers to the independent \nlivestock producer being almost completely ignored in this bill. Iowa's \nindependent livestock producers had clearly made the elimination of \npacker ownership their number one priority. The conferees threw it out.\n  The president of the Iowa Pork Producers had stated: ``It [the packer \nban] was our number one issue for the Farm Bill and we are extremely \ndisappointed it didn't survive.''\n  The Iowa Cattlemen released a statement which read:\n\n       The Iowa Cattlemen's Association Executive Board . . . \n     expressed their frustration with a missed opportunity for new \n     legislation regarding a ban on packer ownership in the final \n     version of the Farm Bill. . . . We believe the Farm Bill \n     Conference committee has overlooked and ignored the family \n     farmer and small livestock producer in failing to adopt \n     appropriate packer limitations.\n\n  It's clear that is what Iowa's livestock producers wanted and this \nfarm bill doesn't deliver. It's that simple!\n  Also, in regard to livestock producers, the bipartisan amendment I \noffered with Senator Feingold which would have eliminated the ability \nof packers to force livestock producers, into mandatory arbitration was \ndropped in conference.\n  We finally had the chance to give farmers an opportunity to choose \nthe best dispute settlement mechanism available for their individual \nsituation. But instead of fixing the problem--and let me remind \neveryone that this passed by an overwhelming vote on the Senate floor--\nwe've locked independent livestock producers into binding arbitration \ninstead of mediation or civil action which could have given family \nfarmers a fighting chance to succeed in a dispute with a packer.\n  Who wants a pat on the back from the packers for dropping these items \nfrom the conference report? I am sure the packers are really proud of \nyou, whoever you are. Don't worry about\n\n[[Page S3923]]\n\nthe independent livestock producers, they won't be around much longer \nanyway.\n  My third reference to competition pertains to competition for funds. \nSpecifically, when the next round of payments will be made.\n  Sticking with current law and passing a supplemental would provide a \nnet benefit to Iowa farmers of approximately $662 million in the first \nsix months if the supplemental was only equal to the levels of support \noffered within the last supplemental package, according to the Center \nfor Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University. If a \nfarmer has the ability to pay down his debt earlier in a loan cycle \nthan later in that same cycle that money goes much further for the \nindividual producer, everyone knows this. Instead, under the bill as \ncurrently constructed, Iowa producers will be waiting till sometime \nbetween December and March for the first round of sizable payments. It \nwon't be this fall as it has been for the last three years.\n  I have read in the press that some Members of this body are trying to \nclaim that this is beneficial to farmers in short term. I guess the \nquestion is what's ``short term'' to those folks, but the better \nquestion is, what's short term to Iowa's family farmers?\n  In the next 6 months. I think it would be fair to say that Iowa \nfarmers are concerned how they will be treated under this program for \nthe next six months. The benefits to Iowa farmers from implementation \nof the new farm bill in the current fiscal year would include increased \nLDP rates for corn because of the increased corn loan rate. Nationally, \ncorn farmers received less than 14 percent of a crop year's LDP payment \nin the same fiscal year since 1997. For Iowa, the amount is clearly \nless than one percent. This means that Iowa farmers would gain \nessentially nothing from the higher loan rates in the current fiscal \nyear.\n  Iowa farmers would find that their soybean LDP rates would decrease \nunder the new farm bill because of lower soybean loan rate. But for \nsoybeans, less than 5 percent of LDPs were collected in the fiscal year \nas the crop year. Thus, Iowa farmers would not lose much at all from \nimplementation of the lower rates in the current fiscal year.\n  So where is the benefit to this approach? Is there a payment hidden \nin the conference report I have not seen yet? I guess that those in \nfavor of this bill could say that there is a fixed payment available to \nfamily farmers that will hopefully be made available in October, but \nthen you have to remember to reduce that payment by the amount a family \nfarmer has already received this year. In Iowa, that means your net \nbenefit for the fixed payment is 1.9 cents per bushel of corn.\n  How can anyone defend 1.9 cents as a substantive fixed payment? How \ndoes that compare with the Robert's supplemental? Well, he had 33.4 \ncents per bushel available for corngrowers in Iowa, and there was no \nslight of hand to force you to reduce it, or pressure to manipulate \nyour reportable base, to improve your payment. Does anyone actually \nthink 1.9 cents is better for family farmers than 33.4 cents per \nbushel?\n  My fourth reference to competition is trade, specifically trade \ncompliance. I offered an amendment during the Senate floor debate that \nwould have reinforced the importance of ensuring that the farm bill \nwhich passes the Senate complied with our Uruguay Round trade \ncommitments, and the conferees stripped it out.\n  As I have said before, our family farmers depend on foreign markets, \nexporting about one-quarter to one-third of the farm products they \nproduce. For the past 25 years, the U.S. has exported far more \nagricultural goods than it has imported.\n  The Uruguay Round negotiations improved conditions of market access \nfor American farmers. For the first time, the agreement reached during \nthe Uruguay Round capped the level of trade-distorting support that WTO \nmembers can provide to producers. Worldwide, agricultural tariffs were \nreduced by an average of 36 percent over a 6-year period. The United \nStates agreed to reduce its own amber box spending to $19.1 billion per \nyear.\n  Because agricultural domestic support commitments are now ``bound'' \nunder WTO rules, the United States and its trading partners can be \nsubjected to harmful trade retaliation if they exceed their WTO \nlimitations.\n  If a WTO complaint were brought against the United States for \nexceeding its domestic support commitments, it is possible that many \ncountries could become complainants in the cases and allege injury.\n  If the U.S. were found in violation of our trade obligations, we \nwould be expected to change our current farm program, `midstream'. If \nwe were not able to, the complaining countries would receive \nauthorization to retaliate by raising duties on U.S. goods.\n  Our agricultural goods would likely be the first target of \nretaliation as the products chosen for retaliation are often the most \nsuccessful exports.\n  Retaliation by our trading partners would cut our exports, forcing \nsurplus commodities onto the domestic market. An increased domestic \nsurplus would place downward pressure on domestic prices, increasing \nthe need for additional assistance. At the same time, we would not be \nallowed to provide our family farmers any support. The result is that \nthe conference report would fail family farmers when their need is the \ngreatest.\n  That is why I offered my amendment to provide reassurance that we \nwould not have to cut the legs out from under our nation's family \nfarmers if the funding provided by this legislation exceeds our Uruguay \nRound commitments. In the event that a provision of this farm bill \nwould have threatened to break our amber box caps, as determined by the \nSecretary of Agriculture, my amendment would have sunset the offending \nprovisions after 18 months.\n  In order to continue funding at a level that is consistent with our \nUruguay Round commitments, Congress would have been required to pass a \nreadjustment resolution until the offending provision could be \nrewritten by Congress. Unlike the conference report, which gives the \nSecretary of Agriculture sweeping authority to reduce or suspend \npayments, this amendment would ensure that farmers can count on the \nassistance they need until Congress agrees that we will potentially \nviolate our trade commitments.\n  In addition, USDA would have determined what program played a \nsignificant role in potentially violating our trade agreements and \nwithin 18 months that program would have been suspended, hopefully to \nbe reformed in a trade compliant fashion.\n  But now, we wrote a new farm bill that will undercut our negotiators \nbefore the negotiations even get off the ground.\n  That is because this farm bill we are discussing today, has, \naccording to its own supporters, a 19 percent chance of violating our \nUruguay Round Amber Box commitments. We have never violated those \ncommitments. And we have certainly never publicly announced an \nintention to violate those commitments. To violate those commitments \nnow, or to threaten to do so, is a tremendous shift in long-standing \nUnited States agricultural trade policy.\n  Some of my colleagues might claim that this bill has improved from a \n1 in 3 chance to a 1 in 5 chance of sabotaging our rural economy, and \nthey might even be proud of the improvement. But even these dismal \npercentages get worse when we learn the details.\n  FAPRI--The Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute--used their \nexisting 2001 baseline to determine this percentage. By FAPRI's own \nadmission, the 2001 baseline does not take into account the full impact \nwe are seeing in the market of many commodity prices trending downward. \nFAPRI qualified their analysis by explaining:\n  Over the next few weeks, FAPRI intends to conduct an updated analysis \nof the bill that will incorporate more current market information. The \nnew analysis will result in different estimates of prices, production, \nGovernment costs, farm income, and other indicators. Without prejudging \nresults of the forthcoming analysis, please note that market prices for \nseveral commodities are currently lower than FAPRI had projected in its \n2001 baseline.\n  So get ready folks, when the 2002 baseline is completed and the \nanalysis is run later this month we could very\n\n[[Page S3924]]\n\nlikely see a huge swing in the wrong direction. The percentage of non-\ncompliance could very possibly be upward of 35-40 percent. We will not \nhave solid figures until the next baseline is completed though because \nof the enormous impact the LDPs will have on 2002 projections.\n  We seem to be rushing to milk the Federal cow before anyone checks \nthe breed, or much less the gender of the cattle. This is not how you \nestablish prudent, or even satisfactory policy, but it doesn't seem \nlike many Senators care about that right now.\n  We have achieved a great deal at the negotiating table in the past 50 \nyears because we have credibility. Our trading partners respect the \nfact that we stick to our guns and do what we say we are going to do. \nIn turn, we expect them to do the same.\n  But passing a non-trade compliant farm bill seriously damages our \ncredibility.\n  And it does so right at the time when we are poised to launch new, \ncomprehensive global trade talks largely built around our own \nagricultural negotiating objectives.\n  I cannot think of a more effective way to undermine everything we \nhave worked for, and everything we hope to accomplish at the \nnegotiating table during the next 3 years, than to pass a farm bill \nthat we know might break our WTO obligations.\n  The advocates of this approach might say, well, it is only a one-in-\nfive chance that we will not be trade-compliant under this farm bill.\n  But would we accept that argument in discussing, say, education \npolicy, and go forward with an education program that had a one-in-five \nchance of failure? Or a defense program?\n  I do not think we would. And it does not make any more sense to go \nforward on that basis here, especially if those odds might actually be \nmuch worse than we realize.\n  Competition is and for a very long time will be the number one issue \nfor family farmers. We should all think back to Secretary Veneman's \nconfirmation hearing. During the question and answer period before the \nSenate Agriculture Committee she said something that a few of my \ncolleagues have seemingly already forgotten. She said that the one \ntopic she had heard the most about while visiting Senators and House \nmembers was the issue of competition. It was the most mentioned issue \nand the issue that we generating the most concern in rural America.\n  What did we leave out of this conference report? Competition, \ncompetition, competition, competition. The glaring lack of strong \nprovisions regarding competition is why The Organization for \nCompetitive Markets, and the Center for Rural Affairs oppose this \nlegislation. These groups supported the legislation when family-farmer-\nfriendly provisions were added on the Senate floor, but they are now \nopposed because they support family farmers and independent livestock \nproducers and this bill does not do that.\n  As I look at the conference report before us I have to admit I have \nlost a little bit of faith in the process. We put a good bill together \non the Senate floor. It came out of committee with ridiculously high \npayment limits, nothing on livestock competition, a complete disregard \nfor trade compliance, deficiencies in the nutrition title, etc.\n  But on the floor of the Senate we all worked together to make it a \nbill that was acceptable, and I would say that bill was very good for \nIowa's family farmers because it had in it the issues Iowans wanted us \nto address, specifically payment limits and packer ownership. This bill \ndoes not do what Iowans wanted it to do, plain and simple. It skipped \nIowa's top priorities.\n  In addition, let's not forget about the administrative nightmare that \nthis conference report will create. Everyone should be well aware of \nhow difficult implementation will be for USDA. Don't blame the Bush \nadministration if payments don't get out time. I hope that the Senators \nthat are more interested in immediate implementation, than passing a \nsupplemental are not going to be disingenuous in the future and attack \nthe administration because implementation takes awhile to accomplish.\n  Let there be no question that if there is fault to assign regarding \nimplementation it lies with the authors of the bill, not the \nbureaucrats required to decipher the intent of the authors. This will \nnot be an easy task.\n  So I hope that Senator Daschle's comments yesterday in the Daily \nMonitor ring true. He was quoted as saying, ``you're not going to see \nthese disastrous supplemental requests in the future.'' But then I \nwonder what ``future'' means because the next sentence reads, ``We'd \nstill like to get one for 2001, but in the future you're not going to \nsee them.''\n  The thing I just cannot understand is why, if you just had the money \nand the willingness of Republicans to write a supplemental that would \nbe beneficial to family farmers, why did you forsake the opportunity to \nput money in farmers hands right now, and trade that benefit for \nimmediate implementation? It's a risk that family farmers should not \nhave to take.\n  To conclude, I would agree with those that claim this is a historic \nfarm bill, but in my opinion it might be historic for all the wrong \nreasons. We are losing support in the urban sectors for future farm \nbills by not reforming the existing abuses that have been made \nabundantly clear by media. Even farmers want us to fix the payment \nproblems by implementing reasonable, legitimate payment limits, but \ninstead the conferees ignored this issue.\n  This bill will do nothing to restore integrity to the programs, \nreduce pressure on rents and land prices, dampen overproduction, and \nhelp maintain family farms and the culture that surrounds our rural \ncommunities, isn't that our goal? Why is this conference report ``good \nenough'' to some when it does very little for our family farmers?\n  Has anyone read the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street \nJournal, or the San Francisco Chronicle? These are urban newspapers and \nthey are up in arms over this farm bill. What happens if urban folks \ndecide they cannot hold their noses regarding the subsidy abuse down \nthe road?\n  But, I guess I am assuming there will be a rural community to serve \nin 6 years. There is a possibility we will not have a rural community \nto serve due to the consolidation, concentration, increased land \nprices, and cash rents.\n  When I was in the well for the final vote I told my colleague I was \ngoing to support the Senate bill and I did. I said if those provisions \nwere maintained, the provisions Iowa's family farmers wanted in this \nbill, I would support the conference report. But those provisions are \nnot in this conference report, so I will not support it.\n  This bill does not accomplish Iowa family farmers' highest priorities \nso I am opposing the conference report. Anyone representing Iowa's \ninterests should. We can do better, we must do better if we want family \nfarmers and independent livestock producers to survive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Akaka pertaining to the submission of S. Res. 262 \nare located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are now debating the farm bill \nconference report. I have some serious concerns about the policies \nembodied in this conference report. I will speak to those concerns \nshortly, but, first, I want to address another concern. My concern is, \nwhere is the budget? Where is the budget that we will use to judge not \nonly whether we can afford this farm bill, but other legislation that \nmight come before the Senate during the remainder of Congress?\n  Interestingly, the tortuous path that this farm bill has taken to get \nto a final vote tomorrow began exactly 1 year ago this week when we \nadopted the fiscal year 2002 budget resolution. That budget resolution \nwas adopted prior to us knowing that we had an economic downturn and \nobviously, prior to the September 11 attacks on the United States of \nAmerica.\n  At the time the budget resolution was adopted, the projections \nindicated there would be a general budget surplus of $5.6 trillion over \nthe next decade, and that after the tax cuts there would still be a \nvery large surplus. We now know that the economic downturn, increased \nemergency defense, homeland security spending that followed the \nSeptember 11 attacks, and\n\n[[Page S3925]]\n\nthe Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act enacted last winter to \nassist workers impacted by the economic slowdown, have all combined to \nlower the general surplus outlook to about $1.7 trillion over a \ncomparable 10-year period.\n  This farm bill agreement that is before us today seems to be \nblissfully ignorant of the events over the last year. It embodies \ncommodity policies that return us to business as usual, high subsidies, \ndistorting trade provisions, and increasing Government costs.\n  Those who do not follow the intricacies of the budget process might \nsay: This makes no sense. Don't we have a budget by which to judge this \nlegislation?\n  Yes, the one we adopted 1 year ago this week. It is not the budget \nresolution for the year 2003; it is the budget resolution for 2002, \nadopted when Republicans were still in control of the Senate by one \nvote. Yes, that budget provided for increases in agricultural spending \nand other spending, such as prescription drugs. Specifically, that \nbudget that authorized the chairman of the Budget Committee to allocate \n$73.5 billion to the Agriculture Committee, so long as it did not come \nout of the Social Security or Medicare trust fund.\n  Can anybody stand on the floor and honestly say that the expenditures \nin this farm bill will not come out of the Social Security trust fund \nor the Medicare trust fund? I have not been raising this issue, but it \nis interesting that the current chairman of the Budget Committee, who \nusually raises this issue while trying to ensure we do not spend the \nMedicare and Social Security trust fund is not raising it now.\n  And now we see the bigger, more serious problem. The problem will not \nbe just with this farm bill; it will be with the other spending and tax \nlegislation we consider in the remaining days of this Congress. These \nmeasures will be judged against an outdated budget plan, one adopted \nlast year when the Republicans were in control of this body, not one \nfor current allocations and current needs, which has not been adopted \non the floor of the Senate as of this date.\n  The question is asked again, Where is the budget? Where is the budget \nagainst which we are going to judge this farm bill and other \nlegislation that I have just iterated that are certainly going to come \nbefore the Senate?\n  Until we agree to a new updated budget that reflects the dramatic \nchanges that have occurred over the last 12 to 18 months, the old \nbudget, the one I was responsible for getting adopted by the Senate and \nconferenced--that budget remains in effect until replaced by an updated \nbudget. And until that time, any Budget Act points of order, any \nallocations to authorizing committees, any reserve fund releases, such \nas prescription drug spending or health insurance for the uninsured, \nwill be judged not by what is reality today but by what we thought it \nwould be before the economic downturn and before the terrorist attacks \non the United States just prior to mid-September.\n  Some may wonder, why have a budget resolution? I do not have to \nwonder. I only have to see what is happening on the floor of the \nSenate. Anyone can predict what is going to happen in the next few \nmonths--not years, the next few months--in fact, some of which has \nalready happened prior to taking up this conference report on \nagriculture.\n  We cannot, and we should not, legislate, in my opinion, without a \nbudget blueprint. Every year, since the Budget Act became law in 1974, \nthe Senate has adopted a budget resolution, as required, and in some \nyears more than one. In some years we missed the deadline, but we \nalways adopted a budget resolution in the Senate.\n  Only once in the nearly 28-year history of the act has the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate failed to conference their budget \nresolutions. In 1998, the year following the balanced budget agreement \nof 1997, Chairman John Kasich and I were unable to bridge the \ndifferences in the two resolutions. Rather amazing--we were both \nRepublicans, and that was the one year we could not bridge the \ndifferences. All other years, regardless of the makeup of the two \nbodies, we did arrive at a conclusion.\n  Let me repeat, the Senate has passed a budget resolution every year. \nThere was one time when we did not have a conferenced budget blueprint, \nand we agreed here in the Senate to follow the Senate-passed resolution \nas our blueprint for spending and taxing. But, we had what would amount \nto a budget by concurrence of the Senate.\n  I have been on that Budget Committee for 27 years. I was not a member \nin the first organizing meeting in 1974, when Senator Muskie was \nchairman, though there was a Senator Peter Dominick who was Senator \nMuskie's ranking member that year, and some historians get me confused \nwith him. In those 27 years, my colleagues have honored me by allowing \nme to serve as committee chairman for 12\\1/2\\ years and as its ranking \nmember for 9.\n  In all those years, we adopted a Senate budget resolution. It was not \neasy. Sometimes I thought we would fail, but we stuck with it, and many \ntimes on a bipartisan basis we prevailed and the blueprint to guide \nfiscal policy was achieved. A budget resolution takes care of many \nthings automatically and with precision. Right now there is no \nprecision, there is no decision, and we are flying essentially by the \nseat of our pants on many issues.\n  Every year under the leadership of Chairman Muskie, Chairman Chiles, \nand Chairman Sasser, the Senate has adopted a budget resolution. Today \nthe House of Representatives has passed a budget resolution for next \nyear. Today the President of the United States has submitted a budget \nto Congress for next year. Today we do not have a budget in the Senate.\n  Beginning today, we legislate a major spending bill, a farm bill, \nthat is based on a budget I admittedly helped craft last year, but also \nI freely admit is outdated and needs to be revised. It is time that be \ndone. It is obvious that the Senate thinks it should be done. I truly \ndoubt that we have been as omniscient as one may think. Had we been \nable to foresee the events of last year when we were crafting that \nbudget, we would not have allocated the level of spending we did to the \nfarm bill; of that I am almost certain. That is why we need a new \nbudget, and that is why this decision we make tomorrow can send a \nsignal to the country and our trading partners throughout the world \nthat we know it is not business as usual. We need to craft a new budget \nfor these new times.\n  For just a few moments, I will talk about a couple of New Mexico-\nspecific concerns. In addition to my objections to this conference \nreport on budget and trade grounds, I must note that this legislation \nis especially harmful to one of the most important parts of the \nagricultural economy of my State of New Mexico--dairy farmers. New \nMexico's milk producers are hurt more by this bill's provisions in my \nState than any other State in the Union. Our producers will lose \nbetween $4 and $5 million a year compared to current law. And that is a \nconservative estimate.\n  Just today, there is a FAPRI estimate that indicates the losses would \nbe as high as $51.2 million over the life of this program. Regardless, \nthis means that at least $30,000 per dairy farm in New Mexico will be \nlost because of this bill. New Mexico, which has climbed to the seventh \nlargest milk-producing State in the Union, will see minimum losses over \nthe life of the program of at least $125,000 per farm, and most will \nlikely suffer larger losses.\n\n  My dairy farmers want a market-driven system. They can compete on \nquality and efficiency with any other dairy farming group in this \nNation. If we just let them do their job under a free market. These \nproducers will supply plenty of milk and it will be of the highest \nquality.\n  My dairy producers are opposed to direct payments. They also oppose \nthe caps in this bill. And they are punished because this legislation \ncontains both--direct payments and caps. And neither is predicated upon \nlarge dairy farms but, rather, is predicated upon the small milk farms. \nMost of our farms are 1,500 head or more and are becoming more \nefficient every year. They welcome competition from anywhere. They are \nefficient. They are innovative. They do great things. Yet, they are \npunished. We come along and say this is not the American way for the \nfarm bill. We are going to punish you because you are efficient, \nbecause you produce, because you are highly innovative.\n  Instead of saying: You are going to get as good a deal as you \ndeserve, as\n\n[[Page S3926]]\n\nfine a return as you deserve in the American market, we are going to \ntell you what you get. In this instance, we are going to take away from \nyou between $4 and $5 million a year, perhaps as much as $125,000 per \nfarm during the time this bill exists.\n  The dairy industry in my State--and we are a small State in terms of \nbusiness--has revitalized large parts of the New Mexico economy. Nearly \n4,000 New Mexicans earn a living directly from dairy, with payrolls in \nexcess of $90 million a year. New Mexico's dairies and producers spend \nnearly $400 million annually for labor and feed. For our State, which \nlags near the bottom of per capita income statistics, this conference \nreport is a direct attack. I cannot support such a conference report. I \nwill not.\n  I know there are predictions of how bad it would be if this did not \npass. I have studied it all. I think I know as much as anyone here \nabout it. It would be a great signal if it did not pass. Then we could \nproduce a budget and decide how much money should be put in for the \nagricultural community under a budget that is current.\n  This wrongheaded agricultural policy promoted by this conference \nreport is especially tragic in light of the real progress that was made \nin this bill in the area of nutrition. Many do not know that this bill \ncalled agriculture is also the principal nutrition legislation for our \ncountry. The bill retains the Domenici-Durbin amendment to restore food \nstamp benefits to eligible legal immigrants who have been in our \ncountry for 5 years. This policy will help feed an estimated 360,000 \npeople per month.\n  In addition, the bill simplifies and streamlines the application \nprocess for food stamps. It increases funding for the Emergency Food \nAssistance Program and makes it easier for nonprofit participation in \nthe Commodity Supplemental Food Program to feed the elderly and small \nchildren. In total, the legislation provides for $6.4 billion in food \nstamps and other nutrition programs. This amount falls short of the \n$8.9 billion provided in the Senate-passed version of the farm bill. At \nleast we are making some progress toward eliminating involuntary hunger \nin America.\n\n  So this Senator finds himself in an unusual position of voting no on \nthis farm bill. The good things in nutrition fail to outweigh the bad \nagricultural policy positions envisioned by this bill. I will remind my \ncolleagues that we have spent an enormous amount of money in the last 2 \nyears on agriculture with the ``emergency'' funding for $27.3 billion, \nas well as $5.5 billion in new agriculture commodity support payments \njust last July.\n  I am fully aware of that. I understand the threats--veiled or \notherwise--that if we don't get this bill now, we will have a \nrepetition of what I have described in the last paragraph of my \ncomments. I don't believe so. I believe we understand clearly where we \nare, and I do believe that now is the time to say no to legislation \nthat clearly doesn't fit a budget--at least we don't know that it \ndoes--and has the kind of policies adopted that I think are as \ncounterproductive as they can be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have been listening to the Senator from \nNew Mexico, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, former chairman \nof the Budget Committee, and a very valued member of that committee. \nBut I must say I disagree with his conclusions about this farm bill. \nLet me just enumerate the reasons.\n  First of all, while it is true a new budget resolution has not yet \npassed, it is also true under the rules of this body that the previous \nbudget resolution guides our actions until the new budget resolution is \npassed. The budget resolution under which we are operating provides for \nthe amount of money that is in this farm bill. This farm bill is \nentirely within the budget requirements under which we are operating.\n  No. 2, every budget that has been presented for the next year \nincludes this same amount of money. The budget the President has \npresented, the budget the House presented, the budget that has passed \nthe Senate Budget Committee--each and every one of them has the same \namount of money for a new farm bill that was in last year's budget \nresolution. So the question of what the budget resources are is not in \ndoubt.\n  The fact is, the Congressional Budget Office has provided an estimate \nof cost. That is always the case when the Senate and the House are \nconsidering legislation. They do an estimate of the cost. We operate \nunder that cost until the job is finished. We don't change the \nestimates in the middle of the effort. We don't change the rules in the \nmiddle of the game. They made an estimate, and we are living with it \ntoday. We don't change estimates in the middle of a legislative agenda \nbecause to do so would make the work of Congress virtually impossible. \nIf we changed the estimates every time the Congressional Budget Office \nmade a new estimate, the committees would never know what resources \nthey had to deal with. So this is a longstanding practice of the Senate \nand the Senate Budget Committee.\n\n  Once the action has been taken in the Senate and in the House, as it \nhas been, we don't change the estimates in the conference committee. \nThat would create chaos. So the fact is, the estimates we were \noperating under when the bill was considered in the House, and then \nconsidered in the Senate, were the same estimates used in the \nconference committee, the same estimates being used today, and the \nreason there is no budget point of order against the farm bill that is \nbeing considered.\n  Those are the facts. These budget estimates that were done by the \nCongressional Budget Office and were used by the Senate and House as \nthey worked up a farm bill were made in good faith. Now, with later \ninformation, they may alter them somewhat, but we have to follow the \nassumptions that were made at the time the legislation was considered. \nWe certainly don't change the estimates in the middle of legislative \nactivity or in the conference committee to resolve the differences \nbetween the Senate and House farm bills.\n  Let's lay the budget issue to rest. There is no budget point of order \nagainst this bill. This bill is in full compliance with the \nrequirements of the Budget Act. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, why is this farm bill necessary? I read the eastern press, and \nthey are panning this bill almost on a daily basis. I submit to you \nthat many of these newspaper writers, editorial writers, have never set \nfoot in my State. They clearly have not paid much attention to what our \nfarmers are up against in this international environment. We are not an \nisland unto ourselves in the United States. We are up against very \ntough, determined competition from countries all around the world that \nare doing much more for their producers than we are doing for ours. Let \nme repeat that. Our major competitors are doing much more for their \nproducers than we are doing for ours. To abandon our producers is to \nput them on an unlevel playing field. To create a circumstance in which \nthey cannot fairly compete would be a profound mistake for this \ncountry, for our producers and, ultimately, for our economy.\n  Let me just direct people's attention to this chart, which says it \nvery clearly and very well. Our major competitors are the Europeans. \nTheir supports are far higher than U.S. supports for farmers. The most \nrecent data available show the average support level in Europe is $313 \nper acre. That is how much assistance the Europeans give their \nfarmers--$313 an acre. Here is the comparable level of support in the \nUnited States: $38 an acre. It is $38 an acre in the United States and \n$313 an acre in Europe.\n  It is no wonder there are hard times in rural America. It is no \nwonder there are hard times up and down the main streets of every rural \ncity and town. It is no wonder if you go to the European countryside, \nit is prosperous. Why? Because our European friends have decided they \nare willing to put out a lot of money to have a prosperous rural \ncountryside so everybody doesn't go to town. They don't want everybody \nto go to town. They want people out across the land. What else? They \nwant to have an assured source of supply. The Europeans have been \nhungry twice. They never want to be hungry again, and they are willing \nto pay to make certain the productive capacity is out across their \ncountryside and to make certain they are never hungry again.\n\n[[Page S3927]]\n\n  It doesn't end there. These are not Kent Conrad's numbers or Budget \nCommittee numbers; these are from the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development's analyses of the different support levels \nin different parts of the world. These are the numbers of the official \nscorekeepers internationally. They are the ones who do the \ndeterminations of actual support in various regions of the world.\n  As I have indicated, it doesn't end there because if we look at \nexport support, export subsidies, we find the European Union floods the \nworld with agricultural export subsidies. This pie shows the amount of \nexport support in the world. The blue part of this pie is Europe's \nshare. Europe accounts for 84 percent of all the world's agricultural \nexport subsidy--84 percent.\n  Here is the United States' share: Less than 3 percent. Less than 3 \npercent of the United States; 84 percent in Europe. They are outgunning \nus almost 30 to 1. That is what our competitors are up to.\n  By the way, they have gone from being the biggest importing region in \nthe world to being nearly the biggest exporting region in the world in \n20 years, and they did it the old-fashioned way: They bought the \nmarkets. They bought markets that were traditionally ours.\n  Some of our opponents on the other side would say to American \nfarmers: You go out there and compete against the French farmer and the \nGerman farmer, and while you are at it, you take on the French \nGovernment and the German Government as well. That is not a fair fight. \nOur farmers are ready, willing, and able to compete against anybody any \ntime, but it is not fair to put them up against the treasuries of \nEuropean nations. It is not fair to put them up against the Treasury of \nthe Government of France and the Government of Germany and the \nGovernment of England. That leaves the playing field tilted badly \nagainst them. That puts American farmers in a circumstance in which \nthey cannot possibly compete and succeed, through no fault of their \nown.\n  To do something other than to try to level the playing field is to \nabandon our farmers. It is to wave the white flag of surrender and say \nto the Europeans: You just take it, take it all; take the agricultural \nbase, and while you are at it, take the 20 million jobs that go with \nit; take the jobs in distribution, in transportation, in marketing; \ntake them all. Because that is what they would like to do, and that is \nwhy they are spending so much to achieve that very result.\n  We do not have to look very far to see what is occurring in world \nagriculture. All we have to do is study the annual statistics, and we \ncan see very clearly the pattern and plan of the Europeans. We can \neither decide to wave the white flag of surrender, engage in what I \ncall a unilateral surrender, or we can fight back.\n  That is a fundamental question before this body as we consider this \nfarm bill: Are we going to fight back, or are we going to roll over and \nsurrender? That is a fundamental question for this country. Do we want \nto maintain the capacity to produce food in this country, or do we want \nto be dependent on foreign countries for our sources of food? That is a \nfundamental issue before this body in considering this farm bill.\n  I pray this country makes the decision that we are going to try to \nlevel the playing field; that we are going to fight back; that we are \ngoing to give our farmers a fair, fighting chance. To do otherwise is \nto abandon them in this international competition.\n  This farm bill has improved countercyclical support. That was a key \nfailure of the last farm bill. The last farm bill said: The market is \ngoing to work even though other countries are not following it, even \nthough other countries have these massive programs to intercede, to \nmaintain a network of family farms across their countries. We know it \ndid not work. How do we know? Because we had to pass economic disaster \nbills in each of the last 4 years, economic disaster bill after \neconomic disaster bill because the previous farm bill was a disaster \nitself. This is an attempt to provide a stronger structure under \nagriculture so we do not have to repeatedly come back to our colleagues \nto ask for economic disaster assistance.\n  Let me make clear, we may have to come back for natural disasters; \nindeed, I think we will because none of us can predict when a hurricane \nmight strike, when we might have a tornado, when a part of the country \nmight be hit by drought or overly wet conditions. Natural disasters \noften require a response. None of us can predict when they might \nstrike, what their effects might be. But economic disasters, which were \ncreated in part by the last farm bill, hopefully we can prevent.\n\n  We do it with higher loan rates, and with optional updating of bases \nand yields--those are the determinations of what a farmer's base is for \nsupport. We do it with a new marketing loan program for pulse crops: \ndry peas, lentils, and small chickpeas, which are important in crop \nrotations in part to break the disease cycles we have seen and that \nhave contributed the need for disaster programs in recent years. There \nis the repeal of the sugar loan forfeiture penalty, a penalty that \nshould never have been imposed in the first place.\n  The bill has country of origin labels for imported meat, fish, \nproduce, and peanuts. This is critically important. Have we learned \nnothing from what has happened in the rest of the world? Europe has \nbeen hit by mad cow disease and by hoof and mouth disease, and they \nhave responded by creating a system that will allow them to know where \neach animal came from, the specific farm the animal came from, because \nthey know they need to have that information.\n  I had the Ambassador from Uruguay in my office just last week. They \nare creating a system to know the origin of the food they eat. In \nUruguay, they are going to be able to track an animal back to the farm \nit came from, so if there is a problem, they can trace it and isolate \nit and prevent an expansion. That is just common sense.\n  Think of how many times we have heard on the news that there is a \nrecall of food products, and they provide you the listing of the number \non the can so we know what to look for. What would they do if there \nwere no numbers on the cans of processed foods and we did not know what \nto look for? What would we do when they found there was a problem of \ntainted product and they had no way to track it? We would either have \nto throw it all away or take our chances.\n  There is a better way. We have found that better way. It is to know \nthe source of the food. That is what we are doing in this bill. Yet \nthere are people who are still railing against doing what anybody with \nany common sense knows we need to do. We need to know the origin of the \nfood we are eating. That is basic. That is basic to dealing with foot \nand mouth disease, that is fundamentally important to dealing with mad \ncow disease, that is fundamentally important to dealing with possible \nterrorist threats, so that if any problem develops, we can trace the \nsource of our food, we can isolate it, and we can eliminate the threat. \nThat is common sense, and this bill provides it.\n  This conference report also includes a strengthened commitment to \nrural development, conservation, trade, and, yes, nutrition programs.\n  In conservation alone, I was amazed to read an editorial that \nsuggested that somehow the commitment to conservation in this farm bill \nwas inadequate. What farm bill are they talking about? This bill has \nincreased the commitment to conservation by 80 percent, and yet they \nsaid it was insufficient. Mr. President, an 80-percent increase is \ninsufficient?\n  We need to do a better job of conserving our soil. We need to do a \nbetter job of conserving our precious water resources. This bill makes \nmajor strides in that direction.\n  One of the key elements of the bill is the signature piece of the \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Harkin of Iowa, who \nauthored the conservation security program which is part of this bill. \nHe has said something that I think is going to resonate in history \nbecause he has declared: We are not going to just continue conservation \nprograms the same old way, we are going to make a departure. We are not \ngoing to just have the Federal Government pass laws that become \nregulations and then, if people do not follow them, we penalize them. \nInstead, he says: With the conservation security\n\n[[Page S3928]]\n\ninitiative, we are going to establish what national priorities are in \nconservation, and then we are going to provide an incentive program for \nfarmers to comply. That is a profound difference in the relationship \nbetween the Federal Government and agricultural producers. It is a \nprofound change. It is precisely the right change. It says to farmers, \nwhen we identify a national priority, we will respond; we will respond \nwith an incentive to encourage you to adopt that practice.\n\n  That is important. That is important to the environment. That is \nimportant to producers. That is important to the Nation. That will \nprovide a template for future Government relations with the people for \nwhom we work. He has made an enormous contribution. This is a $2 \nbillion program that fundamentally changes the relationship between the \nFederal Government and producers across this country.\n  This bill also includes a renewed commitment to rural development: $1 \nbillion in new funding to encourage and strengthen economic development \nin the rural parts of this country. It is badly needed. Certainly, in \nmy part of the country, we continue to lose population.\n  We also have the trade title. We are facing tough competition and we \nneed to fight back. One billion dollars in additional funds is in the \ntrade title. We will have an aggressive outreach to other countries to \nbuy American products from American producers. That is what an American \nfarm bill ought to be about.\n  I saw with great interest what the Republican chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee in the House of Representatives said about this \nbill. He said this is not a bill for France. This is not a bill for \nCanada. This is a bill for American farmers and American consumers. \nThis is an American farm bill.\n  Chairman Combest has that exactly right. This is a bill for America. \nIt is a bill that deserves our support. I was proud to work with the \nconferees on this bill. Chairman Combest, a member I developed great \nrespect for in all the hours of negotiation, is truly an outstanding \nleader for American farmers, American consumers, and American \ntaxpayers. He was concerned about them all in this conference.\n  So was Congressman Stenholm, the ranking member of the House \nAgriculture Committee. No one would want to meet a tougher negotiator \nthan Congressman Stenholm. He was very tough. He knew there was a lot \nat stake for this country, for our producers, for our consumers.\n  To our own conferees, I want to say thank you. Thanks especially to \nSenator Harkin, who day after day after day stayed and negotiated and \nfought for a strong farm bill because he knew what would happen if we \nfailed. If you are ever in trouble, you want someone like Tom Harkin \nfighting for you in the Senate because he is determined and he will not \ngive up. This farm bill is a great testimony to his leadership.\n  I could not leave out our own leader, Senator Daschle, who at key \ntimes came into the negotiations to help us over the rough spots. He \nshowed great wisdom, great patience, and great leadership. We thank him \nfor all he contributed. He represents a farm State. He knew what was at \nstake.\n  Considerable thanks as well to Senator Leahy. I have never seen \nanyone more determined on behalf of his constituents than Senator \nLeahy. We listened to a lot of detailed debate on the merits of the \ndairy provisions of the bill. This bill was improved because of that \ndetermination.\n  Now a word about those on the other side. Senator Lugar, the ranking \nmember of the Agriculture Committee, disagrees with what we have \nproduced. He has made that clear. I have enormous respect for Dick \nLugar. He is one of the most knowledgeable Members of this Chamber on a \nwide range of issues. On foreign policy questions, there is nobody I \nwould rather talk to or listen to before reaching a conclusion than \nDick Lugar. He is an extraordinarily intelligent man, a person of great \ncharacter. He speaks against this bill out of principle. I respect \nthat. I don't agree with him in this case. I think I have outlined some \nof my reasons for disagreement, but he makes a very strong case, an \nintellectually honest case. I disagree with him. However, his argument \nis intellectually honest, and he has been very clear and forthright \nthroughout the entire procedure. He made very clear he wasn't for this, \nevery step of the way. I admire Senator Lugar. My respect for him has \ndone nothing but grow, although I disagree with his fundamental \nconclusion.\n\n  Others say this costs too much money, and I understand that. I am \nchairman of the Budget Committee. I wish we didn't have to spend this \nkind of money. Friends, our competitors are spending much, much more. \nTo spend less is to say to our people, tough luck; you are out of \nbusiness. That would be a profound mistake.\n  Let me close by urging my colleagues to support this bill. It \ndeserves their support. It is a balanced bill. It is within the budget. \nIt is a bill that will make a difference for our country over time. Not \nimmediately, no. It will not solve all the problems immediately.\n  To our colleagues who say this bill costs way too much, we ought to \npresent it in context. In the year 2000, we spent $32 billion helping \nour producers. In 2001, we spent $22 billion. This is on a fiscal year \nbasis. That is different than on a crop-year basis. On a fiscal year \nbasis, these are the numbers: $32 billion in 2000 and $22 billion in \n2001. In 2002, it will be $14.2 billion. In 2003, it will be $19.1 \nbillion. The red bars are the amount added over the current farm bill. \nSo for 2002, without this legislation, it would still cost $12.7 \nbillion in that fiscal year. In the year 2003, it would cost $12.3. \nThis bill adds $6.8 billion to take us up to $19.1 billion for fiscal \nyear 2003, which will start October 1.\n  Remember we are coming from much higher levels of expenditures when \nyou count the underlying farm bill plus the economic disaster payments \nwe have enacted. This chart shows that, although we have healthy levels \nof expenditures in this new farm bill--more than $70 billion more than \nwe would have had under the old farm bill--we actually have less than \nwas paid out by the Federal Government under the old farm bill plus the \neconomic disaster payments made in each of the last 4 years.\n  I conclude by reminding those who are listening that we are up \nagainst fierce competition from our major competitors in Europe who are \nspending much more than we are, providing much higher levels of support \nfor their producers than we provide for ours, and on top of that, are \nspending much more to promote their exports than we spend to promote \nour agricultural exports. Those are the facts. I hope our colleagues \nwill remember when we reach a conclusion that this is a bill that is \ncritically important to American agriculture.\n  A major farm group leader in my State responded tellingly when I \nposed the question, What happens without this bill? His reaction was \nimmediate and strong: Senator, without this bill there will be a race \nto the auctioneer.\n  That is exactly right. This bill is all that stands between a race to \nthe auctioneer in every farm community in this country and the \ncontinuing viability of the family farm network that has served this \ncountry so well.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for his kind words. I thank my friend \nand my colleague from North Dakota for two things: First, for his great \nleadership as head of our Budget Committee and for giving the guidance \nand direction and providing the budget for what we need to do; and for \nbeing on the Agriculture Committee and providing his expertise on \nbudget matters as we work through the farm bill, both in the committee, \non the Senate floor, and in conference. He has been great. I compliment \nthe Senator.\n  I can say without fear of contradiction that many times we might have \nbeen persuaded to go in a different direction--let's say on the farm \nbill in the conference--had it not been for the Senator from North \nDakota, whose expertise and knowledge of the budget came to the \nforefront and carried the day for us so we got the bill that we got.\n  I thank my friend from North Dakota for, again, being there every \nday. The Senator said I was there every day. He knows because he was \nthere every day that I was, on the farm bill conference. I thank him \nfor that. I also thank the Senator for always pointing out in these \nnegotiations, when we are talking about trade, what the Europeans\n\n[[Page S3929]]\n\nare doing compared to us. We cannot ever forget that. This farm bill \nthat we passed, this is for our farmers, for our ranchers. This is not \nfor the European farmers and the European ranchers and the South \nAmerican farmers. This is for our farmers. We ought to make no excuse \nfor it, none whatsoever. We are sticking up for our producers in this \ncountry.\n  I have one last thing to say to the Senator from North Dakota about \nthe chart he had up recently about the money we are spending on \nagriculture. I think I read an editorial, maybe it was in the Wall \nStreet Journal--or someplace else--going after how much money we are \nspending on agriculture. I asked to get a run here from CBO on their \nbaseline projections from now for the 10 years of this farm bill \ncompared to the total outlays of the Federal Government. If you take \nthe outlays of the Federal Government for the next 10 years, CBO says \nthat comes to $22.245 trillion. Add up all the spending on agriculture \nfor everything; that comes to $206.2 billion--.93 percent of all the \nspending the Federal Government is going to do in the next 10 years \ngoes for agriculture.\n  That is a small price to pay, I say to my friend from North Dakota, \nfor having the best food supply, the most productive capacity in the \nworld, the cheapest food, and the safest food anywhere in the world. I \nthink when the American people see that, they will say: Yes, this is \nthe kind of farm bill we need. Ninety-three percent? I say to my friend \nfrom North Dakota, I believe the average American will say that less \nthan a penny out of every dollar to keep our farmers in business is a \nvery small price to pay.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota, again, for his wisdom, \nguidance, and judgment on these matters as we work through this farm \nbill.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I conclude by thanking my colleague, \nSenator Harkin, the chairman of the committee, who really did an \noutstanding job getting this bill through the committee, through the \nSenate, and through the conference. Certainly, thanks also go to our \ncolleague on the other side of the aisle, Senator Lugar, for his \npassionate position and his wisdom. Even when he disagreed, he would \nprovide us with observations that guided us in terms of altering what \nwould otherwise have been a weaker bill. So I thank him and recognize \nhis very professional staff as well.\n  Senator Lugar, we thank you and your staff.\n  On Senator Harkin's staff, I want to thank Mark Halverson. Mark, who \nis the staff director of the Agriculture Committee, showed enormous \ndiplomacy going through this process. This is tough stuff. It is \nextraordinarily complicated. There were hundreds and hundreds of hours \nof deliberation. I thank Mark Halverson for always keeping his cool and \nfor his wisdom in keeping a focus on the ultimate goal.\n  I also thank Susan Keith as well, who worked so hard on this bill. We \nappreciate all that she meant to its conclusion.\n  On my staff, I thank Tim Galvin and Scott Stofferahn. Tim Galvin and \nScott Stofferahn were an extraordinary team. They played a key role \nthroughout this process.\n  Tim Galvin, who used to be on the staff of former Senator Bob Kerrey \nof Nebraska, who served as head of the Foreign Agricultural Service in \nthe Clinton administration, joined my Budget Committee staff more than \na year ago. I could not have chosen better. He has been absolutely \noutstanding.\n  Scott Stofferahn, who is on my State staff, commuted--and this was \ntruly a case of long distance commuting--to participate in the \ndeliberations on this bill because he headed the Farm Services Agency \nin North Dakota under the previous administration for 8 years and knew \nthe details of farm programs backwards and forwards. He was really \nindispensable to our efforts. So special thanks to Tim and Scott, to \nthe staff members of Senator Harkin and the staff members of Senator \nLugar, and certainly to our colleagues on the House side.\n  There were times we had very deep disagreements in the conference \ncommittee, but one thing you never questioned was that each and every \nMember was doing his or her level best for the farmers of this country, \nfor the taxpayers of this country, for the consumers of this country. \nWe had different ideas about what that represented, but I never \nquestioned the good faith of any member of that conference committee, \nincluding those who disagreed with us.\n  Certainly to Congressman Combest and Congressman Stenholm, we \nappreciate your patience. The patience of each of us was tried at \ntimes, but it was an important effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, earlier today I asked unanimous consent to \nhave some letters printed in the Record, letters of support for the \nbill.\n  I have three others I would like to have printed. The first is a \nletter from the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation saying they urge strong \npassage of the conference report for the 2002 farm bill. I ask \nunanimous consent the letter from the Iowa Farm Bureau be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             Iowa Farm Bureau,\n\n                                                      May 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the 150,000 plus members \n     of the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, the Iowa Farm Bureau \n     Board of Directors urges you to support passage of the \n     conference report for the 2002 farm bill. We are generally \n     pleased with the provisions in the conference committee \n     report including a stronger safety net for our producers and \n     an increase in conservation spending. Iowa farmers will \n     benefit from the additional safety net features and are \n     seeking your support for this legislation.\n       The conference committee report contains many of the \n     features of the current farm program and improves upon the \n     safety net by instituting a counter-cyclical payment when \n     prices fall below certain levels. It provides for a strong \n     commitment to trade, rural economic development and \n     conservation. In particular, the $9 billion in additional \n     spending for the environmental quality incentive cost-share \n     assistance program will mean that Iowa farmers have access to \n     the much-needed resources to address environmental concerns. \n     We are particularly pleased that the conferees agreed to fund \n     the Conservation Security Program. This new conservation \n     program will be important to compensate farmers for the \n     ongoing costs of conservation practices.\n       In addition, we are pleased that the conference committee \n     included the Senate's version of the energy title and \n     provisions designed to enhance protections for livestock \n     producers. The conference committee agreed to prohibit \n     confidentiality provisions in production contracts. These \n     provisions have limited the ability of producers to seek \n     legal and financial advice about the terms of a contract \n     before entering into it. This provision does not preempt \n     stricter state laws; thus, Iowa's law will not be negatively \n     impacted. In addition, hog producers with production \n     contracts will have additional protections under the Packers \n     and Stockyards Act.\n       Despite our disappointment that a ban on packer ownership \n     was not included in the final version, we are pleased that \n     the committee included country of origin labeling. This \n     provision will ensure that consumers have an opportunity to \n     choose between domestically produced beef, fruits and \n     vegetables and those produced overseas. We believe that U.S. \n     consumers will choose to purchase products produced by our \n     farmers if this information is made available to them.\n       The farm bill conference committee report is a consensus \n     document that balances the needs of the program crops and \n     other agricultural commodities. It provides the additional \n     safety net that producers have been seeking and maintains the \n     strengths of the current farm program. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Craig Lang,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Next, a letter from the Iowa Farmers Union. They also \nsent a letter of support urging passage of the bill. I ask unanimous \nconsent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Iowa Farmers Union,\n\n                                            Ames, IA, May 1, 2002.\n\nIowa Farmers Union Reacts to the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act \n                                of 2002\n\n       Ames, IA.--Over the past few years, Iowa Farmers Union \n     (IFU) has been working intently with our elected officials to \n     vastly improve farm legislation. Now, after weeks of \n     deliberations, the farm bill conferees have reached an \n     agreement on a new farm bill entitled ``The Farm Security and \n     Rural Investment Act of 2002''\n       ``We are still waiting for the final details, but what we \n     have seen so far indicates the new farm bill provisions will \n     be a definite\n\n[[Page S3930]]\n\n     improvement over the former `Freedom to Farm' program that \n     was a disaster for farmers and taxpayers alike,'' said Gary \n     Hoskey, IFU President.\n       The agreement, while short on specifics, should provide \n     certainty to farmers and lenders because of the new safety \n     net provisions of the law. Under the old program, farmers and \n     lenders were forced to make production decisions that would \n     not cash flow, in hopes that Congress would pass emergency \n     supplemental aid legislation long after the crops were \n     planted.\n       ``The Iowa Farmers Union joins all Iowans in extending our \n     thanks to Senate Agriculture Chairman Tom Harkin for his \n     efforts in this new farm legislation,'' said Hoskey. ``Not \n     only did Senator Harkin succeed in getting a much improved \n     safety net for family farmers, he was also successful in \n     getting significant increases in conservation programs and \n     rural development funding.''\n       ``And, for the first time ever, there is an Energy title in \n     the farm program that will encourage research and development \n     of renewable and bioenergy resources. Hopefully our country \n     will now look more to agriculture for renewable energy \n     sources instead of imported oil from the Middle East.''\n       ``We are also glad to see Country of Origin Labeling \n     included in this law. It is something we have worked on for a \n     long time,'' added Hoskey\n       ``We are disappointed that the payment limitations were not \n     lowered more and the packer ban on owning and feeding \n     livestock was not passed,'' said Hoskey. ``We will continue \n     to work with Senator Harkin and our other legislators on \n     these and other important issues.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. And the Iowa Soybean Association in applauding the \ncompletion of the bill and urging its passage and signature by the \nPresident.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter from the Iowa Soybean Association \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Iowa Soybean Association,\n\n                                    Urbandale, IA, April 30, 2002.\n\n The Iowa Soybean Association Applauds the Completion of the 2002 Farm \n                Bill by U.S. Senate and House Conferees\n\n       Urbandale, Iowa.--The Iowa Soybean Association (ISA) \n     applauds the completion of the 2002 Farm Bill by the U.S. \n     Senate and House conferees today.\n       ISA President John Hoffman said, ``Soybeans are treated \n     more equitably in relation to other program crops in this \n     legislation, and Iowa soybean farmers are provided better \n     income protection. ISA is pleased with the inclusion of \n     expanded conservation programs, an energy title, which \n     increases opportunities for soy biodiesel, and increased \n     funding for important trade title programs in the Bill.''\n       ``On behalf of ISA, let me thank Chairmen Tom Harkin and \n     Larry Combest and their colleagues on completing this \n     demanding process in time for programs to be effective for \n     2002 crops,'' Hoffman added.\n       The completion of the bill comes after much diligent work \n     by both ISA and American Soybean Association (ASA) directors \n     on behalf of Iowa soybean producers with key legislators. \n     Good farm policy is the goal of the lobbying efforts by \n     members of both ISA and ASA. ISA will continue to be a leader \n     in efforts such as these to ensure equitable treatment in the \n     2002 Farm Bill and other soybean policy issues.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. These three farm groups in Iowa all support this farm \nbill.\n  I listened to the debate on the floor. I listened to my colleague \nfrom Iowa earlier. This is the first opportunity I have had to respond.\n  My colleague and I have been friends for 28 years now, I guess it is, \nsince we both came to the House in 1974. We worked very strongly \ntogether on issues of concern to our State and Nation. We do not always \nagree on things, I understand that, but we do work together.\n  I think we have a pretty big disagreement on this farm bill. I say to \nmy colleague from Iowa--he went on about the trade portions of the bill \nand whether or not it is going to violate WTO. I want to set the record \nstraight one more time. This bill will strengthen our position in the \nWTO negotiations. It will strengthen it. If we go down towards zero in \namber box payments, that weakens our bargaining position. The closer we \nget to $19 billion, that strengthens our position. It strengthens it \nbasically because of what Senator Conrad from North Dakota was talking \nabout--how much the European Union supports its agriculture.\n  Second, my colleague from Iowa said there was a one in five chance \nthat we would violate the WTO. That is a statistic that has come from \nthe Food and Agriculture Policy Research Institute. That said they \nestimated about a 19-percent chance, I guess, of this violating the \nWTO.\n  FAPRI also said the present law, the law we have been under since \n1996, has a 14-percent chance of violating WTO. So the present law is \n14 percent, this is 19 percent; that is a very modest change, a very \nmodest amount difference. So we should not be worried about that. We \nare well within the bounds of WTO.\n  I reaffirm that this farm bill is for our farmers. We stick up for \nour farmers. We stick up for our ranchers. We stick up for our people \nin rural America. Through the process of our committee and the House \nprocess and the conference committee process, we work out what we \nbelieve is best for our producers, our farmers, and our ranchers--not \nwhat is best for Germany, France, Brazil, or China. That is their \nbusiness. As long as they do it within the WTO, it is their business. \nHow we seek to address our problems and to help our producers is our \nbusiness. It is not the business of France, Germany, Italy, England, \nBrazil, China, or Japan. That is our business.\n  I hope people understand and recognize that, yes, we have a WTO, but \nour first obligation, as we held up our hand and swore our oath of \noffice here, our first obligation is to our people, to make sure we \ntake care of our people first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield time to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Montana.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to follow the \nremarks of the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, how many minutes does the Senator request?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am going to keep it as short as I \npossibly can. I want to make a couple of comments, and then I will fade \naway into the past. How is that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee, and the ranking member.\n  I start off by thanking them for the work they did on this bill.\n  Agricultural legislation is, of course, very important to the State \nof Montana. There is no question about a changed policy on how we serve \nagriculture. There is no doubt in my mind that this bill will not bring \nlower prices for food commodities. Agribusiness will continue to buy as \ncheap as they can. The taxpayer will continue to pay their prices, and \nalso the taxpayer will continue to participate in the income of \nAmerican agriculture at the production level. That is not going to \nchange. What has changed a little bit is that we are into price support \nprotection of a commodity. We are not in the business of guaranteeing \nthe income of the farmer.\n  This will allow us to make a strong argument for a market-driven \neconomy on the global scene.\n  It will have trade impacts. There is no question in my mind.\n  Even though we have dealt with this kind of situation before, it is \nmy belief that we will drive up the cost of land. When we do that, the \nbigger producers will buy out the lower producers. So we don't save a \nlot of small producers--the people we are trying to help out.\n  That is what farm bills do. That is what price supports on \ncommodities do.\n  I will vote for this bill. But it is hard to stand up here and talk \nphilosophy and about a direction when you are in the middle of a 5-year \ndrought. Montana needs some help.\n  Will this bill help those who are in a drought? No, it will not. We \nwill have to get some supplemental money somewhere for drought relief. \nI think we can do that, if we work very hard.\n\n  The total cost is over budget--as submitted by the Congressional \nBudget Office--by $80 billion. We thought we were operating within \naround a $70 billion or a $72 billion budget. We know we are over \nbudget for this particular piece of legislation.\n  In spite of all of these loan rates and targets, there is a strong \nsuspicion on my part that we will be back in the\n\n[[Page S3931]]\n\nbusiness of overproduction. If there is a strong conservation title in \nthis bill, it will be hard to implement with soil conservation and \nwater conservation with an enticement to overproduce. I have a \nsuspicion that it is in here.\n  We didn't do anything about insurance. We didn't look into that to \nsee how it is used in unusual ways to enhance the purchase of revenue \ninsurance for farms. We need to look at that.\n  We didn't get the packer concentration legislation that we wanted, \nnor did we prevent the USDA from using a USDA stamp on meat products \nimported into this country. We did get a country of origin label.\n  That may be a slippery slope. There is a downside to that. But for \nevery upside there is always a downside. We hope when we get into the \nadministrative rules of that program we can have some input so that our \nproducers are not only protected but have the ability to participate.\n  I know some of us in this body do not live on a border. But I will \ntell you our challenges along that border are much greater than some \nwould imagine.\n  We did nothing about captive shippers when we moved our crops to \nports and plants.\n  Those of us who only have one railroad have real serious concerns \nabout producing for the railroad. It wasn't meant to be that way. But \nthat is the way it is under present conditions.\n  As you know, in agriculture, we buy retail and we sell wholesale, and \nwe pay the freight both ways. Those things were not even dealt with or \nlooked at in this piece of legislation.\n  As we look at this issue, we are back to loan rates which are a \nlittle bit higher than before. We are back at targets, and we are back \nto deficiency payments.\n  Those of us who thought we were going to get an LDP payment in \nSeptember forget about that. It is going to be smaller. You are going \nto get it in four payments starting this September. The last payment is \ncoming in June of next year.\n  I don't think that is going to make every banker in the world happy. \nIt won't get us out of our doldrums as far as producing this year's \ncrop.\n  Like I said, we haven't had a crop for 5 years. Again, we are in a \nsituation in Montana where we need an infusion of money. That is what \ndrives my vote today. It is not because I agree philosophically about \nwhere this bill is taking us. I think probably when you look at it, the \nchairman of the committee was exactly right. If you look at it, it is \nnot very much more money for our producers as compared with where we \nhave been in the last 4 or 5 years. It doesn't increase their income \nall that much. You will just have to do more paperwork to get it with \nrisk involved.\n  Tomorrow, we will vote for this bill. But I have the expectation that \nit will not be long before we will be revisiting this business of \nagriculture--before any of us are gone from this body.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wonder if the good Senator would be \nkind enough to yield 15 minutes off the bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think we are talking about agriculture \ngenerally, are we not? Good. I wanted to talk about the farm bill. I \nhad thought that is what we were talking about this afternoon. \nApparently other issues are talked about as well.\n  In any event, the bill before us, of course, is the conference \ncommittee report on agriculture. That is the one, it seems to me, we \nneed to focus on at the moment.\n  I begin by saying I am pleased we have a conference report on the \nagriculture bill. The conference report is before us and we can make a \ndecision with respect to agriculture in the bill that is before us.\n  For much of agriculture, of course, this is a key time of the year. \nCompletion here is certainly very timely and one that is very \nimportant.\n  I know that colleagues on both sides, the House and the Senate, spent \nmany hours over the past couple of months working to reach a \ncompromise. I thank them and their staff because I know it was very \nhard work and it takes a very long time.\n  We need a farm bill. We need a farm bill. That is very important to \nour economy. It is very important to our Nation. It is very important \nto homeland defense and all the things that are important to us. \nProducers in rural communities depend on a stable farm policy.\n  Of course, the bottom line, what we ought to be talking about, is a \nstable farm policy, the kind of policy that will show to us in the \nfuture where we want to be in agriculture.\n\n  I get a little concerned sometimes as we talk about all kinds of \nsubjects and obviously talk about the immediacy of them. And that is \nthe fact. But we really ought to be thinking a little more of where we \nwould like to be in 10 years or 20 years. Where do we see agriculture? \nWhere do we see our families and our communities in 10 or 20 years? \nWhat do we want agriculture to look like? That really ought to have an \nimpact on what we do in the long term, and what we do now is going to \nimpact that long term.\n  If we could develop a vision of where we wanted agriculture to be, \nthen, of course, decisions we make in the interim would be much easier \nand certainly would lead toward the goal that we want.\n  Many of the programs that are in this bill affect Wyoming and are \nbeneficial to Wyoming. The new sugar program is based on marketing \nallotments. Sugar, interestingly enough, in Wyoming is a major \ncommodity and has been one of our biggest cash crops in our State of \nWyoming; in addition to being one of the relatively few products that \ngoes out to the retail markets that is entirely processed in our \ncommunities in Wyoming.\n  New policies are designed to keep the market in balance and to have \nsomething to do with production and control and to prevent the costly, \ndamaging forfeitures we have had in the past.\n  As you probably know, we have been for years about the second largest \nproducer of lamb. So we needed to ensure that this product is eligible \nfor a marketing loan, and we are happy that it does. I am pleased that \nthe conference provided wool producers with a new opportunity, similar \nto others, to grow and to strengthen their markets. These producers are \nmaking changes. These producers are looking forward and seeking to \ndevelop a niche market for their own products and to work with \nprocessors so they can move forward.\n  One of the things we have seen in agriculture, of course, is out of \nthe total price for a retail agricultural product, the percentage that \ngoes to the producer is getting smaller and smaller. So we are making \nsome moves there.\n  Wheat, of course, is the only so-called program crop in Wyoming. The \nreport continues to provide assistance, of course, to wheat producers.\n  Conservation is important to all of us in agriculture, and I think \nmaybe it is particularly important to those of us in the West--maybe \nnot any more important but we really like open space and we really like \nto keep properties, lands open. Of course, the answer to that is to \nhave an effective agriculture, to have a profitable agriculture where \npeople can stay on the land and keep it open and available. So we are \npleased with that. It provides a means for producers to comply with \nGovernment mandates while voluntarily working to protect the \nenvironment. Water quality is one of those things, and we certainly \nneed to be very careful about that. It is a very important thing to us.\n  The report subsequently boosts spending for conservation to $17 \nbillion. That is good. Conservation affects everyone. One of the things \nwe tried to do, and I tried to do as a member of the committee, was to \nkind of get off of this program crop thing, where the high majority of \nthe money has always gone, and put it over a little bit more on general \nagriculture so we could have an impact on the broad view of agriculture \nand not just on cotton and wheat and corn and soybeans. They are \nimportant, too, of course, but they are\n\n[[Page S3932]]\n\nnot the only crops in the world. So this conservation approach was one \nof the best that we could take.\n  As we worked on this bill in committee, as a member of the \nAgriculture Committee, I spent the bulk of my time working on the \nconservation title.\n  Efforts such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, EQIP, \nhelps farmers and ranchers with technical information, with water \nquality as it comes through their land, with livestock grazing, and so \non. This is strengthened.\n  So I thank the conferees for incorporating much needed reforms in \nthis program, such as boosting cost-share dollars, eliminating priority \nareas, and eliminating bidding-down procedures.\n  I am also pleased with the authorization of a new program for \ngrasslands--the Grasslands Reserve Program. There are efforts here to \nassist in the protection of native grasslands, and it is particularly \nbeneficial to western ranchlands that are being threatened by land \nsales and land fragmentation.\n  There are a number of programs in the bill that are critical for \nrural communities and the Nation's hungry, including rural development \nand nutrition programs, including food stamps, one of the major \nexpenditures.\n  In my opinion, there is no question that these are important \nprograms. I support them. However, on balance, I have concerns with the \nfarm bill. Even though, as I have enumerated, I support those things \nthat I think are reasonable, I think the final product has missed the \nmark. I believe Congress should be working to move agriculture more to \na market-based economy versus one supported entirely by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Here again, what do we want to see in agriculture in 10 or 20 years? \nDo we want the Federal Government to be in charge of farm production in \nthis country? I don't think so. We want to develop the market so we can \nhave prosperous agriculture in the private sector and people can make \ndecisions for themselves.\n  This report is a dramatic step away from a market-based economy. \nTotal spending has ballooned to about $83 billion over 10 years, \naccording to the CBO score released yesterday. That is an increase of \n$9.3 billion over the original budget of $73.5 billion. Most of the \nincrease is in the commodity title. Roughly $48 billion is devoted \nsolely to the commodity title. If you incorporate CBO's new score, we \nare spending $57 billion for commodity programs alone.\n  In my opinion, the policies in this report will stimulate \noverproduction in an already fragile market. So we would move away from \nmarket control and move into a level set by loans and payments. \nFurther, these same policies will price our products out of foreign \nmarkets. The fact is, about 1 in every 3 acres in agriculture must be \nin overseas markets. We produce much more than what we consume. We need \nto understand that those markets are vitally important to us.\n  Furthermore, farm policy, as I have mentioned, should benefit all of \nagriculture, not just select crops. Wyoming is not a crop-oriented \nState. Yet agriculture is one of our top three economic industries. \nFarm policies do not benefit my constituents as much as they do \nproducers in the Midwest or even our surrounding States.\n  We should all question how these new policies will impact our trade \nnegotiations and our export markets, which is what we are dealing with \nwhen this is over. If we have exceeded the so-called ``amber box'' \nallocation, our competitors can retaliate against our products because \nthey think we have subsidized our products through this approach. How \ndoes retaliation benefit U.S. producers? Being locked out of export \nmarkets is a serious concern. We felt that very much when we had the \nAsian currency crisis and much of beef was going to Asia and the \nmarkets were building, and suddenly it did not. Now we find ourselves \nwith relatively high tariffs there, which we ought to be able to \nnegotiate down if we can deal with that.\n\n  When the United States is party to only a handful of agreements, we \neffectively limit our possibilities. If we aren't selling the wheat, \ncorn, or beef to the world, someone else is.\n  When we began debate in the Agriculture Committee, I urged all of my \ncolleagues to think about the future, where we were going to be. I \nthink in most all we do we ought to be thinking about the long-term \nimpact. I think that ought to be done here certainly.\n  Unfortunately, I fear this farm bill will create additional reliance \non Government assistance, while simultaneously threatening our export \nmarket possibilities. So there are some questions in my mind about the \nconference committee report.\n  I was not on the conference committee. I have a question about packer \nownership. As the chairman knows, I have long been concerned about the \nimpact of packer concentration, where three or four packers handle 80 \npercent of the livestock. During Senate debate, I cosponsored an \namendment to ban packing companies from owning and feeding livestock \nprior to slaughter. I would like to have someone from the conference \nexplain to me why it is no longer a part of the farm bill if this would \nprovide for more competition. Why would we not be for that? If it is \nbetter for producers, why would we not be for that?\n  Disaster assistance. Unlike much of agriculture, livestock producers \ndo not have a Federal program. They have received very little \nassistance over the last few years, despite ongoing drought conditions \nthat have forced many to sell all or part of their herd.\n  I would like to have the conference personnel tell me why, in a time \nof providing record assistance for agriculture, the conference report \ndoes not contain disaster assistance to agriculture, this conference \nreport does not contain disaster assistance for livestock producers. We \nare providing $94 million in market loss assistance for apple producers \nand $10 million for onion producers--but not for livestock producers.\n  Again, there are some excellent portions of this bill. On balance, it \nis not moving in the direction we want to go in in terms of the future \nof agriculture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes--and more if he needs \nit--to the Senator from Georgia. He has been a very valuable member of \nour Senate Agriculture Committee. I take this opportunity to thank him \npersonally for his diligence, his effort, and input into our committee \ndeliberations, and also on the floor. I daresay that many of the good \nprovisions that we have--especially dealing with getting the whole \npeanut program changed over to what it was in the past to meet new \nchallenges for the peanut growers in America--would not have been there \nwithout the efforts and strong input from the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia. I yield to him 10 minutes or more if he needs it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for allowing \nus to work so closely together on this piece of legislation.\n  Like many of our colleagues, I have been reading a great new book by \nRobert Caro on Lyndon Johnson, entitled ``Master of the Senate.''\n  I enjoyed the hundred or so pages on the Senate as an institution, \nand especially the chapters on Senator Richard Russell of Georgia. He \nis an icon in my State and, of course, one of the greatest Members to \never serve in this body. We remember him mostly for his contributions \nas chairman of the Armed Services Committee. But another of his great \ncauses was that of the American farmers. When he was a freshman, just \nin his thirties, he became chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee \non Agriculture. Now, those were the days.\n  One of the things he was most proud of was his fight for a national \nschool lunch program. Senator Russell would like what is in this farm \nbill for nutrition, and I think he would like the other parts of it as \nwell.\n  Speaking on the importance of agriculture, Senator Russell once \npointed out:\n\n       Every great civilization has derived its basic strength and \n     wealth from the soil.\n\n  As I stand behind this desk he once used in this hallowed Hall, and \nas we deliberate this farm bill, it is well to remember those words:\n\n       Every great civilization has derived its basic strength and \n     wealth from the soil.\n\n  I am afraid too many Americans do not understand that today. I \nstrongly support this farm bill conference report, and I thank the \nmembers of the conference committee, as I said in the\n\n[[Page S3933]]\n\nbeginning of my remarks, especially our chairman, Senator Harkin, for \ntheir good and diligent work.\n  I also thank our majority leader, Senator Daschle, for his \nexceptionally strong leadership on this bill. We have a farm bill that \nthe President has said he will sign, and I appreciate that. It is a \nbill that can be implemented this year and, most importantly, it is a \nbill that is good for all of America's farmers.\n  Farmers, ranchers, dairymen, bankers, equipment dealers, even family \ngrocery store owners can finally breathe a small sigh of relief. With \nthis bill, Congress will finally deliver some help to America's rural \ncommunities. Many do not realize it, but these communities are facing \ntheir biggest crisis since the Great Depression.\n  One of the most historic changes in this farm bill is the elimination \nof the Depression-era peanut quota system. Switching from this 80-year-\nold quota system to a new market-oriented program was not easy. In \nfact, it has been downright painful for many in my State, but I am \nconfident this new peanut program will benefit not only peanut \nproducers but also American consumers.\n  The new peanut program will allow our farmers to compete on a global \nscale, just as farmers of other traditional commodities do. It will \nprovide access to new markets and fairer price competition with foreign \ncountries.\n  At the same time, however, the elimination of the quota system will \nresult in financial losses for many of Georgia's family farms. There is \nno question that this peanut quota is an asset. It is taxed by the IRS. \nIt has been passed down through families from generation to generation. \nThat is why on the Senate side, Senator Cleland and I made sure farm \nfamilies who have worked hard to purchase this quota over years are \nfairly compensated for their losses.\n  This bill gives peanut quota holders a fair 5-year buyout. Those who \nargue that quota holders do not deserve it simply do not understand how \nmany have come to rely on this quota as their retirement. They do not \nunderstand how this quota system has helped fuel many rural economies \nfor many years. So when we do away with it, as we are in this bill, in \nall fairness, we have to have a short transition. We need a bridge from \nthe old system to the new, and this bill provides one.\n  I am very pleased the farm bill we have before us today does not have \nthe lower payment limit that was adopted earlier by this Senate. That \nlower payment limit would have helped no farmer, but I can guarantee \nyou it would have hurt many. I do not exaggerate. It would have forced \nmany farmers in my State and across the South to put their farms on the \nauction block.\n  One has to understand the type of agriculture found across the South \nto realize the ill effect of lower payment limits. The cost of \nproducing traditional commodities in the South often run three to four \ntimes higher than the cost of producing corn and wheat in other parts \nof the country.\n\n  Also, the size of a family farm in the South can be as large as a few \nthousand acres, much bigger than in other parts of the country. Our \nfarmers in the South should not be punished because their production \ncosts are greater or because their family farms are bigger.\n  The payment limit the conferees have worked on, a compromise between \nthe House and Senate, closes the loopholes that have received so much \npublic attention in recent years, but at the same time it still allows \nour farmers to produce the cheapest and healthiest food supply in the \nworld.\n  Producers have the right to pursue efficiency and adapt to a changing \nworld economy. I am pleased the conferees in the end understood the \nneed to develop a final bill that will not hurt American farmers.\n  There are other important pieces of this bill as well.\n  This bill contains an 80-percent increase in conservation spending. \nThat large an increase is unheard of. The increased funding will help \nwith programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program, the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program, the Farmland Protection \nProgram, and the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program. All of these \nprograms are critical to farmers and livestock producers throughout \nGeorgia.\n  These conservation programs help products comply with the costly \nFederal regulations that the Government continues to throw our way. In \naddition, this bill contains significant funding increases for research \nwhich we do a lot of in our university system in Georgia. I have \nalready mentioned nutrition. Forestry, trade, and rural development \nprograms are all here.\n  Mr. President, our farmers have waited long enough. Our rural \ncommunities have suffered long enough. Our previous agricultural policy \nhas failed to provide the backbone needed during these depressed times \nin rural America.\n  For the sake of those rural communities in Georgia and all across \nthis country, I thank, again, the leadership of the Senate and the \nHouse who have recognized this emergency and addressed it head on. I \nask my colleagues to vote in support of this farm bill. It is a good \none.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from Arizona. \nHow much time does the Senator require?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I speak against this farm bill conference \nagreement that will serve as the basis of farm policy for the next 6 \nyears. I oppose this legislation because it is an appalling breach of \nour Federal spending responsibility and could be damaging to our \nnational integrity.\n  Included in this agreement, as we all know, is $83 billion in new \nspending for farm programs above the baseline, which brings the grand \ntotal to $183 billion for the life of the bill. In yearly spending, the \nprojections for this new farm bill will rank among the most expensive \nfarm bills in recent history.\n  Before I launch into my remarks, I wish to say that some of this new \nspending is laudable, including funding for conservation programs, \nincreased funding for food stamps and nutrition programs, but \nunfortunately the bad policies outweigh any positive developments. Farm \nspending will reach record levels, and modest reforms were eliminated. \nWe had a few modest reforms enacted on the floor of the Senate. All of \nthose were eliminated.\n  It is no surprise that the adherence to the status quo is \nparticularly disappointing since information was widely available \ndemonstrating the overwhelming disparity of farm payment distributions. \nThe GAO study highlighted the egregious disparity in farm benefits, \ndemonstrating that over 80 percent of farm payments primarily benefited \nlarge and medium-sized farms. Other studies by the Environmental \nWorking Group found that in evaluating U.S. Department of Agriculture \ndata, the top 10 percent of big farmers and agribusiness consumed about \n80 percent of farm benefits, leaving small farmers out in the cold.\n  When Members talk about small farmers, how in the world do you \njustify that--when they took out, I say to the distinguished managers \nof the bill and conferees--they took out the requirement, the ceiling \nwe put on the maximum amount that a farmer could desire.\n  Tyler Farms in Helena, AR, received $23 million in cotton payments in \n2001.\n  Cenex Harvest States Co-op in St. Paul, MN, received $9 million in \nwheat subsidies and also received $7 million in corn payments as well.\n  A farmers rice co-op in Sacramento, CA, received $40 million in rice \nsubsidies, while Riceland Foods, Inc., in Stutgart, AR, received $38 \nmillion.\n  Mr. President, how does one justify this? What is going to happen? We \nall know what is going to happen. The same thing that happened in the \npast: 80 percent of the large corporations and large farms get the \nmoney; they buy out the small farmer, and the farms get big and the \nsmall farmers, whom ostensibly we are trying to assist in this \nlegislation, are the ones who have to sell. A very large percentage \nhave an average of about $1,000, while the major agribusinesses receive \nhundreds of millions of dollars. I don't have the figures for ConAgra \nand Archer Daniels Midland.\n\n  A modest effort was made to limit farm payments to $250,000 per \nfarmer. Despite overwhelming justification for this modest limitation, \nlooming farm and election year politics pressured conferees to reject \nany reasonable limitations. Nothing in this bill will serve as checks \nand balances to prevent the bulk of payments to selected commodities \nsuch as cotton, wheat, and corn\n\n[[Page S3934]]\n\ngrowers and large farming conglomerates.\n  This is not to say other targeted commodity groups are completely \nleft out. A new mix of old and new subsidies flows in abundance in the \nfinal conference agreement, with $94 million in mandatory funding for \nmarket loss assistance for apple producers, $10 million in mandatory \nfunding for onion producers, $1.3 billion guaranteed for dairy \nproducers as a compromise for ending the Northeast Compact. Wool, \nmohair, and honey subsidies have been resurrected, which were phased \nout or eliminated in the 1996 farm bill.\n  I remember in 1996 we were so proud of the fact we finally eliminated \nmohair subsidies. We were so proud because mohair subsidies were put in \nduring World War I because mohair was deemed essential to the \nproduction of uniforms for the Army--uniforms for the doughboys of \nWorld War I. We finally got rid of it in 1996. And guess what. Like \nFreddie, it is back.\n  Honey subsidies have been resurrected; a new payment and loan program \nfor producers of dry peas and lentils; $500 million is secured for \nsugar growers, in addition to a continuing lucrative loan subsidy \nprogram.\n  I will talk about sugar for a minute. We are talking about wanting to \nhelp the poor countries in our own hemisphere. We are committed to \nhelping Africa with massive economic aid. Bono, the great musician of \nU2, made a crusade of assistance, particularly for Africa, and we are \ngoing to pour American tax dollars into these countries to help their \neconomies. Meanwhile, we are going to cut off every possibility they \nhave of making a go of their economies because we will not allow their \nproducts into the United States of America, whether they be textiles or \nwhether they be sugar.\n  Sugar is amazing. We have a couple guys down in Florida who control \nthis huge amount of sugar production, and they are able, through their \npolitical clout and massive campaign contributions, to have an enormous \nimpact on our protectionism. Meanwhile, we will borrow these products--\nwhether they be textiles from poor Central American countries or sugar \nfrom Caribbean countries--and then we will turn around and give them \neconomic aid, when really the best economic aid we could probably \nprovide to these nations would be to allow them to export their goods \nand products to the United States of America. The American consumer is \nthe one who would pay less for a pound of sugar, would pay less for \nsugar, would pay less for a pair of trousers or a shoe or a banana.\n  What have we done? We are costing the American average citizen, one \nwho is not a farmer, big or small, enormous amounts of money because we \nwill prop up a price, and because the agribusiness is by the small \nfarms, they will cultivate them and they will grow more products, there \nwill be more of a surplus, and we will, again, lift the subsidy, \ncosting the average citizen a lot more money. This is a vicious cycle \nwe are in. It is one that obviously is going to be very damaging for a \nlong time.\n  While proponents of this bill claim otherwise, the potential for \noverproduction may result in lower market prices, forcing Congress to \nonce again respond with emergency payments, forcing the United States \nbeyond the $19.1 billion annual limit agreed to in recent World Trade \nOrganization negotiations.\n  We have another problem with the bill. The WTO and other trading \npartners will not sit still for it. We will see some serious \nconfrontation between ourselves and our friends overseas and in this \nhemisphere, particularly in the WTO. There will be great legitimacy to \ntheir argument. What will happen is exactly what is happening now after \nwe bailed out the steel industry. We are going to see them slap tariffs \non our product, and we will see the average consumer, the average \ncitizen--not Archer Daniels Midland, not ConAgra, not Tyler Farms in \nHelena, AR, that got $23 million in cotton payments, not Seneca Harvest \nState Crop that got $9 million in wheat subsidy and $7 million in corn \npayments; it will be the average citizen.\n  We have a new payment and loan program for producers of dry peas and \nlentils, as I mentioned; $500 million for sugar growers; $204 million \nin mandatory funding for payments to bioenergy producers who buy \nagricultural commodities to expand production of biodiesel fuel, an \nadditive made from soybeans and ethanol; $650 million for the Market \nAccess Program, which taxpayers subsidize, a marketing program for for-\nprofit corporations on overseas advertising and promotion--I recall \none: Over $1 million which we are now spending to help convince people \noverseas to eat popcorn--establishment of a new peanut direct payment \nprogram at a cost of $3 billion; an additional $1 billion buyout \nprogram of the traditional peanut price support system.\n  All this new spending adds up to increased burdens for taxpayers, and \nit may threaten U.S. commitments through various trade agreements.\n  How can we say we are in favor of free trade when we are considering \nthis kind of massive farm subsidy? I have argued a long time on the \nfloor about catfish. A catfish is a catfish. Ask any scientific expert, \nany college professor. But we will call it by a different name so that \nwe can ``nail'' the Vietnamese and make sure our domestic catfish \nindustry is protected. And guess what. The price of catfish will be \nhigher for the average citizen.\n  In a letter to Senator Lugar, the Canadian Ambassador stated his \nconcerns about the direction of this bill:\n\n       The direction of the 2002 Farm bill is counterproductive to \n     the efforts of both Canada and the United States to achieve \n     shared objectives for global agricultural trade reform. . . . \n     Both the House and Senate versions of the Farm bill call for \n     significant increases in spending on trade-distorting forms \n     of support. It is also a concern that U.S. legislators are \n     considering reinstating abandoned production distorting \n     subsidies (e.g., honey), and extending them to new \n     commodities, such as peas and lentils.\n\n  This policy of subsidizing wealthy farming interests will have ripple \neffects throughout the developing world by stimulating overproduction \nand further driving crop prices down on world markets.\n  This farm bill already approaches $200 billion over 10 years, but \nwhen it is said and done, the final cost will be much higher not only \nfor the American taxpayer who must foot the bill but for the poor \nnations across the globe.\n  I have not seen in recent memory the unanimity as expressed by \nvarious newspapers across this country--the Washington Post: ``This \nTerrible Farm Bill'' and the Washington Post: ``House Farm Vote on Farm \nBill Carries Global Consequences.'' The Wall Street Journal, in their \nown reserved, understated way call it ``The Farm State Pig-out'' and \nthe Atlanta Journal: ``Farm Legislation Illustrates Worst In Corporate \nWelfare Reform.''\n  With President Bush and Senator Tom Daschle pushing the new farm \nbill, voters must understandably be lured into believing this is a \nwelcome sign of bipartisanship in our Nation's Capital. It is \nbipartisan already but hardly welcome. This is nothing more nor less \nthan pure porkbarrel spending, enough to keep partisans on both sides \nof the aisle happy. Despite public outcry and outrage at such \nprofligacy, the largest corporate welfare reform program in our country \nis now all but a done deal--it is a done deal.\n  ``How to Keep 'Em Down on the Farm: Subsidies; Congress: In Tribute \nto Agriculture lobbys' Clout, bill bumps funding 70%.''\n  Says the St. Paul Pioneer Press: ``A Three-Way Deal: Taxpayers Foot \nFarm Bill.''\n  Says the Washington Post: ``Show down on subsidies.'' Washington \nPost, May 2, 2002:\n\n       The farm bill that goes to the House floor for a final vote \n     today is coming under attack from U.S. trading partners, with \n     some experts warning that it could severely damage the \n     economies of poor countries and set back the Bush \n     administration's efforts to strike free-trade agreements.\n       ``This is an appalling signal to the world and the farm \n     bill is very, very bad for the international agriculture.'' \n     Warren Truss, Australia's Agriculture Minister, was quoted \n     saying on his country's national radio network. The United \n     States, he said, ``is telling other people to lower subsidy \n     levels but not doing the same thing itself.''\n\n  Before I conclude I would like to express my gratitude to my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Lugar, a man of virtue and reason with \nrespect to our Nation's agricultural policies, for the strong stance \nopposing this farm bill agreement. He alone acted in principled fashion \nfor this Senate body, first by offering a true reform proposal for farm \npolicy during Senate debate\n\n[[Page S3935]]\n\nwhich would have substantially reduced Federal farm payments and \ndirected assistance on a needs-based approach. He boldly proposed to \nphase out cherished sugar, peanuts, and dairy subsidies. He also \nsuggested that Federal assistance is more appropriately focused to \nthose farmers who genuinely need assistance. As a farmer himself, he \nwisely recognized the fallacy of unlimited and unchecked farm subsidies \nand as demonstrated by withholding his approval on this final \nconference agreement. I applaud him for his brave battle against \nentrenched farming interests.\n  It is easy for me to vote and speak against this bill. It is not so \neasy for Senator Lugar. I think he has displayed courage and wisdom and \npeople will grow to regret, over time, that we did not heed his words \nand respect and vote for his proposals. That is because we have a train \nwreck coming and that train wreck is going to cost the American \ntaxpayers a great deal in both quality of products as well as price.\n  I, obviously, will vote against the farm bill, and I do not think \nthis is one of the Senate's finest hours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has consumed 15 \nminutes. The ranking member controls 15 minutes; the chairman of the \ncommittee controls 4.5 minutes. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona for his thoughtful \ntribute. I appreciate very much the strength of his statement today. It \nwas timely and important for all Americans to hear.\n  I yield the floor. I anticipate perhaps one more speaker on our side. \nI reserve our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? Does the Senator from Iowa \nyield time?\n  Ms. CANTWELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Cantwell are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has just under 15 \nminutes. The Senator from Iowa has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The speaker I anticipated is not present and therefore I \nam delighted to hear from the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nelson of Florida are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I note there is no speaker on our side. I \nanticipated that perhaps the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nNickles, would be available. Therefore, I would suggest that a quorum \ncall be instituted--I suspect the time has already left on the \nDemocratic side, and there would be 13 minutes remaining on our side--\nand that this be allowed to run out. In the event that Senator Nickles \nappears, he might utilize the remainder of that time. Otherwise, we \nwill come to the conclusion of the debate on the farm bill today and \nwill be prepared for another vigorous session tomorrow.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask that the time be charged \nto our side. There will not be any time left. Otherwise, I suggest \nequal charging.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Four and one-half minutes \nremain to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I suggest the time be charged--I delay my request for a \nunanimous consent request and ask that the time remaining on our side \nbe yielded to the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield 12\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I wish to come to the floor and make a \nfew comments on the agriculture bill. First, I wish to compliment the \nSenator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar, for his statement today, for his \ncomments, and for his very astute recognition of some of the problems \nwe have in this bill.\n  I want to be in favor of an agriculture bill. I want to be in favor \nof a farm bill that is going to help farmers. Unfortunately, I think \nthis bill fails that test.\n  I look at this bill from a lot of different angles. I want to help \nagriculture. I think every Member in this body wants to help \nagriculture. But is this bill the right way to do it?\n  If we pass legislation that is going to greatly encourage production \nand have the Government paying for a lot of it and then drive prices \ndown, are we helping agriculture in the long run? I am afraid maybe we \nwill be hurting agriculture in the long run.\n  As a matter of fact, there is a study which is just coming out that \ntalks about the price of wheat going down for the next 5 or 6 years as \na result of this bill. This bill is a 6-year bill. We are just trying \nto get a handle on the cost of it. There is a new estimate coming from \nthe Congressional Budget Office that estimates the cost of this bill \ngreatly exceeds the estimates by a total of about $9 billion.\n  The level we were negotiating with the President on was $73 billion \nover present law over 10 years. Now we have the Congressional Budget \nOffice coming up and saying we find this is another $9 billion on top \nof the $73 billion, for a total of right at $83 billion over and above \npresent law.\n  In other words, we are saying present law wasn't doing enough to help \nagriculture. So there was a bipartisan agreement with President Bush \nthat would put in an additional $73 billion to help agriculture. That \nwas done. But evidently that wasn't enough because a new scoring came \nout indicating this busts that budget by an additional $9 billion. That \nis one reason to be opposed to it.\n  Then I look at what happened on the cost limitation. We passed an \namendment in the Senate in which I and others participated. It passed \nwith 66 votes. We said we want to have a payment limitation. Payment \nlimitations have grown dramatically. Years ago, we had payment \nlimitations of $40,000 or $50,000 per farmer. Yes, we found that \ndifferent people were skillful in their evasion of those limits. They \nhad multiple payments in their families and pyramid schemes. We tried \nto tighten that up.\n  Anyway, we had bipartisan support for an amendment, 66 votes that \nsaid: We want to have a limit of $275,000, and that would include \ncertificates. We adopted that with a big vote. We sent it to \nconference. And we come back to find the limit is not $275,000, it is \n$360,000. So it increased substantially over what we passed in the \nSenate. And, oh, incidentally, in the $360,000, they forgot to count \ncertificates.\n  Not to get too complicated, but any farmer who is listening to this \nknows what I am talking about. It means there is no limit. It means the \ndifference between the loan rate and the price you receive will not \ncount towards your total payment limitation of $360,000, so you could \nhave payments of $1 million.\n  Senator Lugar talked about, for his State, looking it up on the Web \nsite you could see that this would only apply to six or seven farmers. \nI looked for my State, and it would apply, frankly, to more than that. \nBut I find out there are a lot of farms where those payment limitation \nnumbers, that are posted by the environmental group, greatly exceed \nthat, because they run things through co-ops and other organizations \nthat do not show the payment limits, that are not attributing those to \nindividual families.\n\n[[Page S3936]]\n\n  So the point is, the Senate adopted an amendment that said: Let's \nhave a payment limitation of $275,000. The bill comes back with \n$360,000, and it has no limitation whatsoever on the certificates.\n  Then we have to look at the crops.\n  I heard Senator Lugar say earlier today: Does it make sense to have a \nprogram on cotton that has a current market price of 31 or 32 cents, \nand we have a target price of 72 cents? The difference is 41 cents. \nThat 41 cents is 131 percent of the market price. The Government is \ngoing to be paying more in subsidy than what the market is. The market \nis 31 or 32 cents, and the Government is going to be paying basically \nthe difference. The Government is going to be paying 41 cents for a \ntotal payment to the farmers of 72 cents per pound. That is an enormous \nsubsidy in cotton.\n  What about in rice? The average price is about $4.20 per \nhundredweight. The target price for rice is $10.50. So the Government \npayment is going to be $6.30, about 150 percent of the market price.\n  Does that make sense? And if you have the Government paying so much \nmore than what the market price is, we are greatly encouraging \nproduction of these commodities well in excess of what the market says \nwe should be doing, so we will be drowning in surpluses, keeping the \nprices low.\n  What about in wheat? In my State, we grow a lot of wheat. The market \nprice and the loan rate are just about the same. But the target price \nis $3.86. The market price is about $2.80. So it is a difference of \n$1.06. That is what the Government is going to pay. The Government is \ngoing to be paying 38 percent more than what the market price is for \nwheat.\n  Compare that to current law. It is about 16 percent of the market \nprice. Under current law, the Government pays about 46 cents per bushel \nin wheat. Under this bill, we will pay $1.06 per bushel. So that is \nover twice as much Federal subsidy per bushel.\n  You might say that is great for your State. It may benefit a few of \nour wheat farmers, but the net result is, collectively, nationally, \nwhat we are going to be doing is encouraging a lot of overproduction, \nand prices will continue all. As estimated by this one study, prices \nwill fall. Does that help wheat farmers in the long run? I do not think \nso. I do not think it is going to help them. The net result is, we are \ngoing to be putting a lot of people into bankruptcy.\n\n  Look at corn. For corn, you have a market price of $1.90, you have a \ntarget price of $2.60--a differential of 70 cents. That is 37 percent \nof the market price. The Government would be paying 37 percent more \nthan what the market would dictate we should be paying in corn.\n  Compare that to present law. The differential is 26 cents. So right \nnow the Federal Government is paying a 26-cent differential on the \nmarket price of corn. That is 14 percent. That more than doubles now to \n70 cents. So we are going to have more corn production. Somebody might \nsay that might be great for corn farmers. But guess what. You encourage \na lot of production in excess of demand and you are going to be \ndrowning in surpluses, and prices are going to fall.\n  So Government payments are going to go up. We are increasing a \nGovernment dependency system here that is broken. It needs to be fixed. \nBut instead of fixing it, we are making it worse. These Government \npayments are going to get bigger and bigger, and maybe people will see, \non Web sites, how much people are really making and come back to \nCongress and say: Wait a minute. Fix it. You should not be paying a few \npeople--and it is exactly a few people who are really going to be the \nbeneficiaries.\n  What we will have is a situation where the smaller farmers will be \nbought up by the big ones. The smaller farmers are not going to be able \nto make it. So this is going to exacerbate and accelerate the move from \nsmall farms to large corporate megafarms, and the megafarms are going \nto get the bulk of the money.\n  I think it has already been reported that the upper 10 percent of \nfarms are getting two-thirds of the cash payments out of agriculture. \nThat figure will increase. It will soon become where the upper 5 \npercent of farms will be getting 70 percent of all the money coming \nfrom this program; and maybe that figure will even climb from there.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a farm bill payment \ncomparisons table and a farm bill spending table be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      FARM BILL PAYMENT COMPARISONS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                             Wheat             Corn\n                                       ---------------------------------\n                                        Current   Conf   Current   Conf\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2001/2002 season average price........     2.80    2.80     1.90    1.90\nLoan rate.............................     2.58    2.80     1.89    1.98\nTarget price..........................      n/a    3.86      n/a    2.60\nDirect payment rate...................     0.46    0.52     0.26    0.28\nLoan deficiency payment...............  .......  ......  .......    0.08\nCounter cyclical payment rate.........  .......    0.54  .......    0.34\n                                       ---------------------------------\n    Total payment.....................     0.46    1.06     0.26    0.70\n    As a percent of market price......      16%     38%      14%     37%\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                      FARM BILL PAYMENT COMPARISONS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                             Rice            Cotton\n                                      ----------------------------------\n                                       Current   Conf   Current    Conf\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2001/2002 season average price.......     4.20    4.20   0.3140   0.3140\nLoan rate............................     6.50    6.50   0.5192   0.5200\nTarget price.........................      n/a   10.50      n/a   0.7240\nDirect payment rate..................     2.04    2.35   0.0556   0.0667\nLoan deficiency payment..............     2.30    2.30   0.2052   0.2060\nCounter cyclical payment rate........  .......    1.65  .......   0.1373\n                                      ----------------------------------\n    Total payment....................     4.34    6.30   0.2608   0.4100\n    As a percent of market price.....     103%    150%      83%     131%\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n           FARM BILL SPENDING--OLD BASELINE `VS' NEW BASELINE\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    Cost under\n                                    April 2001   Cost under\n               Year                   budget     March 2002   Difference\n                                    resolution    baseline\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2002.............................          2.5          2.5  ...........\n2003.............................          7.2          8.5          1.3\n2004.............................          8.8         10.4          1.6\n2005.............................          9.3         10.7          1.4\n2006.............................          8.9         10.1          1.2\n2007.............................          8.5          9.5          1.0\n2008.............................          7.2          8.1          0.9\n2009.............................          7.4          8.1          0.7\n2010.............................          6.9          7.6          0.7\n2011.............................          6.8          7.3          0.5\n                                  --------------------------------------\n  Total..........................         73.5         82.8          9.3\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. So there are lots of reasons to have concerns about this \nbill. I have mentioned the cost. I mentioned the enormous payments that \nwould be made to some. I mentioned the fact that the total cash \npayments to farmers is really nonexistent because we did not count \ncertificates. And then I look at the fact that we are getting \nagriculture in some areas where it really does not belong.\n  What in the world are we doing with an onion program? What are we \ndoing with subsidies for apples? And what are we doing reinstating a \nhoney program that we finally stopped? Why are we reinstituting a \nprogram for wool and mohair, which was created decades ago, and it \nreally is not necessary to have a national program?\n  Why are we subsidizing the purchasing of all kinds of commodities \njust to prop up prices? Again, Federal Government intervention is like \nwe do not believe in markets. And when we are talking about trade--and \nwe have a trade bill on the floor of the Senate that we will be \nconsidering in a couple days--it is like, oh, yes, half of our trade \nnegotiations are stuck in agriculture. For those who have not followed \nthis issue, agriculture is very difficult to deal with in trade \nnegotiations. We have just made it a whole lot worse.\n  When we tell people, let's open up markets and we can compete--and we \ncan compete in agriculture anywhere in the world--with this bill we are \nmaking it very difficult for our people. Those with whom we trade say: \nOh, yes, you say we shouldn't subsidize our farmers so much, but look \nhow much you are subsidizing your farmers.\n  So you are going to see greater and greater protectionism and greater \nand greater subsidies on both sides of the Atlantic--frankly, all \nacross the world--with more Government dependency everywhere.\n  Who will be the real losers? Certainly, the poor and developing \ncountries will be losers because they cannot afford to get into this \nkind of battle. And, frankly, the American taxpayers will be the losers \nas well because we will be writing a whole lot of checks to produce \ncommodities that we do not need and that the market is saying we do not \nwant. We produce so much more than we can consume, so we have to \nexport.\n  This bill is going to make it more difficult to export. So we are \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S3937]]\n\nbe drowning in our own surpluses. Market prices will fall further, and \nGovernment payments will go up. That is the net essence of this bill. I \nhate to say that. I wish that were not the case.\n  I have supported agriculture bills in the past, unlike some of our \ncolleagues in this Chamber. I would like to support an agriculture bill \nthis year. Unfortunately, I see this bill as taking a giant step in the \nwrong direction, a direction where people will not be farming, due to \nwhat the demand or the marketplace is dictating, but, frankly, a \nmarketplace dictated by Government, Government subsidies, Government \nlargesse, and, ultimately, Government control. This Senator believes \nthat is a mistake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. On this side. How much time on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I think all has been said that needs to \nbe said, at least for today, on this farm bill. I guess we are going to \nhave 6 more hours of saying it all over again tomorrow. So I see no \nneed to stay here any longer.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for \nyielding the time. This is extremely important legislation. As one who \nfrom time to time manages floor legislation, I recognize that it is \nimportant to keep the focus and attention on the pending subject \nmatter.\n  But I want to take a moment of the Senate's time to talk about \nanother issue which is important to the families in this country; that \nis, our education budget.\n  I take this moment now because we have had a series of actions by the \nadministration in recent days that brought new focus and attention on \nthe issue of education funding.\n  Money, in and of itself, is not going to answer the problems we are \nfacing in this country on any public policy issues, and it will not in \nthe area of education. But what we had last year was an education \nreform program that was worked on by Republicans and Democrats alike, \nthe No Child Left Behind Act. Prior to passage of the new law, there \nwas criticism of the federal education programs, that they were not \nresulting in the children developing academic skills and succeeding in \nour school systems across this country, and there was also a very \nfundamental understanding; and that is, while money alone will not \nsolve the problem, reform alone will not solve the problem. If you \nbring reform together with resources, you are going to fulfill a recipe \nfor progress for children in this country.\n  The reforms, which we spelled out in the new law, are raise standards \nfor students and teachers and hold schools and school districts \naccountable for results. It requires a great deal from the students, a \ngreat deal from the schools, a great deal from the parents, a great \ndeal from the local communities, additional responsibilities by the \nStates. We in Washington told them that we were going to be a partner \nin this endeavor to try to really make a difference in enhancing \nacademic achievement.\n  That was an endeavor on which many of us signed off. Many of us, who \nhave been here for a period of time, have raised some serious questions \nabout the seriousness with which our Republican friends are really \ncommitted to the areas of education and education reform. I remember, \nafter we saw Republican leadership take over in the Senate, as a result \nof the elections of 1994, one of the first actions they undertook was a \nrescission of some $1.7 billion in education funding that had already \nbeen appropriated for some of the neediest children in this country. We \nfought that. We fought it and fought it, but they had some success in \nrescinding funding. It was the same year the Republican leadership \nannounced they wanted to abolish the Department of Education.\n\n  I think most of us in this body wanted the Department of Education, \nfor one simple and fundamental reason; that is, every time the \nPresident brings a Cabinet together, we want to have someone at that \ntable who is the clear, powerful voice for children and enhanced \neducation and investing in the children of this country and their \neducation. That is what the a Secretary of Education should do. But \nthey wanted to abolish the Department of Education. They said we could \nhave many other Departments, and money in other areas of public policy. \nBut we resisted, and we saw that the Department was not abolished.\n  Then, if you can believe, in 1995, in the Republican budget \nresolution that came over from the House, they tried to effectively \neliminate over $18 billion in student loans support over a 7-year \nperiod. We were able to resist that, just as we resisted Republican \nefforts in 1981, when President Reagan initiated what they call an \norigination fee on student loans, an additional kind of payout. We were \nable to reduce that in a significant way. But students still pay too \nmuch up front to borrow money to go to college.\n  This is the record over a very considerable period of time. Three \nyears ago, we had the battle on the floor of the Senate on elementary \neducation, and there was a move to eliminate and support for 800,000 \nhomeless children, 800,000 migrant children, 800,000 immigrant children \nwho were going to be American citizens. The Republican leadership did \nnot want any coverage for them.\n  The American people have a certain hesitancy and a certain concern \nabout the legitimacy of the other side's real interest in investing in \neducation. The list of anti-education proposals from the other side \ncontinues to go on.\n  Just ten days ago, we saw the proposal by one of the leading \nauthorities in the administration, Budget Director Mitch Daniels, who \nsuggested a new way to shortchange students pursuing their college \neducation in this country, by effectively denying them the opportunity \nto go for the lowest-interest rates on student loans that long have \nbeen available to them. The Administration sought to require that \nstudents pay higher interest rates on their loans, rates which would \nmean, for the average student, more than $3,000 in additional expenses \nover the life of their loan. If that loan was $17,000, and repayment \nwere stretched over 30 years, it would be an additional $10,000 in \ncosts.\n  That is a very clear indication of how the Administration views \nsupport for higher education for students in this country.\n  Now, we find that the President is out traveling across the country \ntalking about the importance of funding education, understanding that \nwe need reform and that we also need resources.\n  Just yesterday, this is what the President said in Michigan:\n\n       The Federal Government has responsibilities. Generally, \n     that responsibility is to\n\n[[Page S3938]]\n\n     write a healthy check, and we did so in 2002--$22 billion for \n     secondary and elementary education. It's a 25 percent \n     increase. We've increased money by 35 percent for teacher \n     recruitment, teacher retention, and teacher pay.\n\n  I wish that had been their proposal, but it was not. It was not. \nTheir proposal was for a 3.5 percent increase, basically enough only to \ncover inflation despite the tremendous needs beyond inflation that our \nschools have. All of the difference between the 3.5 percent and what \nthe President identified here was the result of Democratic leadership \nin the Senate and the Appropriations Committee to get that increase.\n  Let's be fair. Let's be honest. Let's be candid in terms of it. That \nis the basic and bottom line. And all we have to do is say: Well, if \nthis really was their proposal last year, what happened to it this \nyear? This year, the administration proposes a 2.8 percent increase, \nagain inflation only. Why on the one hand would you go out and tell \npeople in Michigan that you provided $22 billion for elementary and \nsecondary education, a 25 percent increase, and a 35 percent increase \nfor teachers, recruitment for teachers for one year, and now come on \nback and propose a 2.8 percent increase.\n  Who is fooling whom? It was 3.5 percent last year, and the Democrats \nraised it to the figures the President talked about, and this year it \nis 2.8 percent. That is what is in the budget. That is what is in the \nbudget numbers.\n  It gets worse. Look at what the administration's budget is for the \nfuture, according to the last budget conference report. It provides \nvirtually zero new money for education for the next 8 years, all the \nway to 2011. They put forward funding to cover the cost of inflation, \nbut not a nickel above it. There it is, as shown on the chart, for the \nnext 8 years. For the next 8 years: a zero increase. We do not hear \nthem talking about that. We do not hear the President or the Department \nof Education or anyone for the President denying this. It is because \nthat happens to be it.\n  What we are saying is that we believe--believe deeply--that when you \nhave an over $2 trillion budget and you say education is your most \nimportant priority, outside of national security and the war on \nterrorism, we think you can do better on education than this. That is \nwhat the Democrats say. And that is what we want the American people \nwant. An over $2 trillion budget, and they can't do anything better \nthan a 2.8 percent increase. It doesn't even meet the challenges of \ninflation and growing school enrollment, never mind all our unmet \nschool needs.\n  So the schoolteachers who are out there now trying to upgrade their \nskills, as we have effectively required in last year's reform \nlegislation, so that we can have a well-qualified teacher in every \nclassroom, they are going to be denied the support. 18,000 fewer \nteachers who received training last year budget will go untrained next \nyear under the administration's budget.\n  Those children, whom we are asking to meet higher standards, who need \nthat extra help and assistance in the after-school programs with \ntutorials, they are going to find the doors are going to be closed to \nthem in the after-school programs. 33,000 children who received after-\nschool learning opportunities will be pushed out of programs next \nschool year under the administration's budget.\n  Why is it that at a time when the country has come together, and \nthere has been a great hullabaloo about the signing of the No Child \nLeft Behind Act--and I participated in it, and welcomed the \nopportunity, as others did in this body, to see that we were going to \ngive national focus and attention on the issues of education--we are \npulling the rug out from underneath this effort? Are we expecting that \nschools reform will be a success on a tin cup budget? It simply cannot \nbe done. Every schoolteacher, every parent understands that. Every \nschool board member, every principal, every superintendent understands \nit.\n\n  If we are going to leave no child behind, we cannot accept the \nAdministration's budget that provides services to just over a third of \nall the needy children eligible for Title I assistance. They leave \nalmost 6 million children behind. The Administration wanted to title \nour bipartisan school reform bill the No Child Left Behind Act. The \nlegislation laid out a glide path of funding so that we would provide \nsupplemental services for every needy child. That is what that \nlegislation stated. That is what the President signed. But you don't \nget there with this budget.\n  What we are basically talking about here is whether we are going to \nget the qualified teachers in underserved areas, areas with the highest \nincidence of dropout rates among Hispanic Americans and the highest \nnumber of unqualified teachers. That does not mean those teachers who \nare working today under extremely challenging and difficult conditions \ndon't want to be a part of this whole effort to upgrade skills. They \nwant to be. Give them a chance. Give them a fighting chance.\n  That is what last year's bill sought to do. It sought to give them a \nchance for certification. Give them a chance for training. Give them a \nchance for upgrading their skills. We have seen where it has been done. \nIt has been done down in North Carolina. It is being done in a handful \nof other States. We believe the Nation ought to be about it. That is \nthe policy that last year's bipartisan legislation committed us. That \nis what we are not living up to.\n  I hope we can try to get back to what we committed ourselves to and \nwhat we are fighting for here today. We have the opportunity at this \ntime to try to breathe new life into the pledge to leave no child \nbehind. We still have the appropriations process to go through. We \nwelcome a President who says: All right. We have looked through these \nfigures. We know we are fighting a war on terrorism. We know we are \nfunding homeland security. But by God, at the greatest times of \nAmerican history, we have not only fought overseas but we have invested \nhere at home. The place to start off that investment is going to be \nhere in the area of education. We are going to support those past \nefforts, those bipartisan efforts and make sure that the legislation \ncomes to life with an infusion of added and desperately needed \nresources.\n  We are going to continue to make our presentation, continue to make \nthis case day in and day out. We want to tell the parents in this \ncountry that when we were a part of voting for that legislation to \nenhance academic achievement and accomplishment, we said it was a \nnational priority and we meant it.\n  This administration's budget does not make education a national \npriority. So, we are going to fight for those families. We are going to \nfight here on the floor. We are going to fight during the \nappropriations process. We will take on the administration. But we are \nnot going to leave the children of this country behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3938-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3938-S3943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ENRON MARKET MANIPULATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, this morning I sent a letter to the \nAttorney General asking him to institute a criminal investigation \nagainst Enron and other energy companies. I will read that letter into \nthe Record.\n  The letter says:\n       Dear Attorney General Ashcroft: I am writing to ask that \n     you institute a criminal investigation to determine whether \n     federal fraud statutes or any other laws were violated by \n     Enron and other energy companies engaged in energy trading \n     and delivery of natural gas and electricity to the Western \n     Energy Market in 2000 and 2001.\n       In January, during a hearing before the Energy Commission I \n     asked Patrick Wood, Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission (FERC), to investigate whether Enron manipulated \n     prices in the Western Energy Market. The enclosed documents \n     released by FERC indicate that Enron was not only \n     manipulating prices in the West, but also engaged in a number \n     of calculated strategies such as ``Death Star,'' ``Fat Boy,'' \n     and ``Get Shorty'' to either receive payment for energy not \n     delivered or increase price. In my book, this is outright \n     fraud.\n       Since Arthur Andersen (the entire company) has been \n     indicted by the Justice Department for shredding documents, \n     it seems to me that Enron is at least as culpable, if not \n     more so, for creating certain schemes to perpetuate acts of \n     fraud on consumers under the guise of corporate strategies.\n       Because UBS Warbug has purchased Enron's trading entity, I \n     am particularly concerned that the same manipulative trading \n     strategies may continue to be in place today. I ask that you \n     launch a thorough investigation into this matter which may \n     well involve other energy companies that delivered energy \n     into the Western Energy Market in 2000 and 2001 and continue \n     to do so today.\n       Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n\n\n[[Page S3939]]\n\n\n  In the last 2 years I have listened to my colleagues, to FERC, and to \nenergy companies tell me that the California energy crisis was caused \nby inherent problems in California.\n  I have never disagreed that California's flawed energy deregulation \nlaws helped precipitate an energy crisis. But I have also always \nbelieved that energy companies took advantage of California and the \nrest of the West to manipulate the market and to drive up prices. There \nis simply no other way that energy costing $30 a megawatt hour at one \ntime, a few days later could cost $350 a megawatt hour.\n  On March 7, one of my colleagues in this esteemed House said the \nfollowing on the Senate floor to justify opposition to our futures \nderivatives amendment:\n\n       I have seen no evidence--in fact I will point out that \n     Chairman Greenspan has seen no evidence--that derivatives by \n     Enron, or by anybody else, had anything to do with the energy \n     spikes in prices in California.\n\n  So I would ask my esteemed colleague to read these documents which \nare today on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Web site and \ntell us if he can still say that.\n  These documents, released yesterday, are nothing short of \nastonishing. They discuss strategies with popular names such as Death \nStar and Get Shorty to describe in detail how energy prices can be \nmanipulated. And then there is a document, by a law firm, Brobeck, \nwhich attempts to justify the strategies.\n  I am not shocked to learn that this had occurred. I have been saying \nthis for a long time now. But the arrogance of documenting such illicit \nand underhanded behavior, and using popular titles for it, I think \nspeaks for itself.\n  Make no mistake about it, this is a smoking gun.\n  I ask unanimous consent these memoranda be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Brobeck, Attorneys at Law.\n  As part of our preparation for the various investigations and \nlitigation actually and potentially facing EPMI in connection with the \nCalifornia energy market, Jean Frizzell, Barrett Reasoner, Mike Kirby \nand Gary Fergus spent several full days over the past few months at \nEPMI for the purpose of learning and understanding more about the data, \nmethodology, the various strategies used by the traders and the \nimplementation of those strategies. This is a highly complicated \nsubject matter and all of us are still learning.\n  We used as our starting point the Preliminary Memorandum dated \nDecember 8, 2000, which we understand was prepared as the first step in \neducating you and outside counsel about EMPI trading practices. The \nPreliminary Memorandum was written by Steve Hall, an associate on loan \nfrom the Stoel Rives law firm, and co-authored by Christian Yoder, the \nin-house counsel at EMPI. Over the course of the past month, we have \nspent a fair amount of time with a number of traders. In some \ninstances, we met the same traders more than once to try and understand \nthe various practices. On January 11th, we spent another full day with \nTim Belden, chief trader for EMPI in Portland going over the strategies \nthat have been identified. Here is our summary of the status of our \nfurther investigation and present analysis of the EMPI trading \npractices:\n\n\n                                Overview\n\n       The California energy market during calendar year 2000 was \n     an incredibly complex and dynamic environment. Weather, \n     supply shortages, physical limits and market volatility \n     contributed to this environment. During the past month, we \n     have had several outside law firm lawyers, each with varying \n     degrees of experience with California electricity market, \n     work together with the EPMI traders to understand the market \n     and the practices. From time to time, the understanding of \n     and interpretation by the lawyers interviewing the same \n     traders about the market and the trading practices were \n     inconsistent. When that happened, we would go back to the \n     traders to try and gain a common understanding of the \n     particular market and trading strategy. At this point in the \n     process, we realize that there are very few clearly defined \n     trading strategies. Depending upon the particular \n     circumstances of the day, trading strategies were modified \n     and applied in response to EPMI's portfolio, market \n     conditions, the individual trader's understanding of them, \n     and the individual trader's preference within a large overall \n     framework. In part, this is because trading is done 7 days a \n     week for many different schedules (e.g. PX day ahead, PX day \n     of, ISO hour ahead, ISO real time etc.\n       EPMI is only one of the many market participants. We do not \n     have nearly enough information to gain a good understanding \n     of all of the impacts other participants, and whatever their \n     strategies might have been, had on the market. For these \n     reasons, you should consider this a work in progress, rather \n     than the definitive analysis of EPMI trading practices. We \n     may learn that some of the conclusions we have reached will \n     later turn out to be inaccurate. In fact, we learned during \n     this process that some of other information contained in the \n     Preliminary Memorandum, which resulted in some erroneous \n     assumptions and conclusions, cannot be supported by the facts \n     and evidence which are now known. In other instances, some \n     statements in the Preliminary Memorandum understandably mixed \n     trading strategies and schedules. In order to minimize the \n     risk of confusing matters further, we have taken the \n     additional step of having Tim Belden review this memorandum \n     to see if we have accurately described the trading practices \n     and to see whether he can spot any flaws in our analysis. We \n     tried to follow the same format of the Preliminary Memorandum \n     for easy cross reference.\n\n\n               ``Incing'' Load into the Real Time Market\n\n       ``Incing'' was a slang name (short for ``increasing'') for \n     a trading strategy used in response to the independently \n     owned utilities (IOU) well known and documented strategy of \n     significantly underestimating their load in the PX day ahead \n     market. This practice by the utilities apparently occurred \n     almost daily. Because the IOU's purchased their power through \n     the PX day ahead market, the PX thus became their scheduling \n     coordinator; the ISO's resulting schedules understated the \n     load for the next day. The IOU practice of underestimating \n     load artificially lowered the PX day ahead market clearing \n     price. Incing served to partially counteract the reliability \n     issues caused by this practice and, from the California \n     consumer's perspective, appears to have been preferable to \n     the alternative of selling outside of California. In \n     addition, incing may have increased the actual guaranteed \n     available supply of power in the California market depending \n     upon the shape of the demand curve. Incing reduced demand in \n     the ISO market, therefore reduced the ex post price and \n     potentially lowered the overall cost to California consumers. \n     When incing, EPMI was a price taker in the ISO ex post \n     market.\n\n\n                               Death Star\n\n       Death Star was a slang name for a strategy that addressed \n     congestion between northern and southern California. During \n     certain periods, there are transmission limits between \n     northern California and southern California on path 15 and \n     path 26. It appears that the source of the congestion may \n     have been the consistent underestimating of load by PG \n     same underestimating referred to above. Because the demand \n     was artificially lower in Northern California, it appears \n     supply was trying to move to southern California. By using a \n     combination of ISO approved scheduled counterflows and \n     alternative non-ISO transmission lines, EPMI increased the \n     transfer capability between the regions, reduced congestion, \n     and utilized underused pathways to increase the overall \n     supply of electricity in southern California. By virtue of \n     using multiple transmission paths, EPMI took on financial \n     risks, including having the transmission line derated, \n     assessment of additional congestion charges, and liability \n     for take or pay transmission charges on alternative \n     transmission lines to execute the strategy.\n       Contrary to certain statements in the Preliminary \n     Memorandum, congestion was relieved and energy did flow \n     through otherwise underutilized paths.\n\n\n                               Land Shift\n\n       Load shift is a general term used to describe a variety of \n     scheduling practices and trading strategies in the day ahead \n     and hour ahead markets. One variation of load shifting \n     involved scheduling ISO approved counterflows in the ISO day \n     ahead market, ISO hour ahead market or both. Generally \n     speaking, as an alternative to purchasing power in the north. \n     EPMI purchased power in the south and counterflowed that \n     power to the north. Such transactions had the effect of \n     providing congestion relief in the ISO day ahead market or \n     the ISO hour ahead markets. These transactions placed EPMI at \n     financial risk for the differences in price between the \n     regions.\n       Another category of load shifting involves shifting the \n     load on paths for which EPMI purchased firm transmission \n     rights. This category was briefly discussed in the \n     Preliminary Memorandum. We have learned more about his load \n     shifting strategy since the Preliminary Memoranda was \n     written. As the result of several in depth interviews with \n     the traders and review of the public market surveillance \n     reports available in the public and all market participants, \n     if is apparent that the assumptions and conclusions contained \n     in the Preliminary Memorandum were inaccurate. First, in \n     hindsight, it now appears likely that the load shifting \n     strategy, without knowing the impact of other market factors, \n     sometimes may have reduced the prices in the north while \n     leaving prices in the south unchanged or minimally impacted. \n     Second, it appears that the estimate of profits from this \n     load shifting strategy in the Preliminary Memorandum was\n\n[[Page S3940]]\n\n     vastly overstated and indeed confused. It would appear that \n     the source of the confusion may have been that the \n     Preliminary Memorandum reported the total profit attributable \n     of the EPMI firm transmission rights on path 26, as reflected \n     in ISO public documents, as opposed to any calculation of the \n     profit of this particular strategy.\n\n\n                               Get Shorty\n\n       ``Get Shorty'' was the slang name for a trading strategy \n     involving the provision of ancillary services in the PX day \n     ahead and ISO hour ahead markets. EPMI committed to providing \n     the ancillary services in the PX day ahead market and covered \n     its position by purchasing those services in the ISO hour \n     ahead market. Accordingly, EPMI actually purchased the \n     services necessary to provide ancillary services if called \n     upon to do so. In fact, the ISO regularly called upon EPMI \n     for ancillary services that were provided. Based upon the \n     information we have so far, there was only one incident \n     where EPMI failed to cover its position. In that single \n     instance, EPMI promptly offered to, and ultimately did, \n     return the payment received for the ancillary services \n     that were not provided. Accordingly, the strategy did not \n     impact the reliability of the grid. This strategy, \n     however, did place EPMI at financial risk. On a number of \n     occasions, It appears the cost to cover exceeded the \n     amount received in the day ahead market and EPMI provided \n     services to the ISO at a loss.\n       The Preliminary Memorandum incorrectly assumed that the \n     information provided to the ISO was inaccurate. It now \n     appears that, consistent with daily ISO practices, that EPMI \n     did not specify the source of the ancillary services at the \n     time of sale.\n\n\n                                ricochet\n\n       ``Ricochet'' was the slang term for a trading strategy that \n     existed because EPMI was not permitted to make adjustment \n     bids in SC to SC (scheduling coordinator) trades due to \n     limitations in the ISO software systems. Ricochet served the \n     dual purpose of allowing for adjustment bids and opening up \n     market options for EPMI including the supplemental and \n     bilateral markets. By using this strategy, EPMI was at \n     financial risk if the PX price exceeded either the \n     supplemental or bilateral market price. Furthermore, the ISO \n     software limitation forced EPMI to incur additional costs, \n     export charges, ancillary services on exports and line losses \n     on imports.\n       Ricochet appears not to have been a strategy that was used \n     to a significant extent when compared to EPMI's overall \n     portfolio. It appears that other market participants with \n     control areas adjacent to California and access to extremely \n     flexible generation resources may have relied more \n     extensively on this strategy.\n       At the present time, EPMI faces its own software \n     limitations in implementing ISO approved adjustment bids in \n     SC to SC transactions.\n\n\n                            non-firm export\n\n       This was a trading practice that involved scheduling \n     counterflows three hours ahead of the time energy would flow. \n     The schedule counterflow had the likely effect of reducing \n     the congestion charge on the scheduled path. Under this \n     strategy, EPMI qualified for the congestion relief payment \n     two hours before the scheduled flow. Ultimately, EPMI did not \n     flow the power. Based upon the information we have, this \n     practice does not appear to have had any demonstrable impact \n     on either the PX price or the ISO ex post price. However, in \n     August 2000, the ISO directed that the practice be \n     discontinued. The EPMI traders with whom we spoke confirmed \n     that EPMI has complied with that mandate.\n\n\n                 selling non firm energy as firm energy\n\n       This was a trading strategy that was occasionally used in \n     southern California to allow for the import of power that \n     would otherwise not be available. The net effect of this \n     practice, in conjunction with other market factors, was to \n     increase the overall supply with no apparent impact on PX \n     price. EPMI was subjected to financial risk in that if the \n     non-firm power was cut, EPMI would have to cover the energy \n     cut by purchasing that power in the ISO market at the ex post \n     price.\n       At this time, it appears that the net result of this \n     practice was to bring additional supply into California.\n\n\n         scheduling energy to collect the congestion charge ii\n\n       The net effect of this strategy was to schedule counterflow \n     thereby reducing congestion in hour ahead market. This was a \n     high risk strategy because EPMI was exposed to the ex post \n     market price that could exceed the congestion price. This \n     strategy could have potentially lowered the congestion charge \n     depending upon a wide variety of other market factors.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Stoel Rives LLP,\n\n                                                 December 8, 2000.\n     To: Richard Sanders\n     From: Christian Yoder and Stephen Hall\n     Re: Traders' Strategies in the California Wholesale Power \n         Markets/ ISO Sanctions\n\n     Confidential: Attorney/Client Privilege/Attorney Work Product\n\n       This memorandum analyzes certain trading strategies that \n     Enron's traders are using in the California wholesale energy \n     markets. Section A explains two popular strategies used by \n     the traders, ``inc-ing'' load and relieving congestion. \n     Section B describes and analyzes other strategies used by \n     Enron's trades, some of which are variations on ``inc-ing'' \n     load or relieving congestion. Section C discusses the \n     sanction provisions of the California independent System \n     Operator (``ISO'') tariff.\n\n\n                           A. The Big Picture\n\n     1. ``Inc-ing'' load into the real time market\n       One of the most fundamental strategies used by the traders \n     is referred to as ```inc-ing' loan into the real time \n     market.'' According to one trader, this is the `oldest trick \n     in the book' and, according to several of the traders, it is \n     now being used by other market participants.\n       To understand this strategy, it is important to understand \n     a little about the ISO's real-time market. One responsibility \n     of the ISO is to balance generation (supply) and loads \n     (demand) on the California transmission system. During its \n     real-time energy balancing functions the ISO pays/charges \n     market participants for increasing/decreasing their \n     generation. The ISO pays/charges market participants under \n     the schemes: ``instructed deviations'' and uninstructed \n     deviations.'' Instructed deviations occur when the ISO \n     selects supplemental energy bids from generators offering to \n     supply energy to the market in real time in response to ISO \n     instructions Market participants that increase their \n     generation in response to instructions (``instructed \n     deviation'') from the ISO are paid the ``inc'' price. Market \n     participants that increase their generation without an \n     instruction from the ISO (an ``uninsured deviation'') and \n     paid the ex post ``dec'' price. In real-time, the ISO \n     issues instructions and publishes ex post prices at ten-\n     minute intervals.\n       ``Inc-ing load' into the real market'' is a strategy that \n     enables Enron to send excess generation to the imbalance \n     energy market as an uninstructed deviation. To participate in \n     the imbalance energy market it is necessary to have at least \n     1 MV of load. The reason for this is that a generation cannot \n     schedule energy onto the grid without having a corresponding \n     load. The ISO requires scheduling coordinators to submit \n     balanced schedules, i.e., generation must equal load. So, if \n     load must equal generation, how can Enron end up with excess \n     generation in the real-time market?\n       The answer is to artificially increase (``inc'') the load \n     on the schedule submitted to the ISO. Then, in real-time, \n     Enron sends the generation it scheduled, but does not take as \n     much load as scheduled. The ISO's meters record that Enron \n     did not draw as much load, leaving it with an excess amount \n     of generation. The ISO gives Enron credit for the excess \n     generation and pays Enron the dec price multiplied by the \n     number of excess megawatts. An example will demonstrate this. \n     Enron will submit day-ahead schedule showing 1000 MW of \n     generation scheduled for delivery to Enron Energy Services \n     (``EES''). The ISO receives the schedule, which says ``1000 \n     MW of generation'' and ``1000 MW of load. The ISO sees that \n     the schedule balances and, assuming there is no congestion, \n     schedules transmission for this transaction. In real-time, \n     Enron sends 1000 MW of generation, but Enron Energy Services \n     only draws 500 MW. The ISO's meters show that Enron made a \n     net contribution to the grid of 500 MW, and so the ISO pays \n     Enron 500 times the dec price.\n       The traders are able to anticipate when the dec price will \n     be favorable by comparing the ISO's forecasts with their own. \n     When the traders believe that the ISO's forecast \n     underestimates the expected load, they will inc load the real \n     time market because they know that the market will be short, \n     causing a favorable movement in real-time ex post prices. Of \n     course, the much-criticized strategy of California's \n     investor-owned utilities (``IOUs'') of underscheduling load \n     in the day-ahead market has contributed to the real-time \n     market being short. The traders have learned to build such \n     underscheduling into their models, as well.\n       Two other points bear mentioning. Although Enron may have \n     been the first to use this strategy, other have picked up on \n     it, too. I am told this can be shown by looking at the ISO's \n     real-time metering, which shows that an excess amount of \n     generation, over and above Enron's contribution, is making to \n     the imbalance market as an uninstructed deviation. Second, \n     Enron has performed this service for certain other customers \n     for which it acts as scheduling coordinator. The customers \n     using this service are companies such as Powerex and Puget \n     Sound Energy (``PSE''), that have generation to sell, but not \n     native California load. Because Enron has native California \n     load through EES, it is able to submit a schedule \n     incorporating the generation of a generator like Powerex or \n     PSE and balance the schedule with ``dummied-up'' load from \n     EES.\n       Interestingly, this strategy appears to benefit the \n     reliability of the ISO's grid. It is well known the \n     California ISOs have systemically underscheduled their load \n     in the PXs's Day- Ahead market. By underscheduling their load \n     into the Day-Ahead market, the IOUs have caused the ISO to \n     have a call on energy in real time in order to keep the \n     transmission system in balance. In other words, the \n     transmission grid is short energy. By deliberately \n     overscheduling load, Enron has been offsetting the ISO's \n     real time energy deficit by supplying extra energy that \n     the ISO needs. Also, it should be noted that in the ex \n     post market Enron is a ``price taker,'' meaning that they \n     are not submitting bids or offers, but are just being paid \n     the value of the energy that the ISO needs. If the ISO did \n     not need the energy, the dec price would quickly drop to \n     $0. So, the fact that Enron was getting paid for this \n     energy shows that the ISO needed the energy to balance the\n\n[[Page S3941]]\n\n     transmission system and offset the IOU's underscheduling \n     (if those parties own Firm Transmission Rights (``FTR'') \n     over the path).\n     2. Relieving Congestion\n       The second strategy used by Enron's traders is to relieve \n     system-wide congestion in the real-time market, which \n     congestion was created by Enron's traders in the PX's Day \n     Ahead Market. In order to relieve transmission congestion \n     (i.e., the energy scheduled for delivery exceeds the capacity \n     of the transmission path), the ISO makes payments to parties \n     that either schedule transmission in the opposite direction \n     (``counterflow payments'') or that simply reduce their \n     generation/load schedule.\n       Many of the strategies used by the traders involve \n     structuring trades so that Enron gets paid the congestion \n     charge. Because the congestion charges have been as high as \n     $750/MW, it can often be profitable to sell power at a loss \n     simply to be able to collect the congestion payment.\n\n\n                  B. Representative Trading Strategies\n\n       The strategies listed below are examples of actual \n     strategies used by the traders, many of which utilize the two \n     basic principles described above. In some cases, the \n     strategies are identified by the nicknames that the traders \n     have assigned to them. In some cases, i.e., ``Fat Boy,'' \n     Enron's traders have used these nicknames with traders from \n     other companies to identify these strategies.\n     1. Export of California Power\n       a. As a result of the price caps in the PX and ISO \n     (currently $250), Enron has been able to take advantage of \n     arbitrate opportunities by buying energy at the PX for export \n     outside California. For example, yesterday (December 5, \n     2000), prices at Mid-C peaked at $1200, while California was \n     capped at $250. Thus, traders could buy power at $250 and \n     sell it for $1200.\n       b. This strategy appears not to present any problems, other \n     than a public relations risk arising from the fact that such \n     exports may have contributed to California's declaration of a \n     Stage 2 Emergency yesterday.\n     2. ``Non-firm Export''\n       a. The goal is to get paid for sending energy in the \n     opposite direction as the constrained path (counterflow \n     congestion payment). Under the ISO's tariff, scheduling \n     coordinators that schedule energy in the opposite direction \n     of the congestion on a constrained path get paid the \n     congestion charges, which are charged to scheduling \n     coordinators scheduling energy in the direction of the \n     constraint. At times, the value of the congestion payments \n     can be greater than the value of the energy itself.\n       b. This strategy is accomplished by scheduling non-firm \n     energy for delivery from SP-15 or NP-15 to a control area \n     outside California. This energy must be scheduled three hours \n     before delivery. After two hours, Enron gets paid the \n     counterflow charges. A trader then cuts the non-firm power. \n     Once the non-firm power is cut, the congestion resumes.\n       c. The ISO posted notice in early August prohibiting this \n     practice. Enron's traders stopped this practice immediately \n     following the ISO's posting.\n       d. The ISO objected to the fact that the generators were \n     cutting the non-firm energy. The ISO would not object to this \n     transaction if the energy was eventually exported.\n       Apparently, the ISO has heavily documented Enron's use of \n     this strategy. Therefore, this strategy is the more likely \n     than most to receive attention from the ISO.\n     2. ``Death Star''\n       a. This strategy earns money by scheduling transmission in \n     the opposite direction of congestion; i.e., schedule \n     transmission north in the summertime and south in the winter, \n     and then collecting the congestion payments. No energy, \n     however, is actually put onto the grid or taken off.\n       b. For example, Enron would first import non-firm energy at \n     Lake Mead for export to the California-Oregon border \n     (``COB''). Because the energy is traveling in the opposite \n     direction of a constrained line, Enron gets paid for the \n     counterflow. Enron also avoids paying ancillary service \n     charges for this export because the energy is non-firm, and \n     the ISO tariff does not require the purchase of ancillary \n     services for non-firm energy.\n       c. Second, Enron buys transmission from COB to Lake Mead at \n     tariff rates to serve the import. The transmission line from \n     COB to Lake Mead is outside of the ISO's control area, so the \n     ISO is unaware that the same energy being exported from Lake \n     Mead is simultaneously being imported into Lake Mead. \n     Similarly, because the COB to Lake Mead line is outside the \n     ISO's control area, Enron is not subject to payment of \n     congestion charges because transmission charges for the COB \n     to Lake Mead line are assessed based on imbedded costs.\n       d. The ISO probably cannot readily detect this practice \n     because the ISO only sees what is happening inside its \n     control area, so it only sees half of the picture.\n       e. The net effect of these transactions is that Enron gets \n     paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually \n     moving any energy or relieving any congestion.\n     3. ``Load Shift''\n       a. This strategy is applied to the Day-Ahead and the real-\n     time markets.\n       b. Enron shifts load from a congested zone to a less \n     congested zone, thereby earning payments for reducing \n     congestion, i.e., not using our FTRs on a constrained path.\n       c. This strategy requires that Enron have FTRs connecting \n     the two zones.\n       d. A trader will overschedule load in one zone, i.e., SP-\n     15, and underschedule load in another zone, i.e., NP-15.\n       Such scheduling will often raise the congestion price in \n     the zone where load was overscheduled.\n       The trader will then ``shift'' the overscheduled ``load'' \n     to the other zone, and get paid for the unused FTRs. The ISO \n     pays the congestion change (if there is one) to market \n     participants that do not use their FTRs. The effect of this \n     action is to create the appearance of congestion through the \n     deliberate overstatement of loads, which causes the ISO to \n     charge congestion charges to supply scheduled for delivery in \n     the congested zone. Then, by reverting back to its true load \n     in the respective zones, Enron is deemed to have relieved \n     congestion, and gets paid by the ISO for so doing.\n       e. One concern here is that by knowingly increasing the \n     congestion costs, Enron is effectively increasing the costs \n     to all market participants in the real time market.\n       f. Following this strategy has produced profits of \n     approximately $30 million for FY 2000.\n     4. ``Get Shorty''\n       a. Under this strategy, Enron sells ancillary services in \n     the Day-ahead market.\n       b. Then the next day, in the real-time market, a trader \n     ``zeroes out'' the ancillary services, i.e., cancels the \n     commitment and buys ancillary services in the real-time \n     market to cover its position.\n       c. The profit is made by shorting the ancillary services, \n     i.e., sell high and buy back at a lower price.\n       d. One concern here is that the traders are applying this \n     strategy without having the ancillary services on standby. \n     The traders are careful, however, to be sure to buy services \n     right at 9:00 a.m. so that Enron is not actually called upon \n     to provide ancillary services. However, once, by accident, a \n     trader inadvertently failed to cover, and the ISO called on \n     those ancillary services.\n       e. This strategy might be characterized as ``paper \n     trading,'' because the seller does not actually have the \n     ancillary services to sell. FERC recently denied Morgan \n     Stanley's request to paper trade on the New York ISO.\n       The ISO tariff does provide for situations where a \n     scheduling coordinator sells ancillary services in the day \n     ahead market, and then reduce them in the day-of-market. \n     Under these circumstances, the tariff simply requires that \n     the scheduling coordinator replace the capacity in the hour-\n     ahead market. ISO Tariff, SBP 5.3, Buy Back of Ancillary \n     Services.\n       f. The ISO tariff requires that schedules and bids for \n     ancillary services identify the specific generating unit or \n     system unit, or in the case of external imports, the selling \n     entity. As a consequence, in order to short the ancillary \n     services it is necessary to submit false information that \n     purports to identify the source of the ancillary services.\n     5. ``Wheel Out''\n       a. This strategy is used when the interties are set to \n     zero, i.e., completely constrained.\n       b. First, knowing that the intertie is completely \n     constrained, Enron schedules a transmission flow through the \n     system. By so doing, Enron earns the congestion charge. \n     Second, because the line's capacity is set to ``0,'' the \n     traders know that any power scheduled to go through the \n     inter-tie will, in fact be cut. Therefore, Enron earns the \n     congestion counterflow payment without having to actually \n     send energy through the intertie.\n       c. As a rule, the traders have learned that money can be \n     made through congestion charges when a transmission line is \n     out of service because the ISO will never schedule an energy \n     delivery because the intertie is constrained.\n     6. ``Fat Boy''\n       a. This strategy is described above in section A(1).\n     7. ``Ricochet''\n       a. Enron buys energy from the PX in the Day Of market, and \n     schedules it for export. The energy is sent out of California \n     to another party, which charges a small fee per MW, and then \n     Enron buys it back to sell the energy to the ISO real-time \n     market.\n       b. The effect of this strategy on market prices and supply \n     is complex. First, it is clear that Enron's intent under this \n     strategy is solely to arbitrage the spread between the PX and \n     the ISO, and not to serve load or meet contractual \n     obligations. Second, Ricochet may increase the Market \n     Clearing Price by increasing the demand for energy. \n     (Increasing the MCP does not directly benefit Enron because \n     it is buying energy from the PX, but it certainly affects \n     other buyers, who must pay the same, higher price.) Third, \n     Ricochet appears to have a neutral effect on supply, because \n     it is returning the exported energy as an import. Fourth, the \n     parties that pay Enron for supplying energy to the real time \n     ex post market are the parties that underscheduled, or \n     underestimated their load, i.e., the IOUs.\n     8. Selling Non-firm Energy as Firm Energy\n       a. The traders commonly sell non-firm energy to the PX as \n     ``firm.'' ``Firm energy,'' in this context, means that the \n     energy includes ancillary services. The result is that the \n     ISO pays EPMI for ancillary services that Enron claims it is \n     providing, but does not in fact provide.\n       b. The traders claim that ``everybody does this,'' \n     especially for imports from the Pacific Northwest in to \n     California.\n\n[[Page S3942]]\n\n       c. At least one complaint was filed with the ISO regarding \n     Enron's practice of doing this. Apparently, Arizona Public \n     Service sold non-energy to Enron, which turned around and \n     sold the energy to the ISO as firm. APS cut the energy flow, \n     and then called the ISO and told the ISO what enron had done.\n     9. Scheduling Energy To Collect the Congestion Charge II\n       a. In order to collect the congestion charges, the traders \n     may schedule a counterflow even if they do not have any \n     excess generation. In real time, the ISO will see that Enron \n     did deliver the energy it promised, so it will charge Enron \n     the inc price for each MW Enron was short. The ISO, however, \n     still pays Enron the congestion charge. Obviously a loophole, \n     which the ISO could close by simply failing to pay congestion \n     charges to entities that failed to deliver the energy.\n       b. This strategy is profitable whenever the congestion \n     charge is sufficiently greater than the price cap. In other \n     words, since the ex post is capped at $250, whenever the \n     congestion charge is greater than $250 it is profitable to \n     schedule counterflows, collect the congestion charge, pay the \n     ex post, and keep the difference.\n\n\n                             c. iso tariff\n\n       The ISO tariff prohibits ``gaming,'' which it defines as \n     follows:\n       ``Gaming,'' or taking unfair advantage of the rules and \n     procedures set forth in the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or \n     Activity Rules, or of transmission constraints in period in \n     which exist substantial Congestion, to the detriment of the \n     efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets. \n     ``Gaming'' may also include taking undue advantage of other \n     conditions that may affect the availability of transmission \n     and generation capacity, such as loop flow, facility outages, \n     level of hydropower output or seasonal limits on energy \n     imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that may \n     otherwise render the system and the ISO Markets vulnerable to \n     price manipulation to the detriment of their efficiency.'' \n     ISO Market Monitoring and Information Protocol (``MMIP''), \n     Section 2.1.3.\n       The ISO Tariff also prohibits ``anomalous market \n     behavior,'' which includes ``unusual trades or \n     transactions''; ``pricing and bidding patterns that are \n     inconsistent with prevailing supply and demand conditions''; \n     and ``unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports \n     from or exports to other markets or exchanges.'' MMIP, \n     Section 2.1.1 et seq.\n       Should it discover such activities, the ISO tariff provides \n     that the ISO may take the following action:\n       1. Publicize such activities or behavior and its \n     recommendations thereof, ``in whatever medium it believes \n     most appropriate.'' MMIP, Section 2.3.2 (emphasis added).\n       2. The Market Surveillance Unit may recommend actions, \n     including fines and suspensions, against specific entities in \n     order to deter such activities or behavior. MMIP, Section \n     2.3.2.\n       3. With respect to allegations of gaming, the ISO may order \n     ADR procedures to determine if a particular practice is \n     better characterized as improper gaming or ``legitimate \n     aggressive competition.'' MMIP, Section 2.3.3.\n       4. In cases of ``serious abuse requiring expeditious \n     investigation or action'' the Market Surveillance Unit shall \n     refer a matter to the appropriate regulatory or antitrust \n     enforcement agency.

Following such \n     complaint, the Market Surveillance Unit may ``carry out any \n     investigation that it considers appropriate as to the concern \n     raised.'' MMIP, Section 3.3.5.\n       6. The ISO Governing Board may impose ``such sanctions or \n     penalties as it believes necessary and as are permitted under \n     the ISO Tariff and related protocols approved by FERC; or it \n     may refer the matter to such regulatory or antitrust agency \n     as it sees fit to recommend the imposition of sanctions and \n     penalties.'' MMIP, Section 7.3.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This proves, for the first time, active and \npurposeful manipulation of the energy market in order to drive up \nprices and increase profits.\n  I thank the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for the \ninvestigation which took place and began subsequent to our hearing on \nJanuary 29 and my request to FERC that they conduct this investigation.\n  As Chairman Wood told the Energy Committee hearing: Sunlight is the \nbest disinfectant. I am very pleased that, under his leadership, FERC \nis now practicing what Mr. Wood has preached.\n  But take note that these documents have sat within Enron for the last \n18 months. This is 6 months after a subpoena was issued for them. And, \nfinally, after all this time, the Enron board decided it would release \nthe documents.\n  It is appalling that it took this long. It is precisely why the CFTC \nor FERC or some regulatory agency needs the authority to investigate. \nThat was an authority that the CFTC had until the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act was passed by this body in December of 2000.\n  That is the same month these documents were actually produced. It is \nexactly what Senator Cantwell, Senator Wyden, and I have been saying in \nthe Energy Committee for more than a year. Had our derivatives \namendment been in place, at least it would have ensured that for online \ntrades, a regulatory agency would have had access to these documents \nand would have been able to investigate right away. I hope the 50 of my \ncolleagues who voted against our energy derivatives amendment will \nreconsider their opposition.\n  Senator Harkin, who is present in the Chamber, the chair of the \nAgriculture Committee, has said he would take a look at our legislation \nand mark it up. I am once again calling on his committee to hold \nhearings and mark up our legislation as soon as possible.\n  Congress must pass legislation to reinstate CFTC authority to oversee \nenergy derivatives in the futures market and investigate fraud and \nmanipulation of energy producers.\n  What do these documents mean for California and the Western States? \nUntil now, FERC has never said it thought there was manipulation in the \nCalifornia and western energy markets. As such, it has taken a very \nconservative view with respect to refund proceedings, interpreting \n``just and reasonable'' doctrines and reviewing long-term energy \ncontracts. That means FERC-ordered refunds were very limited and very \ninsignificant relative to ``unjust and unreasonable'' costs. Now all of \na sudden the landscape has changed. Manipulated spot markets lead to \nforward markets that were also manipulated, and thus long-term \ncontracts also reflect unjust and unreasonable rates. So this means \neverything needs to be put back on the table by FERC.\n  I don't believe it was just Enron. I believe other companies were out \nthere doing the same or similar things. In fact, one document, a \nDecember 2000 memo from two Enron employees named Yoder and Hall to \nanother named Sanders, even fingers two other companies, Puget Sound \nand PowerEx, as having done the same thing.\n  These documents suggest that this may be beyond FERC at this point. \nThat is why I am calling for the Department of Justice to investigate \nthese memoranda, the companies, and other companies. I am also calling \non FERC to take another look at contracts signed by California and \nother Western States with energy companies to see if future prices of \nenergy were also manipulated by Enron. The evidence is now very clear \nthat this was in fact the case.\n  I am also asking FERC to take another look at the refund proceedings. \nThe evidence now exists that prices were unjust and unreasonable to a \nmuch larger extent than FERC had previously determined.\n  As my colleagues know, I have asked the Department of Justice to \ninvestigate, and here is why I believe there may well be outright \nfraud. There are three easy ways.\n  First, Enron sold power out of State and then bought it back. This \nenabled them to evade certain price caps and sell energy without a cap \nin order to receive a much higher price for their energy. This is \nreferred to as megawatt laundering.\n  Second, by knowing that transmission lines were constrained and \noversubscribed for a set hour, the company scheduled deliveries in \norder to get paid and not deliver. The net effect was that Enron got \npaid for moving energy to relieve congestion that they had no intention \nof actually ever moving.\n  Third, with simple sleight of hand, Enron could sell nonfirm energy \nto the power exchange as firm energy in order to get paid extra for \nancillary services in the firm contracts when Enron was actually \nselling nonfirm power.\n  There are other examples documented on the Web site. Some are much \nmore technical, with suspicious names such as Fat Boy, Get Shorty, and \nDeath Star. I am sure there are yet other ways to manipulate the \nsystem, and perhaps other companies figured out other ways to do it as \nwell.\n  I am also asking the Department of Justice to investigate the entire \nwestern energy market and those trading into it in the years 2000 and \n2001. If there ever was a bugle call to action to fix what was wrong \nwith the California and western energy markets from May of 2000 to June \nof 2001, this is it.\n\n[[Page S3943]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3943-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CUBAN BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I call to the attention of \nthe Senate a shocking Associated Press story that was filed yesterday \nafternoon. I have not had a chance to read the papers today, so I don't \nknow in which papers it was printed. This is a headline:\n\n       U.S. Official Says Cuba May Be Helping Rogue States With \n     Biological Weapons.\n\n  I am going to read the first two paragraphs of this AP story:\n\n       The Bush administration said yesterday it believes Cuba has \n     at least a limited offensive biological warfare program and \n     may be transferring its expertise to other countries hostile \n     to the United States.\n       We are concerned that such could support biological warfare \n     programs in those States, said U.S. Under Secretary of State, \n     John Boland.\n\n  This is of grave concern to the Nation. If the Bush administration \nhas hard evidence that Cuba is exporting biological weapons to our \nenemies, then the Bush administration should not just be making \nspeeches about it. They ought to be planning an action in consultation \nwith the Congress under the War Powers Act as to what to do about \nexporting biological agents to our enemies in this war on terrorism.\n  This would be absolutely unacceptable. What will the action be? That \nis where the consultation ought to be going on with Congress as to what \nthe administration is planning. Don't make a speech that the AP story \nsays was made to the Heritage Foundation. But, instead, let us talk \nabout what the means are of stopping the exports of biological weapons \nand biological agents that would be going from Cuba to other terrorist \nstates which are clearly out to do ill will to the interests of the \nUnited States.\n  Could it involve something more other than stopping the exports of \nbiological weapons? Yes, it could. But that is what the planning ought \nto be about instead of just making speeches to think tank foundations.\n  I think this is a matter of gravest concern. Certainly, we have \nsuspected, since Cuba is on our list of terrorist states, that this \nkind of activity might be going on. But, if it is, under the \nConstitution there ought to be consultation with the appropriate \ncommittees about any plans to protect the interests of the United \nStates and not the Assistant Secretary of State making a speech to the \nHeritage Foundation.\n  I wanted to call this to the attention of the Senate. It has \napparently not gotten much attention up to this point. I think it is of \ngrave concern to the United States. It is clearly in the interest of \nthe United States, if these weapons of mass destruction through \nbiological agents are being produced or researched in Cuba, that it be \nstopped forthwith, and certainly any export to other countries that \nwould do us harm should be stopped dead in its tracks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida for his statement. The whole area of weapons of mass \ndestruction is one of interest to me and to many Senators. Very \nclearly, the war against terrorism contemplates that we will be \nvigorous in trying to find the al-Qaida and other associates. But at \nthe minimum, we must make certain they do not have access to materials, \nlaboratories, or weapons of mass destruction, which would be \ncatastrophic, whether it be from Cuba or countries in the Middle East, \nthe Far East, Africa, or wherever.\n  Many of us have commented--including the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida--about the worldwide extent of their war effort. The President \nhas commented that it may be a long war for that very reason. I commend \nhim for his statement.\n  I am hopeful the relevant committees have been informed. Perhaps the \nleadership of the Senate has been informed. But if not, that should \noccur quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3943-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3943-S3946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MANIPULATION OF ENERGY MARKETS\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL.

Oppel Jr. and Jeff Gerth)\n\n       Washington, May 6.--Electricity traders at Enron drove up \n     prices during the California power crisis through \n     questionable techniques that company lawyers said ``may have \n     contributed'' to severe power shortages, according to \n     internal Enron documents released today by federal \n     regulators.\n       Within Enron, the documents show, traders used strategies \n     code-named Fat Boy, Ricochet, Get Shorty, Load Shift and \n     Death Star to increase Enron's profits from trading power in \n     the state--techniques that added to electricity costs and \n     congestion on transmission lines.\n       The documents--memorandums written in December 2000 by \n     lawyers at Enron to another lawyer at the company--also \n     describe ``dummied-up'' power-delivery schedules, the \n     submission of ``false information'' to the state, and the \n     effective increasing of costs to all market participants by \n     ``knowingly increasing the congestion costs.''\n       The memos, which provide the first inside look at the \n     complex trading strategies Enron used in California, give \n     strong ammunition to state officials who have long argued \n     that Enron and other power marketers manipulated the state's \n     market and played a crucial role in the crisis that cost \n     California consumers and utilities tens of billions of \n     dollars in 2000 and 2001. The documents state that other \n     power companies used similar techniques.\n       Tonight, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, \n     said she would ask Attorney General John Ashcroft ``to pursue \n     a criminal investigation to determine whether in fact federal \n     fraud statutes or any other laws were violated'' by Enron's \n     energy-trading activities. Federal prosecutors are already \n     conducting an inquiry into Enron's accounting, which falsely \n     increased reported profits but ultimately led to the \n     company's filing for bankruptcy protection in December.\n       Enron agreed to sell its energy-trading unit earlier this \n     year to UBS Warburg, a division of UBS, Switzerland's largest \n     bank. Nearly all of Enron's senior executives, and most of \n     its board members, have departed in the last nine months.\n       Enron's senior management learned of the documents in late \n     April, and the company's board decided during a meeting on \n     Sunday to waive attorney-client privilege and turn the memos \n     over to investigators at the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission, a person close to the company said. The company \n     has also informed the Justice Department, the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission and the attorney general of California \n     about the documents.\n       At a noon meeting today, lawyers for Enron gave the memos \n     to investigators from the regulatory commission, which is \n     examining whether Enron manipulated energy markets in the \n     West. The agency released the documents a few hours later. \n     Officials at the commission declined to comment, but they are \n     continuing their investigation into Enron's effect on power \n     prices and asked the company today to provide additional \n     documents on its electricity and natural-gas trading \n     activities.\n       In a letter sent by officials at the commission today to \n     Enron, investigators at the agency said the documents \n     described how Enron traders were ``creating, and then \n     `relieving,' phantom congestion'' on California's electricity \n     grid. The documents also detail what investigators described \n     as ``megawatt laundering,'' in which Enron bought power in \n     California, resold the power out of\n\n[[Page S3944]]\n\n     the state and then bought the power back and resold it back \n     into California--allowing Enron to circumvent price caps \n     meant to clamp down on costs.\n       ``These documents prove that these companies can manipulate \n     the market,'' said Loretta Lynch, the president of the \n     California Public Utilities Commission, ``Enron prevented \n     California from seeing these documents for years, and now we \n     know why.''\n       Ms. Lynch said the documents supported her argument that \n     FERC should leave in place temporary electricity price \n     restraints, introduced last June, which state officials say \n     have played a large role in reining in prices. ``I don't see \n     how FERC can remove the boundaries they put in place on our \n     market last June.''\n       An outside lawyer for Enron, Robert S. Bennett, said he \n     could not comment on the trading strategies described in the \n     documents. ``Because we have sold the trading unit and the \n     people with the knowledge of trading practices are no longer \n     with the company, we do not know what the true facts are, and \n     we do not know which parts of the memoranda are correct and \n     which parts are incorrect,'' Mr. Bennett said tonight.\n       But he emphasized that the company had agreed to waive that \n     attorney-client privilege because it was trying to cooperate \n     with the various investigations into Enron's business \n     practices. ``These memoranda came to the attention of the \n     board and current management in late April, and the board \n     instructed its counsel to not assert the attorney-client \n     privilege and produce these documents to the appropriate \n     government entities,'' Mr. Bennett said.\n       Another memo written by a separate group of lawyers for \n     Enron in 2001--apparently in January or February, after \n     soaring wholesale power prices in California pushed the \n     state's largest utilities to the brink of insolvency--tried \n     to play down the strategies described in the December 2000 \n     memos.\n       In this later memo, which as written to prepare Enron for \n     the ``various investigations and litigation'' it faced \n     because of the California power crisis, the lawyers \n     repeatedly tried to play down or cast doubt on the \n     conclusions drawn by Enron's own lawyers in the earlier \n     memos.\n       ``Some of the information'' in the earlier memos ``which \n     resulted in some erroneous assumptions and conclusions, \n     cannot be supported by the facts and evidence which are now \n     known,'' the later memo stated.\n       In one strategy described in the December 2000 memos, Enron \n     would buy power from a state-run exchange for $250 a \n     megawatt-hour--the maximum under the price caps--and resell \n     it outside California for almost five times as much.\n       ``Thus, traders could buy power at $250 and sell it for \n     $1,200,'' according to one memo. In that document, the Enron \n     lawyers acknowledged that such activity could be playing a \n     big role in causing electricity shortages in the state, but \n     they suggested that was not a significant concern.\n       ``This strategy appears not to present any problems,'' the \n     memo stated, ``other than a public relations risk arising \n     from the fact that such exports may have contributed to \n     California's declaration of a State 2 Emergency yesterday.''\n       The Death Star strategy, as described in the memos, allowed \n     Enron to be paid ``for moving energy to relieve congestion \n     without actually moving any energy or relieving any \n     congestion.''\n       And the Load Shift strategy allowed Enron to generate about \n     $30 million in profits in 2000 using techniques that, \n     according to the documents, included creating ``the \n     appearance of congestion through the deliberate \n     overstatement'' of power to be delivered.\n       In the past, Enron officials said the California power \n     crisis was caused by the state's deeply flawed electricity \n     deregulation plan, the lack of new power-generation capacity \n     and by temporary factors, like a drought that drastically \n     reduced available hydropower. Even some economists who think \n     price manipulation was widespread say these other factors \n     contributed to soaring prices.\n       But Enron executives always insisted that absolutely \n     nothing their traders had done contributed to the crisis. In \n     an interview last year, Enron's former chairman, Kenneth L. \n     Lay, dismissed accusations that manipulation was even partly \n     to blame for California's troubles.\n       ``Every time there's a shortage or a little bit of a price \n     spike, it's always collusion or conspiracy or something.'' \n     Mr. Lay said in the interview, Which was also taped for \n     ``Frontline'' on PBS. ``I mean, it always makes people feel \n     better that way.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 7, 2002]\n\n                 Memo Shows Enron Role in Power Crisis\n\n     (By Nancy Rivera Brooks, Thomas S. Mulligan and Tim Reiterman)\n\n       Enron documents released Monday show the company sought to \n     manipulate power prices in California, creating artificial \n     shortages through the use of aggressive trading tactics \n     during the energy crisis.\n       The disclosure by federal energy regulators marks the first \n     time that a company's own documents have provided clear \n     evidence of market manipulation, critics said, which \n     contribute to soaring prices and blackouts.\n       ``What we have here is a blueprint of . . . manipulation,'' \n     said Robert McCullough a Portland energy consultant and \n     economist. ``It's one thing for economists to state that \n     these things are happening. . . . It's another thing for \n     there to be internal documents on the table stating these \n     things are happening.''\n       The documents, uncovered as part of investigation by the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission into possible \n     manipulation of California's electricity market, are seen as \n     strengthening the state's hand in renegotiating costly long-\n     term contracts with electricity sellers that were reached \n     during the worst of California's energy crisis in 2001.\n       California Democratic Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne \n     Feinstein both called for a Justice Department investigation, \n     with Boxer saying the documents ``confirm what I've been \n     saying for months, that Enron manipulated the California \n     energy market and needs to be held accountable. It is high \n     time we see some indictments handed down in this case.''\n       Although Feinstein said the trading practices may violate \n     federal fraud statutes, energy experts saw the strategies as \n     infractions of market rules that are punishable by fines or \n     suspensions rather than criminal prosecution.\n       The state's grid operator has sought a variety of remedies \n     from FERC for such practices and received some relief in June \n     in the form of price caps throughout the West and other \n     mitigation measures.\n       Enron Lawyer Robert Bennett said company executives, under \n     new leadership after Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing, gave \n     the documents to the Government and waived attorney-client \n     privilege because ``they thought it was the right thing to \n     do. The truth of the matter is, we don't know what the \n     truth of the underlying facts are'' in the memos.\n       Power shortages sent prices skyrocketing in May 2000, which \n     pushed California's two largest privately held electricity \n     utilities to the edge of ruin, caused six days of statewide \n     blackouts and forced the state to buy power for more than 10 \n     million utility customers.\n       Enron and other power sellers have denied that they \n     manipulated prices or power supplies, contending that the \n     energy crisis was caused by a shortage of power plants and \n     hydroelectricity.\n       ``These documents make it clear that Enron was trying to \n     squeeze every dime it could out of the market. It's not \n     surprising that they violated [California Independent System \n     Operator] rules because the ISO don't provide much punishment \n     for violators,'' said Severin Borenstein, a UC Berkeley \n     professor and director of the UC Energy Institute.\n       One memo, dated Dec. 6, 2000, and prepared by an Enron \n     staff attorney and an outside lawyer in anticipation of \n     investigations and lawsuits, explained how Enron traders \n     exploited loopholes or market limitations to boost prices or \n     to wring special payments out of the agencies that operated \n     California's electricity markets.\n       Enron traders used such price-hiking techniques as sham \n     congestion on electricity lines or selling electricity to \n     out-of-state affiliates only to re-import it at higher \n     prices, the memo said.\n       One strategy, code-named Death Star, ``earns money by \n     scheduling transmission in the opposite direction of \n     congestion,'' the Dec. 6 memo said. ``No energy, however, is \n     actually put onto the grid or taken off.''\n       A second undated memo, written by a different law firm, \n     sought to cast a more favorable light on the strategies \n     discussed in the first memo.\n       The second memo defended the Death Star strategy, saying it \n     actually reduced congestion on electricity lines at times and \n     increased supply along underused electricity lines.\n       The Dec. 6 memo also claimed that other traders had begun \n     copying Enron's techniques, many of which have been \n     identified by California officials, although without \n     documented evidence.\n       ``These are the smoking guns we always alleged,'' said \n     Public Utilities Commission President Loretta M. Lynch. \n     ``These documents show their business plan was to game the \n     California market so they could suck every dollar out of \n     California.''\n       Department of Water Resources spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said \n     the department hopes the release of the Enron documents will \n     spur more companies to renegotiate dozens of long-term \n     contracts that DWR signed after it became the power buyer of \n     customers of financially troubled utilities.\n       The California Independent System Operator, which runs \n     California's last remaining official energy market, has asked \n     FERC to grant the state $9 billion in refunds because prices \n     charged in 2000 and 2001 were unreasonable, although the \n     regulators now are considering a lower payment.\n       The quirks of the California energy market presented Enron \n     and other market participants with myriad opportunities to \n     take profitable advantage.\n       California had two markets: a ``day-ahead'' auction market \n     through the California Power Exchange--``The PX,'' in trader \n     lingo--and the ``real-time'' market run by Cal-ISO.\n       Traders quickly found ways to play the two markets off each \n     other.\n       The day-ahead market was supposed to handle the bulk of the \n     electricity requirements, and the real-time market was meant \n     only to correct occasional imbalances.\n       When the crisis hit, the real-time market grew in \n     importance and was the locus of wild price swings.\n       Buyers and sellers who wanted to participate in the real-\n     time market were required to submit to Cal-ISO daily \n     schedules of their production and their ``load,'' or the \n     amount\n\n[[Page S3945]]\n\n     of power they intended to use. The two were supposed to be in \n     balance.\n       But sometimes when power supply was tight, Cal-ISO paid \n     participants a premium when they happened to provide more \n     power than Cal-ISO required.\n       One of Enron's basic strategies, according to the memo, \n     involved deliberately overstating its load. It would deliver \n     as much power as promised but then use less than scheduled \n     and get a premium for the difference.\n       Another Enron stratagem was to take advantage of congestion \n     in the real-time market that Enron had helped create in the \n     day-ahead market, the memo said.\n       During the energy crisis, the amount of power scheduled for \n     delivery into the California market sometimes exceeded the \n     capacity of the system's transmission lines.\n       At such times, Cal-ISO would make ``congestion payments'' \n     to market participants that either schedule transmission in \n     the opposite direction or reduce their generation/load \n     schedule.\n       ``Because the congestion charges have been as high as $750/\n     MW [per megawatt], it can often be profitable to sell power \n     at a loss simply to collect the congestion payment,'' the \n     memo said.\n       Enron traders, acknowledged as among the industry's most \n     creative, worked a number of variations on these two themes. \n     In addition to Death Star, other colorful nicknames for \n     trading methods included Get Shorty, Ricochet and Fat Boy to \n     identify them in discussions with traders from other firms.\n       California imposed price caps to cope with the emergency, \n     but even these offered an opportunity for clever traders who \n     realized that prices weren't capped in neighboring areas that \n     were affected by the crisis.\n       On Dec. 5, 2000, for example, prices soared to $1,200 per \n     megawatt-hour in the Pacific Northwest, while a $250 cap was \n     in place in California.\n       Enron traders saw that they could lock in an instant $950 \n     profit for each megawatt-hour of electricity by buying power \n     on the California PX and selling it up north, according to \n     the memo.\n       ``This strategy appears not to present any problems, other \n     than a public relations risk from the fact that such exports \n     may have contributed to California's declaration of a Stage 2 \n     emergency yesterday,'' the memo said.\n       Cal-ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said some of the \n     behaviors probably caused prices to rise, but the grid \n     operator does not believe they contributed to the six days of \n     blackouts in early 2001. The reason, she said, is that the \n     blackouts were caused by a severe shortage of power, not by \n     phantom congestion.\n       Cal-ISO has asked FERC to extend market protections that \n     are due to expire Sept. 30, including a price cap on \n     electricity in the West.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 7, 2002]\n\n            Papers Show That Enron Manipulated Calif. Crisis\n\n                            (By Peter Behr)\n\n       Enron Corp. manipulated the California electricity market \n     with such maneuvers as transferring energy outside the state \n     to evade price caps and creating phony ``congestion'' on \n     power lines, according to internal Enron documents released \n     yesterday.\n       The techniques described in two memos written by lawyers \n     for Enron in December 2000 were given names such as ``Fat \n     Boy,'' ``Death Star,'' ``Get Shorty'' and ``Ricochet.'' The \n     company turned the documents over to federal regulators, who \n     made them public.\n       The evidence of their use contradicts denials Enron made at \n     the time and provides impetus to several investigations of \n     the bankrupt energy giant's role in the California crisis.\n       Operators of California's power system ordered rotating \n     blackouts on six days early in 2001. That followed a tenfold \n     surge in power prices that began the previous summer, hitting \n     the state's utilities with billions of dollars in excess \n     electricity charges.\n       Details of Enron's financial problems came to light months \n     after the California crisis. ``These documents confirm what \n     we have known for some time, through circumstantial evidence: \n     They show internal corporate strategies for manipulating the \n     market,'' said California state Sen. Joseph Dunn (D), who \n     heads a legislative committee investigation into the power \n     crisis the state suffered a year ago.\n       U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she will ask the \n     Justice Department to launch a criminal investigation of \n     power sales in California.\n       The ``ricochet'' strategy was used to evade wholesale price \n     controls on California electricity by transferring power out \n     of the state and then back in.\n       Another maneuver took advantage of dramatically higher \n     prices that California energy officials were willing to pay \n     to get emergency supplies during shortages, the Enron \n     documents say.\n       The ``Death Star'' strategy is described as permitting \n     Enron to be paid ``for moving energy to relieve congestion \n     without actually moving any energy or relieving any \n     congestion.''\n       The reports were sent to Richard Sanders, Enron's vice \n     president and assistant general counsel, in preparation for \n     lawsuits arising from the California crisis. Sanders, who is \n     still with Enron, could not be reached for comment yesterday.\n       A third, undated memo, prepared by different lawyers in \n     consultation with a senior Enron trading executive, took \n     issue with the first two reports, concluding that some of the \n     trading strategies ``may have increased'' power supplies.\n       Energy analyst Robert McCullough said the memos indicate \n     that Enron traders deliberately tried to create the \n     appearance of shortages and congestion, prompting \n     declarations of power blackouts that need not have been \n     ordered in some cases.\n       State officials complained during the crisis that \n     electricity suppliers were manipulating the state's \n     deregulated power markets. Under political pressure last \n     spring, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed \n     temporary electricity price ceilings on California and \n     neighboring western States.\n       That action, coupled with favorable weather and an economic \n     slowdown, sent electricity prices plummeting last summer, \n     ending the power crisis.\n       FERC officials and energy companies are still locked in a \n     battle over the amount of refunds owed to California because \n     of overcharging.\n       Enron said the documents released yesterday were spotted \n     recently by company officials who took office after Enron's \n     Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing, the largest such filing in U.S. \n     history.\n       As correspondence between Enron and its attorneys, the \n     documents has previously been marked confidential and had not \n     been given to Federal and State investigators.\n       Enron attorney Robert Bennett said Enron managers concluded \n     that the documents should be turned over, and in a telephone \n     conference call Sunday, Enron's board agreed.\n       ``This board and the current management wants to be fully \n     candid with Congress and other Government entities and to do \n     the honorable and responsible thing,'' Bennett said.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, these articles show what consumers in \nmy State have thought all along, that these prices were being \nmanipulated. That is why in January of this year I asked the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission to investigate these high prices that have \nliterally cost people jobs, made consumers pay as much as 60-percent \nrate increases, and have made it tough for our economy in Washington \nState to continue to thrive with these high energy prices in some \nindustries such as aluminum and other intensive energy businesses.\n  Yet what has happened--I do not know if other people in the country \nrealize this--is our consumers may end up paying these high rates for \nmany years, even though Enron has gone bankrupt. The reason is that the \ncontracts these companies have had with Enron are as many as 5-year to \n7-year--in some cases 8-year--contracts which were negotiated at the \ntime of this crisis and very high prices. In fact, energy prices--the \nrates were as much as 1,000 times higher during this crisis.\n  Consumers hear there were memos with names such as Fat Boy or Death \nStar or Get Shorty or Ricochet that were really plans by this company \nto manipulate prices. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should \nact upon these memos and basically find that these rates have, in fact, \nbeen manipulated. That is right, on the west coast, both in California \nand in Washington and in Oregon, prices were manipulated and because of \nthose unjust and unreasonable rates these Northwest entities should be \nlet out of these long-term Enron contracts.\n  I believe that is critically important for us in the Northwest, who \nmay face even further rate increases in the future because of these \nhigh energy costs, and the fact that the Bonneville Power \nAdministration, for example, would be let out of these contracts, it \nmight save as much as $250 million to $300 million just in the costs \nthat BPA has to pay. Instead, they would be able to go out on the \nmarket, not paying the high Enron prices, but go out on the market \ntoday and get cheaper electricity prices.\n  I cannot tell you how important it is for us. My colleague from \nWashington, Senator Murray, and Senator Feinstein, Senator Boxer, \nSenator Wyden, and Senator Smith--we have all spoken on this issue and \nhow it impacts the whole west coast. It is critically important that \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission take the information they have \ndiscovered in their investigation and make this decision on unjust and \nunreasonable rates as soon as possible.\n  I believe the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ought to use its \npower to void long-term contracts with unjust and unreasonable rates. I \nalso believe we need new Senate hearings to review these findings and \nto explore all available options for ratepayer relief under federal \nlaw.\n\n[[Page S3946]]\n\n  I would also like to add my voice to that of my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, and my colleague from Washington, \nSenator Murray, in calling for a criminal investigation by the \nDepartment of Justice into allegations that Enron has manipulated \nprices in the Western electricity markets.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the Western electricity crisis of 2000 \nand 2001 has taken a tremendous toll on the economy of my state, and of \nOregon and California. As a result of electricity prices that spiraled \nto as much as 1000 times the normal rates, consumers throughout the \nWest have paid dearly. They have paid in their utility bills--which \nhave been raised as much as 60 percent--and they have paid with job \nloss in communities that have seen entire industries shut down.\n  Madam President, throughout the Western electricity crisis, I joined \nwith many of my Western colleagues in asking the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission (FERC) to step in and do its job--to ensure just \nand reasonable rates. For many months, FERC refused and assured many of \nus that the Western power crisis was simply the result of drought and a \nshortage of electricity--a shortage that many of us raised questions \nabout, given that it seemed to materialize over night.\n  FERC and this administration repeatedly denied what many of the \nimpacted citizens in Washington state knew intuitively to be true--that \nour Western markets were being manipulated by a handful of companies \nthat drew enormous profits directly from their pockets and from the \ncoffers of their businesses.\n  With the collapse of Enron, Senator Bingaman, chairman of the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, wisely called a hearing to \nassess the bankruptcy's impacts on the energy markets. At this hearing, \non January 29, I asked FERC Chairman Pat Wood to take a close look at \nallegations that Enron have been manipulating markets. In a letter sent \nthat same day, I wrote:\n\n       Congress and our nation's consumers-particularly those of \n     the Pacific Northwest, who have suffered through retail rate \n     increases of up to 50 percent over the past year-deserve to \n     know whether Enron was manipulating Western power markets at \n     their expense. After Enron collapsed, prices in the West's \n     forward energy markets plummeted by 20 to 30 percent. Where \n     there's smoke there's often fire, and we must investigate \n     whether we have a simple coincidence here, or something more. \n     The public deserves answers and, if appropriate, corrective \n     action.\n\n  In response to my request, FERC opened a staff investigation on these \nallegations. And late yesterday, this investigation revealed the first \nreal smoking gun. Now posted on the Commission's Website, you will find \nmemos in which attorneys from Enron outline their strategies for \nmanipulating prices in Western markets.\n  This has real, direct impacts on consumers in my state. During the \nheight of the crisis, many utilities in my state signed long-term \ncontracts with Enron at prices that looked like deals at the time--in a \nseverely dysfunctional market--but today, are two to three times \ncurrent market rates. The Bonneville Power Administration, for example, \nwhich provides 60 percent of all the power consumed in my state, is on \nthe hook for $700 million worth of Enron contracts over the next few \nyears. In today's market, these contracts would be half as costly. \nNevertheless, Bonneville and the consumers of the Northwest continue to \nbe held hostage. They continue to pay Enron. At the conclusion of this \ninvestigation, I hope that FERC will see to it that justice is done. If \nmarkets were manipulated--as the evidence now suggests--Washington \nState consumers should be given relief from these contracts.\n  In addition to these ongoing FERC proceedings, I do hope the Justice \nDepartment will open a criminal investigation into Enron's actions to \nmanipulate electricity prices and defraud consumer-ratepayers.\n  But I also look forward to this body exercising what I believe is \nnecessary continued oversight. This morning, at an Energy and Natural \nResources Committee hearing, Senator Bingaman and I discussed the \npossibility of a hearing on these issues. I also believe that the \nJudiciary Committee may be an appropriate forum for discussing the \nantitrust component of these allegations.\n  But in addition, I hope my colleagues--and particularly those who \nwill serve on the Energy bill conference committee--will pay close \nattention to what this means for our nation's electricity markets. \nDuring the debate on that bill, I offered a consumer protection \namendment to the electricity title that I believe would have prevented \na recurrence of the Western energy crisis and incorporated many of the \nlessons we have learned--and continue to learn--from Enron's collapse. \nMy amendment suggested that before FERC was allowed to open up markets \nlike California to deregulation, it should have to establish clear \nmarket rules, have in place the mechanisms necessary to monitor markets \nto detect manipulation. It would have directed FERC to take decisive, \ncorrective action to protect consumers when abuses do occur. And it \nwould have given FERC and state utility commissions the access to books \nand records they would need to discover evidence like the memos we have \nnow found in this Enron investigation, almost two years after the \nenergy crisis began and after months of business closures and rate \nhikes across the West.\n  I hope Attorney General Ashcroft will heed our call today. I look \nforward to continuing our oversight of this issue in the Energy \nCommittee, and I hope our conferees will consider this new evidence--\nthat Enron has been manipulating power markets--as they consider the \nenergy bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3946-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DECISION TO ``UNSIGN'' THE ROME STATUTE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I come to the floor to express my \ndisappointment with the Bush Administration's decision to unsign the \nRome Statute, and withdraw the United States from the process of \ncreating an international criminal court.\n  We are told this decision was made in order to protect American \ntroops and American sovereignty from a faceless international \nbureaucracy. Unfortunately, it does the opposite. In fact, this \ndecision vastly decreases our ability to shape the ICC, ignores the \nfact that the ICC will come into existence regardless of whether we are \ninvolved or not, and raises the specter of unilateralism just as we \nwill be turning to our allies for help in a series of crucial policy, \ndiplomatic--and perhaps military--undertakings.\n  Administrations since President Truman have supported the \nestablishment of a criminal court to try the worst crimes against \nhumanity. Reasonable people can disagree about the merits of the Rome \nStatute. Like many of my colleagues, I have some concerns about its \njurisdiction and potential impact on U.S. forces deployed overseas.\n  I do not, however, think the consequences of simply walking away from \nthe Statute should be ignored. Instead of asserting our leadership, we \nare abdicating it. Instead of shaping the court to serve our interests, \nwe have relinquished our seat at the table and removed ourselves from a \nposition to shape it at all.\n  This is especially disappointing, Madam President, when you consider \nthe simple fact that the ICC will still come into existence in July. \nThat was made clear in New York on April 11, when the 60th nation \nratified the Rome Statute, putting it into effect. To date, 64 nations \nhave ratified the statute. Only one--the United States--has withdrawn.\n  When it comes time to pick prosecutors and judges, which it will do, \nwe will not be at the table. And when it comes time to consider rules \nof evidence, which it will do, our voices will be absent.\n  But let's consider also exactly who some of those 60 are--Britain, \nCanada, France, Italy and Spain, all NATO allies, all currently \nfighting side-by-side with our troops in Afghanistan and the Balkans. \nAnd all whom we hope to count on in future conflicts in our war on \nterrorism.\n  Yesterday afternoon, our Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues \nsaid that America had ``washed our hands [of the ICC]. It's over.'' If \nit were only so, Madam President. We did not put the ICC out of \nbusiness. But we did take ourselves out of the action--and out of a \nposition to influence the ICC. The decision to unsign was the wrong \ndecision at the wrong time and, most troubling of all, not in keeping \nwith the American national interest.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3947-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3947]]\n   HONORING THE 2002 AAA SCHOOL SAFETY PATROL LIFESAVING MEDAL AWARD \n                                WINNERS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I am proud to announce to the Senate \ntoday the names of the young men and women who have been selected to \nreceive special awards from the American Automobile Association. Six \nsafety patrollers will receive the 2002 AAA School Safety Patrol \nLifesaving Medal Award, the highest honor given to members of the \nschool safety patrol. They are in Washington, DC, today to receive \ntheir awards, and I wanted to say how proud we are of them all.\n  There are roughly 500,000 members of the AAA School Safety Patrol in \nthis country, helping in over 50,000 schools. Every day, these young \npeople ensure that their peers arrive safely at school in the morning, \nand back home in the afternoon.\n  Most of the time, they accomplish their jobs uneventfully. But, on \noccasion, these volunteers must make split-second decisions, placing \nthemselves in harm's way to save the lives of others. The heroic \nactions of this year's recipients exemplify this selflessness.\n  The first AAA Lifesaving Medal recipient comes from Alexandria, MN.\n  On January 11, 2002, 12-year-old Kathryn DelZoppo, a captain on St. \nMary's Catholic School Safety Patrol, was at her post with four other \npatrol team members. Even though the duty period was almost over, \nKathryn remained alert and kept watch over her team.\n  As one member of the team approached a busy intersection, a child ran \npast him, into the street, and into the path of a swiftly approaching \nvehicle. Thinking fast, Kathryn grabbed the child's jacket and pulled \nhim back to the safety of the curb.\n  This year's second AAA Lifesaving Medal honoree comes from Manassas, \nVA.\n  On September 20, 2001, Weems Elementary School Safety Patrol Ernesto \nNavarrette, age 11, was on duty at the bus circle with six other \npatrols and a teacher. Ernesto scanned the area for possible safety \nhazards as students climbed onto their buses.\n  A pick-up truck parked in the grass nearby began to back up, but no \none could hear the truck's engine over the noise of the children and \nbuses. Only Ernesto saw the truck backing up toward a fellow patrol \nmember, who had her back to the moving truck. He yelled to the patrol \nto move out of the way. She did, just in time.\n  The next AAA Lifesaving Medal winners come from Lancaster, OH.\n  On November 21, 2001, Sandersen Elementary School Safety Patrols \nJustin Wright, age 13, and Ethan Trush, age 12, were on duty on \nopposite sides of a crosswalk outside their school. After checking for \noncoming traffic, Justin and Ethan allowed a third grader to cross the \nstreet.\n  Just then, a car left the school grounds, speeding and fishtailing as \nit approached the crosswalk. Ethan spotted the car just as the younger \nstudent reached the middle of the crosswalk. He yelled out a warning to \nJustin and then quickly moved to safety. Justin immediately dashed into \nthe road and pulled the third grader out of the street, barely escaping \nbeing hit by the oncoming car.\n  The fifth AAA Lifesaving Award recipient comes from Westfield, NJ.\n  On October 16, 2001, Franklin Elementary School Safety Patrol Matthew \nPrintz, age 11, was at his usual post outside the school with fellow \npatrols and a school crossing guard.\n  Signaling traffic to continue, the crossing guard called to the \npatrols to hold back any students approaching the intersection. Just as \ntraffic began to move, however, a student stepped around Matthew and \ninto the street. Matthew immediately grabbed the strap of the student's \nbackpack and pulled him out of the street just in time to avoid being \nhit.\n  The sixth AAA Lifesaving Award honoree is from Fairfax, VA.\n  On March 7, 2002, 11-year-old Greg Whitaker, captain of the Fairhill \nElementary School Safety Patrol, was walking with a first-grade student \ntoward their homes after fulfilling his school bus patrol duties.\n  A man pulled up in his van and blocked the boys' path. The man got \nout of his van and started to ask the little boy several questions, \nincluding where he lived. Greg immediately said in a loud voice, ``We \nneed to go home!'' He took the first-grader's hand, and walked the boy \ndirectly home. Before the van pulled away, Greg committed the license \nplate number, the van, and the driver to memory.\n  Safely home, Greg called his patrol sponsor for further guidance. The \nsponsor called the local police, and was told there was a warrant out \nfor the man's arrest. Greg's quick thinking and courage saved himself \nand the younger boy from a wanted felon.\n  In addition to honoring safety patrollers with the Lifesaving Medal \nAward, AAA also recognizes the School Safety Patroller of the Year. \nThis award is presented to patrollers who perform duties above and \nbeyond their normal responsibilities and demonstrate outstanding \nleadership, dependability, and academic strength.\n  This year, the Safety Patroller of the Year goes to Kaitlin \nMcLoughlin, age 14, an 8th grader and Safety Patrol Captain at Our \nShepherd Lutheran School in Birmingham, MI.\n  Usually, students have to be in eighth grade to be a safety patrol \ncaptain. Kaitlin was allowed to join a year early, however, after \nsubmitting an impressive essay and completing an interview process. She \nwas also chosen captain of her patrol team the following year.\n  Kaitlin's principal describes her as ``dependable, clear thinking, \ncalm, and well-respected by students and teachers alike.''\n  Kaitlin's responsibilities include keeping a weekly record of her \nsafety squad, raising and lowering the school flag, and keeping track \nof the safety belts and ponchos. When she is on duty, she is \nresponsible for locking one of the school doors after the final bell \nrings in the morning. She must also organize her squad and assign duty \nstations monthly.\n  Recently, the faculty chose Kaitlin to attend the Birmingham Optimist \nClub breakfast for outstanding area students. She has also served as a \nkindergarten and computer classroom aide, and assisted with photography \nfor the school website.\n  Kaitlin is co-captain of the cheering squad, vice-president of the \nstudent council, co-chairman of the 7th-8th grade dance, and sings in \nthe choir. She is Mistress of Ceremonies for the school talent show and \nserves as hostess for Lutheran Schools' Week. Kaitlin also works with \nthe local food bank and on various school fundraisers. She is active in \nher church youth group, cheerfully volunteers her services when asked \nand often seeks out other opportunities to serve.\n  She and all of the other AAA winners deserve our thanks and applause.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I extend congratulations and thanks to these \nyoung women. They are assets to their communities, and their families \nand neighbors should be very proud of their courage and dedication.\n  I would also like to recognize the American Automobile Association \nfor providing the supplies and training necessary to keep the safety \npatrol on duty nationwide.\n  Since the 1920's, AAA clubs across the country have been sponsoring \nstudent safety patrols to guide and protect younger classmates against \ntraffic accidents. Easily recognizable by their fluorescent orange \nsafety belt and shoulder strap, safety patrol members represent the \nvery best of their schools and communities. Experts credit school \nsafety patrol programs with helping to lower the number of traffic \naccidents and fatalities involving young children.\n  We owe AAA our gratitude for their tireless efforts to ensure that \nour Nation's children arrive to and from school safe and sound. And we \nowe our thanks to these exceptional young men and women for their \nselfless actions. The discipline and courage they displayed deserves \nthe praise and recognition of their schools, their communities and the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3947-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3947-S3948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SUZANNE PEARSON RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Madam President, today I have submitted an amendment to \naddress the treatment of certain American industries by Andean nations. \nSpecifically, I am concerned with the detrimental effect the Colombian \ngovernment's use of the price band system, as it applies to pet food, \nis having on the U.S. pet food industry and the farmers who provide the \nraw materials used in the production of pet food. As a Senator from \nGeorgia, this issue is of particular concern to the poultry farmers in \nmy State who supply a large amount of the poultry and poultry byproduct \nused in the production of pet food for export to Colombia.\n  I note that the Andean Trade Promotion and Expansion Act requires a \ncountry to demonstrate a commitment to undertake its obligations under \nthe WTO before it can be designated a beneficiary country. It appears \nthat Colombia's application of the price band system as it applies to \npet food is a violation of Colombia's WTO obligations. Pursuant to the \nWTO, a developing nation, such as Colombia, is required to request and \nbe granted a ``reservation'' if it is going to impose the price band \nsystem on a particular product. The Colombian government failed to \nacquire a reservation for either wet or dry pet food. Therefore, \nColombia's application of the price band system to pet food is in \nviolation of the WTO.\n  It is my expectation that in reviewing the eligibility criteria \nrelating to market access and WTO commitments, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative will insist that Colombia implement its WTO commitment \nto remove wet and dry pet food from the price band system, and apply \nthe 20 percent common external tariff to imported pet food as required \nby Andean Community law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3948-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, since trade-promotion authority lapsed in \n1994, America has stood on the sidelines while other countries have \nbrokered trade agreements that benefit their workers, their businesses, \nand their economies. Soon after taking office, President Bush called on \nCongress to grant him trade-promotion authority to reassert America's \nleadership in promoting U.S. goods and the expertise of our workforce \nto more markets. The House has acted, the Senate Finance Committee has \nacted, and it is now time for the full Senate to deliver.\n  Exports accounted for more than one-fourth of U.S. economic growth in \nthe 1990s. Jobs depending on exports pay wages that are an estimated 13 \nto 18 percent higher than the national average. One in ten American \nworkers, 12 million people, work at jobs that depend on exports of \ngoods and services. Trade is good for American farmers and ranchers. \nTrade is good for American small businesses. At the most basic level, \ntrade is essential to our country's economic growth and prosperity. \nYet, every day that America delays, other countries throughout the \nworld are entering into trade agreements without us, benefitting their \nworkers, their farmers, their businesses and their economies at the \nexpense of ours.\n  Our competitors in Europe, Asia, and Latin America have sealed deals \non approximately 130 preferential trade compacts, many within our own \nhemisphere. Yet the United States is party to only three, with Canada \nand Mexico, Israel and Jordan. Without trade-promotion authority, the \nUnited States, would not be able to build on the many robust economic \nrelationships we share with other countries throughout the world.\n  One such country is Australia. There are few larger, stronger, or \nmore open economies with which the United States can negotiate a \nbilateral free trade agreement than Australia. Annual two-way trade \nbetween the United States and Australia is valued at $28 billion, \nsupporting thousands of jobs in each country. The United States is \nAustralia's largest source of imports and Australia's second largest \nexport market. Everyone can agree that an Australia-United States Free \nTrade Agreement would only enhance this fruitful relationship.\n  Aside from being one of our closest friends and allies, Australia is \na strategic trading partner in the Asia-Pacific Region. Clearly, we \nhave a mutual stake in expanding our market presence in this region, \nand a U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement would set a benchmark for \nother trade agreements in the future. It would not only send a message \nthat we are serious about the principle of open markets, but it would \nshow what trade-promotion authority can deliver. This is just one \nexample of why we need trade-promotion authority, but it is reason \nenough, and it speaks to why we must act now. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in support of trade-promotion authority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3948-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

They have volunteered 20 times \nin an after school program for homeless children at the Whitney Houston \nSchool, visited the Brookhaven Health Care Center to uplift patients' \nspirits, and have already volunteered a total of 600 hours towards this \nproject. The group has also collected 150 new toys to be given during \nthe holiday season and collected over 1,500 canned goods and perishable \nfoods for needy families and a local food pantry. Besides gathering \nthese material goods, the Community Problem Solving Team has been able \nto contribute fiscally.

In the coming weeks the group plans to \npresent a high school senior in their community, whose sister was \ntragically struck and killed by a stolen automobile, a scholarship \ncheck to help her further her education.\n  Through the efforts of these grade school children, many members of \ntheir community are now living happier lives.

Madam President, I rise today to honor Steve \nLovato, an outstanding individual who lost his life in service to \nothers.\n  Steve Lovato was an EMT known for his strong work ethic and his \nhelpfulness to others. His coworkers praised him for his dedication to \nthe job, and he was well recognized for his service to the community.\n  Being an EMT, Steve knew that the financial reward would not be \ngreat. He would often face many dangers that are inherent with the job. \nHowever, Steve liked doing what was right and worked as an EMT because \nhe wanted to help people. That is why it saddens me to know of the \ntragic loss of this noble individual.\n  Nearly two months ago, Steve and his partner, Margie Muccie, \nresponded to a 911 call where a man, Paul Freeman, had been injured by \na burning home. While trying to give Mr. Freeman medical attention, the \nmentally unstable individual pulled out a gun and shot and killed \nSteve. He also killed Roswell Fire Chief, Louis Jones, and his good \nSamaritan neighbor who had called for help, Randy Houghton. Randy's son \nwas also critically injured by Mr. Freeman.\n  This terrible event has had a profound effect on the community of \nRoswell. It has also deepened my resolve to address issues that affect \nthe mentally ill. I have long worked to help people who suffer from \ndiseases of the brain, and I believe that better treatment options for \nMr. Freeman could have prevented this terrible tragedy. I will continue \nto seek out the best possible ways to help those that suffer from \nmental illness.\n  Steve made the ultimate sacrifice in service to others; he lost his \nlife in the line of duty. I am proud to have represented a man like \nSteve, and I send my heartfelt condolences to his wife, Josephine, and \nhis son, Alex. He went above and beyond the call of duty and showed \nunparalleled compassion for his fellow man. I am proud to honor him \nhere today and to know of his heroic efforts.\n  I also wish to express my greatest sympathies to the friends and \nfamilies of Louis Jones and Randy Houghton.

LOLA V. GIBBS' 100TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I would like to set aside a \nmoment to reflect on the life of Mrs. Lola V. Gibbs, a longtime \neducator, community and civic leader. She has made a lasting impact on \nthe generations of people and the communities she has touched. Today, I \nrise to celebrate her 100 years of life.\n  Born the only daughter of Tabitha and George Gibbs on Easter Sunday, \n1902, Lola enjoyed a childhood home filled with the laughter of foster \nchildren. Her family owned a farm, and together Lola and her father \nplanted vegetables and tended to crops. At the age of seven, Lola began \nher education in a one-room schoolhouse. She attended high school at \nState College, graduating in a class of four. It was the degree she \nearned from the larger West Chester Normal College, in the company of \nother African Americans, which shaped the woman she would become.\n  Lola was assigned to Reeves Crossing School, teaching students in her \nhometown school in Woodside. Inspired by the excitement of her pupils, \nshe became interested in 4-H. Before long, she organized the Woodside \nSilver Leaf 4 H Club, which was quickly recognized throughout the state \nfor excellence. She would be a 4-H leader for 55 years.\n  Lola married Edward, whom she met at West Chester Normal, in the \nspring of 1931. They wed in her rose garden and honeymooned in \nWashington, DC. In September 1936, Lola and Edward were blessed with \ntheir son Edward B. Gibbs, Jr.\n  Never complacent, Lola Gibbs went back to college. With her son just \na year old, she enrolled in classes and earned a second degree before \nreturning to Woodside to run her own classroom again. Lola's students \nspanned four grades. When attendance dropped, she moved to a two-room \nschoolhouse in nearby Viola, instructing children, many of whom she had \ntaught before- in grades four, five and six. She organized another 4-H \nclub, called the Viola Jolly 26. The club quickly became the largest in \nDelaware.\n  Upon her retirement, Lola V. Gibbs was appointed president of the \nKent County Teachers Association. In the years that followed, she \nbecame active in the Eastern Star, AARP and the Women's Auxiliary of \nthe Smyrna Home for the Critically Ill.\n  A life member of Star Hill AME Church, Lola focuses much of her \nenergy on the success of the congregation's Historical Society. Both \nher church and her community were stops on the Underground Railroad. \nBoth benefit from her pride in her heritage.\n  Lola V. Gibbs is an active, independent woman of many talents and \ngifts. She has four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. In \n2000, Mrs. Gibbs renewed her driver's license, driving her Ford station \nwagon throughout Kent County, DE. Until just a few years ago, she \ncontinued to play the organ for her church.\n  Today, I rise both to celebrate Lola's one hundred years and the life \nshe breathes into her community. To her grandchildren and great-\ngrandchildren she will leave a legacy of determination, tenacity, and \nkindness. With pride in her students, her family, her heritage and her \ncommunity, she is living proof that a life filled with good works is a \ngood life indeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3949-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LOUIS WYMAN\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I rise today to \npay tribute to my personal friend, former judge and United States \nCongressman, Louis Wyman, who passed away Sunday, May 6. Louis, who was \n85, was involved in one of the closets races in United States Senate \nhistory.\n  Louis left a lasting legacy. His legacy of country, state and family, \nwill not soon be forgotten by those of us whose lives he touched so \ndeeply. He was a loving husband, father and grandfather to his wife \nVirginia, his children Jo Ann and Louis II, and two grandchildren.\n  Louis Wyman was elected to serve in the United States Congress from \nNew Hampshire's 1st Congressional District in 1962. Louis served five \nterms in the House of Representatives before deciding to run for the \nSenate in 1974. In the closest race in Senate history, Louis won the \nseat by only 2 votes. He served briefly in the Senate, after which a \nspecial election was held and John Durkin was awarded the seat.\n  In 1938 Louis graduated from the University of New Hampshire with \nhonors and from Harvard University Law School, in 1941, cum laude. \nLouis was named attorney general of New Hampshire in 1953, and in 1957 \nwas elected president of the National Association of Attorneys General. \nHe returned to the State over the course of many years to practice law.\n  Louis' impact on the State of New Hampshire will not be forgotten. He \ntouched many lives over the years through his many judicial and \npolitical pursuits. Louis was instrumental in preventing the closure of \nPortsmouth Naval Shipyard. Citizens of the Granite State were fortunate \nto have such invaluable aid.\n  While serving on the sub-committee of defense, Louis was an effectual \nsupporter in the development of the F-18 fighter jet and the AEGIS \nMissile. During this time, Louis was a leader in the early funding for \nthe moon landing project.\n  From the hallways of Capitol Hill to the law offices of New \nHampshire, Louis Wyman touched many lives, and left his mark in U.S. \nSenate history. He will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3949-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3949-S3950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNITION OF MAYOR TOM MENINO'S ACCOMPLISHMENT TO LEAD THE U.S. \n                          CONFERENCE OF MAYORS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I am proud to join in celebrating \nan extraordinary milestone for my friend, Mayor\n\n[[Page S3950]]\n\nTom Menino, an honor shared by all the people of Boston who have \nbenefitted from Tom's remarkable leadership in our city. A reflection \nof all that he has accomplished and continues to achieve, Mayor Tom \nMenino ascends to the position of President of the U.S. Conference of \nMayors. I am proud to join his family, staff and colleagues across the \ncountry in congratulating him as he embarks on this new challenge.\n  Since his election as Mayor in 1993, Tom Menino has been tireless in \nhis efforts to make the nation's greatest city even stronger. As he \nbegins his term as President of the Conference, mayors from across the \ncountry will find in Tom a friend and a national trail blazer as the \nchief spokesperson and leader of their efforts.\n  Tom Menino's record of achievement already serves as a blueprint for \nour nation's cities; in 2001 he was recognized by Governing Magazine as \n``Public Official of the Year,'' dubbing him the ``Main Streets \nMaestro.'' Mayors from cities from Houston, Detroit to Philadelphia \nhave come to Boston to study Tom's approach to governing, and each has \nreturned to their own city and implemented a piece of Boston's success \nstory. After a recent Boston visit, Mayor O'Malley returned to \nBaltimore to open an Office of Neighborhoods, borrowing a page from the \nMenino play book.\n  But it is in the neighborhoods of Boston where the results of his \nhands-on management style are most visible. In places like Grove Hall \nand Jackson Square, new businesses are starting up, community \ndevelopment corporations are working hand-in-hand with the Mayor to \njump start new developments and rehabilitate old buildings, and small, \nlocally-owned businesses are flourishing in all corners of the city.\n  But do not take my word for it, just look at the statistics: Crime \nrates are dramatically lower than 10 years ago; the public school drop-\nout rate has been cut in half during Tom's time in office; and almost \n70 percent of Boston's high school graduates continue on to college. \nMayor Menino's work on behalf of the children of Boston reflects a long \nterm commitment that reaches far into the future: He has almost doubled \nthe number of immunized children; launched a youth literacy campaign \nthat has been replicated in over 100 other U.S. cities; and Tom Menino \nis the first mayor of a major city to completely wire the school system \nto the Internet. Mayor Menino has partnered with the Ten Point \nCoalition and other violence prevention groups to create successful \nprograms like Operation Ceasefire and ``2 to 6'', that target the \ncity's at risk youth with activities and structure during those crucial \nafter school hours.\n  I am proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Tom Menino as we move \nahead and continue our work together on improving public schools, \nincreasing the availability of affordable housing and making our \nstreets as safe as they can be. He is a dedicated and talented public \nservant, one whom I am fortunate to call a colleague and friend, and I \njoin the whole Massachusetts delegation and mayors across the State in \ncongratulating him on his Presidency of the U.S. Conference of \nMayors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3950-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING DR.

Shely.\n  At the recently held 53rd Annual Awards Dinner of the Campbellsville/\nTaylor County Chamber of Commerce, Dr. Shely was named ``Citizen of the \nYear.'' Dr. Shely was duly recognized for his unwavering commitment to \nfamily, church, career, and community. He has been a devoted and loving \nhusband for 55 years. He raised five wonderful children of his own and \nis currently the proud grandfather of eight and great-grandfather of \nfour. Dr. Shely has also been a key figure in his church for many \nyears, serving as a Deacon, Sunday School teacher, and Gideon. \nThroughout his career in medicine, Dr. Shely has touched thousands of \nlives delivering babies, healing the sick, and comforting the dying. \nFinally, Dr. Shely serves on the university board of trustees, the \nCitizens Bank board, the library board, the Rotary Club and is the past \npresident of the hospital medical staff.\n  To say that Dr. Forest F.

GEORGE HIGGINS, AMERICA'S ``LABOR PRIEST''\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, when I learned of the death of \nMsgr. George G. Higgins, I was saddened to lose a friend and one of the \nmost passionate workers' advocates of our time.\n  For half a century, Msgr. Higgins was the workers' priest. He was a \nleading advocate of workers rights, but his interests went beyond labor \nto issues of justice and peace, human and civil rights, discrimination. \nThrough his writings and teachings, he helped show the connections \nbetween these vital issues and his deep faith.\n  He left his mark on the lives of America's workers through his roles \nas writer, lecturer, lobbyist, negotiator, and leader. It is said that \nMsgr. Higgins never turned down an invitation to a labor meeting if he \nwas able to be there. He was no stranger to picket lines, stopping by \nto lend an inspirational word to workers and to show his support.\n  Msgr. Higgins played a central role in the negotiations between grape \ngrowers and the newly unionized farm workers in the early 1970s. United \nFarm Workers leader Cesar Chavez said in 1980 that no one in the \ncountry did more for farm workers than Msgr. Higgins.\n  He played a key role as a liaison between the independent Polish \nlabor union Solidarity and American unions at a time when Solidarity \nwas struggling for its very survival in the early 1980s.\n  In 2000, President Clinton awarded him the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, for his commitment to \nworkers' rights, civil rights and religious tolerance. Last year, he \nwas conferred the University of Notre Dame's prestigious Laetare Medal.\n  Msgr. Higgins believed that unions are central to democracy and the \nimprovement of the plight of workers. He insisted that Catholic \ninstitutions welcome unionization and negotiate in good faith with \ntheir employees.\n  AFL-CIO President John F. Sweeney said of Msgr. Higgins that, ``He \nhas been an irresistible force in bringing labor and church together. . \n. . We respect him for his strength, we revere him for his conscience, \nwe stand in awe of his intellect and we thank him for his love.''\n  My thoughts and wishes are with his sisters, Bridget Doonan and Ann \nMaronic, as well as his nephews, nieces, grandnephews and grandnieces. \nWe will miss America's Labor Priest. As we continue to fight for \nAmerica's workers, for justice and for peace, his memory will be with \nus--and with all workers around the globe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3950-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3950-S3951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN RECOGNITION OF LAKE FOREST HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS PREPARING FOR \n            NATIONAL COMPETITION ON CONSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, this May, more than 1,200 \nstudents from across the United States will visit Washington, DC to \ncompete in the national finals of the We the People . . . The Citizen \nand the Constitution program. It is the most extensive educational \nprogram in the country developed specifically to educate young people \nabout the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n  I am proud to announce that a class from Lake Forest High School from \nFelton will represent the State of Delaware in this national event. \nThese students, with the leadership of their teacher Amy Reed-Moore, \nhave worked diligently to reach the national finals. Through their \nexperience they have gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the \nfundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy.\n  This three-day national competition is modeled after hearings in the \nUnited States Congress. The hearings consist of oral presentations by \nhigh school students before a panel of adult judges\n\n[[Page S3951]]\n\non constitutional topics. The students' testimony is followed by a \nperiod of questioning by the judges who probe their depth of \nunderstanding and ability to apply their knowledge.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People . . \n. program has provided curricular materials at upper elementary, middle \nand high school levels for more than 26.5 million students nationwide. \nThe program affords students a working knowledge of our Constitution, \nBill of Rights, and the principles of democratic government.\n  It is inspiring to see these young people advocate the principles of \nour government, particularly in the aftermath of the tragedy on \nSeptember 11. These principles identify us as a people and bind us \ntogether as a Nation. It is important for our next generation to \nunderstand the values and principles that serve as the foundation in \nour ongoing effort to preserve and realize the promise of democracy.\n  These students from Lake Forest High School are currently conducting \nresearch and preparing for their upcoming participation in the national \ncompetition in Washington, DC.

By volunteering at Harborside Healthcare in Bedford and \nserving on the public relations committee for the Manchester Area \nCommittee on Aging, Mary has been a positive example to the community, \nadding to her already deep devotion to our senior citizens.\n  Mary received her bachelors degree in Communications from the \nUniversity of New Hampshire and now plans to pursue a Master's Degree \nin mass communication, with the ultimate goal of becoming a reporter \nfor a major television network. Her experience at WMUR Channel 9 as \nwell as working for Marie Claire magazine will certainly be an asset as \nshe spends her year as Miss New Hampshire.\n  I commend Mary on her achievement and wish her continued success in \nthe coming year. New Hampshire will be represented at the Miss America \npageant and her message will reach even more people. Her dedication to \nour Nation's seniors is exemplary and should serve as the benchmark for \ntoday's youth. It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3951-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               OXNARD HARBOR DISTRICT'S 65TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, the Oxnard Harbor District's \nAnnual National Maritime Day Celebration will be particularly special \nthis year, as the event will also recognize the district's 65th \nAnniversary on May 10, 2002.\n  Created in 1937, the Oxnard Harbor District owns and operates the \nPort of Hueneme, located in Ventura County, CA. The port greatly \ncontributes to the economic success of California and the Nation. More \nthan $4 billion worth of cargo moves through the port each year. In \naddition, the Port of Hueneme is the Nation's number one seaport for \nexporting citrus products and conducts business with countries \nincluding Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Germany and Japan. The Oxnard \nHarbor District has every reason to be proud of its outstanding \naccomplishments and contributions to our nation's great maritime \nheritage.\n  To help recognize the district's long history, this year's event will \nfeature the SS Lane Victory, one of America's last remaining World War \nII Victory ships, and a National Historic Landmark. It loaded its first \ncargo consignment in Port Hueneme in July 1945.\n  To conclude, I would like to add a special word of commendation to \nthe International Mariners Center, whose unwavering and unparalleled \nsupport has been instrumental to the Oxnard Harbor District's success.\n  I thank the Oxnard Harbor District for their many contributions to \nthe community, state and Nation, and wish the staff many more years of \nprosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3951-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       IN RECOGNITION OF THE REVEREND DR. S. HOWARD WOODSON, JR.\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I rise today to acknowledge \nthe Reverend Dr. S. Howard Woodson, Jr., after whom Calhoun St. in \nTrenton is being renamed.\n  It has been an honor for the State of New Jersey to have the service \nof an individual with the immense talents of the Reverend Woodson. In \nhis efforts to serve the community, Reverend Woodson has used his \nleadership skills to effect positive change throughout the State.\n  After moving to Trenton in 1946 and becoming pastor of Shiloh Baptist \nChurch, the Reverend Woodson became actively involved in the civil \nrights movement. As Chairman of the segregated board of the Carver \nYMCA, he fought to be granted independent status by the National YMCA, \nwhich led to the establishment of its own branch, freeing it from the \nsupervision of the central office. This was a first for the Nation. \nDuring his time as President of the State Conference of the NAACP, he \nconvinced then Governor Richard Hughes to convene the first state-wide \nconference on housing discrimination, out of which grew important \nminority housing legislation. Over the course of his political career, \nthe Reverend Woodson had the distinction of being the first person of \ncolor elected as councilman-at-large in Trenton. He was also the first \nperson of color to serve as Chairman of the Ranking Legislative \nCommittee, Assistant Democratic Leader, and Speaker of the State House.\n  But, the impact of the Reverend Woodson extends beyond his work in \nthe areas of civil rights and politics. Through his leadership, Shiloh \nBaptist Church was able to erect a new center of worship and began \nnumerous community outreach programs such as the Clean Neighborhood \nDrive and a Neighborhood Get Acquainted program.\n  I am proud to extend my congratulations to the Reverend Woodson on \nthis special occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3951-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3951-S3952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN HONOR OF PROFESSOR ZAFRA MARGOLIN LERMAN\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise today to honor a woman who \nfor nearly a quarter century has brought the joys of science to \nthousands of students in Chicago and who through every one of those \nyears has given of herself tirelessly to ensure that anyone who sets \nfoot in her classroom can succeed.\n  Zafra M. Lerman is no ordinary science teacher, and she has led no \nordinary life. Born in Israel just before the second World War began, \nthe young Zafra found high school chemistry a bore. It wasn't until she \nwas a soldier in the Israeli Army and taking evening classes that she \ndiscovered her aptitude--and love--for the subject. Zafra went on to \nearn a doctorate in chemistry from Israel's renowned Weizmann Institute \nof Science and then did post-doctoral research at Cornell University in \nNew York.\n  As remarkable as these achievements are, they are really only the \nbeginning of a career that--though certainly filled with personal \naccolades--is most notable for the success of those she has guided. \n``Equal access to science education is a right that belongs to all,'' \nshe says, and she has lived by that axiom both professionally and \npersonally. As a professor, scientist and friend, Zafra has been a \nmentor first and a chemistry teacher second.\n  In 1977, Zafra Lerman became the very first professor of science at \nColumbia College in Chicago, a liberal arts college that at the time \ndidn't even have a single science course. Her first course, Chemistry \nin Daily Life, was filled with artists and writers and historians who \nhadn't the first thought of majoring in science. One day near the \nbeginning of the school year, Zafra took a group of students to a pub \nat\n\n[[Page S3952]]\n\nthe Congress Hotel, across the street from the college. There, she \nrealized she could connect the unfamiliar scientific world to a world \nthe students knew well. The alcohol in the drinks and the acid in the \nsalad dressing became links between science and experience that brought \nmeaning to molecules and bonds and chemical reactions.\n  And so began an innovative curriculum that has been as successful as \nit is unconventional. What began as a new way to look at science has \ngrown into a new way of bringing the power and wonder of the subject to \nthose who for whom learning has all too often been an unrealized \nprivilege rather than the right Zafra Lerman believes it to be. Over \nthe past two decades, Zafra has made it her mission to ensure that all \nstudents, regardless of their background, can experience science in a \nmeaningful way. She has encouraged her students to explore chemistry \nthrough music and dance rather than forcing them to work behind a lab \nbench and has helped them learn the abstract material on their own \nterms.\n  Each week, students from the Chicago Public Schools board busses and \ntravel to Columbia College to experience science the Lerman way. During \nthe summer, Zafra leads a month-long ``science boot camp'' where \nteachers learn for themselves how to unite the realm of science with \nthe universe of a teenager in Chicago. Over the years, more than 16,000 \nyouths on the southwest side of Chicago have found the potential in \nscience education and--thanks to Mother Zafra, as they call her--have \nfor the first time seen high school as a beginning to their education \nrather than an end.\n  Zafra Lerman's work doesn't end at the shore of Lake Michigan. In \naddition to her devotion to the students of Chicago, she has long been \na champion of international human rights. She has traveled extensively \noverseas--often to the most dangerous corners of the world--to help \naddress the plight of dissident scientists in China, Russia and \nBelarus. She even learned the Russian language so she could converse \ndirectly with Andrei Sakharov instead of relying on the translator \nprovided by the KGB.\n  I would like today to congratulate Zafra Lerman on being awarded the \nCharles Lathrop Parsons Award for Outstanding Public Service to \nChemistry from the American Chemical Society. I assure you this is not \nher first honor--indeed, she is the recipient of more than three dozen \nwell-deserved awards and grants over the past 15 years, including the \nprestigious Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics \nand Engineering Mentoring. But I know this one means a great deal to \nher, for the late Franklin A. Long, her mentor at Cornell University, \nreceived the same honor in 1985 and had dreamed that she would one day \nfollow in his footsteps.\n  ``If I am able to see that I made a change for the better in \nsomeone's life,'' Zafra has said, ``then I know that it was a good \nday.'' Madam President, Zafra Lerman's life has been a collection of \ngood days from which so many have benefitted. All of us whose lives she \nhas touched owe her a debt of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3952-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL TEACHER DAY\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I come to the floor today to \nrecognize National Teacher Day and all the hard-working, dedicated \nteachers that spend every day preparing our Nation's children for \ntomorrow.\n  National Teacher Day is an opportunity to let millions of teachers \nacross the Nation know how much we value and appreciate their work. It \nis a chance to salute the dedicated individuals who touch the future by \nteaching our children.\n  We recognize teachers like Jennifer Erbe, the 2002 Iowa Teacher of \nthe Year. I had the opportunity to meet Jennifer last month and was \nimpressed with her passion for children and her ingenuity in the \nclassroom. She is one of Iowa's youngest teachers and we not only need \nto find ways to keep her in the classroom but to encourage more of our \nbest and brightest young people to enter the profession as well.\n  As we celebrate National Teachers Day, we must not forget that \nteachers need more than just a few kinds words about the work they do \nor a pat on the back. They don't need empty rhetoric about the \nimportance of education but need us to provide the resources necessary \nto do the job right.\n  Last year, we passed the Elementary and Secondary Education \nreauthorization and talked a lot about the need for education reform \nand quality teachers. We are demanding greater accountability, but also \npromised increased federal investments. Last year we provided education \nwith a 16 percent increase. That was a good start. However, President \nBush's first budget since the passage of his education reform bill \nprovides only 2.8 percent increase in funding, the smallest increase \nsince 1996.\n  In my home State of Iowa, State budget cuts are forcing school \ndistricts to cut back on the number of teachers for the next school \nyear. Some are laying off teachers. Others are not replacing teachers \nthat will retire. The reality for Iowa children next fall will be \nlarger classes and fewer opportunities.\n  In the next 10 years, 40 percent of Iowa teachers will retire and we \nneed to address that problem now. That is why these lay offs are so \ntroubling, because they are hitting the very teachers that we were \ncounting on to offset the impending retirements.\n  We face many serious challenges in our nation's schools and no one \nworries more about the child that is getting left behind than the \nclassroom teacher. We make sure all children succeed by providing high \nquality preschool programs, small class sizes, modern buildings and up-\nto-date teachers.\n  Someone once wrote, ``If you can read this, thank a teacher.'' Our \nwords are important and take the time to thank a teacher today. But \nlet's not just offer kind words to our teachers, let's dedicate \nourselves to make sure teachers have the tools they need in the \nclassroom to get the job done. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3952-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PERIODIC REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO SUDAN--PM 82\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport, which was referred to the Committee on Banking, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\nTo The Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I am providing herewith \na 6-month periodic report prepared by my Administration on the national \nemergency with respect to Sudan that was declared in Executive Order \n13067 of November 3, 1997.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend section 16131 of title 10, United States \nCode, to increase rates of educational assistance under the program of \neducational assistance for members of the Selected Reserve to make such \nrates commensurate with scheduled increases in rates for basic \neducational assistance under section 3015 of title 38, United States \nCode, the Montgomery GI Bill; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am pleased to be introducing the \nSelected Reserve Educational Assistance Act of 2002. This legislation \nwill provide our National Guard and Reserve personnel with expanded \neducational opportunities at a reasonable cost. Endorsed by the 52-\nmember Partnership for Veterans Education, the bill provides assistance \nand equity that is logical, fair, and worthy of a Nation that values \nboth higher education and those who defend the freedoms that we all \nenjoy. Under the total force concept of our military services, a large \nnumber of Selected Reserve personnel are now on active duty to support \nthe war on terrorism at home and abroad.\n  The original G.I. bill, known as the Servicemen's Readjustment Act, \nwas enacted in 1944. That bill provided a $500 annual education stipend \nas well as a $50 subsistence allowance. As a result of this initiative, \n7.8 million World War II veterans were able to take advantage of post-\nservice education and training opportunities, including more than 2.2 \nmillion veterans who went on to college. My own father was among those \nveterans who volunteered for the war, fought bravely, and then returned \nto college with assistance from the G.I. bill.\n  Since that time, various incarnations of the G.I. bill have continued \nto assist millions of veterans in taking advantage of educational \nopportunities they put on hold in order to serve their country. New \nlaws were enacted to provide educational assistance to those who served \nin Korea and Vietnam, as well as to those who served during the period \nin-between. Since the adoption of the total force concept and the \nchange to an all-volunteer service, additional adjustments to these \nprograms were made, leading up to the enactment of the Montgomery G.I. \nbill in 1985. It is a two-part program, one for active duty personnel \nand veterans and another for members of the Selected Reserve.\n  The value of the educational benefit assistance provided by the \nMontgomery G.I. bill, however, has eroded over time due to inflation \nand the escalating cost of higher education, making it harder for \nservice members and veterans to achieve their educational goals. Last \nyear, military recruiters indicated to me that the program's benefits \nno longer were as strong an incentive to join the military; nor did \nthey serve as a retention toll valuable enough to persuade men and \nwomen to stay in the military, either on active duty or in the Selected \nReserve. Perhaps most important, the program has been losing its value \nas an instrument to help our National Guard and Reserve personnel to \nmaximize their productivity and contributions to their families and \nthe coummunities of which they are a part by furthering their education \nand training.\n\n  In fact, in constant dollars, with one exception, the current G.I. \nbill up until January of this year provided the lowest level of \nassistance ever to those who served in the defense of our country. The \nbasic benefit program of the Vietnam Era G.I. bill provided $493 per \nmonth in 1981 to a veteran with a spouse and two children. Twenty years \nlater, a veteran in identical circumstances received only $43 more, a \nmere 8 percent increase over a time period when inflation had nearly \ndoubled, and a dollar bought only half of what it once purchased.\n  During the first session of the 107th Congress, we were successful in \naddressing some of these problems. Public Law 107-103 greatly improved \neducational assistance benefits available under the part of the \nMontgomery GI bill for service members and veterans, Chapter 30. This \npart of the G.I. bill now provides nine monthly $800 stipends per year \nfor four years. The total benefit is $28,800. On October 1, 2002, the \nmonthly amount will increase to $900, producing a new total benefit of \n$32,400 for the four academic years, a considerable improvement that \nSenator Johnson and I worked hard to accomplish.\n  Now is the time to bring educational assistance program for members \nof the Selected Reserve, Chapter 1606, in line with Chapter 30. Current \nfull-time assistance for the Selected Reserve is $272 per month for a \ntotal benefit of $9,792, only 34 percent of the monthly amount \ncurrently received under the Chapter 30 program. The bill that we are \nintroducing today would raise the monthly amount of assistance for our \nSelected Reserve to $428, for a new total benefit of $15,408 and be \ncomparable to the increases that have and will occur in the Chapter 30 \nprogram. The increase would be effective October 1, 2002.\n  The legislation that we are proposing would fulfill the promise made \nto our Nation's service members, help with recruiting and retention of \nmen and women in our military, strengthen the State and national \neconomies, and partially reflect the current costs of higher education. \nNow is the time to enact these modest improvements to the benefit \nprogram of the Montgomery G.I. bill for members of our National Guard \nand Reserve forces.\n  I urge all Members of the Senate to join me in support of the \nSelected Reserve Educational Assistance Act of 2002.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter in support of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3956]]\n\n\n                                      Reserve Officers Association\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 2002.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins, I write today on behalf of the nearly \n     80,000 members of the Reserve Officers Association of the \n     United States. I understand that you intend to introduce the \n     Selected Reserve Educational Assistance Act of 2002, \n     legislation that would not only increase educational payments \n     to members of the Selected Reserve, but would also tie \n     proportional increases in the Reserve GI Bill (Chapter 1606) \n     to increases in the active duty (Chapter 30) provisions of \n     the bill.\n       ROA believes that these changes are both appropriate and \n     timely in as much as they recognize the increased \n     contributions and responsibilities of the Reserve components \n     within the Total Force. Since Operation Desert Shield/Desert \n     Storm, Reserve component support of contingency operations \n     has increased twelve hundred percent, to the point that it \n     now averages nearly 13,000,000 mandays per year. That figure \n     does not include the nearly 85,000 Reservists currently on \n     active duty in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. \n     Moreover, there is no indication that this tempo of \n     operations is likely to decrease anytime soon.\n       Your bill is a landmark in the realm of Reserve education \n     benefits in as much as it contains provisions for automatic \n     increases in payments that keep pace with inflation and with \n     Active component usage. This is a great improvement to a very \n     significant recruiting and retention program, and will \n     doubtless, make it all the more popular and valuable to the \n     military and to the nation as a whole in the years to come.\n       Again, let me thank you for support of the Reserve \n     components of our Armed Forces and their people. If we here \n     at ROA can be of any assistance on this matter, please do not \n     hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Jayson L. Speigel,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS:\n  S. 2463. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to restrict \nbundling of Department of Defense contract requirements that \nunreasonably disadvantages small businesses, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am pleased to be introducing the \nSmall Business Contracts Opportunity Act of 2002. This legislation \nwould help expand opportunities for small businesses to bid on \ngovernment contracts, thus allowing them to sell more products and \nservices to Federal agencies. The bill would prohibit the consolidation \nof contract requirements in excess of $5 million absent a written \ndetermination that the benefits of consolidation substantially exceed \nthe benefits of alternative contracting approaches that would involve a \nlesser degree of consolidation.\n  The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997, P.L. 105-135, \nrequires Federal agencies to conduct market research to assess the \npotential impact of ``bundled contracts,'' and to proceed with such \ncontracts only if the benefits of bundling substantially exceed the \nbenefits of proceeding with separate contracts. Unfortunately, the \nreality is that the Department of Defense, and other Federal agencies, \nhave narrowly interpreted these provisions of the Small Business \nReauthorization Act. The result is that too many Federal contracts are \nso large that they are out of reach for small businesses. Yet, small \nbusinesses could perform the work if the contract requirements were \ndivided into separate contracts rather than consolidated.\n  For the past several years, the evidence that contract bundling is \nhurting small businesses has been growing. For example, on November 16, \n``Eagle Eye'' publishing released its second study on bundling since \n1997, which found that the Defense Department is the biggest culprit of \nbundling, accounting for 82 percent of all bundled dollars. The study \nreport goes on to say, that large businesses are the main beneficiaries \nof bundling, and highlights that large firms win 74 percent of all \nbundled dollars and 67 percent of all prime contract dollars. With the \naverage bundling contract worth $8 million, it is no wonder small \nbusinesses receive only 9 percent of all bundled contract dollars. \nEagle Eye found that the average bundled contract was 11 times larger \nthan the average unbundled contract.\n  Also, according to the Eagle Eye study, major DoD bureaus remain the \nlargest proponents of bundling. Army's 1999 bundled total was up to 22 \npercent since 1992 to $15.8 billion, while Navy increased only by 2 \npercent, but still managed to bundle $22 billion worth of contracts. \nAir Force bundled $18.8 billion, but offered some good news because its \ntotal is down 24 percent since 1992.\n  The legislation that I am proposing would require the Department of \nDefense to prove the cost benefit of consolidating a contract in excess \nof $5 million. Now is the time to enact this modest provision to ensure \nthat our small businesses have the opportunities that they deserve to \nprovide goods and services for the Department of Defense.\n  I urge all Members of the Senate to join me in support of the \nContract Consolidation Act of 2002.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 2465. A bill to extend and strengthen procedures to maintain \nfiscal accountability and responsibility; to the Committee on the \nBudget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to \nthe order of August 4, 1977, with instructions that if one Committee \nreports, the other Committee have thirty days to report or be \ndischarged.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to join with my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, to introduce a common-sense budget \nprocess bill, the Budget Enforcement Act of 2002.\n  In the 1990s, we took fiscally responsible actions that led to \nbalancing the budget in 1999 and 2000 without using Social Security. \nBut last year, the government returned to the bad habit of using the \nSocial Security surplus to fund other government activities. We need to \nput an end to that practice.\n  The Government will not have these Social Security surpluses to use \nforever. In the next decade, the Baby Boom generation will begin to \nretire in large numbers. Starting in 2016, Social Security will start \nredeeming the bonds that it holds, and the non-Social Security \ngovernment will have to start paying for those bonds from non-Social \nSecurity surpluses. The bottom line is that starting in 2016, the \ngovernment will have to show restraint in the non-Social Security \nbudget so that we can pay the Social Security benefits that Americans \nhave earned.\n  That's why we cannot continue to enact either tax cuts or spending \nmeasures that push the government further into deficit. Before we enter \ninto new obligations, we need to make sure that we have the resources \nto meet our Nation's commitment to our seniors under Social Security.\n  We need to return to the priority of protecting the Social Security \nTrust Funds. We should, as President Bush said in a March 2001 radio \naddress, ``keep the promise of Social Security and keep the government \nfrom raiding the Social Security surplus.''\n  And to get the Government out of the business of using Social \nSecurity surpluses to fund other government spending, we need to \nstrengthen our budget process. That is what the bill that Senator Gregg \nand I are proposing would do.\n  The history of budget process changes teaches that realistic budget \nenforcement mechanisms work. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, \nenacted with bipartisan support, with a Democratic Congress and a \nRepublican President, deserves much credit for helping to keep the \nGovernment on that path to reduce and eventually eliminate the deficit.\n  A central feature of the 1990 act was the creation of caps on \nappropriated spending. In recent years, Congress has blown through \nthose caps, when those caps were at unrealistic levels, and when the \nGovernment was running surpluses. But in most years of their history, \nappropriations caps helped to constrain the politically understandable \nappetite to spend without limit.\n  Congress has repeatedly endorsed the idea of spending caps. Congress \nrenewed and extended the caps in the budget process laws of 1993 and \n1997. And 6 of the last 8 budget resolutions have set enforceable \nspending caps. If budget numbers are to have any meaning, if they are \nnot to be just wishes and prayers, then we need to have enforcement.\n  Our bill would reinstate and extend the caps on discretionary \nspending, and would do so at a realistic baseline. It would simply set \nthose levels at those in the budget resolution reported by the Budget \nCommittee on March 22.\n\n[[Page S3957]]\n\nAnd our bill maintains, without change, the separate subcaps created in \nthe Violent Crime Act of 1994 and the Transportation Equity Act of \n1998.\n  Like the 1990 budget law that it extends, our bill would apply budget \nenforcement to entitlements and taxes. It would extend the pay-as-you-\ngo enforcement mechanism. All parts of the budget would thus be treated \nfairly.\n  Our bill would also improve the points of order that enforce the caps \nand pay-as-you-go enforcement. It would allow Senators to raise a point \nof order against specific provisions that cause the caps or pay-as-you-\ngo discipline to be violated. This part of the bill will work very much \nlike the important Byrd Rule that governs the reconciliation process, \nwhich is of course named after the distinguished senior Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Under our bill, if a piece of legislation violates the caps or pay-\nas-you-go discipline, any Senator could raise a point of order and \nforce a vote on any individual provision that contributes to the budget \nviolation. If the point of order is not waived, then the provision \nwould be stricken from the legislation.\n  The bill would also shut back-door ways around the caps and pay-as-\nyou-go enforcement, by requiring 60 votes to change the caps, alter the \nbalances of the pay-as-you-go scorecard, or direct scorekeeping.\n  Our bill would limit the exceptions to the point of order against \nemergency designations in the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution, so \nthat all emergencies would be treated alike. Our bill would thus treat \nemergencies as they were treated in the text of that budget resolution \nwhen the Senate passed it on April 7, 2000, rather than in the watered-\ndown form it had when it came back from conference with the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  And finally, our bill would extend for 5 years the requirement for 60 \nvotes to waive existing points of order that enforce the Congressional \nBudget Act. The 60-vote requirement that gives these points of order \nteeth expires on September 30 this year under current law.\n  This is sensible budget process reform, in keeping with the best, \nmost effective budget process enforcement that we have enacted in the \npast. It would make a significant contribution toward ending the \npractice of using the Social Security surplus to fund other government \nactivities. And that is something that we simply must do, for our \nseniors, and for those in coming generations who will otherwise be \nstuck with the bill. I urge my colleagues to join us to cosponsor our \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Gregg-Feingold Budget Enforcement Act of 2002\n\n       Appropriations Caps--The bill would reinstate and extend \n     for 5 years the caps on discretionary spending, keyed to the \n     levels in the budget resolution reported by the Budget \n     Committee. Points of order and the threat of across-the-board \n     cuts would continue to provide enforcement.\n       Pay-as-You-Go for Entitlements and Taxes--The bill would \n     reinstate and extend the pay-as-you-go discipline that \n     controls entitlement spending and tax law changes. Points of \n     order and the threat of across-the-board cuts would continue \n     to provide enforcement.\n       Point of Order Against Specific Provisions that Violate the \n     Caps or Pay-as-You Go--If legislation violated the caps or \n     pay-as-you-go enforcement, the bill would allow any Senator \n     to raise a point of order against (and thus force a vote on) \n     any individual provision that contributed to the budget \n     violation. If the Senate did not waive the point of order, \n     then the provision would be stricken from the legislation. \n     This point of order would work just like the Byrd Rule \n     against extraneous matter in reconciliation legislation.\n       Guarding Against Budget Evasions--The bill would shut back-\n     door ways around the caps and pay-as-you-go enforcement, by \n     requiring 60 votes to change the discretionary caps, alter \n     the balances of the pay-as-you-go scorecard, or direct \n     scorekeeping.\n       Limit Emergency Exceptions--The bill would limit the \n     exceptions to the point of order against emergency \n     designations in the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution, so \n     that all emergencies would be treated alike.\n       Extending Existing Points of Order--The bill would extend \n     for 5 years the requirement for 60 votes to waive existing \n     points of order that enforce the Congressional Budget Act. \n     The 60-vote requirement that gives these points of order \n     teeth expires on September 30 this year under current law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Carnahan, and Ms. \n        Collins):\n  S. 2466. A bill to modify the contract consolidation requirements in \nthe Small Business Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I am pleased today to be introducing \nlegislation, the Small Business Federal Contractor Safeguard Act, \ndesigned to protect the interests of small businesses in the Federal \nmarketplace.\n  As the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have focused a considerable amount of energy \npromoting the interests of small businesses in the Federal marketplace. \nThe legislation being introducing today marks a critical step forward \nin this process.\n  It is no secret that the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship places a great deal of importance on moving \nlegislation forward in a bipartisan manner, the members of my Committee \nunderstand we represent the interests of all of our Nation's small \nbusinesses, the most important and dynamic segment of our economy. And \nnowhere is the bipartisan consensus stronger than in the area of \nFederal procurement and ensuring that our Nation's small businesses \nreceive their fair share of procurement opportunities. I am pleased to \nonce again be introducing bipartisan legislation with the Committee's \nranking member, Senator Kit Bond. Regardless of who has chaired the \nCommittee during our tenure together, we have both worked hard to \nimprove small business Federal procurement opportunities.\n  I am also pleased to be joined by Senator Jean Carnahan, a member of \nthe Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship and the Senate \nArmed Services Committee and Senator Susan Collins, also a member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee. While small business participation \nin procurement activities is important throughout the Federal \nGovernment, nowhere is it more important than at the Department of \nDefense, which is responsible for over 63 percent of the goods and \nservices purchased by the Federal government. The support of Senator \nCarnahan and Senator Collins will help ensure the success of this \nlegislation.\n  The legislation we are introducing today has one ultimate purpose, to \nprevent Federal agencies from circumventing small business protections \nwith regard to the practice known as contract bundling. Few issues have \nso strongly galvanized the small businesses contracting community as \nthe practice of contract bundling, which occurs when procurement \ncontracts are combined to form large contracts, often spread over large \ngeographic areas, resulting in minimal or no small business \nparticipation.\n  Many supporters of the practice of contract bundling point to its \ncost savings. They claim it saves the taxpayer money to lump contracts \ntogether. Unfortunately, there is little evidence supporting this \nclaim, and too many contracts are bundled without the required economic \nresearch designed to determine if a bundled contract will actually \nresult in a cost savings.\n  The Small Business Administration's, SBA, Office of Advocacy, an \nindependent body within the SBA, estimated that for every increase of \n100 bundled contracts, there was a decrease of over 106 individual \ncontracts issued to small firms. Additionally, for every $100 awarded \non a bundled contract, there was a decrease of $33 to small business. \nThe Office of Advocacy arrived at these conclusions using a \nconservative definition of what constitutes a bundled contract. \nTherefore, the negative impact on small businesses from contract \nbundling is likely more severe.\n\n  While seemingly an efficient and cost effective means for Federal \nagencies to conduct business, bundled contracts, are anti-competitive. \nWhen a Federal agency bundles contracts, it limits small businesses' \nability to bid for the new bundled contract, thus limiting competition. \nSmall businesses are consistently touted as more innovative, providing \nbetter and cheaper services then their larger counterparts. But when \nforced to bid for mega-contracts, at times across large geographic \nareas, few, if any, small businesses can be expected to compete. By \ndriving small\n\n[[Page S3958]]\n\nbusiness from the Federal marketplace, contract bundling will actually \ndrive up the costs of goods and services purchased by the Federal \nGovernment because competition will be limited and our economy will be \ndeprived of possible innovations brought about by small businesses.\n  Although there is current law in place intended to require Federal \nagencies to conduct market research before bundling a contract, \nloopholes in the current definition of a bundled contract allow them to \noften skirt these safeguards.\n  Our legislation changes the name ``bundled contract'' to consolidated \ncontract, strengthens the definition of a consolidated contract, and \ncloses the loopholes in the existing definition to prevent Federal \nagencies from circumventing statutory safeguards intended to ensure \nthat separate contracts are consolidated for economic reasons, not \nadministrative expediency.\n  The new definition relies on a simple premise: if you combine \ncontracts, be it new contracts, existing contracts or a combination \nthereof, you are consolidating them and would need to take the \nnecessary steps to ensure it is justified economically before \nproceeding.\n  Our legislation also alters the current Small Business Act \nrequirements regarding procurement strategies when a contract is \nconsolidated to include a threshold level for triggering the economic \nresearch requirements.\n  Previously, any consolidated contract would trigger the economic \nresearch requirements, something considered onerous by many Federal \nagencies and often cited as the reason for circumventing the law. The \nnew procurement strategies section of the Small Business Act would \nrequire a statement of benefits and a justification for any \nconsolidated contract over $2 million and a more extensive analysis, \ncorresponding to current requirements for any consolidated contract, \nfor consolidations over $5 million.\n  In order to move forward with a consolidated contract over $2 \nmillion, the agency must put forth the benefits anticipated from the \ncontract, identify alternatives that would involve a lesser degree of \nconsolidation and include a specific determination that the \nconsolidation is necessary and justified. The determination that a \nconsolidation is necessary and justified may be determined simply \nthrough administrative and personnel savings, but their must be actual \nsavings.\n  In order to move forward with a consolidated contract over $5 \nmillion, an agency must, in addition to the above: conduct current \nmarket research to demonstrate that the consolidation will result in \ncosts savings, quality improvements, reduction in acquisition times, or \nbetter terms and conditions; include an assessment as to the specific \nimpediments to small business participation resulting from the \nconsolidation; and specify actions designed to maximize small business \nparticipation as subcontractors and suppliers for the consolidated \ncontract. The determination that a consolidation is necessary and \njustified may not be determined through administrative and personnel \nsavings alone unless those savings will be substantial for these larger \ncontracts.\n  By establishing this dual threshold system, we have placed the \nemphasis for the economic research on contracts more likely to preclude \nsmall business participation, while not ceding smaller contracts to the \nwhims of a Federal agency. This change, coupled with a clear definition \nof a consolidated contract should be enough to garner compliance. \nHowever, if Federal agencies continue to consolidate contracts when \nthere is no justification, fail to conduct the required economic \nresearch, or fail to provide procurement opportunities to small \nbusinesses, I would see little choice but to support legislative \nchanges requiring punitive measures for these Federal agencies. This is \na step I have been reluctant to take in the past. However, I am \noptimistic that such a step will not be necessary and that the fair and \nreasonable system established under this legislation will be effective.\n  I would once again like to thank my fellow sponsors, Senators Bond, \nCarnahan, and Collins for their support on this issue. I hope all of my \ncolleagues will join us in supporting this bill. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2466\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, today I join the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry, in introducing this important legislation on \nan issue of vital concern to small businesses. This bill, a truly \nbipartisan effort, represents one of the best opportunities in a long \ntime to remove the current logjam on controlling contract bundling.\n  We often say around here that, in some cases, all that is necessary \nto help small business is for government policy to stop visiting harm \nupon them. Contract bundling is one of those harmful policies. It \neliminates small businesses from competing for contracts to sell the \ngovernment some of the $200 billion in goods and services it buys every \nyear.\n  The Small Business Act says that small firms shall have the maximum \npracticable opportunity to compete for Federal contracts. This is good \nfor small business, good for the purchasing agencies, and good for the \ntaxpayer who pays the bills.\n  Small business benefits from having access to a stable revenue stream \nwhile they get up-and-running. The Small Business Act recognizes how \ngovernment contracting can contribute to business development and \neconomic renewal. For example, my HUBZone program provides contracting \nincentives for small firms to locate in blighted neighborhoods, helping \nthem win Federal contracts and stabilize their revenues while they \ndevelop a nongovernmental customer base.\n  Federal agencies also benefit from small firms in Federal \nprocurement. Many of the most innovative solutions to our problems, \nsuch as new technologies in defense readiness, come from small firms. \nLarge business can be just as bureaucratic as the worst Federal \nagencies.\n  Complex chains of command, the need to consult with the corporate \nheadquarters, and repetitive sign-offs on a new idea that have to be \ncleared with Accounting, Marketing, and Human Resources can stifle \ninnovation and creativity. The absence of all these structures can make \nsmall business able to ``turn on a dime,'' deliver new innovative \nproducts at lower cost, and clobber their big competitors. Agencies \ntrying to carry out their governmental functions can take advantage of \nthese innovations and deliver better quality services to our \nconstituents.\n  Finally, the taxpayer wins when small business competes for \ncontracts. The more competition, the lower the prices and the higher \nthe quality.\n  But contract bundling gets in the way of all those benefits. To \nsimplify the contracting process, agencies will take a bunch of small \ncontracts and roll them into one massive contract. The result is a \ncontract that a small business could not perform, due to its complexity \nor its obligation to do work in widely disparate geographic locations. \nA small business owner says, ``I could not perform the contract, even \nif I won it. So I won't even bid.'' When that happens, we all lose.\n  During my tenure as Chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, \nwe took a stab at trying to control bundling. At that time, no \nstatutory definition of bundling existed. It was like the Supreme Court \ntrying to deal with pornography, we know it when we see it. In the \nSmall Business Reauthorization Act of 1997, I pushed for a specific \ndefinition of bundling and created an administrative process to review \ninstances of bundling. Agencies were supposed to make a determination \nwhether a proposed bundle was ``necessary and justified.''\n  Since that time, we have seen agencies poke holes in that definition. \nFor example, they say that a proposed contract represents a new \nrequirement. Since it is new, it was never issued previously as \nseparate smaller contracts, so it isn't bundling, they say. Now they \ndon't have to do the ``necessary and justified'' determination.\n  Or, they will point to another phrase in the current definition of \nbundling. Currently, a bundle involves consolidating contracts in a way \nthat makes small business participation unlikely. If they structure a \ntiny piece of the contract so that a small business somewhere, someday \nmight be able to win that piece, the rest of the massive contract isn't \ntechnically bundling. Therefore, the agency doesn't have to do the \ndetermination.\n  This bill will close those kinds of loopholes. It builds upon some \nvery positive language introduced in last year's Defense Authorization \nbill when the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, proposed a draft during \nmarkup in the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Senator from \nMichigan noticed that it doesn't make sense for Federal agencies to \navoid the ``necessary and justified'' determination. The goal of that \nprocess is to ask, does a proposed bundle make sense? Is it good value \nto the taxpayer and to the agency? Does it help or harm the vendor base \nthat would be available to the agency in the future?\n\n  My colleague from Michigan decided it was time to make Defense \nagencies complete these bundling studies, to make sure we weren't doing \nharm to our defense readiness through these acquisition policies. I \nthink we need to do the studies to make sure the Small Business Act is \nnot cast aside and ignored. Suddenly, after a long impasse on this \nissue, the Senators from Michigan and Massachusetts and I found we had \ncommon ground on this issue.\n  Unfortunately, we were unable to get these positive provisions \nincluded in last year's Defense bill. That's why we are trying again. \nThe Bush Administration sought to have a single governmentwide policy \napply to all Federal agencies, not just the Defense establishment. This \nis a sound approach, but it would have required making changes to the \ngovernmentwide bundling policy in the Small Business Act. We were ready \nto agree to such a change, but our counterparts in the other body \nobjected, citing jurisdictional claims about using an Armed Services \nbill to make changes in Small Business Committee jurisdiction.\n  The bill we offer today should overcome these problems. It would make \na uniform governmentwide policy, through the Small Business Act. It is \na stand-alone bill. It builds upon an approach suggested by the Armed \nServices Committee as a reasonable one.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his work on this issue and \nI am pleased to have been at the table with him in crafting this \nproposal. I look forward to its enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL:\n  S. 2467.

Madam President, I come to the floor today to address a \ntopic that I believe is key to the future competitiveness of our \nNation, and that is the training of our workforce.\n  These have been tough times for the economy of my State, and \ncertainly the economy of the Nation at large. The most recent \nemployment data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics have \noffered little comfort in Washington, which along with the other \nPacific Northwest States of Oregon and Alaska, continue to have among \nthe highest unemployment rates in the Nation.\n  This body moved quickly to provide immediate relief to the workers \nmost impacted by the devastating economic impacts of the September 11th \nincidents, and I am proud that this Senate under the leadership of our \nMajority Leader was able to deliver some temporary assistance to \nworkers who have exhausted unemployment benefits.\n  Nonetheless, our efforts should not stop with an unemployment \ninsurance extension. We must continue pursuing long-term strategies for \na sustained recovery. The fundamental strength of our economy lies in \nthe working men and women of this Nation whose innovation and hard work \npropelled the massive economic expansion of the past decade.\n  The edge that will keep our workers ahead in this changing global \neconomy is their skills. Our economy is global, linked by international \nmarkets and communications networks. The sustained success of U.S. \ncompanies depends on adaptability and innovation to survive, which \nmeans that workers themselves need to remain flexible and continually \nupdate job skills.\n  Even in this time of relatively high unemployment, businesses \nthroughout the country are having hard times finding skilled workers. \nLast year, for example, 46 percent of American businesses had trouble \nfinding qualified workers. Next year, 29 percent of American businesses \nexpect that they will continue to have trouble hiring qualified \nworkers, even in this slugish economy.\n  At the same time, over 3 million workers are laid off each year, but \nwell under 500,000 receive any sort of training in response to meet the \nskills demands of those hiring businesses.\n  But meeting those skills demands, and bridging the skills gaps that \npersist between will not widely occur without a strong financial \ncommitment to ensuring access to skills training programs, and ongoing \nefforts to maximize the effectiveness of those funds that we already \ninvest.\n  The decision we make today to invest in our workers will pay off many \ntimes over in the form of a stronger economy, healthier communities, \nand improved quality of life.\n  But the persistent truth is that we are delivering a trickle of \nfunding while faced with a tidal wave of need.\n  During the Easter recess, I traveled across my State, from Olympia to \nKelso, Vancouver to Bellingham, the Tri-cites to Mt. Vernon, and \nreceived a great deal of feedback from Washingtonians who are seeking \ntraining, are providing it, or are serving as employers who need to \nhire skilled workers. And I heard similar concerns repeated in each of \nthese areas: first, as our economy continues to change, the demand for \nnew skills has grown; second, that the State has experienced an \nenormous increase in demand for skills training by individual workers, \na trend that appears to be widespread throughout the Nation; but third, \nthat far too many of those workers seeking to access training cannot \nget the training they need due to limited availability of slots at \ntraining institutions and the limited availability of tuition \nassistance.\n  Last month my office released an informal study of this apparent \nshortfall in the capacity of training systems in my state to meet \nemerging demand, and the results of that study were staggering to me. \nTens of thousands of workers who want to upgrade their skills have only \na limited ability to do so because of budgetary limitations that \nprevent institutions from adequately adding capacity to deliver \ntraining, and because only limited numbers of training vouchers are \navailable through the federal job training system.\n  I might add that our governor has truly been a leader in expanding \naccess to training. In response to the recent wave of layoffs in our \nState, he managed to add more than 1,300 additional adult worker-\ntraining slots to the state's community and technical college system. \nEven in the face of our state's terrible revenue crunch, Governor Locke \nhas made that commitment, and he deserves tremendous credit for it.\n  But it is clear that states need additional help from the Federal \nGovernment. Workforce investment must be a national priority.\n  As my colleagues know, the programs authorized by the Workforce \nInvestment Act are only in their second year of implementation. \nAlthough we still have several job-training programs offered through \nthe Federal Government, the WIA system is clearly the centerpiece. It \nis the only Federal system designed to meet a broad range of worker \nneeds, and it emerged from years of bipartisan work by Congress to \nconsolidate at least 17 Federal programs into one system for delivering \nemployment and training services.\n  Continuing our financial commitment to WIA programs at this critical \nstage in their development is essential to effective implementation of \nthese system-wide reforms.\n  Senators Kennedy, DeWine, Wellstone, and our other colleagues took an \nenouous step in passing WIA in 1998. And despite bumps in the road, the \nsystem is already showing great promise. Nonetheless, as we move toward \nreauthorization of WIA and TANF, there are a number of issues that many \nof us will want to address in seeking to take the system to the next \nlevel.\n  We must, first and foremost, put an even higher priority on training. \nIn developing human capital that maximizes the power of our economic \nengine, we must not get caught in the short-sighted quicksand of a \nwork-first mentality. We will do ourselves a grave disservice if we \nsimply force more people without the skills to obtain and hold a job in \nthis dynamic economy, to work faster, in whatever job is available, \noften low paying jobs, rather than getting them the tools that they \nneed to truly be self-sufficient.\n  Second, we must further enhance the seamlessness of our training \nsystems. As GAO has documented in recent months, we still have partners \nin the WIA system that do not fully participate, and we still have \nnumerous Federal training programs operating independently of one \nanother, often duplicating effort and resources. We need to keep our \neye on ball in this case, that the goal is to provide the highest \npossible service at the lowest unit cost on behalf of the customers of \nthe system, its employment and training recipients, and we need to \nmaximize the return on our Federal investment.\n  Third, in meeting these objectives, we need to maintain the \nflexibility of the systems while encouraging the types of activities \nand use of funds that will help us match skilled workers with available \njobs. We need to take a serious look at whether the systems effectively \nbalance the need for accountability with the flexibility for local \nboards in the use of federal dollars that is will allow them to most \neffectively target resources at the problems that most plague their \ncommunities.\n  Finally, in the short term, we must tailor all of our Federal \ntraining systems and programs to ensure the greatest possible access \nfor workers who want to obtain training. That means that it is \nincumbent on us to keep the door open as wide as possible for adult \nstudents to access programs like Pell. And we must try to utilize the \nmost current and powerful technologies to enhance the delivery of \ntraining.\n  Today, I am introducing three bills that are designed to build upon \nthe existing workforce structure to expand access to training and \nimprove its effectiveness.\n  The first piece of legislation would change the Pell Grant program to \nmake certain that student financial aid is available to recently laid \noff workers.\n  A standard practice in the determination of Pell Grant eligibility \nfor student aid is to base grant awards upon the applicant's income \nduring the previous year. The use of tax forms for this purpose, in \nmany cases, is the appropriate and easiest administrative method of \nobtaining a clear and official\n\n[[Page S3961]]\n\nstatement of need. But as a result, many recently laid-off workers are \noften not eligible for critical financial assistance at a time when the \nworker's family is experiencing a dramatic decrease in income.\n  The legislation would explicitly provide the authority for \neducational institutions, after taking sufficient precautions to \nprevent fraud, to consider current-year income levels for applicants \nseeking training through Pell-eligible programs. It does this in a very \nnarrow way, by ensuring that institutions in states with high \nunemployment rates consider current year financial circumstances rather \nthan previous year, income.\n  The second bill also addresses issues of access and delivery of \ntraining. While many distance-learning technologies have been developed \nin recent years, those technologies have not necessarily reached many \nof those most in need of training. Many workers in need of training may \nnot be aware of opportunities available online to engage in distance-\nlearning training coursework and may not have sufficient access to \ntechnologies that provide the means to access such distance-learning \ntechnologies.\n  It may not be enough to create a distance-learning curriculum and \npassively provide it through an educational institution website. \nRather, comprehensive solutions need to be developed that integrate \ncurriculum innovations, technological access, and the promotion and \nlinkage of workers in need of training with such opportunities. \nAdditionally, sources of funding to obtain online coursework may not be \navailable to many workers seeking to engage in such training.\n  The third bill that I am introducing is designed to help WIA Boards \naccess more, high-quality information to better understand regional \nlabor market dynamics and improve system performance with goal of \nidentifying emerging sectors and targeting employment and training \nresources appropriately.\n  While workforce areas may be conducting research now on the \nemployment landscape in those areas and states, those assessments and \nstatistical labor market data collected by the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics is not be sufficient to provide a level of detail for \nidentifying actual job opportunities in regional labor markets and \nmatching available workers to those business demands. As a result, \nlocal systems may not have the information needed to most efficiently \ntarget the use of available resources and training providers may not \nalways build curricula and programs that most effectively address local \nworkforce needs.\n  This legislation is designed to make resources available to maximize \nemployment and training resources toward meeting emerging area skills \nneeds. I want to make clear that this is not intended to simply \nreinvent the wheel for areas that are already developing sectoral \napproaches within existing workforce development systems. But it should \nin fact, allow those areas to take the next step by providing funds to \nenhance the capacity of systems to meet area employer needs.\n  This is a first step on a long journey as we work to improve Federal \njob training systems, and it is in no way independent of the need for \nadditional resources to grow those systems.\n  Each of these bills is an important component of that broader \nstrategy and I look forward to working with my colleagues as we begin \nto look at the reauthorization of TANF, of WIA, and of the Higher \nEducation Act this year and next.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CARNAHAN:\n  S. 2470. A bill to encourage and facilitate the security of nuclear \nmaterials and facilities worldwide, to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Madam President, the disintegration of the Soviet \nUnion more than a decade ago resulted in economic and political chaos.\n  The Soviet Union possessed more than 10,000 nuclear weapons, and \ndozens of nuclear weapons production facilities sprawled across 11 time \nzones. As a result of the economic collapse, funding fell short for \nsecurity at nuclear weapons storage and production facilities. This \nleft dangerous amounts of deadly weapons and materials vulnerable to \ntheft.\n  Since 1991, there have been countless documented cases of individuals \nstealing plutonium and uranium from the former Soviet Union. So far, we \nbelieve no ``nuclear smuggler'' has taken enough material to make a \nnuclear device. The real problem is the uncertainty of the unknown.\n  Since the end of the Cold War, we have done a great deal to curb the \nthreat posed by weapons of mass destruction. The United States has \ntaken the lead in the international community to help Russia secure its \nnuclear weapons and material. The Department of Defense's Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program and the sister programs at the Department of \nEnergy are truly ``defense by other means.'' The Defense Department's \nprogram is more commonly known as the Nunn-Lugar program, in \nrecognition of its creators, my colleague from Indiana, Dick Lugar, and \nformer Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia. Because of these two men, we face \nless of a threat from the Soviet Union's nuclear legacy than we would \nhave otherwise.\n  The Department of Defense has focused on destroying nuclear weapons \nand improving security over weapons in transit and storage. The \nDepartment of Energy has focused its own threat reduction efforts on \nlocking up uranium and plutonium that could be used in a nuclear weapon \nand helping develop peaceful, commercial job opportunities for weapons \nscientists. The investments made in these programs to secure Soviet \nnuclear weapons and materials have truly been in our national interest.\n  However, as far-reaching as these programs have been, they were not \ndesigned to address some of the terrorist threats we now face. In \nparticular, there are three gaps in our nuclear threat reduction \npolicies that need to be dealt with.\n  First, these programs do not apply to countries outside of the former \nSoviet Union. Second, these programs do not address the threat of \nradiological materials. Third, these programs do not deal with \npreventing terrorist sabotage of nuclear power plants.\n  Expanding our threat reduction programs globally is an important \npriority. So far, most of our efforts have focused on the dangerous \nsituation in the former Soviet Union. This makes sense, since most of \nthe under-secured nuclear weapons useable material is located in that \npart of the world.\n  However, we need to pay more attention to the smaller amounts of \nweapons material in other parts of the world that are not under tight \nenough lock and key. This means building up security at every type of \nnuclear facility worldwide, including nuclear power plants, processing \nfacilities, storage sites and other related buildings.\n  We also need to start focusing on radiological materials.\n  And by radiological materials, I am referring to highly radioactive \nsubstances other than weapons-useable uranium or plutonium. A ``dirty \nbomb'' combines radioactive material that could be found at nuclear \npower plants, medical facilities or other industrial sites with \nexplosives. This weapon would not be as immediately destructive as a \nnuclear bomb. But it would cause significant physical, environmental, \neconomic, and psychological damage to our citizens, and to our national \nsecurity.\n  Indeed, intelligence reports indicate that Osama bin Ladin has been \nactively pursuing the materials to develop a ``dirty bomb.'' In fact, \nhe called the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction a ``religious \nduty.'' In addition, there have been reports of meetings between \nPakistani nuclear weapons scientists and al-Qaeda operatives and \nbetween Iraqi officials and al-Qaeda representatives. We will never \nknow what went on at these meetings. But we must take every step \npossible to thwart their evil plans.\n  Finally, we will contribute to our national security by improving \nnuclear power plant security outside the United States. The Department \nof Energy has been working for years to improve the safety of Soviet-\ndesigned nuclear power plants in the former Soviet Union and Eastern \nEurope. This is to prevent the possible repeat of the Chernobyl \ndisaster.\n  However, to date, protecting these plants from terrorist sabotage has \nnever been addressed. Before the tragedies of September 11, we never \nthought such an attack was realistic. Now that our reality has changed, \nwe are providing greater security to protect our\n\n[[Page S3962]]\n\npower plants here at home. These efforts will serve as good models to \nupgrade the security at nuclear plants in Russia and elsewhere.\n  Today I am introducing a bill that would help bolster our national \nsecurity by improving the security of all nuclear and radiological \nmaterial worldwide. My bill addresses each of the three gaps in our \ncurrent efforts that I have just identified.\n  First, it calls on the Department of Energy in cooperation with the \nDepartments of State and Defense to develop a program that would \nencourage all countries to adhere to the highest security standards for \ntheir nuclear material wherever it is used or stored;\n  Second, it requires the Department of Energy to establish a \nsystematic approach for securing radiological materials other than \nuranium and plutonium outside the United States; and\n  Third, it directs the Department of Energy, in consultation with the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission and the International Atomic Energy \nAgency, to develop plans for preventing terrorist attacks on nuclear \npower plants outside the United States.\n  This bill is a cost-effective and short-term way to counter current \nthreats to our national security and it promotes world cooperation in \nsecuring nuclear materials. Already, this bill has gained the \nendorsement of several world leaders in the field of nuclear non-\nproliferation, including: Dr William Potter, Director of the Monterey \nInstitute's Center for Nonproliferation Studies; Dr. Graham Allison, \nformer Assistant Secretary of Defense; and Rose Gottemoeller, former \nDeputy UnderSecretary at the Department of Energy.\n  At this time I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from \neach of these individuals and organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Center for Nonproliferation Studies,\n                                     Monterey, CA, April 29, 2002.\n     Senator Jean Carnahan,\n     Hart Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Carnahan: As the director of the Monterey \n     Institute's Center for Nonproliferation Studies, I have long \n     been involved in research and training activities designed to \n     combat the spread of weapons of mass destruction. I have \n     focused especially on proliferation risks associated with the \n     former Soviet Union and have sought to enhance the safety and \n     security of fissile material and nuclear facilities in that \n     region. As you are well aware, this task has acquired even \n     greater urgency in the aftermath of September 11, as has the \n     need to consolidate and secure the smaller amounts of fissile \n     material that are inadequately safeguarded in other parts of \n     the world.\n       Although the highest priority should be given to \n     consolidating, securing, and reducing the global stocks of \n     fissile material--the stuff of nuclear weapons--it also is \n     important for more attention and resources to be devoted to \n     countering nuclear threats posed by the sabotage of nuclear \n     power plants, research reactors, and spent fuel storage \n     sites, and the risks associated with so-called ``dirty \n     bombs'' or radiological dispersal devices, which could be \n     made by matching conventional explosives with radioactive \n     source material. These dangers, while global in nature, are \n     especially acute in Russia due to the amount of nuclear \n     material present, the absence of adequate safeguards, and the \n     vulnerability of many nuclear facilities to sabotage and/or \n     terrorist attack. Although experts at Russian nuclear \n     facilities have highlighted these vulnerabilities for a long \n     time, their remediation has not typically been a high \n     priority for U.S. nonproliferation assistance.\n       In light of these serious nuclear dangers, I strongly \n     support your efforts to develop new legislation to counter \n     nuclear terrorism and to improve the security of fissile and \n     radiological material and nuclear facilities both in Russia \n     and worldwide. In this regard, there are many useful lessons \n     to be learned from the decade of U.S.-Russian collaboration \n     in cooperative threat reduction, a topic many of my staff and \n     I have analyzed carefully. Please feel free to contact me if \n     you would like more detailed information on our prior work or \n     if I can be of any assistance to you as you pursue your \n     exceptionally timely and important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            William C. Potter,\n\n                                        Director, CNS and CRES and\n     Institute Professor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Harvard University,\n\n                                     Cambridge MA, April 30, 2002.\n     Senator Jean Carnahan,\n     Hart Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Carnahan: I am writing to support your draft \n     legislation focused on addressing the threat of nuclear \n     terrorism. As a member of the Baker-Cutler panel and a \n     longtime Russia watcher, I have seen with my own eyes \n     security systems for potential bomb material that would make \n     it an easy task for terrorists to steal. As a former Senator, \n     now Ambassador Howard Baker has testified to his colleagues \n     on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, ``I don't mean to \n     be unduly philosophical or psychological about it, but it \n     really boggles my mind that there could be 40,000 nuclear \n     weapons, or maybe 80,000 in the former Soviet Union, poorly \n     controlled and poorly stored, and that the world isn't in a \n     near-state of hysteria about the danger.'' And the problem is \n     not limited to Russia: around the world, there are dozens of \n     facilities with enough highly enriched uranium or a bomb--\n     some of them civilian research facilities with a single night \n     watchman and a chain link fence providing the only security.\n       In the aftermath of September 11, with Osama bin Laden \n     declaring that acquiring weapons of mass destruction is a \n     ``religious duty,'' allowing such conditions to continue \n     would pose an unacceptable threat to the security of the \n     United States and the world. If a nuclear weapon were to fall \n     in the hands of those who organized the September 11 attacks, \n     there would be no threats and no negotiations. Tens of \n     thousands of innocent victims would die in a flash; if the \n     bomb were in lower Manhattan, it would destroy everything up \n     to Grammercy Park.\n       That terrible vision must guide our efforts now, and our \n     sense or urgency. We must be asking ourselves: ``on the day \n     after a U.S. city is destroyed in a nuclear blast, what would \n     we wish we had done to prevent it?'' And then we must take \n     those actions now, a quickly as we practically can.\n       What is needed is a fast-paced, focused effort to eliminate \n     stockpiles of potential bomb material wherever they are no \n     longer needed, while instilling rapid security upgrades \n     wherever these materials will remain. The goal should be to \n     attain a stringent, global standard for security for all \n     stockpiles of nuclear weapons and materials--for if these \n     cannot be stolen, then terrorists cannot get the means for a \n     nuclear attack. At the same time, we must be doing more to \n     guard against potential Chernobyls caused by terrorist \n     attacks on nuclear facilities or terrorist acquisition and \n     use of radiological material for a ``dirty bomb.''\n       Thus the objectives outlined in your legislation are \n     precisely what is needed. Should this legislation become law, \n     the security of the United States would be measurably \n     improved, and our children and grandchildren will thank you. \n     I commend you for your leadership in this crucial endeavor. \n     Let me know if I can be of any assistance in pushing it \n     through.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Graham T. Allison,\n        Douglas Dillon Professor of International Affairs, Former \n     Assistant Secretary of Defense.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Carnegie Endowment for\n\n\n                                          International Peace,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 2002.\n     Senator Jean Carnahan,\n     Hart Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Carnahan: Please allow me to introduce myself. \n     My name is Rose Gottemoeller, and I am a Senior Associate at \n     the Carnegie Endowment. I have previously served in senior \n     positions both in and out of the U.S. government, most \n     recently (until October 2000) as Deputy Undersecretary of \n     Energy for Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation, and Assistant \n     Secretary of Energy for Nonproliferation and National \n     Security. From 1994 to 1997, I was Deputy Director of the \n     International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, \n     after serving in 1993 and 1994 as the White House National \n     Security Council Director responsible for denuclearization of \n     Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus. Prior to that time, I was at \n     the RAND Corporation as a senior researcher on issues related \n     to Soviet defense and arms control policy.\n       Based on my long experience working on nuclear security \n     issues, I strongly believe that more needs to be done, both \n     in the former Soviet Union and throughout the rest of the \n     world, to ensure a safe and secure future for all Americans. \n     For the better part of the last ten years, the United States \n     has borne the brunt of helping Russia and its neighbors \n     improve security of its civilian and military facilities that \n     house weapons-useable fissile material. As you know, the \n     United States has contributed millions of dollars to secure \n     the Soviet nuclear legacy, but not out of altruism: it is \n     clearly in our national interest to do so.\n       While I strongly believe that the support of the U.S. must \n     continue, I now also emphasize that the only way to develop a \n     comprehensive effort to address poorly secured nuclear \n     materials in other parts of the world is for our friends and \n     allies to shoulder some of the burden. The security of \n     nuclear material is in every country's best interest, and \n     every country should be an active participant.\n       Thus far, most cooperative efforts to improve the physical \n     protection of nuclear materials have taken place in the \n     former Soviet Union. This is logical, given that most \n     weapons-usable fissile material is located in that region of \n     the world, and much of it has been adequately protected since \n     the break-up of the USSR.\n       However, particularly since September 11th, I believe that \n     we all need to pay more attention to the smaller caches of \n     fissile material that exist in other parts of the world. Many \n     of them are not protected to a level commensurate with \n     international standards.\n\n[[Page S3963]]\n\n       It is important to note that while terrorists might have \n     aspirations of developing advanced weapons of mass \n     destruction, it is more likely that a terrorist organization \n     would be able to develop a Radiological Dispersal Device \n     (RDD). This weapon of mass disruption could be created with \n     conventional explosives and some spent fuel or other \n     radiological source material. To the best of my knowledge, \n     there are no nonproliferation efforts for radiological \n     materials. This needs to change. One approach would be to \n     improve the physical protection of such materials, although \n     this task would be so enormous and expensive on a world-wide \n     basis that I believe careful priorities need to be set for \n     such projects. It would also be important to consider \n     emergency response and public information efforts, so that \n     local governments and citizens will have the tools at hand to \n     respond to such an attack.\n       The security of nuclear power plants has also come under \n     scrutiny lately. The DOE has been working for years to \n     improve the safety of Soviet-designed nuclear power plants, \n     with significant successes. However, to date, protecting \n     these plants from terrorist sabotage has been less of a \n     priority, and thus has not received attention or funding. \n     This, too, must change.\n       The DOE could very easily and usefully take the lessons it \n     has learned from its experience during the last decade of \n     cooperation with Russia and apply them to these new and \n     evolving threats to our national security.\n       Therefore, I strongly support your endeavors, and am \n     thankful for your vision in developing new legislation to \n     address these issues. In the absence of a determined program \n     of action, we have every reason to anticipate acts of nuclear \n     terrorism against American targets before this decade is out.\n       Please feel free to contact me if I can provide you any \n     further information or clarification. Again, thank you for \n     your commitment to this important issue.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                             Rose E.

Jean Carnahan,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Carnahan: On behalf of the Russian-American \n     Nuclear Security Advisory Council (RANSAC), I want to thank \n     you for sponsoring legislation in support of expanded and \n     improved international efforts to control nuclear and \n     radiological materials. Few objectives are more central to \n     ensuring international security than keeping these and other \n     weapon of mass destruction materials out of hostile hands.\n       Since its inception, RANSAC and its members have been very \n     active in promoting efforts to improve nuclear controls in \n     Russia and the former Soviet Union. But we also believe that \n     it is essential to engage the rest of the international \n     community in this effort.\n       Since last September there has been some forward progress \n     in programs working to reduce the global nuclear materials \n     threat, but the pace of these efforts remains drastically out \n     of synch with the magnitude of the risks. And, the \n     international community must devote more time, attention, and \n     resources--both in the former Soviet Union and the rest of \n     the world--to diminish these obvious nuclear dangers. I \n     applaud and support the goals of your legislation as a \n     practical step toward accelerating and expanding these \n     efforts.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Kenneth N. Luongo,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Nuclear Threat Reduction Campaign\n\n\n     statement from the nuclear threat reduction campaign, on the \n        introduction of the global nuclear security act of 2002\n\n       Since 1993, the International Atomic Energy Agency has \n     documented almost 400 cases of trafficking in nuclear and \n     other radioactive materials. Of those, 18 involved small \n     volumes of weapons-grade plutonium or highly enriched \n     uranium, and most of those cases originated in the former \n     Soviet Union. Recent revelations from American intelligence \n     officials indicate that Osama Bin Laden and his al Qaeda \n     network have been trying to acquire radiological material to \n     build a co-called ``dirty'' bomb for use against American \n     targets.\n       At present, there are no cooperative programs to secure \n     radiological materials in Russia or elsewhere. The Nuclear \n     Threat Reduction Campaign (NTRC) applauds Senator Jean \n     Carnahan (D-MO) for taking important measures to address this \n     serious threat by introducing the Global Nuclear Security \n     Act, 2002. In the wake of the tragic events of September \n     11th, Senator Carnahan's bill will begin the difficult, but \n     necessary, process of securing radiological materials from \n     potential terrorist theft, tighten international nuclear \n     safety standards, and develop plans for mitigating the threat \n     of terrorist attacks on nuclear power plants outside of the \n     United States.\n       This bill supports the President's pledge that, ``Our \n     highest priority is to keep terrorists from acquiring weapons \n     of mass destruction.'' The Global Nuclear Security Act, 2002 \n     is an immediate and cost-effective mechanism to counter \n     current threats to our national security.\n       (The NTRC has put forth a five-part agenda encouraging \n     Congress and the Bush Administration to: work toward a \n     comprehensive inventory of nuclear weapons and weapons-grade \n     materials; pass the Debt-Reduction-for-Non-Proliferation Act; \n     sign a legally-binding agreement to reduce stockpiles of \n     strategic weapons held by the United States and Russia; \n     strengthen joint U.S.-Russia threat reduction and non-\n     proliferation programs; and expand existing programs to \n     mitigate the threat of bioterrorism. The NTRC is a project of \n     the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation and The Justice \n     Project.)\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. In January of this year, I traveled, with eight of my \ncolleagues, to meet with the leaders of Pakistan, Turkey, Afghanistan, \nand several countries of the former Soviet Union.\n  We were impressed with their level of commitment to the war against \nterrorism, and to making the world safe from weapons of mass \ndestruction. We are all in this struggle against terrorism together. \nThe only way to lock up all nuclear and radiological material is for \nfriends and allies to work together and share the burden. We will spend \nseveral billions of dollars this year to improve our homeland security, \nand rightly so. But we also must recognize that we are only as safe as \nthe weakest link in the chain-link fence guarding some nuclear material \nin far away country.\n  I fully support President Bush's call to action, when he said late \nlast year, with Russian President Putin by his side, that ``Our highest \npriority is to keep terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass \ndestruction.''\n  I hope my colleagues will join me as well in supporting this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3963-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3963-S3964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 261--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT PUBLIC \nSERVANTS SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND CONTINUED SERVICE \n          TO THE NATION DURING PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK\n\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Voinovich, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Thompson) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Madam President, I am pleased to support my \ncolleague, Senator Craig on this concurrent resolution on protecting \nour Western forests from catastrophic fire.\n  It could not be more timely.\n  Unfortunately, this year is shaping up to be one of the worst fire \nyears on record for many States in the West and for southern California \nin particular.\n  The fire season usually begins in California in early summer and can \nlast all the way up to November.\n  A few years ago it became clear to me that we had a potential \ndisaster on our hand beginning every June.\n  In the 106th Congress Senator Domenici, several of our colleagues and \nI worked to greatly increase funding for fire prevention.\n  That included millions of dollars for the removal of dead and dying \nand small diameter trees and thick underbrush that have accumulated in \nour national forests, dramatically increasing the likelihood of serious \nand highly destructive forest fires.\n  Recently, the Forest Service identified 24 million acres of land in \nthe Continental U.S. as being at the absolute highest level of \ncatastrophic fire risk.\n  Almost a full one third of this area, 7.8 million acres, lies in \nCalifornia; this is more than any other State.\n  It includes the entire Sierra Nevada mountain range, the newly \ndesignated Sequoia National Monument, it also includes the Plumas and \nLassen Forests in and around the Quincy area, where forest fires in the \npast have destroyed homes and businesses and spotted owl habitat.\n  And it includes the Lake Tahoe Basin, where one-quarter of the trees \nare either dead or dying.\n  And the probability of major fire conflagration remains and grows \neach year. Such a fire around Lake Tahoe for instance could permanently \ndestroy the water quality of one of the most pristine lakes in the \nworld.\n  Not to mention a potential loss of life, habitat and property that \ncould be devastating.\n  Each year, the Forest Service spends hundreds of millions of dollars \nputting out fires.\n  This money would be much better spent preventing fires in the first \nplace rather than cleaning up after the fact.\n  And that is what our resolution seeks to address.\n  How did things get this way?\n  Well through the turn of the 20th century, the U.S. population was \npredominantly spread out and agrarian.\n  Forest fires burned naturally at fairly predictable intervals and \nthey burned hot enough to restrict encroaching vegetation and prevent \nfuel from loading up on the ground, but not hot enough to kill old \ngrowths.\n  Forests in the U.S. survived in this fashion for literally thousands \nof years.\n  By the middle of the twentieth century, however an increasing \npopulation began to occupy new urban-wildland interface zones on what \nhad once been forests.\n  Suddenly, forest fires had to be put out or suppressed in order to \nprotect the surrounding communities.\n  It seemed intuitive to simply continue fighting fires as they arose \nand leave the forests otherwise, untouched.\n  So nothing was done to groom the forests, to remove the dead and \ndying, to reduce undergrowth, and to prevent subsequent conflagrations.\n  What is called fuel load has grown to astronomical proportions in \nmany of our national forests.\n  Dead and dying trees which were no longer consumed by fire, lingered \nwhile brush began to build up at ground level.\n\n  Newer, different species of trees, no longer stifled by natural fire, \nbegan to crowd out some of the older growth trees.\n  Forests became crowded and severely fire-prone.\n  Newer, different species of trees, no longer stifled by natural fire, \nbegan to crowd out some of the older growth trees.\n  In the meantime, what we learned was that one-size does not fit all \nwhen it comes to managing our forests.\n  Each forest is distinct. Differences in topography, geography, flora \nand fauna, elevation, and climate dictate how a particular forest \nshould be managed.\n  A forest in the California Sierras is different from a forest in \nAlaska or Pennsylvania or Idaho.\n  It is imperative that the Forest Service use all available tools to \nclean up the forests and reduce fire risks.\n  This includes removing dead and dying trees, thinning overgrowth, and \nusing mechanical treatment and controlled burning.\n  It should also include the fuel breaks demonstrated by the Quincy \nLibrary Group Project.\n  If we don't use all these tools, incidents of serious fire will only \ncontinue to increase.\n  In California, fire susceptible Douglas and White firs have grown \nunderneath old growth ponderosa pines.\n  The newer firs which are not resistant to fire, create potential fuel \nladders that permit a fire to reach the tops, or crowns of old growths \nfor the first time.\n  For most of recent history an old growth pine was impervious to fire \nsince rarely did a fire reach all the way up to its crown.\n  Now with these relatively new fuel ladders, fire threats to old \ngrowths are very real.\n  Drought periods have further stressed the forest, predisposing it to \ninsect infestations, disease and of course, severe wildfire.\n  California forests provide homes for dozens of endangered and \nthreatened species including the Marbled Murrelet and the Spotted owl.\n  It is an understatement to say that today, the risk of fire is the \nmost serious threat to our forests and these species.\n  It may be the most immediate short-term environmental threat that our \nwestern forests face.\n  That is why this policy of fire prevention and this resolution are so \nimportant.\n  And I urge my colleagues to support the Craig-Feinstein resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3965-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3965-S3966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 108--TO DESIGNATE MAY 4-12, 2002, AS \n                       ``NATIONAL TOURISM WEEK''\n\n  Mr. BURNS (for himself and Mr. Reid) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Madam President, I have tried again tonight to appoint \nconferees on the Sudan Peace Act. The House took this simple step late \nlast year. This will be the third time we have sought consent to take \nthis very simple procedural step. Each time our Republican colleagues \nhave objected.\n  What is happening in Sudan is a travesty. The government in Khartoum, \nthe same government, incidentally, that gave shelter to Osama bin \nLaden, is waging a brutal civil war against the Christians in the south \nof that country. We are reminded of the brutality of this war in \noccasional newspaper stories, but the people of that ravaged land live \nthis brutality daily.\n  We all have our views on what the final Sudan Peace Act should look \nlike,\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\nand I understand that there is significant concern with some of the \nprovisions of the House-passed version of this bill. That's to be \nexpected.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to S. Res. 261, submitted earlier today by Senators Akaka, \nConrad, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 261) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that public servants should be commended for their \n     dedication and continued service to the Nation during Public \n     Service Recognition Week.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, it is with pleasure that I support a \nresolution commending public servants, especially our federal \nworkforce, for their dedication and continued service to the nation \nduring Public Service Recognition Week, which began yesterday and runs \nthrough May 12, 2002. I am delighted to be joined in this effort by \nSenators Cochran, Durbin, Levin, Lieberman, Voinovich, Collins, and \nThompson.\n  As my colleagues know, public service is a long and honored tradition \nin the United States. Today, more than ever, our nation is faced with \nchallenges that affect not only our way of life, but also the security \nof our country. Although we are still grappling with these changes, \nthere has been one steady and true beacon of hope and inspiration \nthrough this uncertainty--our federal workforce. Their dedication, \ncommitment, and tireless service have contributed greatly to the \ncountry's recovery from the tragic events of September 11th and the \nanthrax attacks through the U.S. Mail.\n  Public Service Recognition Week represents an opportunity for us to \nhonor and celebrate the commitment of individuals who serve the needs \nof the nation through work at all levels of government. Public Service \nRecognition Week is also a time to call on a new generation to consider \npublic service. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on International \nSecurity, Proliferation, and Federal Services, I am pleased that there \nis renewed interest in working for the federal government. This trend \nis particularly heartening given that 50 percent of our federal \nworkforce will be eligible to retire in the next five years. I also \nwish to point out that every federal agency has a role in ensuring that \nour nation is protected and that it prospers, not just those agencies \nand federal employees that are directly fighting the war on terrorism.\n  I invite my colleagues to honor the patriotic commitment to public \nservice that our federal employees exemplify and to join in the federal \ngovernment's annual celebration. From May 9-12, 2002, there will be an \nextensive exhibit on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., showcasing \nmany of our federal agencies and branches of the military, as well as \nhighlighting the services these agencies provide.\n  In addition to the Mall exhibits, I encourage my colleagues to \nrecognize federal employees, as well as state and local government \nemployees within their states, to let them know how much their work is \nappreciated. Our resolution details the tremendous contributions that \nour public servants make to their country and communities.\n  I am very proud of the men and women who serve our country, both in \nand out of uniform. I urge my fellow members to use next week to thank \nour federal employees for their enthusiasm and selfless dedication to \npublic service.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, that any statements relating thereto be printed \nin the Record, all without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 261) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 261\n\n       Whereas Public Service Recognition Week provides an \n     opportunity to honor and celebrate the commitment of \n     individuals who meet the needs of the Nation through work at \n     all levels of government;\n       Whereas over 20,000,000 men and women work in government \n     service in every city, county, and State across America and \n     in hundreds of cities abroad;\n       Whereas the United States of America is a great and \n     prosperous Nation, and public service employees have \n     contributed significantly to that greatness and prosperity;\n       Whereas Americans benefit daily from the knowledge and \n     skills of these highly trained individuals;\n       Whereas public servants--\n       (1) help the Nation recover from natural disasters and \n     terrorist attacks;\n       (2) fight crime and fire;\n       (3) deliver the mail;\n       (4) teach and work in the schools;\n       (5) deliver Social Security and Medicare benefits;\n       (6) fight disease and promote better health;\n       (7) protect the environment and national parks;\n       (8) improve transportation and the quality of water and \n     food;\n       (9) build and maintain roads and bridges;\n       (10) provide vital strategic and support functions to our \n     military;\n       (11) keep the Nation's economy stable;\n       (12) defend our freedom; and\n       (13) advance United States interests around the world;\n       Whereas public servants at the Federal, State, and local \n     level are the first line of defense in maintaining homeland \n     security;\n       Whereas for every essential service disrupted by the \n     terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, public servants \n     responded quickly and effectively, many giving their lives \n     for their country;\n       Whereas public servants demonstrated once again on \n     September 11, 2001, that civil servants at every level of \n     government are decent, hard-working men and women, committed \n     to doing a good job regardless of the circumstances;\n       Whereas America's Federal employees have risen to the \n     occasion and demonstrated professionalism, dedication, and \n     courage during the attacks of September 11, 2001, and in \n     their aftermath;\n       Whereas after September 11, 2001, thousands of Federal \n     employees were deployed in disaster response teams, and \n     government employees continue to contribute in the war on \n     terrorism as a part of their normal duties;\n       Whereas each agency has a role in ensuring that the Nation \n     is secure and prosperous despite renewed attention to those \n     agencies which are directly fighting the war on terrorism; \n     and\n       Whereas May 6 through 12, 2002, has been designated Public \n     Service Recognition Week\n\n[[Page S3974]]\n\n     to honor America's Federal, State, and local government \n     employees; and\n       Whereas Public Service Recognition Week will be celebrated \n     through job fairs, student activities, and agency exhibits: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends government employees for their outstanding \n     contributions to this great Nation;\n       (2) salutes their unyielding dedication and spirit for \n     public service;\n       (3) honors those public servants who have given their lives \n     in service to their country;\n       (4) calls upon a new generation of workers to consider a \n     career in public service as an honorable profession; and\n       (5) encourages efforts to promote public service careers at \n     all levels of government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/07/senate-section/article/S3974-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII WARRIOR MEN'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM FOR \n              WINNING THE 2002 NCAA NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 262, submitted \nearlier by Senators Akaka and Inouye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 262) commending the University of \n     Hawaii Volleyball Team for winning the 2002 National \n     Collegiate Athletic Association Men's Volleyball National \n     Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to the consideration \nof the resolution.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, in \ncongratulating the University of Hawaii's Warrior Volleyball team, the \n2002 NCAA National Champions. The Warriors captured the title by \nbeating top-ranked Pepperdine University in four games Saturday evening \nin State College, Pennsylvania. The national championship is the first \nfor any men's athletic program at the University of Hawaii in over 30 \nyears of NCAA Division I competition.\n  Hawaii finished its championship season with a 24-8 record, and out-\nhit and out-blocked a Pepperdine team that had beaten the Warriors in \ntheir three previous meetings this season. Saturday's victory also \nmarked the 200th win for Warrior coach Mike Wilton in his ten-year \ntenure at Hawaii.\n  Sports fans in Hawaii love the men's and women's volleyball teams at \nthe University of Hawaii. Hawaii has led the nation in attendance for \nseven consecutive seasons. This season the Warriors drew 89,387 fans \nfor 16 home matches, an average of 5,587 per match, breaking the record \nset last year. It is not unusual for almost 8,000 fans to pack the Stan \nSheriff Center on the UH-Manoa campus for a contest against a \nconference rival. When you factor in the fact that all home matches are \ntelevised, you get an appreciation of the popularity of Hawaii's \nvolleyball program.\n  The 2002 Volleyball National Champions are an extraordinary team. \nThey are also an international team. Three-time All-American and Final \nFour MVP Costas Theocharidis is from Greece; Team captain Eyal Zimet is \nfrom Israel; senior All-American Dejan Miladinovic is from Serbia. \nAlong with Hawaii's best prep players, men from Canada, the mainland \nU.S., Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Guam, are a part of the 2002 Hawaii \nWarrior's championship team this season. It is a credit to the players, \ncoaches, trainers and staff, that outstanding teamwork, years of hard \nwork and conditioning, and dedication to the sport they love, have \nearned them the national championship.\n  The multinational 2002 champions are splendid representatives and \nambassadors for Hawaii. Hawaii is a multicultural State, where no race \nor ethnicity has a majority. Our Culture reflects the rich mosaic of \nNative Hawaiian, Asian, and Western cultures and traditions which are \nshared, celebrated, and appreciated by Hawaii's people and visitors to \nthe islands. Immigrants from nations around the world have shared their \nrich cultures and traditions, which in combination with the indigenous \nHawaiian culture, have created a special and wonderful place for \nresidents and visitors alike.\n  So it is with great pride and appreciation that I join my colleague \nfrom Hawaii and the people of Hawaii in honoring the 2002 National \nChampion University of Hawaii Warrior Volleyball team by offering a \nresolution commending their championship season. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a roster of Warrior Volleyball players, coaches, and staff \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. AKAKA. Congratulations to the Warriors players and Coach Mike \nWilton and his staff for a wonderful and historic season.

Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking up \nexpeditiously the Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety \nOfficers' Benefit Act of 2002. I thank Senators Campbell, Schumer, \nClinton, and Biden for cosponsoring our bipartisan measure. I also \ncommend Representatives Manzullo and Nadler for their leadership on the \nHouse version of this bill, H.R. 3297.\n  Named for Chaplain Mychal Judge, who was killed while responding with \nthe New York City Fire Department to the September 11 terrorist attacks \non the World Trade Center, this legislation recognizes the invaluable \nservice of police and fire chaplains in crisis situations by allowing \nfor their eligibility in the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program. \nFather Judge, while deemed eligible for public safety officer benefits, \nwas survived by his two sisters who, under current law, are ineligible \nto receive payments through the PSOB Program. This is simply wrong and \nmust be remedied.\n  Indeed, Father Judge is among ten public safety officers who were \nkilled on September 11, but who are ineligible for federal death \nbenefits because they died without spouses, children, or parents. This \nbill would retroactively correct this injustice by expanding the list \nof those who may receive public safety officer benefits to the \nbeneficiaries named on the most recently executed life insurance policy \nof the deceased officer. This change would go into effect on September \n11 of last year to make sure the families of Father Judge and the nine \nother fallen heros receive their public safety officer benefits.\n  In addition, this bill would retroactively restructure the Public \nSafety Officers' Benefit Program to specifically include chaplains as \nmembers of the law enforcement and fire units they serve, and would \nmake these chaplains eligible for the one-time $250,000 benefit \navailable to public safety officer who have been permanently disabled \nas a result of injuries sustained in the line of duty, or to the \nsurvivors of officers who have died.\n  We have yet another unique opportunity to provide much-needed relief \nfor the survivors of the brave public servants who selflessly risk and \nsacrifice their own lives everyday so that others might live or be \ncomforted.\n  Finally, I applaud the National Association of Police Organization, \nthe Fraternal Order of Police, and American Federation of State, County \nand Municipal Employees for their leadership and strong support for \npublic safety officers and their families. I ask unanimous consent that \ntheir letters in support of the Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains \nPublic Safety Officers' Benefit Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      Grand Lodge,\n\n\n                                    Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing on behalf of the membership \n     of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our strong \n     support for S. 2431, the ``Mychal Judge Police and Fire \n     Chaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefit Act of 2002.''\n       None of us in the public safety community will ever forget \n     the tremendous courage exhibited by our police, fire, and \n     rescue personnel as they responded to the devastating\n\n[[Page S3976]]\n\n     terrorist attacks of 11 September. Nor will we forget the \n     examples of heroism and self-sacrifice exemplified by Father \n     Judge and the other dedicated public servants who lost their \n     lives on that day.\n       The legislation you have introduced affords Congress the \n     opportunity to further honor these American heroes by making \n     two important enhancements to the Public Safety Officers' \n     Benefits Program (PSOB). First, S. 2431 will specifically \n     recognize police and fire chaplains who were killed or \n     injured in the line of duty while responding to a fire, \n     rescue, or police emergency among those who are eligible for \n     PSOB benefits. In addition, the bill would expand the list of \n     those allowed to receive such benefits in the event of an \n     officer's death to include, in the event that there is no \n     surviving spouse or child, the individual designated by the \n     officer as a beneficiary under their most recently executed \n     life insurance policy.\n       On behalf of the more than 300,000 members of the Fraternal \n     Order of Police, thank you for your leadership on this issue \n     and for your continuing commitment to America's Federal, \n     State and local law enforcement officers. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact me, or Executive Director Jim Pasco, if \n     we can provide you with any additional information or \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Steve Young,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    National Association of Police\n\n\n                                          Organizations, Inc.,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the National Association of \n     Police Organizations (NAPO), representing 220,000 rank-and-\n     file police officers from across the United States, I would \n     like to advise you of our wholehearted support for S. 2431, \n     the ``Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety \n     Officers' Benefit Act of 2002.'' This bill will recognize the \n     invaluable service of police and fire chaplains in crisis \n     situations by allowing for their eligibility in the Public \n     Safety Officers' Benefit program.\n       Created by congress in 1976, the PSOB program is \n     administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance of the U.S. \n     Department of Justice and pays a one-time death benefit to \n     the families of public safety officers who die in the line of \n     duty.\n       S. 2431 is named after Franciscan Friar Mychal Judge who \n     was the Chaplain of the New York City Fire Department. Father \n     Judge was killed by the falling debris of the World Trade \n     Center on September 11, 2001, while giving last rites to \n     another firefighter who died in the terrorist attack.\n       NAPO thanks you for introducing this important piece of \n     legislation and expeditiously bringing it before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee for full consideration. We commend you \n     for your continued and strong support of law enforcement and \n     look forward to working with you for the bill's passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J. Johnson,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                       AFSCME,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 2, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the 1.3 million members of \n     the American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n     Employees (AFSCME) and the corrections and law enforcement \n     officers and emergency medical technicians that we represent, \n     I am writing to express our support for the Mychal Judge \n     Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefit Act \n     of 2002 (S. 2431).\n       Father Mychal Judge was a courageous and humane chaplain \n     and public servant who deserves the honor you bestow on him \n     posthumously by the introduction of this legislation which \n     expressly includes chaplains as eligible members of the law \n     enforcement and fire units for public safety death benefits \n     purposes. We know firsthand about his bravery because Father \n     Judge was an AFSCME member.\n       Not only does this legislation resolve any ambiguities \n     regarding coverage of chaplains, but it would also expand the \n     list of those who may receive benefits in the event of a \n     public safety officer's death in the line of duty. Currently, \n     if the officer does not have a surviving wife, children or \n     parents, no benefit would be paid as was the case with Father \n     Judge. Your legislation would allow this monetary benefit to \n     be paid to the individual designated by such officer as a \n     beneficiary under the officer's most recently executed life \n     insurance policy and then to the parents of the officer. As \n     you mentioned in your statement, approximately 450 public \n     safety officers killed in the September 11th attacks died \n     without spouses, children or parents so the $250,000 death \n     benefit will not be paid. Your legislation would correct this \n     inequity.\n       AFSCME wholeheartedly endorses the Mychal Judge Police and \n     Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act of 2002. \n     Thank you for recognizing the need for this legislative \n     change in the benefits program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles M. Loveless,\n                                          Director of Legislation.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, that any \nstatements relating thereto be printed in the Record, all without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
