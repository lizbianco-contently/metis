I \nwould advise Members and staff if they have filed their amendments \nalready, there is no need to refile them.\n  There will be no rollcall votes today. The next rollcall vote will \noccur at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, on cloture on the DOD authorization bill.\n  There is lots of work to do. The majority leader has asked me to \nannounce that we have the DOD bill we need to finish. We are close to \nhaving some final numbers on the appropriations bills so we can do \nthose conferences that are so badly needed and complete the other \nappropriations bills. We have the airport safety matter we must work on \nas quickly as possible. There is work we have to do on helping those \nemployees who have been displaced as a result of the incident on \nSeptember 11.\n  We have an antiterrorism bill the Judiciary Committee has been \nworking on all weekend. Senators Hatch and Leahy have literally been \nworking on that all weekend. They hope to have something for us in the \nnext few days, perhaps as early as tomorrow.\n  So there are lots of things to do. We are going to need the \ncooperation of all Senators to get them done as quickly as possible. \nThe continuing resolution will go for the next 2 weeks. We very much \nhope by that time we will have been able to complete the normal \nappropriations process or at least work our way toward that end.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about the \nfuture as I hope it might happen in the Senate. Obviously, we have a \ngreat many things to do, many of which are time imperative, that we \nneed to do them immediately, and I am for that.\n  I am very proud of what I have seen here and what I have seen at home \nwith respect to our national reaction to this terrorism assault and the \ndisaster with which we are faced. I believe the President and his team \nare doing what needs to be done, are doing the necessary research and \nintelligence gathering that is necessary. This is the most unusual kind \nof an emergency in which everyone is ready to do something but you have \nto first discover what it is that is proper to do. I think that is \nbeing done: Positioning the military, to the extent that that will be \nnecessary--again, a different kind of war but one in which the military \nobviously will be a very prime portion of it; moving to establish \ndomestic defense, working with our States--I was just this week with \nour National Guard in Wyoming, and the Governor was setting about to \nhave that be part of the security for airports--and the things that \nneed to be done will be given, I hope, an agenda for strengthening our \ndomestic defense regarding intelligence.\n\n  I am pleased the President is asking Members to seek to continue to \ndo the emergency things that must be done, while, at the same time, \nreturning to our daily business and routine. We can do both, urging \neveryone to have the patience we must have to retain our commitment and \ndetermination to move forward with things we must do.\n  I am proud of what I see at home. People have the same conviction \nthat we must do these things and are committed to doing whatever it \ntakes, supporting our country and supporting our President.\n  It is a shame to have to go through this terrible time but I am very \nproud with the Nation coming together, proud of what I see as a show of \npatriotism and support for America.\n  I am also very pleased with the performance of this Congress. There \nhas been an unusual and remarkable show of nonpartisanship to do the \nthings that, indeed, must be done. We have come together. We have much \nyet to do. I believe it would be good if we prioritized the activities \nto complete through the year. Among the 435 Members, there are \ndifferent ideas of priority, but we have to come to a decision as to \nwhat has to be done immediately. I wish we could do that. Clearly, our \npriorities will rest with the emergency demands brought about by the \nwar on terrorism, coupled with the emergency demands we now have with \nthe economy. We have special activities dealing both with defense and \nthe economy; we have our regular operational items we must do, such as \n13 different appropriations, none of which, yet, has cleared and gone \nto the President. This is what goes into the regular operation of \ngovernment. It seems to me it makes good sense to keep those separate. \nWe should separate the issues in the emergency category from the normal \noperational issues we face.\n  It would be a mistake to expand what will be long-term operational \nfunctions in this emergency way and run the risk of having those be \nthere when the emergency is over. We ought to deal with those \ndifferently. Certainly many of the things we need to do now will not be \nin place in the future.\n  I believe we should agree on a list of priorities, must-do items we \nneed to do for defense and terrorism. We should agree on a list of \npriorities. The administration has things we ought to do \nadministratively. We should agree with them to do them. We should make \na priority list of things to do to stimulate the economy, whether tax \nrelief, withholding tax changes, whatever. There are a number of things \nout there. We met last week with Chairman Greenspan, Bob Rubin, and \nothers. We will continue to do that. In fact, tomorrow we will meet \nwith Secretary O'Neill. I hope we can do this and come up with a list \nand commit ourselves to it, leaving us free to do the things we have to \ndo that are now before the Congress.\n  We have a great deal to do. It is not easy to set priorities, but \nthat is part of our responsibility. If we can do that, I would like the \nleadership to set up a committee to come up with the lists and present \nthem to the remainder of the Congress. That will move the Congress \nforward to do the things we must do in a divided fashion--what we must \ndo as a priority against the operational agenda.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to share with my colleagues my \nconcern about our economy, the loss of jobs, and the economic stimulus \npackage being considered by Members of the House, the Senate, and the \nWhite House. Mr. Thomas, the Senator from Wyoming, mentioned some of \nthe economic stimulus package. In my view, an education opportunity tax \ncredit should be included in any economic stimulus package put together \nin the coming weeks.\n  We know our economy is in serious trouble. The economy grew just 0.2 \nof 1 percent in the second quarter of this year, compared to 4.1-\npercent average growth in the year 2000. The most important thing we \ncan do at this point is increase consumer spending, especially on \ndurable goods. Orders for durable goods dropped in August, as reported \nby the Commerce Department, all of which was due to the technology and \ntransportation sectors. We have addressed the transportation industry \npartially, with the airline industry stabilization bill, but the \ntechnology sector still remains unaddressed.\n  Consumer confidence is dropping like a stone. The University of \nMichigan Consumer Sentiment Index released last week, September 28, \nindicated that consumer confidence dropped 21 percent. Although the \ncorrelation between consumer confidence and spending is not strong in \nthe short term, it is strong in the mid-to-long term. The No. 1 reason \nfor this precipitous drop in consumer confidence is because of where \nconsumers thought they would be in their own lives 6 months out. One \nfinancial market analyst was recently quoted in the Washington Post as \nsaying that the size of this decline in consumer confidence will \ntranslate into reduced spending in the next 6 months. That confidence \ndecline is not over. Consumers, clearly, are on a very cautious \nmindset. That is why we must take measures to improve consumer \nconfidence and spending again.\n  There is a debate currently underway in our country over which types \nof tax cuts are the answer to providing immediate economic growth. In \nmy judgment, we must focus on individual tax cuts that will immediately \nlift consumer confidence and result in greater consumer spending--the \nidea that we need to increase corporate savings and investment \nnecessities, that those companies have revenues in the first place, \nrevenues that come from consumer spending.\n  Instead, what is needed, as the Wall Street Journal editorialized \ntoday, is ``temporary, not permanent tax breaks--and preferably for \nconsumers, not business.''\n  The Wall Street Journal article was very clear as to the \nineffectiveness of corporate tax cuts in order to spur the economy, \nciting Gregory Mankiw, an economist at Harvard, who favors permanently \nabolishing the corporate income tax, but states that doing so now would \nnot result in immediate investment. He is quoted as saying:\n\n       The problem now is there's a lot of uncertainty, which is \n     inducing people to wait, which depresses aggregate demand, \n     which in turn exacerbates the economic slowdown.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal further opines that:\n\n\n[[Page S9943]]\n\n\n       . . . stimulating spending and making members feel secure \n     would be more effective than reducing corporate tax rates as \n     a way to boost economic growth.\n\n  In fact, we all know our economy, this free market, is all about the \nconsumer. If consumers do not buy, companies will not have revenue. If \ncompanies do not have revenue, they will not be able to invest, nor \nwill companies need employees to be in those jobs to produce. If they \ndo not invest, if they are not creating jobs, our economy will not grow \nout of this economic sluggishness.\n\n  The technology sector, which was once the leading force behind \neconomic growth and productivity, is now the most significant \ndetractor, getting hit the hardest by the contractions in spending and \ninvestment. There has been a 19-percent drop in technology spending, \nincluding a 45-percent drop in personal computer orders and a 14.5-\npercent drop in software and equipment spending.\n  Other sources of capital and growth have dried up as well. Banks \ncontinue to limit their exposure to the high-technology sector and \ntighten lending standards, cutting off resources at a time when money \nis already scarce. Venture capital has all but disappeared from this \nsector. First-round venture capital funding has already fallen $1.84 \nbillion, down 87 percent from the previous year during the second \nquarter of 2001.\n  This has all led to widespread layoffs within the tech sector over \nthis past year. Job cuts in the high-tech industries of \ntelecommunications, computers and electronics--those job cuts are up 13 \ntimes over what they were last year.\n  Through the end of August, high tech accounted for nearly 40 percent \nof the 1.1 million job cuts so far in 2001.\n  Just to put that in perspective, that is 4 times more, 4 times \ngreater than the entire post-attack airline industry layoffs--over \n400,000 jobs lost in the tech sector versus, obviously, a great concern \nover 100,000 jobs lost in the airline industry sector. The total tech \njob sector cuts in August alone exceeded all of the cuts for the year \n2000.\n  This technology sluggishness is clearly harmful for our future. \nTechnological advancements are how America and our economy will compete \nand succeed internationally, and technological sector growth and rapid \nadvances in productivity have been the base of our economic growth in \nthe past and will be a vital key to our competitiveness in the future. \nAs we look at technology in the future, whether it is computers, \nwhether it is clean coal technology, whether it is fuel cell \ntechnology, these are important for future competitiveness, our quality \nof life, and good jobs in the future.\n  The lifeline to our economy, consumer spending, has been seriously \ndampened by the terrorist attacks which occurred on September 11, 2001. \nThat is why I would like to bring the attention of my colleagues back \nto a bill I introduced in March of this year, the Educational \nOpportunity Tax Credit of 2001. This proposal will provide a $1,000-\nper-child computer purchase tax credit which families can also use, not \njust to buy computers but printers, monitors, educational software, or \nInternet access. However, this tax credit would not apply to tuition at \na private school. This would provide the exact type of boost both \nconsumer spending on durable goods and the technology sector need. \nMaybe we could limit this tax credit to 1 or 2 years. Even with that \nlimitation I would estimate it would provide upwards of $20 billion in \nnew consumer spending.\n  Think of parents who have a child in school. If they could buy their \nson or daughter a computer or some peripherals, a printer, they would \nsay: Gosh, if I do it this year or next year, I will get a tax break \nfor it. That will induce that spending.\n  It clearly would induce computer and technology spending, especially \nif it is available for 2 years, thus propelling the technology sector \nwhile also improving educational opportunities for students. The fact \nis, experience shows that even a small, temporary reduction in taxes \ncan bring about huge increases in computer sales.\n\n  In South Carolina, they had a sales tax holiday on computers for just \n3 days. CPU sales increased more than tenfold; 1,060 percent in those 3 \ndays.\n  In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania they eliminated the sales tax on \ncomputers for 1 week. CPU sales increased sixfold; 615 percent in that \ntime.\n  My Educational Opportunity Tax Credit would not just impact computer \nsales but also software makers, Internet access providers, printer, \nmonitor and scanner manufacturers as well.\n  In South Carolina they realized a 664-percent and 700-percent \nincrease in monitor and printer sales, respectively, with only a 5-\npercent tax break. We know that consumer spending accounts for two-\nthirds of all economic activity, which is largely flat and has been \nflat this summer and weakening in the last report in our economy.\n  The Education Opportunity Tax Credit represents the right solution \nfor our economy. No. 1, it increases consumer spending on computers and \nrelated technology. No. 2, it injects $20 billion into the weakest and \none of the very important links in our economy. No. 3, it provides \npreviously out-of-reach education and technology opportunities for \nfamilies.\n  As I said before, I am willing to work with my colleagues in \naddressing the best way to implement this proposal. We can shorten the \napplicable timeframe from the original bill. We can look at a different \ncredit level to make sure we get the maximum economic impact for \nminimum fiscal impact to the Treasury. But I am convinced that \ncombining consumer-oriented tax cuts with appreciation of what is \nreally going on in the technology sector can improve consumer \nconfidence, accelerate consumer spending, and provide the technology \nsector the revenues they need to reinvest and return our economy to \nstrong growth and also provide more good paying jobs for the people of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue based on my \nobservations over the past week, an issue clearly on the minds of many \npeople, and that is the potential threat of germ warfare and \nbioterrorism. Over the weekend, there was a lot of discussion through \nthe various media outlets about our broad vulnerability to terrorism in \nthe United States of America, in part based on intelligence and in part \nbased on the events of September 11.\n  Over the last week, many people have rushed to obtain antibiotics and \ngas masks to prepare for the threat of bioterrorism or germ warfare--\nthe threat that is posed by germs, bacteria--if viruses fall into the \nwrong hands. Many people are concerned that given the powerful \ndestructive ability of some of these viruses, they could used in a way \nthat threatens not only all Americans, but all of civilization.\n  A lot of people called me over the weekend, recognizing my interest \nin this topic and recognizing I had participated in passing a bill \ncalled the Public Health Threats and Emergency Act which was passed in \nthe year 2000.\n  People have asked if the threat of bioterrorism is real? The answer \nis yes, it is real. In fact, we have already seen the destructive use \nof bacteria by people in this country. In 1984, there was an outbreak \nin Oregon of salmonella poisoning from which over 700 people suffered \nsome illness. This outbreak was caused by members of a religious cult \nplacing living bacteria in the salad bars of 10 different sites across \nthe State.\n  The ``bio'' part of biogerm warfare or biochemical warfare is the \nliving organism, and that is what was inserted in the salad bars that \ncaused the illness of about 700 people. We know germ warfare has been \nused, so the threat is real.\n\n[[Page S9944]]\n\n  But before people attempt to respond to this threat by rushing out \nand buying items, we need to put the threat of bioterrorism in \nperspective. The overall probability of a bioterrorist attack is low. I \ndo not know exactly what that number is. In fact, we cannot put a \nspecific number on it, but the overall probability of a terrorist \nattack using biology, bacteria, living organisms--is low. However, it \nis increasing. It is now our number one or number two threat, and, at \nleast to me, it is clear that we are highly vulnerable in the event \nsuch an attack takes place.\n  The consequences of such an attack, whether it is with anthrax, \nsmallpox, tularemia, pneumonic plague, nerve agents or blister agents, \nis huge. Why? Because we are ill equipped. We are unprepared. However, \nin saying that, we have to be careful that we do not become alarmists. \nPeople will have nightmares, will not sleep at night, and the response \nshould be the opposite.\n  We need to recognize there are things we can do right now, first and \nforemost, to develop a comprehensive biodefense plan capable of \npreventing a bioterrorist attack. Obviously, prevention should be our \nprimary goal from the outset. We want to keep biological weapons out of \nthe hands of people who are intent on destruction. At the same time we \ncan be prepared--if these germs and agents fall in the hands of a \npotential terrorist--by preparing an effective response plan. Third, is \nthe response, an area called consequence management, crisis management \nafter such an assault takes place.\n  Yes, the threat is real, but very low--a tiny probability, but \ngrowing. Why do I say growing? Because on September 11 we witnessed a \ncalamity the likes of which have never been seen before in the history \nof the world. It was unexpected and unfathomable--using planes as \nbombs. We know those events were carefully planned out over a period of \nyears in a very sophisticated way that was obviously well financed. \nTherefore, I will say it is growing because we did not expect it, and \nbecause it has occurred several years after Khobar Towers and after the \nattack on the USS Cole. So there is an increasing threat of calamity \nand destruction.\n  This threat is rising, secondly, because of scientific advances in \nareas such as aerosolization. People talk about anthrax and how you \ncannot really aerosolize it--that is, breaking it down into defined \nparticles so it can be inhaled into the lungs--because 10 years ago we \ntried to do it and could not do it. However, over the last 10 years \nthere have been huge advances in this technology. Today we use \nnebulizers in hospitals to aerosolize particles to get medication deep \ninto the lungs. We did not have that technology 10 to 15 years ago, but \nthe technology has been developed.\n  Take perfume, for example. When one goes through a department store, \none can smell the perfume around. The technology of aerosolization has \nprogressed rapidly over the last 10 to 15 years. What we thought could \nnot be done 10 or 15 years ago can be done today because of advances in \ntechnology.\n  Another example is airplanes spraying chemicals. They say: Oh, those \ncrop dusters cannot do it, but there are some dry chemical crop dusters \nthat might be able to spray agents.\n  I have mentioned these examples because science has changed and what \nwe could not do years ago can be done today.\n  In addition, the scientific expertise related to biochemical warfare \nis there. A lot of people don't realize that during the 1980s, well \nafter a general pact in 1972 was agreed upon by really the world, the \nSoviet Union set out in a very determined and aggressive way to develop \nbiochemical weapons. The number one goal of this project was the \ndevelopment of pathogens that could kill. This was not a little, secret \nproject. This project involved as many as 7,000 scientists whose \nprofessional being, through the 1980s in the Soviet Union, was to \ndevelop these pathogens and effective mechanisms for their delivery.\n  With the fall of the Soviet Union 13 years ago, those scientists all \nof a sudden became unemployed. With no employment available in the \nformer Soviet Union, those scientists have gone elsewhere in the world. \nWe do not know where they all are, but we do know that they spent their \nentire professional life studying how to develop the boichemical \nweapons that threaten us today.\n  I say that because it is not beyond the realm of possibility that \nthose scientists can be either hired or bought. All of this is in the \npublic record, and, again, I want to be very careful because I do not \nwant to be an alarmist. On the other hand, people need to realize that \nfrom the technology and the scientific standpoint, the expertise is out \nthere.\n  The third area, and the reason why I say the risk is rising compared \nto 10 years ago, is that the United States today has emerged as the \nsole superpower of the world. Without the cold war and the sort of \nbalances and the trade-offs and the push and the pull, the United \nStates has become the target of many people who resent us, who do not \nlike us, who are jealous of us, and a lot of that fervor today will hit \nthe surface, or was hitting the surface more than 10 or 15 years ago in \nthe middle of the cold war.\n  So, the threat is real: low probability but rising.\n  Let me just close on an issue that has to be addressed, and that is \nthis whole field of vulnerability. Why are we so vulnerable today? We \nhave heard recently that the Federal Government has worked aggressively \nand compared to 4 years ago, there has been enormous improvement at the \nFederal level. We are investing money that was not being invested 4 \nyears ago. We are organized. We have 12-hour push products that allow \nus to very quickly could get antibiotics and vaccine, although not \nenough vaccine. We have a delivery system that could be mobilized very \nquickly. All of this is good.\n  We also know that at the Federal level we are not nearly as \ncoordinated as we should be. Treasury, Defense, Energy, and Health and \nHuman Services are all doing something, but according to the GAO report \nthat came out last week, we need better organization and better \ncoordination to eliminate the duplication and to eliminate the possible \nconflicting messages that are sent from the Federal level. So, we can \ncoordinate better.\n  I am delighted that Governor Ridge has taken on this overall \nresponsibility because that is the first step toward better \ncoordination.\n  What really bothers me, when I say the vulnerability is high in spite \nof low probability, is that our public health infrastructure has been \nwoefully and inadequately underfunded over the last really 15 years to \ntwo decades.\n  If there were a bioterrorist attack using germ warfare, what would \nhappen? Basically, you have to diagnosis, you have to have good medical \nsurveillance, you have to be able to assimilate a response team, and \nyou have to do in it a rapid fashion. That is done through our public \nhealth system. The difference between conventional weaponry and \nbioweaponry is that bioweaponry requires first responders that are not \njust the firemen and the policemen, which are so critical and whose \ncourage was so well demonstrated 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago, but in addition the \nfirst responders have to be the physicians, nurses, and the people who \nare managing the public health systems today.\n\n  Most physicians have never been trained to recognize smallpox or to \nrecognize the pneumonic plague that affects the lungs or to recognize \ntularemia or the various types of food poisoning. They have not been \ntrained. When you see 100 cases of flu, you do not even think about \npneumonic anthrax. So we need better training.\n  We have underfunded the public health infrastructure. Communities of \nfewer than 25,000 people are being served by public health units of \nwhich fewer than two-thirds have fax machines or an Internet \nconnection. The ability to communicate between public health units once \nsomething is suspected or identified between the public health entities \nis absolutely critical. This communication infrastructure, at least \nfrom my standpoint, as a physician, as someone who has dealt in \ntreating the immuno-compromised host through the field of \ntransplantation for 20 years before coming to the Senate, is totally \ninadequate today.\n  There are four other things that we can do. The bill that we passed \nin this body last year, the Public Health Threats and Emergency Act, is \na good first step. It addressed this prevention, it addressed this \npreparedness, and it\n\n[[Page S9945]]\n\naddressed this third category of consequence management.\n  Unless we support our public health infrastructure, we cannot \nminimize the vulnerability that is out there today by training those \nfirst responders, by making sure that coordination at the local level \namong various entities is intact. This coordination is not there today \nbecause we have underinvested. Finally we must make sure that there is \ncoordination at the State level and then at the Federal level and then \nacross the Federal level, and that there is appropriate coordination \nwithout duplication.\n  I will simply close by saying that now is not the time for \nindividuals to go out and hoard antibiotics or to buy gas masks. Now is \nthe time for us to come together and develop a comprehensive biodefense \nplan that looks first at prevention to make sure we have the adequate \nintelligence, the appropriate research in terms of viruses, in terms of \nvaccines, and in terms of methods of early detection; second to look at \npreparedness, to make sure we are stockpiling the appropriate \nantibiotics, that we have a sufficient number of vaccines, which we \nsimply do not have today but we are working very hard to get; and third \nthat our consequence management and crisis management could handle what \nis called the surge product, the rush of people to emergency rooms, in \na straightforward way.\n  I am very optimistic. We are working very hard over the course of \nthis week on how much money should be put into this effort. We had a \ngood first step last year in the Public Health Threats and Emergency \nAct. I am very confident that the American public will be very well \nserved by this body and by the administration as we look at this \ncritical area of biodefense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier I was visiting with my colleague \nfrom the State of Idaho, who spent this weekend in his home State, and \nI briefly described to him my travels in North Dakota. All of us \nserving in this Congress, both the House and the Senate, discover and \nunderstand a different spirit in this country since the September 11 \ntragedies that occurred as a result of the acts of terrorists.\n  I was traveling down Interstate 94 in North Dakota, on kind of a \nlonely space of that road, without a building or town in sight. All I \nsaw were prairies and fenceposts. In the middle of that vista was a \nsingle American flag, hoisted up on a fence cornerpost, gently blowing \nin the North Dakota morning breeze--one single American flag.\n  That morning, I was on my way to an event in Hettinger, ND. There \nwere perhaps 80 to 100 people who came to this event in Hettinger, and \nthe master of ceremonies asked that they open the events with the \nPledge of Allegiance. Following the Pledge of Allegiance, it occurred \nto me that it was the first time I had heard the Pledge of Allegiance \nby a group of people in which it was something much more than reciting \na pledge from memory. It was much more about a pledge than it was about \nmemory.\n  All across this country, there is a sense of patriotism, a love of \ncountry, that has sprung from these tragedies of September 11, and that \nspirit invades in a good way the work of the Senate and the House as \nwell. We have had more cooperation on a range of controversial issues \nin the last couple of weeks than I have seen in years in the Senate.\n\n  I say that as an introduction. We are now on a piece of legislation \nthat is very important in a time of national security interests and in \na time in which we have suffered these terrorist attacks. We have the \nDefense authorization bill before the Senate. It is stuck. We cannot \nseem to move it.\n  Why would we not be able to move something as important as a Defense \nauthorization bill at a time such as this? Some Members of the Senate \nare insistent on, among other things, having an energy bill as an \namendment to this bill, including the energy bill that was passed by \nthe House of Representatives on this Defense authorization bill.\n  It is certainly the case we ought to pass an energy bill in this \nCongress. I don't think there is much debate about that. The Presiding \nOfficer, the Senator from New Mexico, is the chairman of the Energy \nCommittee on which I serve. We have been working for some long while to \ntry to find common ground to write a new energy bill for our country. \nIt takes on new urgency to write an energy bill, given what happened in \nthis country on September 11, given the threat of actions by terrorists \nthat could thwart the opportunity to have energy flow to places in this \ncountry that need it.\n  We need to do something with respect to not only energy security but \nenergy supply and conservation and more. How do we do that? We don't do \nthat, it seems to me, by simply taking a bill that was passed by the \nHouse of Representatives, and offering that as an amendment to a \nDefense bill in the Senate, especially in a circumstance where offering \nthat as an amendment holds up a bill as vital to this country as the \nDefense authorization bill. I urge my colleagues to allow Members to \nmove forward and deal with the amendments on the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  We have filed a cloture motion on the Defense authorization bill to \nbe voted on tomorrow, but it is troublesome that we have to file a \ncloture motion to try to shut off a filibuster, in effect, on a Defense \nauthorization bill at this time and in this place in this country. We \nought to move as one with a new dedication of spirit and new \ndetermination to pass legislation as important as this, without hanging \nit up with extraneous amendments.\n  Let me talk for a moment about energy. The energy amendment some of \nmy colleagues wish to offer to this Defense authorization bill is not \ngermane to this bill. It has nothing to do with this bill. This bill is \nabout the Defense Department and programs in the Defense Department. Is \nenergy important? Absolutely. Energy is an important subject. There is \na way to deal with energy policy in this country. All Members know we \nneed to produce more: produce more oil and natural gas. We will do \nthat. We all understand part of a comprehensive national energy policy \nis not only production, but it is also conservation. Some have this \nview that the only energy strategy that exists in America is to dig and \ndrill. Just dig and drill and you will solve America's energy problem.\n  We need to produce more. I will support additional production. That \nis part of an energy policy we need. But we need conservation, \nefficiency, and we need to include renewables and limitless energy \nsources. All of those need to be part of a balanced energy program.\n  If we develop an energy policy and bring it to the floor of the \nSenate, which we should in my judgment, we can have a discussion about \nthe different views of different Members of the Senate about how that \nmix ought to come together in an energy bill. It does not make sense, \nand in my judgment, does not help do what we need to do in the Senate \nto hold up a Defense authorization bill so one can try to offer an \nenergy bill passed in the House of Representatives as an amendment to a \nDefense bill. That is not the right thing to do at this point.\n\n  How do we reconcile this? My hope is those who are holding up the \nDefense authorization bill will stop and say: Let's work together on a \nDefense authorization bill that makes sense for this country. We can do \nthat.\n  We are going to be sending men and women into harm's way in this \ncountry. We probably already have. We certainly will in the future. Yet \nwe are not willing to pass a Defense authorization bill without \noffering extraneous amendments? That is not fair. It is not the right \nthing to do.\n  I attended a ceremony in North Dakota on Friday in which I presented \nmedals that had been earned by World War II veterans that they never \nreceived. Two were Bronze Stars for members of the 184th Division of \nthe North Dakota National Guard. They fought 600 days in combat. They \nactually saved Guadalcanal. They got a letter from the Marine \ncommandant saying they wanted to make them honorary marines. These were \nvery brave,\n\n[[Page S9946]]\n\nbattle-weary veterans when World War II was over. They were much \ndecorated. One of the company commanders had several Silver Stars, \nseveral Bronze Stars. These were brave, brave Americans.\n  As I presented the medal to one of them, he began to cry, thinking \nback about what his contribution was to this country, what he had done \nwith his buddies, thinking back about the number of friends he had lost \nin that National Guard unit.\n  As we now send men and women from our country into harm's way, what \nwe ought to do on defense policy, both with respect to the Defense \nAuthorization Act and the Defense Appropriations Act, is bring these \nbills to the floor of the Senate, work on them in a spirit of \ncooperation, and get them passed. That says, with one voice, to those \nmen and women in uniform in this country: We are going to give you all \nthe support you need to do what you need for this country to protect \nand preserve our liberty and freedom.\n  We are asking them to find those terrorists who committed these acts \nof mass murder against American citizens, find those terrorists and \npunish them, and help prevent these terrorist attacks from ever \noccurring again. That is a dangerous job.\n  President Bush has come to the Congress and said in a call to the \nAmerican people that he needs America to be unified. We should speak as \none. We should say to terrorists and those harboring them around the \nworld: This country will not allow that to stand. We will find you and \nwe will punish you.\n  At this time and in this place, we must, in support of the President \nand in support of the men and women who wear America's uniforms, we \nmust pass this Defense authorization bill and stop what happened in the \nlast week and a half, stop the blocking of this bill for other issues.\n  Then let's come back and deal with energy. I have great confidence in \nmy colleague from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, who now chairs the Energy \nCommittee. My colleague waiting to speak, the Senator from Idaho, Larry \nCraig, is on the committee. We have a lot of good people on the Energy \nCommittee who can work together for a sensible energy policy for this \ncountry. Then let's debate that and have a conference with the House \nand proceed. Yes, we have security issues with respect to energy. Let's \nproceed on those and do it in the regular order. We should write that \nbill in the Energy Committee.\n\n  One final point: We not only have security threats with respect to \nterrorist acts in this country and all the security issues that related \nto that, we also have some emergency issues dealing with this country's \neconomy. Some of that relates to energy, but some of it relates to \ngeneral economic circumstances in this country.\n  The question will be, in my judgment, for the next couple of weeks, \nWill we need a stimulus package in order to provide some lift to the \nAmerican economy? Shall we develop an economic stimulus package? If so, \nwhat will that package be? Senator Daschle and I have written to a \ndozen or so of the leading economists in this country last week, and we \nasked if they would share in a letter an analysis of whether they \nbelieve we need a stimulus package; if not, why not, and if so, what \nshould that package include.\n  I will release to my colleagues today a special report that describes \nthe response of the leading economists in the country in which they \ndescribe how they believe we ought to proceed; what kind of stimulus \npackage, if they believe we should have one, would provide a lift to \nthe American economy; what kind of an approach we should use during \nthis period. We have the Federal Reserve Board working on monetary \npolicies. They are obviously furiously trying to cut high interest \nrates. We are working on fiscal policy issues in the Congress.\n  Specifically, the question with respect to fiscal policy is, Will we \nneed a stimulus package? And if so, what will that package be? I will \nrelease that report this afternoon. It contains a fascinating analysis \nby the leading economists, including Nobel laureates, the leading \neconomic voices in America.\n  We need to get this right, as well. We need to work in a spirit of \ncooperation, between Republicans and Democrats, conservatives and \nliberals, to join hands and see what we can do to provide some lift to \nthis American economy and give the American people some confidence that \ntomorrow is going to be better than today; that they can have \nconfidence in the future. We will have economic growth and opportunity \nin this country's future.\n  All of those are issues that have relationships to each other. But \nlet me just come back to the point I was making originally. We need to \ndo business in this Senate the right way. The Defense authorization \nbill ought to be passed. We ought not block that legislation. Blockage \nof the Defense authorization bill has not been good for this country. \nLet's back away, debate the issues that are relevant to that bill, pass \nthat legislation, and then let's move on to the other critical issues \nour country faces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor in morning business to \ntalk about National Public Lands Day, but before I do that I want to \nrespond to my colleague from North Dakota, ever so briefly, to suggest \nthat the Defense authorization bill can and should move on the floor \njust as he said.\n  There are not a lot of amendments that are holding it up, but there \nis one important one--that has not yet been offered--in an effort to \ntry to cause the Senate to shape a direction and establish a time \ncertain when the Senate can debate a national energy policy.\n  The Presiding Officer happens to be chairman of the Energy Committee \nin the Senate. He and I have worked long hours already, trying to \ndetermine what might go into a national energy policy bill that could \ncome from his authorizing committee.\n  As we know, the House acted before the August recess on a national \nenergy policy. At that time, the American people said we ought to have \na national energy policy for the stability and strength of our economy, \nbecause of the long-term need for energy, and, last, because of \nnational security needs.\n  Since September 11, there has been a literally cataclysmic change in \nthe thinking of the American people as it relates to energy. Issues \nthat once resided in the 35-percent positive range are now at 65-\npercent positive, relating to certain aspects of energy and energy \ndevelopment. I say that because in looking at a poll that was taken on \nDecember 15 and 16, the pollster told me--the poll is still sequestered \nyet for certain purposes--that in his opinion the events of September \n11 changed the mindset of the American public in a greater way than \never in the history of modern-day polling.\n\n  No longer is energy an issue of economic stability. It is now, by a \nfactor of 15 points, an issue of national security. Why? Because the \nAmerican people now well understand we are nearly 60-percent dependent \nupon foreign oil, and a dominant amount of that oil comes out of the \nMiddle East. In fact, just last week the OPEC ministers decided not to \nturn down their valves to force up the price of crude oil because they \nwere afraid they would dump the world economy. That was exactly their \nthinking. I had a phone conversation with our Secretary of Energy, \nSpence Abraham, who had gone to Vienna to talk to the ministers. They \nhad concluded they would not force the price up by forcing the volume \ndown.\n  If we are going to decide we cannot deal with a national energy \npolicy for the next 3 or 4 months when in fact we have already spent 2 \nyears looking at policy before the committee--the Presiding Officer, \nthe chairman, has a bill out, the ranking member has a bill out, and \nthere are other versions. We might not be able to do a large bill that \nis fully comprehensive. But I believe in this time, when America is \nasking us to unite and stand together and has said that energy is now a \nnational security issue of the utmost importance, that we in the next 2 \nweeks on the Energy Committee, if we chose to work 4 or 5 days a week \nand have our staffs working hard, could do just that: Produce a \ncomprehensive energy bill, bring it to the floor, vote on it, and begin \nto work with the House to find out our differences.\n  If we recess in late October or early November--or adjourn, whatever \nour\n\n[[Page S9947]]\n\nleadership decides--an energy bill ought to be on the President's desk \nwaiting for his signature. Any less performance than that is an \ninadequate performance on the part of the Congress.\n  I think we do have that opportunity. The reason we have a colleague \non the floor saying he wants to put one on the Defense authorization \nbill is to cause the leadership of the Senate not to stonewall the \nissue but to give us a time certain when that issue can come to the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/01/senate-section/article/S9947-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VALUE OF PUBLIC LANDS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. If I could for a few moments talk about something that is \nnear and dear to my heart, that is public lands. My State of Idaho is \n63-percent public land. Last Saturday was a time for all Americans to \nrecognize the value we have in our public lands and a time for all of \nus to give a little something back, by volunteering a Saturday to lend \na helping hand to improve our public lands. Last Saturday was National \nPublic Lands Day.\n  This year, National Public Lands Day focused on ``Keeping the \nPromise'' by asking Americans to come together to improve the nation's \nlargest resource, our public lands, and to honor the work and sacrifice \nof the members of the Civilian Conservation Corps.\n  They are unsung heroes who built over 800 of America's national and \nstate parks.\n  Between 1933 and 1942, 3.5 million Corps members planted almost 4 \nbillion trees, and they built parks, roads, and hiking trails.\n  They laid the foundation for the public lands system that America \nenjoys today.\n  This year the Corps held their final national reunion on National \nPublic Lands Day.\n  The ceremony remembered the efforts of the Civilian Conservation Corp \nat Virginia's Shenandoah National Park, and the Corps Alumni \nsymbolically passed the responsibility of caring for public lands to a \nnew generation of concerned citizens.\n  This year, this new generation totaled approximately 50,000 \nvolunteers, who took some of their precious time and performed over a \nmillion dollars worth of improvements to our public lands.\n  I believe National Public Lands Day is an opportunity to build a \nsense of ownership by Americans--through personal involvement and \nconservation education.\n  In recognition of National Public Lands Day and this sense of \nownership we should all have for our public lands, I want to spend a \nfew minutes today and reflect on the value of our public lands and on \nwhat the future holds for them.\n  There are around 650 million acres of public lands in the United \nStates. This represents a major portion of our total land mass.\n  However, most of these lands are concentrated in the West, where as \nmuch as 82 percent of a state can be comprised of Federal land. In \nfact, 63 percent of my own home state of Idaho is owned by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  This can be beneficial, as our public lands have a lot to offer.\n  For starters, there is a great deal of resources available on our \npublic lands--from renewable forests to opportunities to raise \nlivestock to oil and minerals beneath the surface--public lands hold a \ngreat deal of the resources we all depend on and that allow us to enjoy \nthe abundant lives we live in this country.\n  Having resources available on public lands affords us the opportunity \nfor a return on those resources to help fund government services, from \nschools to roads to national defense, and ease the burden on taxpayers.\n  Just as important, though, is the recreation opportunities our public \nlands offer.\n  Every day, people hike and pack into the solitude of wilderness \nareas, climb rocks, ski, camp, snowmobile, use off-road vehicles, hunt, \nfish, picnic, boat, swim, and the list goes on of the abundance of \nrecreation on these marvelous lands.\n  Because the lands are owned by all of us, the opportunity has existed \nfor everyone to use the land within reasonable limits.\n  However, times are changing. We are in the midst of a slow and \nmethodical attack on our access to public lands.\n  It started with the resources industries. It will not stop there.\n  At the same time some radical groups are fighting to halt all \nresource management on our public lands, they are working to restrict \nand, in some cases, eliminate human access to our public lands for \nrecreation.\n  Yes, we must manage our public lands responsibly, which includes \nrestrictions on some activities in some areas.\n  What we must not do is unreasonably restrict or eliminate certain \nactivities.\n  Some people like to hike in backcountry areas where they can find \npeace and solitude while others prefer to ride ATVs into the \nwilderness.\n  Some prefer to camp in more developed facilities while others prefer \nprimitive spots.\n  The point is that recreational opportunities on our public lands \nshould be as diverse as the American public's interest.\n  On the same note, we can use the natural resources we need in an \nenvironmentally responsible manner and still have plenty of \nopportunities to recreate.\n  In fact, recreation resource, and environmental interests can team \ntogether to help each other out. In my own State of Idaho, on the Nez \nPerce National Forest, representatives of these interests and many \nothers have come together though a stewardship project.\n  These groups are working with the Forest Service to implement a \nproject that works for everyone and addresses all of their needs in \nsome fashion.\n  In order to achieve such success, each group has had to compromise to \nagree on a prescription that works for everyone. No one gets their way \nall of the time.\n  This is just one example of differing interests working together to \nhelp each other out and improve the opportunities on our public lands \nfor everyone and to secure a sound environment.\n  We need to see more of this around the country.\n  Public land management has become embroiled in fights, appeals, and \nlitigation. The result is that the only ones who are winning are those \nwho want to ensure we don't use our public lands.\n  This must stop. Differing interests have to come together and realize \nthat we all have one common goal--use of the land in a responsible and \nenvironmentally sound manner.\n  We can not continue to make the same mistakes of the past on these \nmarvelous public lands.\n  That being said, I would like each of my colleagues to think about \nhow public lands benefit their State and how they might work to support \nthe new generation of Americans who are just beginning to find the \nwonders of our public lands.\n  Last Saturday was National Public Lands Day, and many walked upon \nthose lands and rode water equipment on the lakes of those lands. Some \neven cut down a few trees to make a home or to provide saw timber to a \nsawmill. Some were herding cattle on the public lands of Idaho, taking \nthem from the summer range to the fall range and heading them home for \nthe winter season. Soon many will be hunting on the public lands of the \nWest--hunting the elusive elk, or the deer, or other forms of wildlife \nspecies that are abundant and managed both in balanced and purposeful \nways.\n  That is the great story of our Nation's public lands. It is not \nsimply to lock them up and look at them, to call them, as medieval \nEurope once used to call them, ``the King's land.'' The lands of the \npublic are not the King's lands, and they are not the Government's \nlands; they are the people's lands.\n  These lands must be managed in a way that ensures their environmental \nintegrity while allowing all Americans to enjoy them in their lifetime \nand in their style.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will vote \non cloture on the bill at 10 a.m. tomorrow. I certainly hope the Senate \nwill invoke cloture on the bill because we have so many important items \nin this bill relating to our national security. It is essential that we \nact in the Senate so we can go to conference with the House and bring \nback a conference product.\n  So far we have adopted 47 amendments to the bill.

And one amendment has been offered and then withdrawn. \nOver the last few days of last week, and over the weekend, we and our \nstaffs have worked through more of the amendments that have been filed \non the bill.\n  Senator Warner and I have another package of cleared amendments that \nwe will be offering later today in the form of a managers' package. We \nare continuing to work to clear amendments, and we expect to have more \ncleared later this afternoon. I encourage Senators who have amendments \nto bring them down and to work with our staffs to try to get them \ncleared.\n  Completing action on this bill tomorrow would send a powerful signal \nto our allies and our adversaries around the world of our sense of \nnational unity and determination and of our strong support for our \nArmed Forces. Failure to complete action on this bill would send the \nopposite message. So I urge all of our colleagues to put aside \ncontroversial issues that do not relate to this bill and to work with \nSenator Warner and with me to complete action on this important \nlegislation.\n  The ranking minority member of the committee, Senator Warner, is at \nthe White House with the President this afternoon. We were scheduled to \nbegin at 2 o'clock, but that meeting with the President obviously takes \nprecedence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/01/senate-section/article/S9948-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, up until a few days ago, the Senate was \nmoving with lightning-like speed to complete consideration of the \nDefense authorization bill. Complications arose last week and slowed \nthe bill down, but it appears that the Senate may be poised to shift \nback into high gear--or something like it--tomorrow and attempt to \nfinish the bill. A cloture motion was filed last week. If cloture is \ninvoked on Tuesday, passage of the bill will be more nearly assured.\n  Clearly, the Senate has many weighty matters to consider, both in \nthis bill and in other measures waiting in the wings. We should proceed \nwith all due haste to complete our work. The September 11 terrorist \nattack on the United States reordered our priorities and imposed a new \nmeasure of urgency on much of the business that is yet to come before \nthe Senate.\n  But in the heat of the moment, in the crush of recent events, I fear \nwe may be losing sight of the larger obligations of the Senate. Our \nresponsibility as Senators is to carefully consider and fully debate \nmajor policy matters, to air all sides of a given issue, and to act \nafter full deliberation. Yes, we want to respond quickly to urgent \nneeds, but a speedy response should not be used as an excuse to trample \nfull and free debate.\n  I am concerned that the Defense bill may be a victim of this rush to \naction, despite the respite offered by last week's delays. For example, \nthe Defense bill, as reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee, \ncontained language conditioning the expenditure of missile defense \nfunds on U.S. compliance with the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, the ABM \nTreaty. I worry that that language--which was somewhat controversial in \ncommittee and which was only narrowly approved--was dropped without a \nword of debate being uttered on the Senate floor. I understand the \nreluctance to engage in divisive public debate at a time when we are \nall seeking unity, but I caution that debate over such an important \nsubject as the ABM Treaty is not to be lightly dismissed. There is no \nquestion about the unity. The unity is here. And certainly, insofar as \nI am concerned, debate over an issue of this kind is not going to be an \napple of discord thrown into the mix. We may just happen to disagree on \nsome matters with respect to the ABM Treaty.\n\n  So I cannot understand why there needs to be such ``unity'' that it \nwould require keeping our voices completely mute on a matter of this \nkind. It would be no indication of disunity in this country and our \nneed to be unified in dealing with the terrorists or nations that \nharbor terrorists. As a matter of fact, the mere fact that we would \ndisagree on a matter before the Senate--the ABM Treaty, for example--is \nno indication of disunity when it comes to facing the common foe. Not \nto me, at least.\n  The Defense authorization bill provides up to $8.3 billion for \nmissile defense, including activities that may or may not violate the \nABM Treaty in the coming months. Many experts believe the ABM Treaty is \nthe cornerstone of international arms control and that to abrogate or \nwithdraw from the treaty can only lead to a new, dangerous, and costly \ninternational arms race. Other experts, on the other hand, are of the \nopinion that the ABM Treaty has outlived its usefulness, that it is a \nrelic of the cold war that makes it impossible for the United States to \nprotect its citizens against a new world order of rogue nations armed \nwith ballistic missiles and transnational terrorists who may very well \nbe armed with chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons.\n  This is a major policy issue. That is what it is--a major policy \nissue. I am not sure where I stand on the ABM Treaty, but I do know I \nam not prepared to trade it in on a still-to-be-developed, still-to-be-\nproven national missile defense program without giving the matter a \ngreat deal of thought and consideration.\n  The language that was dropped from the Defense bill would have \nprovided Congress the opportunity to vote on funding any missile \ndefense expenditure that would violate the ABM Treaty. It was a \nsensible provision, as I see it. I would have supported it, probably, \nand I would have been eager to engage in debate over it. Although I \nmight have little to say, I would still like to hear it. I would like \nto hear others. That opportunity was given away to avoid what? To avoid \na debate that some might have called divisive on this bill. So be it. \nBut having postponed that debate on this bill, we have an obligation to \nfind another venue in which to have that debate. And we should have \nthat debate sooner rather than later.\n  The resolution granting the President the authority to use force to \nrespond to the September 11 terrorist attack is another example of \nCongress moving quickly to avoid the specter of acrimonious debate at a \ntime of national crisis. The resolution Congress approved gives the \nPresident broad authority to go after the perpetrators of the terrorist \nattack regardless of who they are or where they are hiding. I am not \nsaying we ought to debate that ad infinitum, but at least we could have \nhad 3 hours or 6 hours of debate. Why do we have to put a zipper on our \nlips and have no debate at all?\n  It also authorizes the President to take all appropriate actions \nagainst nations, organizations, or persons who aided or harbored those \nperpetrators. In his address to Congress following the attack, \nPresident Bush vowed to take the battle against terrorism to those \npersons, such as Osama bin Laden; to those organizations, such as the \nTaliban; to those networks, such as Al-Qaida, and to any nations that \nacted as conspirators in the attack on the United States.\n\n[[Page S9949]]\n\n  I supported the resolution granting the President the authority to \nuse military force against the perpetrators of this terrible attack, \nand I applauded his address to Congress and to the Nation. I note that \nthe President wisely drew lines of discrimination, specifying that the \npunishment must be directed against those who are guilty of this crime, \nso that we cannot be accused of broadening our response to those who \nwere not involved in the September 11 attack. Our resolve and our \nferocity of response must carefully discriminate against the guilty, \nand surely if we do so, all men of reason, all nations of conscience, \nwill support and applaud us.\n\n  I was reassured by the President's remarks. But as I delved more \ndeeply into the resolution passed by Congress, I began to have some \nqualms over how broad a grant of authority Congress gave him in our \nrush to act quickly. Because of the speed with which it was passed, \nthere was little discussion establishing a foundation for the \nresolution. Because of the paucity of debate, it would be difficult to \nglean from the record the specific intent of Congress in approving S.J. \nRes. 23. There were after-the-fact statements made in the Senate, and \nthere was some debate in the House, but there was not the normal level \nof discussion or the normal level of analysis of the language prior to \nthe vote that we have come to expect in the Senate. And so I think it \nis important to take a second look at S.J. Res. 23, to examine its \nstrengths and weaknesses, and to put on record the intent of Congress \nin passing the resolution.\n  I am not sure we are doing that. Just as this is my speech, just as \nit is one Senator's observations, those observations might have been \nworth a little more had we made them before we passed that resolution \nin such a great hurry.\n  Two aspects of the resolution are key: First, the use of force \nauthority granted to the President extends only to the perpetrators of \nthe September 11 attack. It was not the intent of Congress to give the \nPresident unbridled authority--I hope it wasn't--to wage war against \nterrorism writ large without the advice and consent of Congress. That \nintent was made clear when Senators modified the text of the resolution \nproposed by the White House to limit the grant of authority to the \nSeptember 11 attack.\n  Let me at this point read into the Record the original text of \nproposed joint resolution submitted to the Senate leadership by the \nWhite House on September 12 this year of our Lord, 2001. And I read it: \n``Joint resolution.'' The title: ``To authorize the use of United \nStates Armed Forces Against Those Responsible for the Recent attacks \nLunched Against the United States.''\n\n       Whereas, on September 11, 2001, acts of treacherous \n     violence were committed against the United States and its \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas, such acts render it both necessary and appropriate \n     that the United States exercise its rights to self-defense \n     and to protect United States citizens both at home and \n     abroad, and\n       Whereas, in light of the threat to the national security \n     and foreign policy of the United States posed by these grave \n     acts of violence, and\n       Whereas, such acts continue to pose an unusual and \n     extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign \n     policy of the United States,\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled--\n\n  And here is the resolving clause that was in the proposed legislation \nsubmitted by the White House to the Senate leadership--\n\n       That the President is authorized to use all necessary and \n     appropriate force against those nations, organizations or \n     persons he determines planned, authorized, harbored, \n     committed, or aided in the planning or commission of the \n     attacks against the United States that occurred on September \n     11, 2001, and to deter and pre-empt any future acts of \n     terrorism or aggression against the United States.\n\n  That completes the proposed resolution the White House submitted to \nthe Senate leadership. Senators modified this text that was proposed by \nthe White House to limit the grant of authority, and that limitation is \nextremely important because the resolution also gives the President \nunprecedented authority to wage war not only against nations involved \nin the September 11 terrorist attacks, but also against individuals and \norganizations.\n  The resolution as passed by the Senate on September 14 is as follows:\n\n       S.J. Res. 23. Whereas, on September 11, 2001, acts of \n     treacherous violence were committed against the United States \n     and its citizens; and\n       Whereas, such acts render it both necessary and appropriate \n     that the United States exercise its rights to self-defense \n     and to protect United States citizens both at home and \n     abroad, and\n       Whereas, in light of the threat to the national security \n     and foreign policy of the United States posed by these grave \n     acts of violence, and\n       Whereas, such acts continue to pose an unusual and \n     extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign \n     policy of the United States,\n       Whereas, the President has authority under the Constitution \n     to take action to deter and prevent acts of international \n     terrorism against the United States.\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled:\n       Section 1. Short Title.\n       This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Authorization \n     for Use of Military Force''.\n       Sec. 2. Authorization for Use of United States Armed \n     Forces.\n       (a) That the President is authorized to use all necessary \n     and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, \n     or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or \n     aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, \n     2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to \n     prevent any future acts of international terrorism against \n     the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.\n       (b) War Powers Resolution Requirements.--\n       (1) Specific Statutory Authorization.-- Consistent with \n     section 8(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution, the Congress \n     declares that this section is intended to constitute specific \n     statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5(b) of \n     the War Powers Resolution.\n       (2) Applicability of Other Requirements.-- Nothing in this \n     resolution supersedes any requirement of the War Powers \n     Resolution.\n  So, S.J. Res. 23 invokes the War Powers Resolution. Quite an addition \nto the proposal that was sent to the Senate from the White House.\n  The crux of the War Powers Resolution is that it provides specific \nprocedures for Congress to participate with the President in decisions \nto send U.S. forces into hostilities. Section 2(b) of S.J. Res. 23 \nspecifically invokes section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution and \nfurther declares that nothing in S.J. Res. 23 supercedes any \nrequirement of the War Powers Resolution.\n  Section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution provides that the President \nmust terminate any use of United States Armed Forces after 60 days \nunless Congress has declared war or has enacted a specific \nauthorization for such use of United States Armed Forces. S.J. Res 23 \nprovides that authorization within the context of the September 11th \nattack.\n  Let me read that again because the emphasis is on the word ``that.'' \nI am going to redo this. S.J. Res. 23 provides that authorization--that \nwe have just read about--within the context of the September 11 attack.\n  Those persons, organizations or nations that were not involved in the \nSeptember 11 attack are, by definition, outside the scope of this \nauthorization.\n  By signing S.J. Res 23 into law, as he did on September 18th, it \nwould seem that the President explicitly, or at least implicitly, \naccepted the terms of the Resolution, including the constraints imposed \nby the War Powers Resolution.\n  However, as clear as the language appears on its face, it is \nnoteworthy that President Bush, like other presidents before him, \nincluding his father, specifically noted in the statement he issued \nwhen he signed the resolution that despite his signature, he maintains \n``the longstanding position of the executive branch regarding the \nPresident's constitutional authority to use force, including the Armed \nForces of the United States and regarding the constitutionality of the \nWar Powers Resolution.''\n  Every President since the enactment of the War Powers Resolution in \n1973 has taken the position that the War Powers Resolution is an \nunconstitutional infringement of the President's constitutional \nauthority as Commander in Chief to deploy U.S. forces into hostilities.\n  This does not mean that President Bush will use that argument to \ncompletely shut Congress out of the process of deploying troops where \nhostilities are taking place or immediately threatened to take place. \nBut it\n\n[[Page S9950]]\n\ndoes mean that President Bush, like his predecessors, is likely to use \nthat argument to consult with Congress and report to Congress on his \nown terms and his own timetable instead of the terms and timetable \nspelled out in the war powers resolution.\n  Last week, President Bush submitted his first report to Congress on \nthe new U.S. Campaign Against Terrorism. In his letter, the President \nsaid, ``I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the \nCongress informed, consistent with the war powers resolution and Senate \nJoint Resolution 23. . . .'' While the intent may have been to inform, \nthe letter was decidedly lacking in details. Notwithstanding the \nrequirement of the War Powers Resolution, the President provided no \ndetails on the proposed scope and duration of the deployment. The only \nindication of a timetable was the president's assertion that the \ncampaign against terrorism ``Will be a lengthy one.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the President's \nreport to Congress be included in the Record following these remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 1.)\n  In short, what appeared to be crystal clear to Congress when it \npassed the use of force resolution appears to be a matter of very \ndifferent interpretation to the President. I wonder, in retrospect, if \na few hours, or indeed if a very few hours, of searching debate and a \nlittle more research prior to the passage of S.J. Res. 23 might not \nhave resulted in a more clearly defined grant of power. We may never \nresolve the political tension between the executive and legislative \nbranches over the constitutional division of war powers, but we might \nhave been able to better clarify the intent of S.J. Res. 23. Such \nclarity is important.\n  This is not a matter that no lack of goodwill will end tomorrow, or a \nweek from tomorrow, or perhaps a year from tomorrow. This resolution, \nsuch as the use of force resolutions granted in the past, has no sunset \nclause. These resolutions remain in force unless Congress repeals them. \nFor all we know, this President could just simply dust off, just that \neasy--dust it off; dust it off--dust off the 1991 gulf war resolution. \nThe President could just as easily dust off the 1991 gulf war \nresolution which granted use of force authority to his father, to cite \ncongressional authority to sweep Iraq into the current conflict \nregardless of whether it had anything to do with the September 11 \nattack.\n  The President, of course, does have limited authority under the War \nPowers Resolution to prosecute terrorist organizations that operate \nagainst our interests and the interests of all peace-loving nations. He \nhas that power regardless of whether Congress has passed a resolution \ngranting him specific authority. He has that inherent power under the \nConstitution, but he may not exercise it without triggering the \nreporting and termination requirements of the War Powers Resolution. In \nhis address to Congress, the President cited organizations which are \nknown terrorist organizations in the world. Regardless of their \nhistory, if those organizations were not involved in the September 11 \nattack, they fall outside of the broad grant of authority provided by \nthe Congress for the President to act in S.J. Res 23.\n  I am not making the case for them by any means. I am simply saying \nthat we in the Senate should have had some things to say publicly about \nthis resolution before we passed it.\n  We should have had some debate. The President could take action \nagainst them if he deemed it necessary, but such action would trigger \nthe War Powers Resolution, wouldn't it? By law, the President would \nhave to report to the Congress on any actions he might take in regard \nto those organizations, and seek new specific authorization from \nCongress if he planned to engage in military action for more than 60 \ndays. But will he? Will he?\n  The intent of the use of force authorization Congress approved in the \naftermath of the attack on America is clear. It is firmly anchored to \nthose individuals, organizations, or nations who were complicit in the \nSeptember 11th attack. Extended operations against other parties or \nnations not involved in the attack would require--or would it--\nadditional specific authorization beyond the 60 day period provided for \nin the War Powers Resolution. Whether the language of S.J. Res. 23 \nadequately supports the intent is another matter.\n  Mr. President, it may seem to some as though I am belaboring a fine \npoint--splitting hairs, if you please--during a time of national \ncrisis. One need not be mistaken about it--I support our President in \nhis efforts to bring to justice the evildoers who attacked the United \nStates on September 11th. Congress has clearly demonstrated its resolve \nand its unity in that regard. I don't think anyone need have any doubts \nabout that. But I have also taken an oath to protect and defend--so has \nevery Senator in this body--the Constitution of the United States. \nArticle I Section 8 of the Constitution grants to Congress the \nexclusive power to declare war. In taking any action to cede that \nauthority to the Executive Branch, Congress must act with extreme care \nand caution.\n  Despite the speed with which Congress passed S.J. Res. 23, an effort \nto inject care and caution into the process was certainly made. The \nramifications of the proposed resolution sent here by the White House \nwere weighed and they were considered. Important modifications were \nmade to the text originally proposed. I would not have voted for it \notherwise. I had no time to study it. I was busy in my Appropriations \nCommittee working on the bill appropriating $40 billion, so I had no \ntime whatever to participate in the study and modifications of that \nresolution. But it was considerably modified. So there was considerable \nmodification made to the text originally proposed.\n  In an effort to achieve the goal of enabling the President to wage \nwar, as he calls it, against those responsible for the September 11 \nattack on the United States, while ensuring that the war cannot be \nbroadened to encompass other targets without the knowledge and the \nconsent of Congress, whether those modifications went far enough, \nwhether the resolution ultimately adopted by Congress accomplishes \nprecisely what we wish to accomplish, we have yet to know with \ncertainty.\n  The President has declared ours to be a nation at war with global \nterrorism. We have united behind him in this hour of crisis, but we \nremain mindful of the somber history of this nation, of the blood that \nhas been shed over the centuries to protect and defend the ideals \nenshrined in our Constitution. We must, therefore, be as constant in \nour vigilance of the Constitution as we are strong in our battle \nagainst terrorism.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep clearly in mind their fundamental \nresponsibility to support and defend the Constitution. That is the oath \nwe took with our hands, at least figuratively speaking, on the Bible \n``so help me God.'' Every one of these Senators took that oath, a \nfundamental responsibility to support and defend the Constitution and \nto fully and fairly debate the major policy issues of the moment \nbecause this is going to be a long time. Whatever powers we cede will \nhave been ceded for a long time, perhaps.\n  As we move through the rest of this session of Congress, let us stop, \nlet us look, let us listen, listen to what our hearts are telling us. \nLet us listen to what this Constitution is telling us. Let us act as \nexpeditiously as possible on the urgent matters before us, but let us \nalso act with calm, careful, and thorough deliberations.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n  Original Text of Proposed Joint Resolution Submitted to the Senate \n           Leadership by the White House, September 12, 2001\n\n  Joint resolution to authorize the use of United States Armed Forces \n against those responsible for the recent attacks launched against the \n                             United States\n\n       Whereas, on September 11, 2001, acts of treacherous \n     violence were committed against the United States and its \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas, such acts render it both necessary and appropriate \n     that the United States exercise its rights to self-defense \n     and to protect United States citizens both at home and \n     abroad, and\n       Whereas, in light of the threat to the national security \n     and foreign policy of the United States posed by these grave \n     acts of violence, and\n       Whereas, such acts continue to pose an unusual and \n     extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign \n     policy of the United States,\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate\n\n[[Page S9951]]\n\n     force against those nations, organizations or persons he \n     determines planned, authorized, harbored, committed, or aided \n     in the planning or commission of the attacks against the \n     United States that occurred on September 11, 2001, and to \n     deter and pre-empt any future acts of terrorism or aggression \n     against the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              S.J.

These terrorists coldly murdered thousands of \n     innocent people on those airliners and on the ground, and \n     deliberately destroyed the towers of the World Trade Center \n     and surrounding buildings and a portion of the Pentagon.\n       In response to these attacks on our territory, our \n     citizens, and our way of life, I ordered the deployment of \n     various combat-equipped and combat support forces to a number \n     of foreign nations in the Central and Pacific Command areas \n     of operations. In the future, as we act to prevent and deter \n     terrorism, I may find it necessary to order additional forces \n     into these and other areas of the world, including into \n     foreign nations where U.S. Armed Forces are already located.\n       I have taken these actions pursuant to my constitutional \n     authority to conduct U.S. foreign relations and as Commander \n     in Chief and Chief Executive. It is not now possible to \n     predict the scope and duration of these deployments, and the \n     actions necessary to counter the terrorist threat to the \n     United States. It is likely that the American campaign \n     against terrorism will be a lengthy one.\n       I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep \n     the Congress informed, consistent with the War Powers \n     Resolution and Senate Joint Resolution 23, which I signed on \n     September 18, 2001. As you know, officials of my \n     Administration and I have been regularly communicating with \n     the leadership and other Members of Congress about the \n     actions we are taking to respond to the threat of terrorism \n     and we will continue to do so. I appreciate the continuing \n     support of the Congress, including its passage of Senate \n     Joint Resolution 23, in this action to protect the security \n     of the United States of America and its citizens, civilian \n     and military, here and abroad.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   George W. Bush.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I know the Senator from Michigan said he wanted to \nspeak. I am anxious to respond to some of what Senator Byrd said. I ask \nunanimous consent I be allowed to follow the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Minnesota.\n  While Senator Byrd is on the floor, let me thank him for another of a \nlong series of pleas that we be aware of our responsibility under the \nConstitution of this country, particularly when it comes to issues of \nwar and peace. Surely the cautionary language of the great Senator from \nWest Virginia is something which I hope all Members will heed.\n  I, personally, treasure the copy of the Constitution which he has \nautographed for me. I have it on my desk, and I look at it constantly. \nIt is not quite as close to my heart as the Constitution which the \nSenator from West Virginia carries with him at all times, but it is \nalways a few feet away from me when I sit at my desk. I thank him for \nagain pointing out to the Senate the responsibility we have in these \nparticularly difficult days.\n  Mr. WARNER. I associate myself with those remarks from a member of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee. We are pleased that he has \ncontinued this long association, although his duties are very heavy in \nother areas. It is interesting that only John Stennis was ever chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee and also served on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. He was a great and dear friend of yours, we know, \nand teacher to all Members.\n  We thank our colleague for this very important speech he has given \ntoday.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the Senator will yield, I thank my friend from Virginia, \nthe State which gave to our country George Washington and James \nMadison, the father of the Constitution. I thank him very much.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my good friend and colleague.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia has made \nreference to two actions we have taken in the Senate. I would like to \ncomment briefly on both.\n  First, on the second action we took, giving the President authority \nto respond to the attacks of September 11, the Senator did us a great \nservice by laying out the version of that resolution with which we \nstarted and the version with which we ended. I made the same effort \nthat day we voted on it, but I do not believe I actually put the drafts \nin the Record. I made reference to them, but I think that perhaps this \nis the first time the actual draft we began with is in the \nCongressional Record. I think that is a very important service.\n  The resolution we adopted, as the Senator from West Virginia said, is \nmuch narrower in terms of its authority. The draft we began with, that \nthe White House submitted to us, had unprecedented broad authority, far \ntoo broad for most of us. It was unlimited by time and by other limits, \nas to what the President could do in response to these attacks.\n  The final resolution we adopted provided that the authority granted \nto the President is to respond to the attack of September 11--not to \nsome unspecified future attacks but to that particular attack of \nSeptember 11, and also, as the Senator from West Virginia said, made \nspecific reference and inclusion by reference to the provisions of the \nWar Powers Act.\n  Those and other changes in the language of the resolution were \nsignificant. Our good friend from West Virginia pointed out that there \nwas much greater care and caution--to use his words--in the final \nresolution we adopted. I hope history proves that those of us who \nworked so hard on that final resolution indeed used enough care and \ncaution to satisfy the requirements of the Constitution and just good \ncommon sense. But history will judge that one--and I hope will judge it \nwell--because the differences between the original draft resolution \nsubmitted to us and the one we adopted are indeed significant changes, \nmajor changes.\n  As a matter of fact, I want to give our staff some real credit \nbecause they worked through the night with us in order to craft those \nchanges which we were then able to adopt unanimously in the Senate.\n  On the first matter the Senator from West Virginia raised, which was \nthe language which was in the original bill on national missile \ndefense--as a member of the Armed Services Committee I\n\n[[Page S9952]]\n\nknow he is familiar with this history--let me recount it for those who \nare not members of the committee.\n  As chairman of that committee, we asked the White House and the \nadministration to tell us whether or not the activities for which they \nwere requesting funding, the test activities for missile defense, were \nconsistent with the ABM Treaty or would conflict with the ABM Treaty. \nWe made many requests for that information, and we never received the \nanswer to it.\n  That is critically important information because if we, as the \nappropriators and authorizers, are going to put funds into a bill for \ntesting activities which are in conflict with an arms control agreement \nand which could have huge ramifications in terms of our own security, \nin the view of many of us resulting in a unilateral withdrawal which \ncould make us less secure rather than more secure--if we are going to \ntake that action as a Congress to appropriate those funds, we should do \nso knowingly.\n  We could not get that information. And so, as chairman of the \ncommittee, I drafted language which gave us an opportunity down the \nroad, if and when the administration determined that the testing \nactivities conflicted with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty--would \ngive us the opportunity to vote whether or not we approved such \nexpenditures.\n\n  If we couldn't find out then, if we couldn't get that information to \nallow us to make that kind of an informed judgment, then I thought it \nwas critically important to have that information so we could at a \nlater point decide whether or not we would approve that expenditure. We \nwon that argument by one vote in the Armed Services Committee. I was \ndisappointed that all of our Republican colleagues voted against it. We \nwere then informed that if that language remained in the bill, the bill \nwould be vetoed by the President. So we started with that premise.\n  That doesn't mean the language was not the right language. In my \njudgment, it was and is the right language. But what it means is that \nwe knew the bill would be vetoed.\n  Then came along the events of September 11, and the question was then \nwhether or not that would make it possible for us to preserve that \nlanguage in a totally different environment or whether or not it would \nmake it more difficult to preserve language which I, as its author, \nthought was very significant, very important language.\n  There are many Members of this body who have devoted large amounts of \ntime to arms control issues, including the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, but I must say I have spent a good deal of time in \nmy career working on these arms control issues, so this became a very \nsignificant issue to me. I believe this unilateral withdrawal from the \narms control agreement will make us less secure and not more secure. If \nI thought unilateral withdrawal from this treaty would make us more \nsecure, I would favor the unilateral withdrawal. I would give notice to \nwithdraw if I believed it would make us more secure--because that is \nthe issue. We are not here to defend a treaty; we are here to defend \nthe country. In my judgment, the unilateral withdrawal from this treaty \nwould result in such a negative reaction on the part of a number of \ncountries that would respond to that withdrawal that overall, on \nbalance, we would end up being less secure, and we would do so in order \nto commit ourselves to testing a system which is a defense against the \nleast likely means of attack, a missile attack.\n  We have been told by the Joint Chiefs over and over again that the \nleast likely way we would be attacked, the least likely delivery system \nfor a weapon of mass destruction, would be a missile. The most likely \nmeans would be a truck or a ship, some more conventional means--for a \nnumber of reasons, one of which being those conventional means--trucks, \nships, whatever--are more accurate, cheaper, and--critically \nimportant--do not have what we call a return address like a missile. A \nmissile attack would lead to the instantaneous destruction of any \ncountry that attacked us, including North Korea. And since the \nmaintenance of their regime is their No. 1 goal in North Korea, \naccording to our intelligence community, it is very unlikely that North \nKorea would attack us with a missile. It would lead to their \ninstantaneous, or almost instantaneous, destruction.\n  So I believe that to unilaterally withdraw from a treaty in order to \nput us closer to a defense against the least likely means of attack, \nand doing so unilaterally, which would produce a reaction on the part \nof a number of countries, including Russia and China, which would \noverall make us less secure since they would build up their forces \nfaster, they would not dismantle their weapons as Russia is doing, they \nwould put multiple warheads on missiles--called MIRVing--they would no \nlonger participate in dismantling weapons, which means we would have \nmore and more nuclear material on Russian soil subject to \nproliferation, subject to pilferage, it struck me and strikes me that \nunilateral withdrawal leaves us, overall, less secure.\n  That is why I worked so hard on getting that language included. I \nthought, if Congress is going to provide the funds for that kind of \nactivity that leads to the unilateral withdrawal from an arms control \ntreaty, Congress should take the responsibility, under that oath to \nuphold the Constitution of the United States, to know what we are \ndoing.\n  That was the driving force behind the language I drafted. So that \nlanguage comes in the bill that is now being considered on the floor \ngiving Congress the opportunity to have a voice before funds it \nappropriates are used for that purpose. It gives us an opportunity to \nknow that in fact the funds are going to be used for an activity which \nconflicts with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\n  Then came the event of September 11. The argument which the opponents \nof my language made was that my language tied the hands of the \nCommander in Chief, because no longer could he move on his own without \nauthority for appropriations; he would have to first come back to us \nfor that authority.\n  Frankly, I don't think that argument comes close to outweighing the \narguments on the other side of this issue. Nonetheless, in that \nenvironment I reached the conclusion that that argument was going to \nprevail and it was not the time, immediately following the events of \nSeptember 11, for that argument to be resolved.\n  It was a very practical judgment on my part as its author that it was \nabout the worst time we could possibly pick--not that it was the time \nof our choosing, but it would have been the worst time to have a debate \nwhich had such crucial importance. It struck me as being far preferable \nthat we preserve our opportunity to present this issue later in a \nseparate bill that went on the calendar and that the majority leader \ncould then attempt to call up. That language is now part of a bill that \nis on the calendar which the majority leader can at a later point call \nup.\n  Will it be more difficult for him to call it up than it would have \nbeen under the language had it remained embedded in the bill? The \nanswer is yes, it will be more difficult because he will have to move \nto proceed if he cannot get the unanimous consent.\n  But given the fact that the President was going to veto this bill and \ntherefore this language was not going to end up in this bill in any \nevent even if it survived the Senate, and there were those of us who \nhad very strong feelings about the importance of avoiding a unilateral \nrift in a strategic relationship with Russia that has produced such \nstability, and for such little advantage, I made the judgment that it \nwould be wise to preserve that argument by placing it in a separate \nbill that the majority leader at least could attempt to call up at a \nlater date and which would be on the calendar. But what I saw otherwise \nwas that this language was going to be removed by a vote of the Senate, \nand having an added disadvantage that we would be debating a security \nissue showing disunity at a time when we wanted to have unity.\n  That was but one factor in my thinking, the other factor being that, \nas a matter of timing, this issue should be debated at a time when at \nleast there would be a fairer opportunity and a setting separated from \nthe events of September 11 where the argument that we were tying the \nhands of the Commander in Chief would have less of an emotional impact.\n  I may have been right; I may have been wrong. But it was a judgment\n\n[[Page S9953]]\n\nwhich I expressed to the body before the actions were taken. I \nindicated that prior to those actions being taken where we divided this \nlanguage and put it into a separate bill, we should leave this debate \nto a later time.\n  Those are key words which are sometimes forgotten. This debate has \nnot gone away. It will not go away. I believe it is very unlikely that \nthe President under these circumstances is going to withdraw \nunilaterally from this treaty.\n\n  That is my own judgment. Surely the events of September 11 have made \nit so clear that collective action against terrorism and collective \naction for our security is essential and that unilateral action on our \npart is not going to make us secure, we need a lot of other countries \nto join with us if we are going to be secure. Acting unilaterally to \nwithdraw from an arms control treaty in this setting it seems to me is \nhighly unlikely.\n  I know that the White House and the President say they are determined \nto get beyond the ABM Treaty, as they put it. But surely these events \nhave shown that we need to act collectively in a civilized world \nagainst the uncivilized terror which has been perpetrated and inflicted \nupon us.\n  I again thank my friend from West Virginia. I don't know of anybody \nin this body who more eloquently and more consistently describes the \nresponsibilities of this body. I have outlined in the best way I can \nwhat I believe my responsibility is and what my responsibility was.\n  My committee made a decision and the Senate made a decision after we \ndescribed the language that was in this bill. I think we made the right \ndecision. It allows those of us who believe strongly in the importance \nof avoiding a rift in a relationship and a unilateral withdrawal from \nan arms control treaty--it is consistent with our beliefs--to preserve \nthis argument for a later date. As I said on the floor prior to the \naction we took, we should leave this debate for a later time; and, I \nmust add, as I have tried to say a number of times since, at a time \nwhen I think we have a better chance of arguing the pros and cons of \nour position in an environment where we at least maximize our \nopportunity to prevail. That doesn't mean I am confident that we will. \nI hope we will prevail if and when that moment comes. At least I \nbelieve we have a greater opportunity when the debate takes place at a \nlater time and in a different setting than we do in the short term.\n  I thank my friend from Minnesota. I have taken more time than I told \nhim I would take.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might take a few minutes, I think it \nis important that the Record of the proceedings today also make \nreference to the fact that I and many others believe that the events of \nSeptember 11 spoke volumes for the President's position that we should \nnot at this time be in any way less than forceful in trying to explore \nall the options to develop a limited defense system protecting this \nNation against a limited attack such as future generations, when they \nlook back at this hour of tragedy, will say that our country did not \nmove forward on all fronts. None of this would have been envisioned. We \ndid not envision the tragedies of September 11. In many respects, some \nstill cannot envision that this country needs a defense against limited \nattack.\n  I must say yes, I accept my distinguished chairman's statement to the \neffect that he made certain decisions. I commend him for it. But I \nbelieve several of us had spoken to him in the context of what was \ngoing to be undertaken had that decision not been reached by our \nchairman.\n  I inquire of the chairman: We want to have our colleague have his \nopportunity to speak here momentarily. Could we get some time estimate \nbecause work is being done on this side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Minnesota was kind enough to allow me to \nprecede him, although he was recognized first so we could comment on \nSenator Byrd's comments. It would now be up to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I probably need about 20 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nSenator from Minnesota concludes his remarks we then return to \nconsideration of the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, is the \nsubject matter of the address of the Senator from Minnesota relevant to \nthe pending matter before the Senate; namely, the Armed Forces bill?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct, although I want to respond to Senator \nByrd's statement.\n  Mr. WARNER. May I also inquire of the chairman and the Senator from \nMinnesota, our colleague from Connecticut has an amendment directly \nrelated in some respects to aspects of the bill----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have been here a long time, and I \nasked unanimous consent to follow Senator Levin. I will speak and try \nto cover the topic, and then I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for one \nadditional unanimous consent request, I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the remarks of the Senator from Minnesota, we return to the \nconsideration of the bill and that Senator Dodd be immediately \nrecognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Again, reserving the right to object, we do have a stack \nof agreed-upon amendments. As soon as we get that behind us, our staffs \ncan devote their time to additional amendments.\n  So I ask the Senator from Connecticut, how much time will he want for \nthe presentation of his amendment and such rebuttal or concurrence that \nmay be made or voiced by other colleagues? Then we can get some better \nidea how soon we can return to the issue of amendments.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague and friend from Virginia \nwill yield, I anticipate taking no longer than 15 minutes myself. \nOthers may want to be heard.\n  Just for the purpose of letting Members know, this will be an \namendment for which, frankly, the chairman and ranking member are very \nmuch responsible; and that is the fire assistance program in which we \nare dedicating, in this case, to the 350 or so firemen who lost their \nlives in New York on September 11, and those who fought here at the \nPentagon, to increase the authorization levels.\n  Others may want to be heard on that. On my part, 15 minutes ought to \nbe more than adequate.\n  Mr. WARNER. On that subject, while I personally am supportive of the \ngoals of the amendment, I must reserve the rights of Senators on this \nside, particularly those on the Commerce Committee. I would presume \nthat the chairman and ranking member may desire to at least address the \nSenate on this matter prior to any final action on the Senator's \namendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my friend, we have notified the Commerce Committee \nabout this amendment. Again, I think they understand that given the \nconstraints remaining for us to offer a freestanding proposal, and \ngiven the history of this bill associated with the DOD bill, I will \nleave it to them to address it themselves. But we have talked about it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my distinguished chairman, I would presume then \nthat this amendment would have a rollcall vote sometime tomorrow.\n  Mr. DODD. Right.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would you permit me to incorporate in your UC a request \nthat 30 minutes be granted to the chairman and ranking member of the \nCommerce Committee prior to any vote on the amendment by our colleague \nfrom Connecticut?\n  Mr. DODD. The only request I would make is this amendment be \nconsidered prior to the cloture vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I beg your pardon.\n  Mr. DODD. That it be considered prior to the cloture vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not sure. The vote takes place at 9:30 tomorrow \nmorning. As I understand it, there is an order to that effect.\n  My understanding is that the standing order is that the Senate will \nvote at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning on a cloture motion; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then I would say to my colleague from Connecticut, how do \nwe achieve that?\n  Mr. DODD. We could have a voice vote. We do not need a recorded vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would have to object to a voice vote. I am dutybound, \nyou\n\n[[Page S9954]]\n\nunderstand, to protect colleagues on this side, particularly those on \nthe Commerce Committee which has overall jurisdiction.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, if there is no objection to the \namendment being incorporated in the bill, this may be the one \nopportunity where we will be able to do something about these \nfirefighters.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to help you. I am going to vote with you. But I am \ndutybound, as you understand, to protect those on this side. I do not \nknow what the chairman of the Commerce Committee, on your side, has \nsaid about this issue, but I do know members of the Commerce Committee, \non this side, certainly must be protected--at least be given an \nopportunity to speak to this amendment if it is brought up for purposes \nof a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. DODD. Why don't we proceed this way, if we could: After the \nSenator from Minnesota has been heard, if I can offer the amendment, I \nwould like to discuss it. In the meantime, we can have conversations. \nWe have already had conversations with members of the Commerce \nCommittee. If they are going to object to us voting on this prior to \nthe cloture vote tomorrow, or allow us to have a voice vote on this, \nthen so be it. But if not, then it could go through this evening. We \nought to try to do it.\n  Is that all right?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that seems to me to be an orderly \nprocedure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the statement of the Senator from Minnesota, we return to the \nDefense authorization bill and Senator Dodd be recognized to offer an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, could that be 15 minutes?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Just to offer it.\n  Mr. WARNER. He wanted 15 minutes to offer it, which is fine. I have \nno objection, but I do want to get back to this question of amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And that Senator Dodd's speech be limited to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/01/senate-section/article/S9954-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THANKING SENATOR BYRD\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

I thank the Senator for his observations. I would be remiss \nif I did not likewise express my gratitude to Senator Levin and to \nSenator Biden and to other Senators who worked together to modify that \nlanguage and to greatly improve the language over what it was when it \nwas sent from the White House to the Senate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  I also say to my colleague, I believe Senator Kerry from \nMassachusetts, and also the majority leader, Senator Daschle--all of \nthem----\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, I want to talk about an amendment that \nI hope will be part of the Defense authorization bill. But as long as \nwe are talking about the resolution for a moment, I want to borrow from \na piece I just finished writing. I will not go through the whole piece, \nbut that deals with the humanitarian catastrophe that is now taking \nplace in Afghanistan. I think it is relevant to talk about this.\n  You have a situation on the ground that is unimaginable: 4 years of \nrelentless drought, the worst in 3 decades, and the total failure of \nthe Taliban government to administer to the country. Four million \npeople have abandoned their homes in search of food in Pakistan, Iran, \nand elsewhere. Those left behind now eat meals of locust and animal \nfodder. This is in Afghanistan.\n  Five million people inside this country are threatened by famine, \naccording to the United Nations. As President Bush made clear, we are \nwaging a campaign against terrorists, not ordinary Afghans--I think \nthat is an important distinction to make--who are some of the poorest \nand most beleaguered people on the planet and who were actually our \nallies during the cold war.\n  Any military action by our country must be targeted against those \nresponsible for the terror acts and those harboring them. And we must \nplan such action to minimize the danger to innocent civilians who are \non the edge of starvation.\n  Let me repeat that one more time. Any military action must be \ntargeted against those who are responsible for the terror acts and \nthose who have harbored them. And we must plan such action to minimize \nthe danger to innocent civilians who are on the edge of starvation. And \nwe must be prepared to address any humanitarian consequences of \nwhatever action we take as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a piece that I just \nfinished writing be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    U.S. Must Lead Efforts to Prevent Refugee Crisis in Afghanistan\n\n(By U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone, Chairman, Subcommittee on Near Eastern \n              and South Asian Affairs, September 28, 2001)\n\n       The September 11 attacks in New York and Washington require \n     our country to respond assertively and effectively against \n     international terrorism. As the Administration reviews all \n     its options, it must consider the humanitarian consequences \n     of any military action against terrorist sites in \n     Afghanistan, and take urgent steps now to address them.\n       Even before the world focused on it as a sanctuary for \n     Osama bin Laden and other terrorists, Afghanistan was on the \n     brink of a humanitarian catastrophe, the site of the greatest \n     crisis in hunger and refugee displacement in the world. Now \n     the worsening situation on the ground is almost unimaginable. \n     After four years of relentless drought, the worst in three \n     decades, and the total failure of the Taliban government in \n     administering the country, four million people have abandoned \n     their homes in search of food in Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan \n     and elsewhere, while those left behind eat meals of locusts \n     and animal fodder. Five million people inside the country are \n     threatened by famine, according to the United Nations.\n       As President Bush made clear, we are waging a campaign \n     against terrorists, not ordinary Afghans, who are some of the \n     poorest and most beleaguered people on the planet and were \n     our allies during the Cold War. Any military action must thus \n     be targeted against those responsible for the terror attacks \n     and those harboring them; planned to minimize the danger to \n     innocent civilians on the edge of starvation; and prepared to \n     address any humanitarian consequences as soon as possible. \n     Since it seems clear that a major international refugee \n     influx will require a massive expansion of existing refugee \n     camps, and creation of new ones, the U.S. and our U.N. \n     Security Council allies should also be thinking now about how \n     to protect those camps, including possibly using a U.N.-\n     sanctioned military force drawn primarily from Arab nations.\n       Osama bin Laden is not a native of Afghanistan, but of \n     Saudi Arabia. Most Afghans do not support bin Laden. Instead, \n     ninety percent of the Afghan people are subsistence farmers \n     struggling simply to grow enough food to stay alive. War \n     widows, orphans, and thousands of others in the cities are \n     dependent upon international aid to survive.\n       Now, anticipating military strikes by the U.S. hundreds of \n     thousands of Afghan civilians are on the move, fleeing the \n     cities for their native villages or for the borders. \n     According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, nearly \n     20,000 have gathered at one Pakistani border crossing alone. \n     The U.N. says it is the most tense border point in the world, \n     with thousands of people out in the open, exposed to \n     scorching days and frigid\n\n[[Page S9955]]\n\n     nights. Kandahar, the spiritual seat of the Taliban, is said \n     to be ``half empty.'' Those who are left behind are the most \n     vulnerable--the elderly, orphans, war widows, and the \n     mentally and physically disabled.\n       Inside Afghanistan, the U.N.'s World Food Programme (UNWFP) \n     aid--much of it U.S.-donated wheat--is the sole source of \n     food for millions. After the attacks on September 11th, the \n     UNWFP was forced to pull out. It left two weeks of food \n     stocks to be administered by local U.N. staff, but Taliban \n     officials last Monday broke into the U.N. compound and stole \n     thousands of tons of grain. Under intense international \n     pressure, the UNWFP has announced it will resume shipments of \n     grain to Afghanistan. Yet how it will be distributed is \n     uncertain, as the Taliban has severed contact between \n     international aid groups and their Afghan staffs, and taken \n     over many of their facilities. To get needed aid in, and slow \n     the outflow of Afghan refugees driven by a lack of food at \n     home, the Pakistani government should immediately relax its \n     border restrictions enough to allow the flow of food and \n     other humanitarian aid into Afghanistan, while maintaining \n     border security.\n       There is no easy solution to this building crisis, and yet \n     our government must aggressively seek solutions to the \n     critical needs of Afghan civilians. As one of its most urgent \n     tasks, the United States must do its part to shore up relief \n     operations and help to again get aid flowing to refugees now. \n     We also must prepare for an already critical situation to \n     worsen as Afghanistan heads into its notoriously harsh \n     winter. We must prepare now for huge numbers of refugees and \n     humanitarian problems in the aftermath of military strikes, \n     repositioning in the region the people and resources needed \n     to deal with it.\n       The U.N. and several privately-funded aid groups are \n     working frantically to set up new camps and bring in supplies \n     and personnel to sites along the border. And yet, developing \n     a stronger response to a massive outflow of Afghans into \n     Pakistan is sure to put pressure on already over-burdened \n     camps, and by extension Pakistani resources and patience. \n     Pakistan is already host to over a million refugees from \n     Afghanistan; 170,000 came as a result of recent drought in \n     Afghanistan. Others fled earlier and have been in Pakistan \n     for years.\n       The United States must do everything it can now to \n     alleviate the suffering of ordinary Afghan civilians. We have \n     agreed to participate in U.N. efforts to raise quickly almost \n     $600 million in aid funds, a number likely to grow. We should \n     be leading that effort, including by contributing \n     substantially. The U.S. and our allies cannot afford to be \n     indifferent to this humanitarian crisis, especially as we \n     seek to build a coalition of moderate Arab and non-Arab \n     Muslims around the globe for our anti-terror efforts. If a \n     humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan is attributed to our \n     military operations, it will weaken international support for \n     our fight against terrorism, and may even make the American \n     people more vulnerable in the end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/01/senate-section/article/S9955-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9955-S9956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MENTAL HEALTH RESPONSE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise in this Chamber to talk about \nthe extraordinary mental health needs of the American people, and \nespecially people of New Jersey, New York, Virginia, Washington, DC, \nand Pennsylvania in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy for holding an extraordinary HELP Committee--\nHELP is Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions--hearing on this topic \nlast week. I am grateful to Senator Warner for his invitation at the \nhearing to have some suggestions about some mental health initiatives \nthat could be part of this DOD authorization. Senator Warner is to be \ncommended for his recognition that there does need to be some \nlegislation that responds to the short-term and long-term needs of \npeople who have been affected by these tragic events.\n  Many Senators are working on this issue, and I am sure the Presiding \nOfficer, the Senator from New Jersey, is one of them. I am pleased to \nalso do this work.\n  I want to talk a little bit about some of the witnesses. Carolyn \nPfeffer, who is a child psychiatrist at New York University, noted that \nin retrospect what should really have been in place was a plan and a \nprogram in every school for how to respond to the disaster, along with \nprompt and effective public education for parents to help them \nunderstand how to talk to their children--in other words, she was \nsaying, right after September 11.\n  She said that what is needed now is ``aggressive work to identify \nchildren who have suffered the most severe stress; training of mental \nhealth professionals in how to respond to the unique needs growing out \nof events of this kind; government funding and leadership to assure \nresources are available to these children who need help.''\n  She said we must do all we can to prepare for the unprecedented \nstrain on our mental health system and to assure that private insurers \nwill encourage appropriate treatment rather than establishing \nartificial limits on what we can provide for people.\n  Dr. Spencer Eth, the vice-chairman of the department of psychiatry at \nSt. Vincent's hospital in New York, also spoke at the hearing. St. \nVincent's was the hospital where the largest number of victims of the \nattack are being treated. Dr. Eth is also a nationally recognized \nauthority on the psychological effects of traumatic event. He gave \nmoving testimony about his experiences with providing treatment for \nemergency workers, and he said, ``Never before have the gaps in the \nmental health system been more apparent.'' He urged the committee to \nrecognize that ``the magnitude of the public's need for traditional \ntherapies, outreach to schools, businesses, and communities . . . is \nunprecedented. . . . He stated, ``We must obtain the funding required \nto reach everyone at high risk and everyone who is already suffering, \nregardless of health coverage, language barriers, and physical \ndisabilities.''\n  Dr. Kerry Kelly gave what was probably the most searing testimony \nabout her own experiences with her onsite work as chief medical officer \nof the New York Fire Department, minutes after the attacks. She \ntestified that, ``the selflessness of these men and women [of the New \nYork Fire Department] is what made them heroes, but it's also what \nbrings me to these hearings today to urge your approval of funds to \nprovide for the psychological and counseling need of our members and \ntheir families. As we get further away from the events of that day, the \nofficers, firefighters, fire marshalls, emergency medical technicians \nand paramedics, will have to cope with delayed reactions to the trauma \nthey experienced. And from day one, the men and women of the New York \nFire Department and the families of those who were lost have had to \nendure a tremendous sense of grief.'' She said, ``The emotional well-\nbeing of our department requires intervention to provide stress \ndebriefing, bereavement counseling, and continued psychological support \nof our members, our families, and the children affected by this \nevent.''\n  Dr. Carol North pointed out that 2 years after the Oklahoma City \nbombing 16 percent of children 100 miles away still reported \nsignificant posttraumatic stress memories related to it.\n  We know one thing for sure: It is a mistake to believe that such \nevents, of September 11 and after, cannot have a lasting impact on the \nmental health of those men, women, and children who have experienced \nthem. We should not repeat the mistakes that were made in the aftermath \nof the Vietnam war when the trauma experienced by veterans was ignored \nand trivialized until well after the optimal time for treatment was \npassed.\n  We have learned from the outstanding research which has been funded \nby the VA and the NIMH of the severity of the disorder and the \neffective ways it can be treated.\n  Let me summarize the case for this amendment of which Senator Warner \nand others have been so supportive. Let us give respect for what people \nhave experienced and help them deal with this now in a manner which is \nappropriate to their individual needs. Let us help those families who \nhave survived the loss of a loved one and may also now be dealing with \npreparations for a funeral or memorial without ever receiving any \nremains of their loved one.\n  Let us recognize that traumatic grief is real and has unique features \nthat go beyond our usual understanding of death and loss. Let us help \nthe emergency workers who stretched their bodies and minds to deal with \nthis horror and lost so many of their friends and colleagues as well.\n  Let us help those who escaped with their lives but now suffer from \nserious injuries and many other losses of their own. Let us help those \nwho made it out safely but who feared for their lives and witnessed \nsuch horror and are now dealing with the multiple losses of friends, \nfamilies, colleagues, and their jobs. And let us help the children who \nmust now try to understand what they\n\n[[Page S9956]]\n\nsaw, what they have lost, what their parents and teachers are going \nthrough, and what the world means, while we all struggle to do the same \nand try to regain our sense of safety.\n  I am not saying that mental illness is widespread or an inevitable \nconsequence of the event. But after hearing from the experts at this \nhearing, we should not underestimate the severe impact of September 11 \non people's sense of identity and safety and how the multiple losses \nand horrific experiences they went through have the potential to affect \nthem for a long while.\n  Let me talk a minute about posttraumatic stress syndrome which can \nhave such lasting effects on the minds and hearts of those who suffer \nfrom it. Here I draw from some experience because a lot of my work, \nespecially back in Minnesota, is with Vietnam vets who are struggling \nwith PTSD. We know from research that the brain chemistry can be \naltered by such experiences, and we know that the day-to-day struggle \nto deal with the frightening flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, loss of \nsleep and many other symptoms can lead to severe problems and an \ninability to function if left untreated.\n  I will never forget a letter from a 10-year-old girl in Pope County, \nMN, who told me that her daddy was a Vietnam vet. He went into the \nshower in the morning. He had been doing fine. This was many years \nlater, about 4 years ago. She said: My dad came out of the shower and \nhe couldn't talk to anybody. Please help my dad. That was PTSD from the \nVietnam war.\n  Treatment can help people with PTSD, depression, anxiety, and a lot \nof other illnesses. What we want to do with this amendment is provide \nStates $175 million in flexible ways to deal with the needs of the \ncitizens. We want to have training programs for licensed mental health \nprofessionals. We want to have expedited and increased research funding \nright away so we know what to do. The Secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services is authorized to set up a disaster research \nclearinghouse so that information can quickly be made available to \nschools and public health agencies during times of crisis.\n  Funding is authorized for $50 million for trauma treatment centers \nfor adults and children to provide services for people who are exposed \nto such traumas.\n  All of this will make a huge difference. This came up last week. I \nthank Senator Kennedy for his leadership. There are a lot of us who are \ninvolved in this effort. Senator Warner is one. I cannot emphasize \nenough to other Senators how important it is that we try to pass this \npackage.\n  Today, we were scheduled to bring up the Mental Health Equitable \nTreatment Act. This is legislation on which I have been working with \nSenator Domenici. More important than that, there are 63 or 64 Senators \nwho support it.\n  One or two Senators objected. I am disappointed to say the least. We \ncould have had this legislation on the floor. We could have had debate \nand some amendments, and it would have passed.\n  The legislation did two things: It ended all discrimination in \ncoverage. It is civil rights legislation. It just says no longer can \nany health care plan treat someone who is struggling with this kind of \nmental illness differently than someone who is struggling with any \nother kind of illness.\n  My God, this is 2001. It is long overdue.\n  The second thing I want to say--I will not try to put one agenda on \ntop of another, but I want colleagues to know that the second thing \nthat happens from this legislation--which is why it is so important--is \nthat the treatment follows the money. When plans now provide coverage, \nyou then see an infrastructure in our country which doesn't exist now \nas it should to provide the care for people. Kay Jamison, who has done \nbrilliant work and writing in this area, said, ``The gap between what \nwe know and what we do is lethal.''\n  There is September 11, and there are all kinds of people trying to \ndeal with this trauma. There are all kinds of other men, women, and \nchildren who don't get the care they need. This is a piece of \nlegislation that has some urgency. There is no reason to delay any \nlonger. One or two Senators objected.\n  I hope this will be on the floor soon, and I hope we can pass it. I \nthink the President will sign it. I think it is a bipartisan effort and \nit is a good thing to do and it is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/01/senate-section/article/S9956-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BENEFITS FOR DISLOCATED AIRLINE WORKERS\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague, \nSenator Carnahan, for her efforts on behalf of dislocated workers in \nthe airline industry. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation \nwhich will benefit thousands of workers who have or will lose their job \nbecause of the tragic events on September 11.\n  I want to say a special word of thanks to Senator Carnahan and her \nstaff for working with me to clarify that employees of maintenance \nsuppliers to commercial air carriers are covered under the language in \nthe bill. This was an important point for me because of the impact the \nSeptember 11 attacks has already had on aviation maintenance businesses \nin my State.\n  Reebaire Aircraft, Inc. located in Mena, AR, is just one example of \nwhy the dislocated worker assistance provided for in this bill is so \nimportant. Prior to September 11, Reebaire Aircraft had a thriving \nbusiness with 101 workers and was in the process of expanding its \nworkforce. Today, Reebaire employs only 15 workers and the owner has \ninformed me that Reebaire may have to cease operations by the end of \nOctober. Reebaire's fate is directly related to the terrorist attacks \nbecause eighty percent of its business was based on maintenance \ncontracts with commercial air carriers who have cancelled future work \norders with Reebaire indefinitely.\n  Again, I commend my colleague for her efforts on behalf of our \nNation's working families.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. I appreciate the support of my friend from Arkansas \nand I am honored to add her name as a cosponsor of my legislation. As I \nexplained to the Senator earlier, it is certainly my intent to cover \ndislocated employees of companies that contract directly with \ncommercial air carriers for maintenance and related services if the \nemployees lose their job because of the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/01/senate-section/article/S9956-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, very briefly, this amendment deals with the \nFIRE Act, a bill which we adopted in a previous Congress, providing \nassistance to departments--paid departments, volunteer departments, and \ncombination\n\n[[Page S9957]]\n\ndepartments for equipment and the like.\n  I see my colleague from Virginia rising.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I say that we worked together on this. \nI would like to be a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my colleague be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me take a second and commend our two \ncolleagues from Michigan and from Virginia, the Chairman and Ranking \nMember. Only a few months ago, those roles were reversed; the chairman \nwas from Virginia and the ranking member was from Michigan. This is a \ngreat team which has done a tremendous job. It is sort of a seamless \ngarment in many ways, in terms of their leadership on national security \nissues as the chairman and ranking members of the Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  I want to take a moment to commend them both for the spectacular job \nthey have done over the last 2\\1/2\\ weeks since the great tragedy on \nSeptember 11. Not only have they led in terms of moving their committee \nproduct along and offering us an opportunity to do something very \nconstructive and positive in responding to the events of September 11, \nbut also in their public commentary on this issue both here on the \nfloor of the Senate as well as in the public forums. The Senator from \nMichigan, Carl Levin, and the Senator from Virginia, John Warner, have \ntruly lived up to the spirit of those who in other times of crisis have \nled without partisanship and with a sense of unity. I think it has been \nreassuring to the American public to have both of them in the positions \nthey are in.\n  On the subject at hand, I have 15 minutes, so I will try to be brief. \nI thank the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Virginia for \nbeing supportive of this effort. In fact, in many ways, without their \nleadership and support on this very matter, we would not have ever \nadopted the FIRE Act.\n  Very simply put, this legislation allows for fire departments across \nthis country--some 30,000 of them, paid volunteers and combined \ndepartments--to seek Federal grants for training and equipment to \nassist them in doing a better job in responding to tragedies in our \nlocal communities.\n  I don't need to make this case. I suppose I could end my remarks \nthere. There is not a single person in this country who is not aware of \nthe heroic efforts of our fire departments, not only within the city of \nNew York, which, of course, suffered the greatest tragedy when it came \nto the loss of life, not only of civilian populations but also \nfirefighters, but also here in the Nation's Capital and the departments \nin Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia.\n  On a parochial note, if you will, some of the first departments to \nrespond to the tragedy at the World Trade Center came from my home \nState of Connecticut. I note the presence of the Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from New Jersey. I know, in fact, many of the people from his \nState as well responded to this catastrophe, the savage attacks in New \nYork City. I don't need to make the case about how valuable these men \nand women are in the job they do. I think we become aware that--despite \nour traditional thinking about fire departments, with sort of the \nDalmatian dog in the front seat and responding to the residential or \nsmall business fire--today they are asked to become basically soldiers. \nThe distinction between what they do and what the men and women in \nmilitary uniforms do--the lines are becoming blurred somewhat here. No \ngreater piece of evidence can I offer than that which occurred on \nSeptember 11.\n\n  Some may say: What are you doing offering a fire amendment on the \nDepartment of Defense authorization? One, this is where the bill was \nborn. As a result of the leadership of the two men I have mentioned \nalready. This bill became law in conference. I offered the bill here, \nbut without them this bill would not have become the law of the land. \nIn a sense, now to extend the authorization over the next several years \nwith a relatively small amendment for this fiscal year, increasing over \nthe next 3 years so that we can provide assistance to these \ndepartments, I think is critical and important.\n  With that, let me explain what is in the bill. Many of us in the \nSenate and in the Congress have long understood that America's \nfirefighters make extraordinary contributions to their communities. But \non September 11, of course, we got a glimpse of a larger role these men \nand women of the fire service play. The national security role of \nfirefighters has become readily apparent to all in this country.\n  On the morning of September 11, the men and women of the New York \nCity Fire Department came to the aid of the entire Nation. They charged \nin to rescue people from every region of our country and more than 40 \nnations around the globe. Those firefighters raced into that building \nto save the lives of people trapped in those two towers. On the same \nmorning, firefighters from Virginia, Maryland, and District of Columbia \nbecame domestic defenders, responsible for coordinating a response to \nan attack on the headquarters of our armed services, the Pentagon \nitself.\n  If there was ever any question that the firefighters who wear the \nuniforms of local agencies are from time to time called upon to serve \nas partners with the men and women who wear the uniform of the U.S. \nmilitary, those questions I think have been laid to rest forever. The \nsad new reality is that when terrorists target civilian populations on \nAmerican soil, we are going to need, more than ever, our rescue \nservices to be as well equipped as they possibly can be.\n  I have mentioned fire departments and, obviously, police departments. \nThis bill covers emergency medical teams as well, EMS services. Again, \nthey responded in heroic fashion from Virginia, Maryland, DC, New \nJersey, Connecticut and, of course, New York. Many of us went to ground \nzero in New York City. Many colleagues met people from their States, \nfirefighters from North Carolina, Colorado, California--people who \nresponded from across this country to be in New York to assist those \ndepartments that had lost more than 350 of their brothers and sisters.\n  So this is a national issue. It directly relates to the security of \nour country. We do not send our soldiers into battle without the \ntraining and equipment they need. We can no longer abide a system that \nwould send firefighters to do their jobs without the proper training or \nequipment that they need.\n  Last year, Congress passed the Fire Fighter Investment and Response \nEnhancement Act as an amendment to the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill. Again, without Carl Levin and John Warner, the \nequipment some of these departments received would not have happened. \nSo I offer the amendment again on this bill not because this is the \nonly opportunity. In a sense, this is a national security issue, a new \nnational security, a new definition of what we are talking about.\n\n  At that time, we authorized 2 years of appropriations under the FIRE \nAct. Unfortunately, the levels of authorization did not anticipate the \nnew threats that have become apparent in recent weeks.\n  Last year, Congress appropriated $100 million to provide grant \nfunding under the FIRE Act to departments across the Nation. The \nFederal Emergency Management Administration recently reported that it \nreceived grant applications from nearly 20,000 local fire departments. \nThe total amount of funding requested by these departments is nearly $3 \nbillion. That is the existing need.\n  We appropriated $100 million, but there were $3 billion in requests \nfrom 20,000 departments across the Nation. Today these firefighters are \nnot just racing with the old hook and ladder down the old country lane \nto put out the barn fire. They are dealing with toxic waste, toxic \nsubstances, some of the most dangerous material in the world, and they \nare going to be called on, unfortunately, to deal with more of it in \nthe years ahead. Therefore, they need the support this amendment will \noffer them.\n  Last year, there was about $2.8 billion of unfunded requests under \nthe Fire Grant Program. I do not think we can afford to have that level \nof unmet needs this year or ever again for that matter. This amendment \nwill assure\n\n[[Page S9958]]\n\nthe continuation of the Fire Grant Program. It will increase the \nFederal Government's commitment to a level I think is appropriate in \nlight of recent events and the continuing threat to the safety of the \nAmerican public.\n  Under current law, authorization for the fire program terminates at \nthe end of fiscal year 2002. This amendment would extend the \nauthorization period until the end of the fiscal year 2004.\n  Further, the current law only authorizes about $300 million for the \nfiscal year 2002. This amendment would authorize an appropriation of up \nto $600 million for the purchase of emergency response equipment and \ntraining.\n  The amendment would also authorize up to $800 million in 2003 and up \nto $1 billion in 2004. To put it in perspective, the COPS Program, \nwhich most of us endorse and support, is around $11 billion. We are \ntaking about $1 billion for firefighters and some 30,000 departments \nacross the country.\n  None of us have ever suggested parity, although one might make a case \nin light of the events of September 11 considering what these men and \nwomen have to deal with, the materials they grapple with, and the \ntraining they are going to need. We have not asked for that. It is the \nauthorization levels I mentioned increasing through the year 2004.\n  There may remain other improvements, by the way, that could and \nshould be made to our emergency response infrastructure. I intend to \nwork very closely with the Commerce Committee. This is naturally and \nnormally a matter under the jurisdiction of the Commerce Committee. I \nexpress my gratitude to Fritz Hollings, our colleague from South \nCarolina, and John McCain, the Senator from Arizona, who, not unlike \nSenator Levin and Senator Warner, have been chair and ranking member \nback and forth.\n  Last year, with their support, we adopted the amendment as part of \nthe DOD authorization bill. I am grateful to Senator Hollings for his \nsupport of this amendment. They have a very important role to play. We \nhave to come back at some point and start talking about other things \nthat can be done.\n  Given the fact we are going to be winding up this session and there \nare very few vehicles available to us on which to have an authorization \nmatter considered, given the history of this act and its association \nwith the DOD authorization bill and the direct linkage between better \nequipping the ability of our fire departments across this country to \ndeal with the new threats our communities face, I think this bill is an \nappropriate place for this amendment.\n  I am very grateful to all of our colleagues for their willingness to \nconsider these extraordinary circumstances.\n  My hope is that this evening we can adopt this amendment on a voice \nvote. I am not interested in having a recorded vote. I think most of \nour colleagues will support it. My hope is that we will complete action \nand leave the Record open so others who may want to comment on this \ncan.\n  I have dedicated this amendment to the men and women who lost their \nlives in the fire departments on September 11. There are a lot of ways \nthey can be memorialized and communities are doing that across the \ncountry. If you talk to your local departments, there is no better way \nto memorialize them than to see to it future firefighters have the \nequipment and training they will need.\n  Hopefully, they will not have to use it. Hopefully, they will never \nhave to face what New York City or Northern Virginia faced with the \nattack on the Pentagon, but if it occurs, I want to be able to say that \nthis Congress and this Chamber provided them the tools and training \nnecessary to respond to those tragedies; that we were not so \nshortsighted that we did not understand the new world we entered as a \nresult of the attacks on our country only 2 weeks ago.\n  Again, I urge the adoption of this amendment. This is one area where \nI know there are likely to be remaining issues, as I said, to be \ndiscussed. But as we continue to identify critical staffing needs and \nbetter ways to structure the Federal Government's partnership with \nlocal firefighters, I will be looking to Chairman Hollings and Senator \nMcCain and the Commerce Committee to continue to provide leadership in \nthis area.\n  There is no shortage of bravery among the men and women of America's \nfire service. Even when commercial air travel was completely shut down, \npublic safety workers from as far away as Chicago and Texas made their \nway to New York and the Pentagon to lend their assistance. We have seen \nthat public safety personnel are extraordinary people. They put the \nneeds of others before their own interests and even before their own \npersonal safety.\n  During the initial rush to save people in the burning World Trade \nCenter Towers, nobody stopped to ask: Why are you here? But if they \nhad, the answer undoubtedly would have come back: Because people need \nour help.\n  Tonight we can provide service to those who provided help in the past \nby helping them. This amendment honors America's firefighters, \nacknowledges the men and women who do not ask why, the men and women \nwho simply do what must be done.\n  This amendment is more than that. It is an investment in America's \nsecurity. This will help America be prepared for come what may. Let the \nworld be on notice that we are not afraid, but we are also going to be \nprepared, and we are also going to prevail. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend our dear friend from Connecticut \nfor his very passionate argument. He has been the leader in the effort \nto provide these resources for our valued firefighters whose amazing \ncontributions were so dramatically demonstrated on September 11. The \nSenator from Connecticut has been the leader in this effort. The \ncontribution which I have made to his effort is small indeed compared \nto what he has been able to put forward with his leadership.\n  I can only say in amazement that as powerful a speaker as the Senator \nfrom Connecticut always is, somehow miraculously, despite the fact he \nis up half the night changing diapers for his daughter Grace, he is \nmore powerful and more passionate than ever. That says something about \nfatherhood. I congratulate him not only on his argument and tell him I \nam proud to be a cosponsor of his amendment, but I again congratulate \nhim on his wonderful new family addition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I add my commendations to our good friend \nand colleague. All too often in reflecting on September 11, we, of \ncourse, focus on the magnitude of the tragedy in New York and, indeed, \nin my State, but we should include Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, we should.\n  Mr. WARNER. The firefighters are a band of brothers and sisters, as \nit was made very clear to me, wherever they are in those States, \nparticularly those three impact areas. I visited the Pentagon not more \nthan 3 or 4 hours after the plane flew into it, and I will have further \nremarks. I see our distinguished colleague from North Carolina wishes \nto address another matter for a few minutes, and then I will regain the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, let these remarks reflect as \nwell, he is absolutely correct. We focus on New York, the World Trade \nCenter, and the Pentagon. He is absolutely correct the people of \nPennsylvania, those who lost their lives in that aircraft--we do not \nknow the whole story, but many of us suspect that the people inside \nthat plane played a very heroic role, and the fact we are standing in \nthis building today debating these issues may very well be because some \nvery heroic civilian Americans stood up and took on some people and \nsaved countless other lives. That mark in Pennsylvania and those who \nresponded to it deserve equal recognition.\n  The Senator from Virginia is absolutely correct.\n  I see my friend from North Carolina is about to speak, and since my \nfriend from Michigan raised the issue of my newborn Grace, I must tell \nthe Senator from North Carolina we received some wonderful little gifts \nfor new Grace and all of them are cherished, but the Senator from North \nCarolina and his beloved Dot sent a little teddy bear which, if you \nextend it, it plays music. I want to tell the Senator I will forever be \ngrateful to my colleague from North Carolina because I have tried all \nsorts\n\n[[Page S9959]]\n\nof ways to quiet Grace down but nothing works like that little music \nbox. I thank the Senator immensely for that token and gesture, and I \nthank his lovely wife as well. I say to my colleague from North \nCarolina, I thought of him many times at 3 this morning.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I acknowledge that from time to time the \nheart of the Senator from Connecticut needs to be quieted so we are \ngoing to bring that little teddy bear to the floor to calm him down on \nsome other matters.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator from North Carolina will yield, we now have \ntwo ways of closing debate a little more promptly and in unique ways. \nOne is with Ted Kennedy's dog, which barks when someone goes on too \nlong--usually not on the floor of the Senate--and now we have a music \nbox. So that Chris and Jackie have the special gift from the Senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hollings). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, be added as a cosponsor to the fire \nact amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that this important colloquy \nabout the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff be printed in today's \nRecord separate from the presentation by the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield further, he might want to ask \nunanimous consent that others might be able to join with Senator Helms \nin commending Hugh Shelton. I am not a member of the committee, but all \nof us at one time or another have had dealings with him, even though he \nis responsible to responding to the Armed Services Committee. This is a \nremarkable public servant, Hugh Shelton, and he is going to be missed. \nHe has a wonderful successor. I do not know him as well as I know \nGeneral Shelton, but on behalf of those not on the committee but who \nhave watched him and talked to him and called him from time to time, \nthis is truly a great citizen, and I wish to add my thoughts and \ncomments about his contribution to our country as well.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I so modify my UC, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the statements made in the Chamber today and otherwise in \nregard to the distinguished former Chairman be printed in today's \nRecord in one place by the close of business today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Helms, Mr. Warner, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Edwards are \nprinted in today's Record under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. WARNER. In regard to the pending amendment by the Senator from \nConnecticut, I think it is important to show how these funds are being \nspent. I referred to the bill that we put in last year in the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, known as the Floyd D. Spence national defense \nauthorization on page 378. These funds are to be used for the following \npurposes: to hire additional firefighting personnel; to train personnel \nin fire fighting, emergency response, arson, prevention, and detection \nor the handling of hazardous materials; or to train firefighting \npersonnel to provide any of the training described in this \nsubparagraph.\n  There is no greater threat facing this Nation today than weapons of \nmass destruction, and as we listened to the very able work being done \nby the Attorney General of the United States and others in connection \nwith the crisis of September 11, they are obligated to tell this Nation \nthat we cannot ring the all clear sign, that we have many problems and \nit could possibly include weapons of mass destruction of the type of \nchemical or biological. It is difficult for me to enunciate that in \nthis Chamber. That is precisely what these funds are to be used for, to \ntrain firefighters. They are oftentimes both professional and \nvolunteer. I thank my colleague.\n\n  Last year, I remember, we wanted to give parity with the professional \nvolunteer. That has been done. They are the first on the scene. Unless \nthey have some training to make an assessment right away, they \nthemselves could become victims of a chemical or biological attack and \ntheir services would be incapacitated, depending on the problem. That \ntraining is included. It is important.\n  There are funds to protect firefighting personnel at the scenes of \nfire and other emergencies. In New York City there was tremendous \npersonal risk in these situations trying to extract survivors and yet \nat the same time confronted with a weakened structure, smoke, and all \ntypes of things. They themselves could be trapped. Special training is \nrequired for extricating the firemen as well as the remaining victims.\n  Other uses of the funds:\n  To certify firefighters, to establish wellness and fitness programs \nfor firefighting personnel, to ensure that the firefighting personnel \ncan carry out their duties--there are tremendous arduous, physical \nrequirements for the men and women who bravely wear the uniforms of \nfirefighters; to fund emergency medical services provided by fire \ndepartments--more and more often, they are the first on the scene to \nrender the basic necessities of medical care and to save lives; to \nacquire additional firefighting vehicles, including firetrucks. We all \nhave romance about the firetrucks. I know some of the volunteer groups \nin my State kept the old truck to remind them of the need to get a new \ntruck, but they never seem to discard the old truck. In times of the \nparade, the old truck comes out and everybody is proud to see it again. \nHowever, we have to get state-of-the-art equipment; to acquire \nadditional firefighting equipment, including equipment for \ncommunications and monitoring; to acquire personnel protective \nequipment, required for firefighting personnel, by the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration and other personnel protective \nequipment for firefighting personnel; to modify fire stations, fire-\ntraining facilities, and other facilities to protect the health and \nsafety of firefighting personnel; to enforce fire codes; to fund fire \nprevention programs; to educate the public about arson prevention and \ndetection; or to provide incentives for the recruitment and retention \nof volunteer firefighting personnel for volunteer firefighting \ndepartments and other firefighting departments that utilize volunteers.\n  I commend our distinguished colleague. I am proud to be a cosponsor \non this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Virginia for his eloquent \ncomments and remarks. He has made a strong statement on the value of \nthis amendment and the contribution it has made.\n  As I pointed out in my remarks, we put in $100 million a year ago and \nwe had over $3 billion worth of grant requests from 20,000 departments \nacross the country. We are not going to satisfy all of that, even if \nthere is a full appropriation to equal the authorization amounts here, \nbut it can make a difference for these people.\n  My office spoke with Senator McCain's office and I ask unanimous \nconsent Senator McCain be listed as a cosponsor of this amendment. He \nhas no objection to this amendment being adopted. I urge we agree to \nthe amendment by voice vote. Perhaps others may want to be heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. I accept, certainly, the statement by the Senator. I \nunderstand Senator McCain still has this matter under advisement.\n  Mr. DODD. He told me he wants to be a cosponsor so we will do that \nmuch, anyway.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator McCain be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (Mr. DODD assumed the cChair.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer of the Senate, the Senator from Connecticut, for his leadership \non firefighting issues.\n  As Governor of South Carolina some years back, I helped to establish \nthe Firefighting Institute in my State. I have always been interested \nin these issues and I continue to admire the bravery of our firemen. \nWhen I came to the Senate in the late 1960s during the civil rights \nera, protestors would pull the fire boxes during demonstrations. When \nthe firemen came to the scene where the alarm was given, they were \nshooting the firemen. We lost several\n\n[[Page S9960]]\n\nfiremen as a result of this. At the time, there was a $50,000 benefit \nfor the FBI and law enforcement personnel, but none, whatsoever, for \nthe Federal firefighters. So we amended that in our committee to make \nsure we took care of the firefighters and their families.\n  The current initiative before us that Senator Dodd first presented \nlast year, is something firefighters around the country are looking \nfor. We in government shortchange some, when it comes to prisons, when \nit comes to law enforcement, when it comes to firefighters. It has been \nmy experience over the years of service that we take these public \nservices for granted when it comes to funding.\n  I guess my frustration with this neglect is an outcome of growing up \nand coming along during the days of the Depression when anybody was \nglad to get any kind of job. The fact is, law enforcement officials and \nfirefighters have historically been underpaid. We cannot accept this \nany longer. We can see the courage displayed in New York, and the \nmagnificent sacrifices made.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to the distinguished chairman, Senator McCain has \nnow indicated he joins in full support of this measure, so I am \nprepared to agree to the amendment, with the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer in the chair; is that agreeable?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If it is agreeable here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Presiding Officer is very content for that \nto occur.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1750) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  (Mr. HOLLINGS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Talk about a seamless transition, as the Senator from \nConnecticut said, this is a seamless transition of the Presiding \nOfficers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All working together.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1793 through 1808, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask consent it be in order to send 16 amendments to the \ndesk, and I ask they be considered en bloc. I understand these \namendments have been cleared by the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself and Mr. \n     Warner, proposes amendments numbered 1793 through 1808, en \n     bloc.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to join my distinguished chairman in commending \nthe hard work of our staff over the course of Friday, Saturday, Sunday, \nand today, working on this package. It is well known to all members of \nthe committee what is included in the amendments. Therefore, the \namendments have been cleared on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr, President, last week I spoke of a group of \nAmericans who will be on the front lines of the new war on terrorism--\nreservists and national guard members. President Bush has authorized \nthe call-up of 50,000 of these citizen soldiers.\n  Together with a bipartisan group of Senators, I offered legislation \nthat I believe would greatly support these brave men and women, and \ntheir families. This amendment would allow those called to active duty \nand their families to have access to uninterrupted health care \ncoverage. My amendment is based on legislation I introduced with \nSenator DeWine earlier this year. It would allow reservists returning \nfrom deployments, to extend their TRICARE coverage for close to six \nmonths or until their civilian health insurers returned their coverage \nto them.\n  Today, I have expanded the scope of this legislation to cover not \nonly reserve components, but two other categories of military personnel \nwho will require help transitioning to civilian life once their active \nduty service has ended.\n  First, there are active duty personnel who are involuntarily \nretained. These are personnel who were scheduled to separate from \nmilitary service, but were ordered to stay on active duty to support \nmilitary operations in times of crisis. Second, there are those who are \ninvoluntarily separated. These are personnel who are downsized after a \nlarge mobilization such as the one the President has ordered.\n  Our military personnel need to know that their Nation will not turn \nits back on them or their families. Today I offer an amendment that \nwill ensure that they receive adequate health care when they return \nfrom active duty.\n  My legislation will build off of a Gulf War era statute that is set \nto expire this year. Under previous laws, involuntarily retained and \nseparated servicemen and women were allowed to extend their military \nhealth care coverage for a certain period of time, depending on their \nlength of service.\n  Service men and women with over 6 years of active duty service could \nextend their TRICARE benefit for up to 120 days after they separated \nfrom service. Those with under 6 years would be allowed to extend their \ncoverage for up to 60 days after they separated from service.\n  I understand that the Department of Defense was going to request re-\nauthorization of this benefit in light of the current crisis. However, \ntheir request will probably not come to Congress in time to be attached \nto the fiscal year 2002 authorization bill. It is time that we act now, \nin the name of these brave soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. But \nmoreover, we must expand this benefit to other critical parts of our \nforce--reservists and national guard members.\n  Currently, when Reservists are called up, they are temporarily \nconsidered active duty components. While they are in harm's way, \nmembers of the reserves and national guard, and their dependents, are \nentitled to the same military health care coverage as other military \npersonnel--what is called, TRICARE. Reservists who have deployed for \nmore than 30 days during a major contingency may extend their military \nhealth care coverage for 30 days after they return.\n  My amendment will provide comfort to thousands of military families \nwhose loved ones risk their lives defending our Nation. But more \nimportantly, it would be part of our national effort to unite behind \nour troops during this time of national crisis.\n  Over 50,000 reservists may soon be called into service. As President \nBush himself has said, ``We're talking about somebody's mom, or \nsomebody's dad, somebody's employee, somebody's friend, or somebody's \nneighbor.''\n  I want to thank both Senators Levin and Warner as well as their \nstaffs for their important assistance in writing this legislation. \nTogether, we crafted a measure that will assure our service personnel \nthat when they return home they will not be denied health care because \nof their military service.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe now we have cleared the decks of \nall cleared amendments. We are hoping more can be cleared yet tonight. \nWe will be here at least for a few minutes. For the moment, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nMaryland, Mr. Sarbanes, and the Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, be added \nas cosponsors of the just-adopted fire act amendment, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I further ask unanimous consent that any additional Members \nhave until the close of business today to add themselves as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may, I want to take just a few minutes, \nwhile the chairman and ranking member are off the floor, to comment on \nsome other aspects of this bill that is before us, the Department of \nDefense authorization bill, and to comment about a larger measure.\n  I have filed an amendment which I may offer. I doubt if I will, but I \nwant to talk about it, if I may. I rise to speak about the election \nreform provisions contained in the DOD authorization bill. First, let \nme applaud the members of the committee for including these provisions \nin the DOD authorization bill.\n  We are all familiar with the fact that last year in the national \nelections there were issues raised about the ability of our men and \nwomen in uniform to cast ballots and have those ballots counted. I know \nthe Presiding Officer, the Senator from South Carolina, who represents \nmajor military installations in his State, men and women from his State \nwho have served in significantly high numbers, has talked about their \nright to vote.\n  At this very hour, as we are gathered here, many of them are \nscattered to the four corners of the globe, protecting and defending \nthe interests of our Nation. There were provisions adopted in the \ncommittee print which I think go a significant way toward minimizing \nthe kinds of irregularities and problems our men and women in uniform \nwitnessed last year in casting their ballots and having their ballots \ncounted.\n  As we prepare to defend our democracy, as we talk about this the most \nsignificant of the bills we debate and discuss on national security, I \nthink it is vital that we also work together in a\n\n[[Page S9963]]\n\nbipartisan fashion to strengthen our democracy at home. So I commend \nand thank our colleagues for adding these provisions to the Defense \nauthorization bill.\n  This is a new world, as we have all heard repeated over and over \nagain during the last several weeks. We are living in a new world where \nour very democracy is under assault. In fact, if I can quote from \nPresident Bush's recent speech to the joint session of Congress, the \nreason we are under attack is because of our democratic system. As the \nPresident said just a few nights ago:\n\n       They hate what they see right here in this Chamber, a \n     democratically elected government. Their leaders are self \n     appointed. They hate our freedoms: Our freedom of religion, \n     our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble, and \n     to disagree with each other.\n\n  Those are important statements. So as we prepare to send troops \npossibly into harm's way, it is necessary that we try to do everything \nwe can to secure for these brave men and women their precious freedom--\nthe freedom to vote.\n  I can think of few more important statements the United States could \nmake to terrorists than to take steps to strengthen and secure the \nright to vote for all eligible Americans, and to have their votes \ncounted. If the terrorists harbored any illusions that they would \ndestabilize our democracy by perpetrating acts of evil against innocent \npeople, our determination to strengthen the right to vote proves that \nthe terrorists are sadly mistaken.\n  The provisions of this bill help ensure that right by setting uniform \nnondiscriminatory voting standards, residency requirements, and \nregistration of balloting rights for uniformed service voters and their \nspouses and dependents. There are over 6 million men and women who \nserve in our uniformed services. These citizens put themselves on the \nline and are at risk every day to protect our Nation. Yet, in some \ncases, when they cast their votes, those votes have not been counted. \nThis is unacceptable. It is most appropriate that we address this \ninadequacy in the text of the Department of Defense authorization \nmeasures.\n  I fully support these provisions which provide for certain minimum \nFederal requirements for voting and registration. Specifically, this \nprovision requires States to ensure that each voting system used within \na State for elections for Federal, State, and local offices, provide \noverseas voters and absent uniformed service voters with a meaningful \nopportunity to exercise their voting rights as citizens of the United \nStates; second, to count an absentee ballot for an election for \nFederal, State, or local office that is timely submitted by an overseas \nvoter or absent uniform services voter to the proper official and is \notherwise valid; third, it permits absent uniformed services voters to \nuse absentee registration procedures and vote by absentee ballot in \nprimary, general, special, and runoff elections for State and local \noffices; lastly, to accept and process any voter registration \napplication from an absent uniformed services voter if the application \nis received by the State official not less than 30 days before the date \nof the election and is otherwise valid.\n\n  I fully support all of these Federal requirements. Importantly, this \nbill mandates these requirements. The bill doesn't say that it would \npermit any State to opt out of these desperately needed reforms. These \nare mandates. The States shall do this regardless of jurisdiction. \nThese men and women are serving in our Federal uniformed services. They \nare protecting our Nation.\n  Whether they are voting for a local office or the Presidency of the \nUnited States, we have to mandate these requirements.\n  The chairman of the committee, the ranking member, and Republicans \nand Democrats alike support mandated provisions in the context of \nvoting rights for uniformed services voters.\n  The only way to guarantee that such requirements become part of the \nvoting rights for uniformed services voters is in fact to mandate them \nand to give the States the resources they may require to implement \nthese provisions.\n  This bill is an important and long overdue effort to ensure that our \nuniformed services voters, regardless of race, ethnicity, disability, \nthe language they speak, or the resources of the community they live \nin, either abroad or in America, have an equal opportunity to cast \ntheir votes and have their votes counted.\n  But we also need to make sure that when these uniformed services \nvoters and their families return to civilian life, their rights to vote \nremain protected regardless of race, ethnicity, disability, the \nlanguage they speak, or the resources of the community in which they \nlive--whether it is abroad or in America, in my view.\n  Today we are ensuring in this bill the right to cast a vote and have \nthat vote counted for our uniformed services voters.\n  I see the presence of the distinguished ranking member, Senator \nWarner. I commend the Senator and Senator Levin for incorporating these \nvoting rights for our men and women in uniform.\n  Before this Congress recesses for the year, or in the alternative, at \nthe earliest opportunity next year, I hope we set similar minimum \nFederal standards to ensure the same opportunity for all eligible \nAmerican voters, regardless of race, ethnicity, disability, the \nlanguage they speak, or the resources of the community in which they \nlive--whether it is abroad or in America.\n  We must enact such comprehensive election reforms while there is time \nto affect the elections for Federal offices in the year 2002 to the \nextent possible, and more particularly the next Presidential election \nin the year 2004.\n  To this end, I have filed my comprehensive election reform bill, S. \n565, the Dodd-Conyers bill, as an amendment to the Defense Department \nauthorization act. The Rules Committee ordered this measure reported on \nAugust 2 by a vote of 10-0. The Dodd-Conyers bill--the Equal Protection \nVoting Rights Act of 2001--I believe, as well as 51 of my colleagues, \nis the strongest and most comprehensive election reform proposal that \nhas been introduced in Congress today. For that reason, it enjoys more \nsupport than any other election reform bill in both Houses. Some 211 \nDemocrat and Republican and independent Members of Congress support \nthis legislation.\n\n  Let me briefly describe once again to my colleagues what this bill \nwill do. In fact, it is completely consistent with the provisions \ncontained in this DOD authorization bill for the men and women in \nuniform.\n  Specifically, the Dodd-Conyers bill creates a temporary commission to \nstudy election reform issues and then submit a report of \nrecommendations in those areas.\n  It creates a grant program to States and localities for Federal funds \nto acquire updating voting systems and technology, improve voting \nregistration systems, and educate voters and poll workers.\n  Lastly, it establishes three minimum Federal requirements for \nelections for Federal office, effective year 2004, with authorization \nfor appropriations to pay for these requirements.\n  These three requirements are:\n  No. 1, Federal standards for voting systems, machines and technology;\n  No. 2, provisional voting; and\n  No. 3, distribution of sample ballots and voting instructions.\n  These three areas are not radical ideas for Federal requirements. The \nFederal standards for voting machines do not dictate what specific \nvoting machine ought to be used by States and localities. How people \nvote in Virginia, South Carolina, Connecticut, or Michigan ought to be \nup to what local people want to do; which machine; which system they \nwant to have in place. We don't decide that at the Federal level. We do \nnot use the approach of ``one size fits all''. On the contrary, in my \nbill States are merely required to adopt the Federal standards for \nvoting systems and equipment governed by the Federal Election \nCommission. At this time, over 36 States have voluntarily adopted these \nVSS standards. Those standards do not require specific machines or \nsoftware but rather specific functionality and performance. For \nexample, voting systems must have some error notification functions, be \naccessible to disabled voters, and have a capacity for audit trail to \navoid fraud. Those basic requirements are not terribly complicated. I \ndon't think that is a radical idea in the 21st century.\n  When you are voting for the Presidency of the United States, and when\n\n[[Page S9964]]\n\nyou are voting for the national assembly, how people vote in one \njurisdiction affects the votes of others in other jurisdictions. You \nare not just voting for a local office. If you get it wrong in \nConnecticut when voting for the President, then voters in South \nCarolina have their vote diluted because the outcome could affect how \nthey cast their ballots from South Carolina.\n  In Presidential elections, a national Congress having minimum Federal \nStandard that applies to all 50 States is absolutely required. \nOtherwise, you lend yourself to be open to the probability that in \nlocal areas where voters may not be allowed to vote, or the votes can't \nbe counted, the overall outcome is affected. That dilutes the rights of \nother voters in other jurisdictions who have done it right and is a \nviolation of the ``one person, one vote'' principle. This is not a \nradical idea.\n  The second requirement is provisional voting. Again, this is not a \nradical idea. Many jurisdictions already do it.\n  Very simply, someone shows up to vote. They claim they have \nregistered to vote. They have filled out all the paperwork. And, for \nwhatever reason, the person sitting in that precinct says: I am sorry, \nwe don't have your name on the voter registration lists or there is a \nchallenge for some other reason. We don't think you are registered to \nvote. At that point, you become a provisional voter. You allow that \nperson to cast their ballot. Like an absentee ballot, you set it aside \nand allow that process to go forward. The person casts their ballot, \nthe ballot is set aside, and at the end of the process, you go back and \ndetermine whether or not the voter was an eligible voter and otherwise \nentitled to cast a vote and have that vote counted. If the voter was \nright, you cast the ballot. If the voter was wrong, you don't cast the \nballot.\n  This is not terribly complicated. I think, depending on the \ndefinition of ``provisional ballot'' process used, all jurisdictions \nalready have some form of ``provision balloting''. Again, it allows \npeople who believe they have voted--in many cases properly registered--\nto then actually cast their ballot and have that vote counted.\n  Thirdly, the distribution of sample ballots and voting instructions: \nThus far, every jurisdiction has sample ballots, the issue is how and \nwhether those sample ballots are distributed. Because of the many \ndifferent factors that influence ballots, such as constitutional \namendments or referendums, it can be costly and labor intensive to \nprint and distribute such sample ballots.\n  Today, having people take a look at sample ballots before you \nactually go in to vote just might facilitate the process, raise the \nlevel of awareness, and give people a chance to become more familiar \nwith what is on the ballot. It is a value.\n  Those are all three of the requirements. The big battle is over \nwhether or not they ought to be voluntary or mandated.\n  In the DOD bill, we said when it comes to uniformed services, this is \nnot a choice you have, it is mandated. If this bill is adopted, we will \nmandate that every jurisdiction in America--whether you like it or \nnot--is going to see to it that men and women in uniform have the right \nto vote and their vote counted.\n  It is not a great leap to say if it is good for uniformed services \nvoters, it is also good to mandate the three basic minimum Federal \nrequirements for all eligible voters, particularly when you are talking \nabout elections of the Presidency and the National Congress?\n  I am not going to offer this larger provision on this bill. We have \nalready incorporated in committee the minimum voting requirements for \nmen and women in uniform. I strongly support what the committee has \ndone. But I do want to raise the issue.\n\n  I know in the midst of everything else that is going on, it is not \nterribly likely--although it may become likely if the session runs \nlonger than some anticipate--to actually bring up the election reform \nbill.\n  I cannot think of anything we could do that would express our sense \nof unity as Americans--I guess memories may fade a little bit, and \nobviously the events of September 11 are so huge that many people may \nhave forgotten the amount of time and attention the Nation took last \nyear--almost a year ago--on November 7th with the national election. In \nthe weeks that went by before we resolved what occurred, night after \nnight we watched what happened in the State of Florida, because that \nState happened to be the pivotal one. I quickly point out the problems \nexisted in almost every State. And in some States, Georgia and Illinois \nfor example, the problems were much more significant than the problems \nin Florida, we now know.\n  But I think we ought to go back and remind ourselves of what occurred \nand how disappointed we were, as Americans, to see a voting system that \nhad fallen into such disrepair. We were lecturing the rest of the world \non how to vote. We had sent teams all over the globe, going to Third \nWorld countries, to show them how we do it in America. Well, now the \nworld has gotten a good view of how we did it in America. Frankly, we \nwere not terribly impressed nor was the world.\n  So I cannot think of a better message we could give to terrorists, \nand others who want to destabilize our country, than that we are going \nto get our voting system right, that we are going to come together, as \nDemocrats and Republicans, and fashion a system that makes us all \nproud. My hope is that will happen.\n  As some may know, I have had discussions with my good friend from \nMissouri, Senator Kit Bond, who has some very strong ideas on how we \ncould minimize voter fraud in this country. And it is a problem. He \nsaid something that I think is true, that we ought to have as sort of a \nslogan on this bill that it ought to be easy to vote and very difficult \nto commit fraud. And today it is hard to vote and maybe pretty easy to \ncommit fraud. We need to reverse that trend.\n  So I am hopeful he and I can work out some proposal that we can \npresent to the entire body here, possibly before we end this session of \nCongress. What a tremendous message we could send, that we are \nimproving the voting process in this country. These requirements that I \nhave laid out and talked about have already been adopted by many \nStates.\n  The Voting systems standards have been voluntarily adopted by over 36 \nStates. As I mentioned earlier, provisional voting, or some aspect of a \nprovisional balloting procedure, has also been adopted in every State \nand the District of Columbia by statues. For example, 20 States have \nprovisional balloting statutes, 12 States contain some aspect of the \nprovisional process, not all of them and about 18 States have no \nprovisional ballot statutes but contain some related provisions, such \nas same-day voter registration.\n  The third requirement is sample ballot distribution and voting \ninstructions. It is fairly straightforward. My best information \nindicates that at this time all States and the District of Columbia \nhave laws providing for some form of sample ballots. However, how these \nsample ballots are distributed appears to vary quite significantly from \nState to State.\n  I will not go into all the details here. I don't want to take the \ntime of my colleagues. Suffice it to say that the committee deserves a \ngreat deal of credit for what they have done for our men and women in \nuniform. The Federal mandate ought to substantially minimize the \nproblems that occurred a year ago across the nation for our men and \nwomen in uniform serving overseas when they want to cast votes and have \ntheir votes counted.\n\n  My hope is we can complete the process now by providing comprehensive \nelection reform for every eligible American voter who desires to cast a \nvote and have that vote counted, just as we provide for our men and \nwomen in uniform. The men and women in uniform will be the first to \ntell you they do not want to be treated differently in that regard. \nThey are citizens of the country. They are citizen soldiers, but \ncitizens. And the right to vote and have your vote counted ought to be \na right that is guaranteed to every eligible U.S. citizen who meets the \nrequirements, regardless of race, ethnicity, disability, the language \nthey speak, or the resources of the community they live in, whether \nabroad or in the United States.\n  So my hope is that in the midst of all the other things we are going \nto do to make our country stronger, to make it more secure, to protect \nour airports, to\n\n[[Page S9965]]\n\nprotect our buildings, to protect our people from the threats of \nterrorist attack, the one thing we might also try to do in the midst of \nall of this is to make our elections process stronger and prove that \nour democracy is strong.\n  It has been pointed out--I mentioned it earlier today--the tremendous \nheroic achievements of the passengers on the flight that crashed in \nPennsylvania. Many of us believe that plane may have very well been \nheaded for Washington, DC, and headed for this very building. We do not \nknow exactly what happened there, but it appears as though some very \nheroic passengers took some very courageous action.\n  In fact, we do know from cell phone conversations that they did \nsomething that ought to remain in the minds of every one of us. They, \nin the midst of all of this, decided to have a vote about what to do, \naccording to the cell phone conversations of several spouses who heard \nfrom their husbands.\n  Imagine this: Here are terrorists on a plane who are about to crash \nthis plane--maybe into this very building, or some other facility; \nsymbols of our democracy, our freedom, and our rights--and the \npassengers on that doomed aircraft decided to cast a ballot about what \nto do.\n  Mr. President, I would like to see us be able to cast our ballots as \nfar as the eye can see in the future of this country, and to see that \nthis process is strengthened, that every citizen, race, ethnicity, \ndisability, the language they speak, the resources of the community in \nwhich they live, can have an equal opportunity to cast a vote and an \nequal opportunity to have that vote counted.\n  I cannot think of a better message that we could send, beyond the \nthings we are doing already, to those who are hiding in the shadows of \nthe world tonight, possibly planning some form of terrorist attack, \ndisregarding basic rights of people, than to say that in the target of \nyour hostility, in a place called America, people have an equal \nopportunity to cast a vote and have those votes counted. We are going \nto make it stronger in the coming days and weeks, not weaker.\n  So I commend, again, the committee for their efforts. I further look \nforward to the opportunity when we can bring up a comprehensive \nelection reform bill to right the wrongs and concerns that I think all \nof us agree occurred in last year's national elections. What better \nmessage can we send to the caves of Afghanistan, or wherever these \npeople may be residing--they may be watching this debate--than that you \nmay try, over and over again, to do everything to destabilize this \ncountry, but the people who cast their ballots on that plane that \ncrashed in Pennsylvania are a reflection of who we are as a people. You \nwill never deny us the right to vote and the right to choose our \nleaders democratically. I think the bill that John Conyers and I have \noffered in the House and the Senate, with some 51 cosponsors in this \nChamber, goes a long way to achieving that desired result.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder now to send 12 amendments to the desk and that they be considered \nen bloc. I understand these amendments have now been cleared by the \nother side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the amendments have been cleared on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I urge the Senate adopt these 12 amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] proposes amendments \n     numbered 1809 through 1820, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1809\n\n (Purpose: To authorize, with an offset, an additional $6,500,000 for \n    research, development, test, and evaluation Defense-wide, with \n$5,000,000 allocated for the Big Crow Program and $1,500,000 allocated \n              for the Defense Systems Evaluation program)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 215.

Madam President, I am introducing this amendment with \nSenator Domenici to S. 1438, the fiscal year 2002 National Defense \nAuthorization Act, to provide funds badly needed for two vital test \nsupport activities in the Department of Defense, DoD. The Big Crow \nprogram provides DoD with highly sophisticated airborne electronic \nwarfare capabilities that enable us to test our newest weapon systems \nand technologies in a realistic battle environment in which electronic \nwarfare is likely to be used. The system can also be used operationally \nif a requirement suddenly occurs. The Defense Systems Evaluation, DSE, \nprogram provides aircraft to replicate enemy and friendly aircraft in \ntesting Army air defense programs and technology. Both of these \nprograms provide vital test support assets used by all the military \nservices. Unfortunately, it is typical for programs that provide cross-\nservice support to be inadequately funded by their parent service \norganization. This year's President's budget request did not seek any \nfunding for these programs, perhaps relying on the Congress, once \nagain, to provide the emergency funds needed to keep them operating.\n  Thus we find ourselves again this year, seeking the funding needed \nfor these two programs in order for them to continue to provide vital \ntest support activities for all of the military services. The \namendment, which Senator Domenici and I offer, will provide the minimum \nnecessary funding to enable Big Crow and DSE to operate during fiscal \nyear 2002.\n  There are other test support programs in the DoD that suffer the same \ncircumstance as the two for which I am seeking funding. They refer to \nthem in the Pentagon as ``the orphans.'' The Defense Science Board, \nDSB, recently completed a review of operational testing and evaluation \nin the Department of Defense and published a report containing a number \nof significant recommendations about how to improve that process to \nmake it more effective and efficient. The DSB recommended that DoD seek \nways to encourage and implement joint service testing. Among their \nrecommendations, the DSB endorsed budget oversight responsibility for \norphan programs such as Big Crow and DSE to the Director, Operational \nTest and Evaluation in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Actual \ntest and evaluation activities would remain the province of the \nmilitary services.\n  This year's Defense authorization bill reported out by the Armed \nServices\n\n[[Page S9968]]\n\nCommittee contains a provision requesting the Secretary of Defense to \nreview the DSB report and to submit recommendations regarding its \nimplementation with the budget request submission for fiscal year 2003. \nI am hopeful that the Secretary will endorse the DSB findings so that \nthe Department will finally exercise appropriate oversight and support \nfor cross-service test activities. In the meantime, the amendment I am \nintroducing is necessary to keep those essential test activities \nunderway. I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendments Nos. \n1809 through 1820, en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1809 through 1820) were agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we had hoped and expected there was going \nto be an additional amendment of Senator Hollings to which Senator \nWarner and I had agreed, but there was a last minute objection, I \nbelieve, on the Republican side. We will try to do the best we can on \nthat in the morning.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the chairman is correct. We believed we \nhad it worked out, and at the last minute there was an objection on \nthis side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/01/senate-section/article/S9968-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

SHELTON\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, this morning marked an unmistakably \nglorious conclusion to the remarkable military career of one of North \nCarolina's most famous citizens, GEN Henry H. Shelton.\n  It occurred at Fort Myer, VA, with scores of America's best-known \nleaders--both military and civilian, on hand for the spectacular event.\n  All branches of the armed services participated. The Secretary of \nDefense, for example, Don Rumsfeld, was there, as was Secretary of \nState Colin Powell. The marching bands didn't miss a cue or a note. It \nwas splendid, every minute of it, in every detail.\n  General Shelton's farewell remarks were a modest review of the many \nthings he had seen and things he had done in many places around the \nworld. His wife Carolyn's eyes brimmed with tears a few times, a \nmeasurement of her pride in, and her love for, her remarkable husband.\n  All in all, it served to make those of us present a bit prouder of \nour country as we surveyed the troops from all of the services and \nheard the bands strike up.\n  I believe Senators will enjoy reviewing the address by GEN Henry H. \nShelton on this, the morning of his retirement from the U.S. Army--and \nespecially, as General Shelton turned over the chairmanship of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff to his friend, GEN Dick Myers.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that General Shelton's farewell \naddress be printed in full in the Record.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Remarks by General Henry H. Shelton, USA, Armed Forces Full Honor \n      Tribute, Summerall Field, Fort Myer, Monday, 1 October 2001\n\n       Secretary Powell, Secretary and Mrs. Rumsfeld, Secretary \n     Principi, Director and good friend George Tennant of CIA, \n     members of the diplomatic corps, distinguished members of \n     Congress to include the delegation from my home state of \n     North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms, Senator John Edwards, and \n     Congressman Bob Etheridge, Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz, \n     Service Secretaries, Fellow Chiefs of Defense, Members of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff past and present to include my \n     predecessor and old mentor General David Jones, Commanders-in \n     Chief of our Combatant Commands, fellow flag and general \n     officers, distinguished guests, family and friends, and \n     especially, the men and women of our Armed Forces, \n     represented here today by the magnificent soldiers, sailors, \n     airmen, marines, and coast guardsmen, standing proud and tall \n     in the ranks before us.\n       Thanks to all of you for being a part of this ceremony \n     during this very busy and trying time and for honoring \n     Carolyn and me with your presence. Thank you Secretary \n     Rumsfeld for those kind words. Carolyn and I deeply \n     appreciate your comments and the awards. There are so many \n     here today that I'd like to thank personally, and many who \n     traveled great distances to get here like Ms. Connie Stevens \n     from LA and Johnny Counterfit and wife from Nashville, \n     Tennessee, and CSM Felix Acosta, a great soldier from \n     Bristol, Tennessee, old friends from Atlanta, Tampa, and \n     Fayettesville, North Carolina, the center of the universe, \n     and finally friends from NC State University.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, this ceremony marks the end of an \n     extraordinary journey: 38 years as a soldier in the service \n     of our country. Now 38 years may seem like an awfully long \n     time, and it is, but as I near the finish line, it feels like \n     I've been driving a powerful Corvette at high speed with time \n     and distance flying by. I can vividly recall the year 1963, \n     when Carolyn and I made the drive from Speed, North Carolina \n     to Fort Benning, Georgia, in the days following my \n     commissioning as a Second Lieutenant from NC State \n     University. Like all young men, I had many dreams and grand \n     thoughts, and also some trepidation about the future. Someone \n     asked me the other day if during those early days if I ever \n     imagined being here today. My response was I was too busy \n     doing my duty as a 2nd Lieutenant and wasn't even thinking \n     beyond 1st Lieutenant. If I had imagined it, it probably \n     would have scared me to death. But, what a truly incredible \n     journey this has been for a farm boy from North Carolina. \n     America is truly a great land of opportunity.\n       But I didn't make the trip alone. So today it's important \n     and necessary that I recognize and thank those who made that \n     journey possible. First, my parents, my mother Patsy is here \n     today, who shaped my character and instilled the values, \n     which have served me well, throughout the trip. My brothers, \n     David and Ben, and sister, Sarah, whose support was always \n     felt. And my wonderful wife, Carolyn, who has been with me \n     every step of the way through 27 moves, raising three \n     wonderful sons, Jon, Jeff, and Mark, and through countless \n     separations in times of war and peace. While I'm grateful to \n     God for many things in my life, none compares with the love \n     and pride that I feel with Carolyn by my side. Thank you for \n     joining me on every step of this journey. Carolyn. And, as I \n     reflect these past four years as Chairman, I fully realize \n     that Carolyn and I need to express our thanks to many of \n     you in the audience today.\n       I first need to thank the two Commanders-in-Chief for whom \n     I've had the honor and privilege of serving. President Bush \n     and President Clinton. I thank President Clinton for giving \n     me the opportunity of a lifetime only four short years ago to \n     serve as this Nation's 14th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\n       This assignment has indeed been the highlight of my career, \n     for the greatest honor that any military leader could ever \n     have is to represent America's soldiers, sailors, airmen, \n     marines, and quite often our coastguardsmen back here in \n     Washington. And for that I'll always be grateful. I also need \n     thank our current Commander-in-Chief, President Bush, for the \n     complete trust and confidence he has shown in me these past \n     nine months. Our nation is truly blessed to have President \n     Bush's strong leadership, integrity, and gritty resolve \n     during this difficult time.\n       I also need to thank the two great Secretaries for whom I \n     have worked during this tour of duty, Secretary Rumsfeld and \n     Secretary Cohen. And both, like me, married above their \n     ``raising'' with Janet Cohen and Joyce Rumsfeld. I thank \n     Secretary Cohen, for the chance he gave me to serve our \n     Nation in this capacity, and to Secretary Rumsfeld for the \n     opportunity to continue to serve and for your trust and \n     confidence. What I found fascinating about these two \n     gentlemen is not what makes them different, but rather what \n     makes them so similar, First, they are true patriots who \n     deeply love their country and all that it stands for. And \n     second, they both share many of the same attributes; strength \n     of character; vision; determination;and an unyielding desire \n     to build and maintain the finest Armed Forces in the world. \n     Thanks to both of you for your trust and confidence, your \n     personal sacrifices to serve our Nation, and for your \n     willingness to stand up for the right thing for our men and \n     women in uniform. Our Nation has been, and will continue to \n     be, blessed by your service.\n       I also need to recognize the extraordinary loyalty and \n     support of my two Vice Chairmen, General Joe Ralston and \n     Chairman Dick Myers. I'm proud of all that we've \n     accomplished. Joe and Dick, your wise counsel and unfailing \n     support made the difference, time and gain, as we confronted \n     a host of difficult challenges and I thank you. I will always \n     be indebted to you both. And Dick, I\n\n[[Page S9969]]\n\n     couldn't be more pleased that the President picked you as my \n     successor. You're a superb warrior, a visionary leader, a \n     true professional and a great friend. And I know that our men \n     and women in uniform are in good hands with you at the helm.\n       I would also like to give a heartfelt thanks to each of the \n     Service Chiefs here today, for your outstanding support, \n     advice, candor, and friendship, Ric, Vern, Jim Jones, John, \n     and Jim Loy. You, and the great group of Service Chiefs you \n     succeeded have redefined what selfless service, character, \n     and teamwork really means. I have watched with admiration \n     your effective stewardship of your respective Services, and, \n     it's largely a tribute to your efforts that our Armed Forces \n     are well trained, fully armed, and ready to fight and win. \n     You're an awesome team.\n       I also need to recognize our superb warfighting CINCs. Our \n     country has been blessed the past four years with a select \n     group of incredibly talented professionals charged with \n     leading our warfighting commands. And leading is precisely \n     what they have done. I want to thank each of you for your \n     continued service to country and for your devotion to the \n     men and women who defend our way of life.\n       And a big thanks to our Command Sergeant Majors and Senior \n     Enlisted Advisors here today, and the magnificent NCO Corps \n     you represent, the factor that truly is our greatest strength \n     as an Armed Force and always the reason behind our success. \n     And, finally, thanks to our great soldiers, sailors, airmen, \n     marines, and coastguardsmen--always at the point of the \n     spear, flying their aircraft, sailing their ships, and \n     patrolling their sectors far from home. They have never let \n     our Nation down and they never will. They stand ready for the \n     challenges ahead!\n       With my time on active duty fast drawing to a close, \n     Carolyn and I will soon finish packing our bags for one last \n     government move. Already packed away is a lifetime of \n     memories. I'll remember: Thousands of faces, both in peace \n     and war, comrades who fell beside me giving the ultimate \n     sacrifice and their families whose lives were changed \n     forever, the welcome tug of nylon straps as a parachute snaps \n     open, the pride of grasping a guidon or unit colors on a \n     parade ground and the thrill of seeing our red, white, and \n     blue flag unfurl in the morning breeze, the familiar feel of \n     a uniform carefully laid out each night for 38 years, the \n     call to vigilance as the last haunting note of taps rings out \n     in the night or is played in tribute to a fallen comrade, the \n     extraordinary privilege of leading troops, and finally, my \n     days spent with all of you during these past four years.\n       For those of you here in uniform, for the past 38 years, \n     I've served with you and many thousands of your predecessors, \n     in the central highlands of Vietnam, in the sands of Saudi \n     Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq, hitting the beach at Port-au-Prince, \n     and scores of major exercises preparing for war. I have no \n     doubt that you will stand proud, tall, and vigilant against \n     those who seek to destroy the enduring freedom we enjoy as \n     Americans.\n       Mr. Secretary, in my heart, I know that our Nation and our \n     Armed Forces are in good hands and I wish you and the \n     President all the best as you set a new course for our \n     country in the difficult and uncertain months ahead. In many \n     ways, I'm reminded of the time in the late 1930s when the \n     winds of war began to envelop Europe. Winston Churchill \n     observed at the time, ``Civilization will not last, freedom \n     will not survive, peace will not be kept unless a very large \n     majority of mankind unite together to defend them.''\n       Ladies and gentlemen, recently, evil and barbaric attacks \n     have been made against the United States and the citizens of \n     the world. Our President responded with a similar call to all \n     nations to join together in a combined campaign against \n     international terrorism. And in President Bush's recent \n     speech to the joint session of Congress, he ordered those of \n     us in uniform to ``be ready.'' Mr. Secretary, on this day as \n     I leave office, I'm proud to report to you that America's \n     military is ready!\n       Farewell my friends, my colleagues, and farewell to you, \n     our Nation's splendid Armed Forces. Carolyn and I shall miss \n     you all. As President Bush said recently, ``In all that lies \n     before us, May God grant us wisdom and may he watch over the \n     United States of America.'' Thank you and may God Bless.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I commend my distinguished colleague \nfrom North Carolina. I, too, want to associate myself with his remarks \non the distinguished career of General Shelton. In my 23 years in the \nSenate, I have worked with many chairmen and each has had his own \nstrengths. The strengths of this fine man were towering. He had a sense \nof humility and composure that was always with him. I never thought \nthat there was a time when he overreached. He was always calm, \ncollected, and confident and rendered magnificent service to two \nPresidents, which is unique. Above all, I remember when the Senate \nArmed Services Committee would have him come before it, most often with \nthe other chiefs, and, frankly, in a respectful way to the Commander in \nChief--at that time President Clinton--would properly say, I respect my \nCommander in Chief but we do not have sufficient funds in the budget \nfor the defense of this Nation to meet our needs. Then he would very \ncarefully lay out those requirements that he and his fellow chiefs \nsitting there before the committee--and indeed I think it was before \nthe Appropriations Committee--the Presiding Officer who recalls the \ntime that he appeared, and he laid down with clarity the needs of the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces in our defense, even though those \nfigures were at variance with the budgetary submissions by the \nPresident.\n  In the very simple, plain language that the foot soldier understands, \nthat man had guts.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield so I may add my compliments to the \nSenator from North Carolina for his remarks?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I join with the Senator from North Carolina in paying \ntribute to Hugh Shelton. I have also had the opportunity to work with \nhim, and I am a great admirer and fan of his. I also must join my good \nfriend from Virginia in saying that his appearances--and there were \nmany before our committee--would be the highlight of our committee's \nactivities. His briefings were always to the point and delivered with \nextraordinary modesty for somebody who had a right to really deliver \nthem with claims of experience, but he never used that. He just used \ncommon sense, calm, and wisdom. His authority came from inside, not \nkind of an outward claim to boast.\n  He was an extraordinary human being, and I just want to thank the \nSenator from North Carolina for his remarks. I join with him. I always \nremember that air campaign in Kosovo, of which he really was a leader. \nI think it was a magnificent success in good measure because of that \nleadership.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great \nNorth Carolinian, General Hugh Shelton.\n  Since 1997, General Shelton has served our nation well as the 14th \nchairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But the men and women stationed \nin my State benefitted from his leadership long before he was confirmed \nas Chairman.\n  Early in his career, General Shelton commanded the 1st Brigade of the \n82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, NC. In 1989, he began a two-year \nassignment as Assistant Division Commander for Operations of the 101st \nAirborne Division-Air Assault. That tour included a seven-month \ndeployment to Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert \nStorm. When he returned from the Gulf, he was promoted to major general \nand returned home to assume command of the 82nd Airborne Division \nstationed at Fort Bragg.\n  In 1997, the Senate confirmed his nomination to chairman, making him \nthe first Green Beret to command our military. The Senate reconfirmed \nhim in 1999.\n  For 38 years, General Shelton has served his country honorably. He \nhas received the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star Medal with V device \nas well as the Purple Heart. Among other honors, he also earned the \nMaster Parachutist Badge, the Air Assault Badge, the Combat Infantryman \nBadge and the Military Freefall Badge. And in a ceremony today at the \nPentagon, the general will receive his fourth Defense Distinguished \nService Medal.\n  He is a native of Tarborro and a graduate of North Carolina State \nUniversity. He and his wife Carolyn have three sons. The Sheltons' \nchildren have followed their father's example of service to the \ncountry--his son Jonathan is a special agent for the U.S. Secret \nService and his son Jeffrey is a U.S. Army Special Operations soldier.\n  These are uncertain and difficult times for our Nation. And, true to \nhis dedication as a soldier in the U.S. Army, General Shelton admitted \nto being reluctant about retiring now. In fact, last week, the general \nsaid ``I feel like the quarterback of a football team that went out on \nthe field and he's behind by one touchdown but he knows his team's \ngoing to come through and win. But you're in the first quarter and all \nof a sudden the coach sends a player out to tell you your eligibility \njust expired.''\n  But as General Shelton must surely know, his retirement does not end \nthe tremendous influence he has had on our military and the defense of \nthis nation. His work will live for years to come. I am so grateful to \ncall him my\n\n[[Page S9970]]\n\nfriend, and North Carolina is proud to call him our son.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/01/senate-section/article/S9970-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         U.S.-GERMANY RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I rise today to share a wonderful story \nillustrating the outpouring of support which the United States has \nreceived from friends and allies around the world in the days since the \nattacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11. I \nrecently joined Senate and House colleagues for a luncheon sponsored by \nthe Congressional Study Group on Germany. Former Congressman Larry La \nRocca, a Democrat from Idaho, hosted the luncheon to provide Members of \nCongress with an opportunity to meet the new German Ambassador, \nWolfgang Ischinger.\n  During Congressman La Rocca's introduction, he read an e-mail a close \nfriend of his received from his son serving in the U.S. Navy aboard the \nUSS Winston Churchill. The Congressman read the e-mail as a timely \nreminder of the close relationship between the United States and \nGermany. I found the story to be inspiring, and I wish to share it with \nmy colleagues and the American people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this e-mail be \ninserted into the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Message Home From an Ensign Stationed Aboard USS ``Winston Churchill''\n\n       Dear Dad: Well, we are still out at sea, with little \n     direction as to what our next priority is. The remainder of \n     our port visits, which were to be centered around max liberty \n     and goodwill to the United Kingdom, have all but been \n     canceled. We have spent every day since the attacks going \n     back and forth within imaginary boxes drawn in the ocean, \n     standing high-security watches, and trying to make the best \n     of our time. It hasn't been that much fun I must confess, and \n     to be even more honest, a lot of people are frustrated at the \n     fact that they either can't be home, or we don't have more \n     direction right now. We have seen the articles and the \n     photographs, and they are sickening. Being isolated as we \n     are, I don't think we appreciate the full scope of what is \n     happening back home, but we are definitely feeling the \n     effects.\n       About two hours ago the junior officers were called to the \n     bridge to conduct Shiphandling drills. We were about to do a \n     man overboard when we got a call from the Lutjens (D185), a \n     German warship that was moored ahead of us on the pier in \n     Plymouth, England. While in port, the Winston S Churchill and \n     the Lutjens got together for a sports day/cookout on our \n     fantail, and we made some pretty good friends.\n       Now at sea they called over on bridge-to-bridge, requesting \n     to pass us close up on our port side, to say goodbye. We \n     prepared to render them honors on the bridgewing, and the \n     Captain told the crew to come topside to wish them farewell. \n     As they were making their approach, our Conning Officer \n     announced through her binoculars that they were flying an \n     American flag. As they came even closer, we saw that it was \n     flying at half-mast.\n       The bridgewing was crowded with people as the Boatswain's \n     Mate blew two whistles--Attention to Port--the ship came up \n     alongside and we saw that the entire crew of the German ship \n     were manning the rails, in their dress blues. They made up a \n     sign that was displayed on the side that read ``We Stand By \n     You.''\n       Needless to say there was not a dry eye on the bridge as \n     they stayed alongside us for a few minutes and we cut our \n     salutes. It was probably the most powerful thing I have seen \n     in my entire life and more than a few of us fought to retain \n     our composure. It was a beautiful day outside today.\n       We are no longer at liberty to divulge over unsecure e-mail \n     our location, but we could not have asked for a finer day at \n     sea. The German Navy did an incredible thing for this crew, \n     and it has truly been the highest point in the days since the \n     attacks. It's amazing to think that only a half-century ago \n     things were quite different, and to see the unity that is \n     being demonstrated throughout Europe and the world makes us \n     all feel proud to be out here doing our job. After the ship \n     pulled away and we prepared to begin our man overboard drills \n     the Officer of the Deck turned to me and said ``I'm staying \n     Navy.'' I'll write you when I know more about when I'll be \n     home, but for now, this is probably the best news that I \n     could send you. Love you guys.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/01/senate-section/article/S9970-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nthis year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred January 7, \n2001 in Ashburn, GA. Robert Martin, 32, was hospitalized in critical \ncondition after being found lying outside an abandoned school with head \ninjuries from a blunt object. In early April, Martin died as a result \nof the injuries. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is investigating \nbut has no suspects. Press reports indicate that Martin had been beaten \nand harassed before because of his perceived homosexuality.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/01/senate-section/article/S9970-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE FROM NEW JERSEY\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, it is with deep pride and a certain \nhumility that I rise today to pay tribute to the women and men of New \nJersey who in the midst of very personal loss and deep sadness, \nresponded immediately to the rescue and recovery efforts that followed \nthe despicable attack on the World Trade Center.\n  In the face of risk and danger, courageous New Jerseyans stepped \nforward and brought a powerful message to the innocent victims and \ntheir desperate families: ``You are not alone.''\n  New Jersey firefighters, police, EMTs, technicians, nurses, doctors, \nconstruction workers and welders, worked tirelessly through day and \nnight. New Jersey residents came out in force to donate blood, \nsupplies, and resources. The open doors of New Jersey schools, places \nof worship, and homes welcomed the weary, the hungry, and the wounded.\n  All of this was done in the spirit of kindness and generosity, of \nselflessness and bravery that makes our nation the strongest in the \nworld.\n  That spirit motivated the undaunted and determined passengers of \nUnited Flight 93, many of whom were New Jerseyans, to take action \nagainst hijackers for the noblest cause, so others might live.\n  Now that same spirit carries through communities around New Jersey \nwhere families and friends, neighbors and strangers alike, gather to \nconsole one another in this time of grief and anguish. Let there be no \ndoubt, we are all in this together.\n  To the men and women of New Jersey who have reached out to others in \nthis time of unspeakable devastation, may the peace that you share be \nan example for all the world. Your heroic deeds will never be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/01/senate-section/article/S9970-4", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9970-S9971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           RECOGNITION OF THE CALVARY CHAPEL CHRISTIAN SCHOOL\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievements of the Calvary Chapel Christian School in Santa Fe, which \ntoday will be named a State Champion by the President's Council on \nPhysical Fitness and Sports. The Calvary Chapel Christian School was \nselected for this prestigious honor based on their students' \naccomplishments in the President's Challenge Physical Activity and \nFitness Awards Program. This program was originated by President Lyndon \nJohnson in 1966 and is especially important today given the increasing \nphysical inactivity among American youth.\n  Calvary Chapel Christian School had a remarkable number of students \nthat earned high scores on the President's Physical Fitness Challenge. \nThese students demonstrated their abilities in four different physical \nfitness tests that tested agility, flexibility, strength, and \nendurance. This achievement is all the more prestigious given what the \nPresident's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports labels an ``epidemic \nof physical inactivity'' among American youth. More than one-third of \nhigh school students do not participate in vigorous physical activity \non a regular basis. This epidemic has contributed to an increase in \nseveral medical problems, such as diabetes, obesity, and osteoporosis, \namong our children.\n\n[[Page S9971]]\n\n  Calvary Chapel Christian School can now serve as a role model for \nother schools in New Mexico and encourage them to emphasize the \nimportance of physical fitness to their students. I congratulate \nCalvary Chapel Christian School on this honor, and I hope that other \nschools will follow their fine example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/01/senate-section/article/S9971-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on October 1, 2001, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2510.

A bill to authorize the President to award a gold medal on \nbehalf of the Congress to Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr. \n(posthumously) and his widow Coretta Scott King in recognition of their \ncontributions to the Nation on behalf of the civil rights movement; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will award a gold medal on behalf of the Congress to Reverend \nDoctor Martin Luther King, Jr., posthumously, and his widow Coretta \nScott King in recognition of their contributions to the Nation on \nbehalf of the civil rights movement. It is time to honor Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr. and his widow Coretta Scott King, the first family of \nthe civil rights movement, for their distinguished records of public \nservice to the American people and the international community.\n  As one of the premier champions of basic human rights, Dr. King \nworked unselfishly to combat segregation, discrimination, and racial \ninjustice. In 1963, Dr. King led the March on Washington, D.C., that \nwas followed by his famous address, the ``I Have a Dream'' speech. \nThrough his work and reliance on nonviolent protest, Dr. King was \ninstrumental in the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965. Despite efforts to derail his mission, Dr. \nKing acted on his dream of America and succeeded in making the United \nStates a better place.\n  Mrs. Coretta Scott King, working alongside her husband, played an \nimportant role as a leading participant in the American civil rights \nmovement. Dr. and Mrs. King worked together to achieve nonviolent \nsocial change and full civil rights for African Americans. After the \nassassination of her husband, Mrs. King devoted her time and energy to \ndeveloping and building the Atlanta-based Martin Luther King, Jr. \nCenter for Nonviolent Social Change as an enduring memorial to her \nhusband's life and his dream of full civil rights for all Americans. \nMrs. King also led the massive campaign to establish Dr. King's \nbirthday as a national holiday which is now celebrated in more than 100 \ncountries around the world.\n  In recognition of the contributions made by Dr. and Mrs. King to the \ncivil rights movement and this Nation, Congress should honor these two \noutstanding individuals by enacting legislation that would authorize \nthe President to award a gold medal on their behalf. Now is the time to \nhonor two of this Nation's greatest public figures, the late Reverend \nDoctor Martin Luther King, Jr. and his widow, Coretta Scott King.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1476\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to improve the \ntreatment of certain animals, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Puppy \nProtection Act of 2001. Introduction of this legislation comes as a \ncontinuation of my interest in the protection and humane treatment of \nanimals, specifically, dogs and puppies. In short, the Puppy Protection \nAct will crack down on breeders who are negligent in their \nresponsibilities of breeding dogs in a healthy and humane environment, \nalready required by law.\n  Across the United States, there are more than 3,000 commercial dog \nbreeding facilities that are licensed to operate by the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture. Owners of these facilities are required to \ncomply with the rules and regulations of the Animal Welfare Act, AWA, \nwhich sets forth standards for humane handling and treatment. \nInspection, to ensure compliance with AWA standards, is performed by \nthe USDA.\n  The shortcomings of this system, however, have been: One, inadequate \nresources to perform timely and routine inspections, and two, too few \ntools to assess the proper care and handling of dogs in federally-\nlicensed kennels. My interest and action over the course of several \nyears speaks to both issues.\n  Earlier this year, I spearheaded an effort with my Senate colleagues \nto increase the appropriation for USDA to enforce the AWA. One problem \nhas been too few resources, approximately 80 inspectors, to inspect \nnearly 10,000 USDA federally-licensed facilities. Adequate resources \nfor inspection will go a long way in ensuring strong enforcement.\n  Introduction of the Puppy Protection Act addresses the second concern \nof too few tools to assess the proper care and treatment of animals in \ncommercial breeding facilities. Let me be clear, there are many \nresponsible breeders throughout the United States who exercise \nappropriate care and judgment in their breeding practices. This bill is \nnot intended to be punitive to those breeders. This bill will, however, \ncrack down on facilities where even the most basic of needs required by \nlaw are not being met.\n  The term ``puppy mill'' is not new to many people, be it pet owners; \nconsumers; animal welfare advocates; inspectors; or just a casual \nobserver. Puppy mills are considered to be large breeding operations \nthat mass produce puppies for commercial sale with little regard for \nthe humane handling and treatment of the dogs. Breeding and raising \ndogs without respect to the animal's welfare guarantees bad results for \nthe unwitting owner, and for the health of the dog and her puppies.\n  For dogs, puppy mill conditions can mean overcrowded cages; lack of \nprotection from weather conditions; overbreeding; lack of veterinary \ncare; and lack of interaction with humans at early stages. What this \ncould mean for the consumer is caring for a pet with developmental \nproblems, such as aggressive behavior or anxiety, and various physical \ndifficulties that require extensive and costly medical attention.\n  My interest and involvement in this matter stem from the regrettable \ncircumstance of Pennsylvania being home to many large scale commercial \nbreeding facilities operating like puppy mills. On a State level, \nPennsylvania has been active, and has made gains in the area of public \nawareness and education, and stronger enforcement through increased \ninspection. What the Puppy Protection Act focuses on is the role of \nFederal inspectors, and the tools they have to enforce the Animal \nWelfare Act.\n  Specifically, this bill will make the following important changes: \nOne, creates a ``three strikes and you're out'' enforcement policy for \nanimal welfare violations, such as a lack of food or water or basic \nveterinary care; two, addresses the need for breeding females to be \ngiven time to recover between litters since currently there are no \nprotections against over-breeding, which causes physical hardship for \nfemales and may compromise the health of puppies; and three, requires \nthat new puppies have adequate interation with other dogs and with \npeople, enhancing their well-being and helping to minimize behavioral \nproblems faced by pet owners. I believe these changes will go a long \nway in cracking down on negligent and irresponsible breeding activities \nthat have long-lasting impacts for owners and their pets alike.\n  I am pleased to have Senator Durbin join me in introducing this \nimportant bill. I ask unanimous consent to have the list of some 827 \norganizations nationwide who support this bill printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Endorsement List for Puppy Protection Act\n\n                  (827 Endorsements--Updated 10/01/01)\n\n\n                                 ALASKA\n\n     Anchorage Animal Control (AK)\n     Gastineau Humane Society (Juneau, AK)\n     Sitka Animal Shelter (Sitka, AK)\n\n\n                                ALABAMA\n\n     The Animal Shelter (Anniston, AL)\n     Barbour County Humane Society Inc.

A bill to require procedures that ensure the fair and \nequitable resolution of labor integration issues in transactions for \nthe combination of air carriers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today to introduce a bill that is \nvery important for many employees of the airline industry in my State \nof Missouri and elsewhere across the country. The legislation is \nentitled ``The Airline Workers Fairness Act.''\n  I have previously written to the distinguished Presiding Officer and \nthe ranking member to explain to them the reason for this concern; that \nis, the fact that for the good of the country, the airline industry, \nand the traveling public, American Airlines acquired the assets of TWA. \nThis was a good measure for continuation of airline service, for the \nemployees, and for the communities served.\n  Now, however, as a result of the outrageous terrorist attacks on \nSeptember 11, airlines across the country have found a significant \ndecrease in volume.\n  I believe there is no safer time to fly the airlines than now. We go \nthrough a little more security. I am delighted to do it. I believe that \nwe are safe on airline travel, certainly safer than we were before \nSeptember 11. I believe it is an outstanding time to fly. But many \npeople, because of legitimate concerns for themselves and their \nfamilies, are not flying. So there are layoffs going on throughout the \nairline industry.\n  What this bill seeks to do is to ensure that after the two companies, \nAmerican Airlines and TWA, and TWA Express, are merged, after the first \nof the year, that the employees of both merged airlines will be treated \nfairly.\n  Obviously, everybody understands with a decrease in airline traffic, \nthere is going to be a need for layoffs. We have seen those layoffs. We \nhope, we fervently pray, that we can get back to business in the United \nStates and get people flying again so they will use this valuable \nresource and get these people back to work.\n  I have talked to an awful lot of people at TWA who realize they will \nbe a much smaller percentage of the total workforce than the larger \nnumbers of American Airlines employees. They have sought to find a way \nto make sure that these two airlines are combined in a fair and \nreasonable manner. They looked at the Allegheny-Mohawk approach that \nwas applied by the Civil Aeronautics Board when those two airlines were \ncombined, and the transactions in that were performed in a way to \nencourage negotiation, mediation, and ultimately resolution of \nseniority integration issues by a neutral third party arbitrator \nselected by the parties.\n  The purpose of this is to ensure that there is a fair and reasonable \nbasis for resolving the seniority issues facing these employees.\n  Several people have accused me of having some formula that I want to \nsee adopted, having decided in advance how this should proceed. I don't \nknow enough about seniority practices of either of the airlines to try \nto propose a solution. But when you have both parties coming together, \nseeking an arbitration panel or arbitrator who is knowledgeable and who \nwill hear presentations from both sides, we can make sure that American \nAirlines employees and TWA employees are all treated in a fair and \nreasonable manner.\n  I am very pleased to say we have had strong support from the Airline \nPilots Association, the International Association of Machinists, the \nTeamsters, and the AFL-CIO. Nobody knows how these issues will be \nresolved, but an awful lot of people are counting on us to make sure \nthey are resolved in a fair and reasonable manner, giving both sides an \nopportunity to be heard and to have an arbitrator propose a final \ndecision.\n  I look forward to working with the occupant of the chair and others \nas we move forward on this very important matter. I thank my colleagues \nfor their kind attention. I ask that if they wish to join me in this \nbill, please do so. It is important that we act on this measure this \nyear. I will be happy to respond to inquiries and work with colleagues \nwho have thoughts on how we can improve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/01/senate-section/article/S9980-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9980-S9981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 164--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 19, 2001, AS ``NATIONAL \n                           MAMMOGRAPHY DAY''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Allen, Mr. Bayh, \nMr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \nCampbell, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Carper, Mr. Cleland, Mrs. \nClinton, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Conrad, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Domenici, \nMr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Fitzgerald, \nMr. Frist, Mr. Graham, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Hatch, \nMr. Helms, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Hutchinson, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, \nMr. Jeffords, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nLeahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Mikulski, \nMr. Miller, Mr. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. \nReid, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \nSpecter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, and \nMr. Wellstone) submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                              S.

Madam President, today I am submitting a resolution \ndesignating October 19, 2001, as ``National Mammography Day.'' I am \npleased that 62 of my colleagues have endorsed this proposal by \nagreeing to be original cosponsors. I might note that I have submitted \na similar resolution each year since 1993, and on each occasion the \nSenate has shown its support for the fight against breast cancer by \napproving the resolution.\n  Each year, as I prepare to submit this resolution, I review the \nlatest information from the American Cancer Society about breast \ncancer. For the year 2001, it is estimated that over 192,000 women will \nbe diagnosed with breast cancer and slightly fewer than 41,000 women \nwill die of this disease.\n  In past years, I have often commented on how gloomy these statistics \nwere. But as I review how these numbers are changing over time, I have \ncome to the realization that it is really more appropriate to be upbeat \nabout this situation. The number of deaths from breast cancer is \nfalling from year to year. Early detection of breast cancer continues \nto result in extremely favorable outcomes: 97 percent of women with \nlocalized breast cancer will survive 5 years or longer. New digital \ntechniques make the process of mammography much more rapid and precise \nthan before. Government programs will provide free mammograms to those \nwho can't afford them, as well as Medicaid eligibility for treatment if \nbreast cancer is diagnosed. Information about treatment of breast \ncancer with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy has exploded, \nreflecting enormous research advances in this disease.\n  So I am feeling quite positive about our battle against breast \ncancer. A diagnosis of breast cancer is not a death sentence, and I \nencounter long-term survivors of breast cancer nearly daily. And the \nkey to this success is early diagnosis and treatment, with routine \nperiodic mammography being the linchpin of the entire process. Routine \nmammography can locate a breast cancer as much as 2 years before it \nwould be detectable by self-examination. A study released just this \nyear showed that periodic screening mammography reduces breast cancer \nmortality by a whopping 63 percent. The statistics tell the story: the \nnumber of breast cancer deaths is declining despite an increase in the \nnumber of breast cancer cases diagnosed. More women are getting \nmammograms, more breast cancer is being diagnosed, and more of these \nbreast cancers are discovered at an early and highly curable stage.\n  So my message to women is: have a periodic mammogram. Earl diagnosis \nsaves lives. But I know many women don't have annual mammograms, \nusually because of either fear or forgetfulness. Some women avoid \nmammograms because they are afraid of what they will find. To these \nwomen, I would say that if you have periodic routine mammograms, and \nthe latest one comes out positive, even before you have any symptoms or \nhave found a lump on self-examination, you have reason to be \noptimistic, not pessimistic. Such early-detected breast cancers are \nhighly treatable.\n  Let me consider an analogous situation. We know that high blood \npressure is a killer, and we are all advised to get our blood pressure \nchecked from time to time. Are we afraid to do this? No. Why not? \nBecause we know that even if high blood pressure is detected on a \nscreening examination, it can be readily and successfully treated. We \nalso know that high blood pressure is not going to go away by itself, \nso if we have it, we should find out about it, get it treated, and move \nahead with our lives.\n  The argument for having periodic routine mammograms to detect breast \ncancer is similar. Most of the time, the examination is reassuringly \nnegative. But if it is positive, and your previous routine mammograms \nwere negative, it meant that this cancer has been detected early on, \nwhen it has a high chance of being cured.\n  And then there is forgetfulness. I certainly understand how difficult \nit is to remember to do something that only comes around once each \nyear. I would suggest that this is where ``National Mammography Day'' \ncomes in. This year, National Mammography Day falls on Friday, October \n19, right in the middle of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. On \nthat day, let's make sure that each woman we know picks a specific date \non which to get a mammogram each year, a date that she won't forget: a \nchild's birthday, an anniversary, perhaps even the day her taxes are \ndue. On National Mammography Day, let's ask our loved ones: pick one of \nthese dates, fix it in your mind along with a picture of your child, \nyour wedding, or another symbol of that date, and promise yourself to \nget a mammogram on that date every year. Do it for yourself and for the \nothers that love you and want you to be a part of their lives for as \nlong as possible.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in the ongoing fight against breast \ncancer by cosponsoring and voting for this resolution to designate \nOctober 19, 2001, as National Mammography Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/01/senate-section/article/S9981-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9981-S9983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1726.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``American Armed Forces \n     Protection Act 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 1402. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 17, 1998, the United Nations Diplomatic \n     Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an \n     International Criminal Court, meeting in Rome, Italy, adopted \n     the ``Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court''. The \n     vote on whether to proceed with the Statute was 120 in favor \n     to 7 against, with 21 countries abstaining. The United States \n     voted against final adoption of the Rome Statute.\n       (2) As of September 15, 2001, 139 countries had signed the \n     Rome Statute and 38 had ratified it. Pursuant to Article 126 \n     of the Rome Statute, the Statute will enter into force on the \n     first day of the month after the 60th day following the date \n     on which the 60th country deposits an instrument ratifying \n     the Statute.\n       (3) Since adoption of the Rome Statute, a Preparatory \n     Commission for the International Criminal Court has met \n     regularly to draft documents to implement the Rome Statute, \n     including Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Elements of \n     Crimes, and a definition of the Crime of Aggression.\n       (4) During testimony before the Congress following the \n     adoption of the Rome Statute, the lead United States \n     negotiator, Ambassador David Scheffer stated that the United \n     States could not sign the Rome Statute because certain \n     critical negotiating objectives of the United States had not \n     been achieved. As a result, he stated: ``We are left with \n     consequences that do not serve the cause of international \n     justice.''.\n       (5) Ambassador Scheffer went on to tell the Congress that: \n     ``Multinational peacekeeping forces operating in a country \n     that has joined the treaty can be exposed to the Court's \n     jurisdiction even if the country of the individual \n     peacekeeper has not joined the treaty. Thus, the treaty \n     purports to establish an arrangement whereby United States \n     armed forces operating overseas could be conceivably \n     prosecuted by the international court even if the United \n     States has not agreed to be bound by the treaty. Not only is \n     this contrary to the most fundamental principles of treaty \n     law, it could inhibit the ability of the United States to use \n     its military to meet alliance obligations and participate in \n     multinational operations, including humanitarian \n     interventions to save civilian lives. Other contributors to \n     peacekeeping operations will be similarly exposed.''\n       (6) Notwithstanding these concerns, President Clinton \n     directed that the United States sign the Rome Statute on \n     December 31, 2000. In a statement issued that day, he stated \n     that in view of the unremedied deficiencies of the Rome \n     Statute, ``I will not, and do not recommend that my successor \n     submit the Treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until \n     our fundamental concerns are satisfied''.\n       (7) Any American prosecuted by the International Criminal \n     Court will, under the Rome Statute, be denied procedural \n     protections to which all Americans are entitled under the \n     Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution, such as the \n     right to trial by jury.\n       (8) Members of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     deserve the full protection of the United States Constitution \n     wherever they are stationed or deployed around the world to \n     protect the vital national interests of the United States. \n     The United States Government has an obligation to protect the \n     members of its Armed Forces, to the maximum extent possible, \n     against criminal prosecutions carried out by United Nations \n     officials under procedures that deny them their \n     constitutional rights.\n       (9) In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States to the risk of international criminal \n     prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the \n     President and other senior elected and appointed officials of \n     the United States Government may be prosecuted by the \n     International Criminal Court. Particularly if the\n\n[[Page S9999]]\n\n     Preparatory Commission agrees on a definition of the Crime of \n     Aggression over United States objections, senior United \n     States officials may be at risk of criminal prosecution for \n     national security decisions involving such matters as \n     responding to acts of terrorism, preventing the proliferation \n     of weapons of mass destruction, and deterring aggression. No \n     less than members of the Armed Forces of the United States, \n     senior officials of the United States Government deserve the \n     full protection of the United States Constitution with \n     respect to official actions taken by them to protect the \n     national interests of the United States.\n       (10) The claimed jurisdiction of the International Criminal \n     Court over citizens of a country that is not a state party to \n     the Rome Statute is a direct contravention of the sovereign \n     equality of all member states under Article 2 of the Charter \n     of the United Nations, and is a threat to the sovereignty of \n     the United States under the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n       (b) Policy of the United States Regarding the Rome \n     Statute.--\n       (1) Policy.--\n       (A) Intention to remain outside the statute.--It is the \n     policy of the United States that the United States will not \n     become a state party to the Rome Statute.\n       (B) Finding regarding the legal status of the international \n     criminal court and the preparatory commission.--Because the \n     United States has not ratified the Rome Statute as a treaty \n     under Article II, Section 2, Clause 2, of the Constitution of \n     the United States, Congress finds the International Criminal \n     Court and the Preparatory Commission are not judicial bodies \n     or instruments of international law with respect to the \n     United States or to citizens of the United States.\n       (2) Diplomatic communication of policy.--\n       (A) Transmittal of intent to the united nations.--It is the \n     sense of Congress that the President should provide written \n     notification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations \n     of the policy contained in paragraph (1).\n       (B) Instructions to united states representatives.--It is \n     the sense of Congress that the President should instruct all \n     representatives of the United States in any international \n     forum or setting, including any forum regarding the \n     availability of funds, to put forward, as United States \n     policy regarding the International Criminal Court and the \n     Preparatory Commission, the policy contained in paragraph \n     (1).\n\n     SEC. 1403. WAIVER AND TERMINATION OF PROHIBITIONS OF THIS \n                   ACT.\n\n       (a) Authority To Initially Waive Sections  1405 and 1407.--\n     The President is authorized to waive the prohibitions and \n     requirements of sections 1405 and 1407 for a single period of \n     one year. Such a waiver may be issued only if the President \n     at least 15 days in advance of exercising such authority--\n       (1) notifies the appropriate congressional committees of \n     the intention to exercise such authority; and\n       (2) determines and reports to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that the International Criminal Court has entered \n     into a binding agreement that--\n       (A) prohibits the International Criminal Court from seeking \n     to exercise jurisdiction over the following persons with \n     respect to actions undertaken by them in an official \n     capacity:\n       (i) covered United States persons;\n       (ii) covered allied persons; and\n       (iii) individuals who were covered United States persons or \n     covered allied persons; and\n       (B) ensures that no person described in subparagraph (A) \n     will be arrested, detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned by or \n     on behalf of the International Criminal Court.\n       (b) Authority To Extend Waiver of Sections  1405 and \n     1407.--The President is authorized to waive the prohibitions \n     and requirements of sections 1405 and 1407 for successive \n     periods of one year each upon the expiration of a previous \n     waiver pursuant to subsection (a) or this subsection. Such a \n     waiver may be issued only if the President at least fifteen \n     days in advance of exercising such authority--\n       (1) notifies the appropriate congressional committees of \n     the intention to exercise such authority; and\n       (2) determines and reports to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that the International Criminal Court--\n       (A) remains party to, and has continued to abide by, a \n     binding agreement that--\n       (i) prohibits the International Criminal Court from seeking \n     to exercise jurisdiction over the following persons with \n     respect to actions undertaken by them in an official \n     capacity:\n\n       (I) covered United States persons;\n       (II) covered allied persons; and\n       (III) individuals who were covered United States persons or \n     covered allied persons; and\n\n       (ii) ensures that no person described in clause (i) will be \n     arrested, detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned by or on behalf \n     of the International Criminal Court; and\n       (B) has taken no steps to arrest, detain, prosecute, or \n     imprison any person described in clause (i) of subparagraph \n     (A).\n       (c) Authority To Waive Sections 1405 and 1407 With Respect \n     to an Investigation or Prosecution of a Named Individual.--\n     The President is authorized to waive the prohibitions and \n     requirements of sections 1404 and 1406 to the degree they \n     would prevent United States cooperation with an investigation \n     or prosecution of a named individual by the International \n     Criminal Court. Such a waiver may be issued only if the \n     President at least 15 days in advance of exercising such \n     authority--\n       (1) notifies the appropriate congressional committees of \n     the intention to exercise such authority; and\n       (2) determines and reports to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that--\n       (A) a waiver pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of the \n     prohibitions and requirements of sections 1405 and 1407 is in \n     effect;\n       (B) there is reason to believe that the named individual \n     committed the crime or crimes that are the subject of the \n     International Criminal Court's investigation or prosecution;\n       (C) it is in the national interest of the United States for \n     the International Criminal Court's investigation or \n     prosecution of the named individual to proceed; and\n       (D) in investigating events related to actions by the named \n     individual, none of the following persons will be \n     investigated, arrested, detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned \n     by or on behalf of the International Criminal Court with \n     respect to actions undertaken by them in an official \n     capacity:\n       (i) Covered United States persons.\n       (ii) Covered allied persons.\n       (iii) Individuals who were covered United States persons or \n     covered allied persons.\n       (d) Termination of Waiver Pursuant to Subsection (c).--Any \n     waiver or waivers exercised pursuant to subsection (c) of the \n     prohibitions and requirements of sections 1404 and 1406 shall \n     terminate at any time that a waiver pursuant to subsection \n     (a) or (b) of the prohibitions and requirements of sections \n     1405 and 1407 expires and is not extended pursuant to \n     subsection (b).\n\n     SEC. 1404.

Some workers worked at both \n     the Atomic Energy Commission facility and the Army plant.\n       (3) The policy of the Department of Defense to neither \n     confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons at any site \n     has prevented the Department from acknowledging the reason \n     for some exposures of workers to radioactive or other \n     hazardous substances at Department facilities, and secrecy \n     oaths have discouraged some workers from discussing possible \n     exposure to such substances at such facilities with their \n     health care providers and other officials.\n       (4) The Department of Energy has publicly acknowledged that \n     nuclear weapons were manufactured and dismantled at the IAAP \n     before the plant was closed more than 25 years ago.\n       (5) In the past, the Department of Defense has publicly \n     acknowledged that the United States had nuclear weapons in \n     Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, Johnston Island, Midway \n     Islands, the United Kingdom, West Germany, and Cuba, but has \n     denied having weapons in Iceland.\n       (6) The Department of the Army in 1999 requested permission \n     to release the names of Army installations that were former \n     nuclear weapons storage sites, and to release information \n     about such sites, but such permission was not granted.\n       (7) Section 1078 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (as enacted by Public \n     Law 106-398; 114 Stat. 1654A-282) requires the Secretary of \n     Defense--\n       (A) to review Department of Defense classification and \n     security policies;\n       (B) to identify and notify former employees of defense \n     nuclear weapons facilities who may have been exposed to \n     radioactive or hazardous substances associated with nuclear \n     weapons at such facilities; and\n       (C) to submit to Congress a report on such actions by May \n     1, 2001.\n       (8) It is critical to maintain national secrets regarding \n     nuclear weapons, but more openness on nuclear weapons \n     activities now consigned to history is needed to protect the \n     health of former workers at defense nuclear weapons \n     production facilities and the public.\n       (b) Modification of General Requirements.--Section 1078(b) \n     of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2001 (as enacted by Public Law 106-398; 114 Stat. \n     1654A-283) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``, or its contractors \n     or subcontractors,'' after ``Department of Defense''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (3), by striking ``stored, assembled, \n     disassembled, or maintained'' and inserting ``manufactured, \n     assembled, or disassembled''.\n       (c) Determination of Exposures at IAAP.--The Secretary of \n     Defense shall take appropriate actions to determine the \n     nature and extent of the exposure of current and former \n     employees at the Army facility at the Iowa Army Ammunition \n     Plant, Iowa, including contractor and subcontractor employees \n     at the facility, to radioactive or other hazardous substances \n     at the facility, including possible pathways for the exposure \n     of such employees to such substances.\n       (d) Notification of Employees Regarding Exposure.--(1) The \n     Secretary shall take appropriate actions to--\n       (A) identify current and former employees at the facility \n     referred to in subsection (c), including contractor and \n     subcontractor employees at the facility; and\n       (B) notify such employees of known or possible exposures to \n     radioactive or other hazardous substances at the facility.\n       (2) Notice under paragraph (1)(B) shall include--\n       (A) information on the discussion of exposures covered by \n     such notice with health care providers and other appropriate \n     persons who do not hold a security clearance; and\n       (B) if necessary, appropriate guidance on contacting health \n     care providers and officials involved with cleanup of the \n     facility who hold an appropriate security clearance.\n       (3) Notice under paragraph (1)(B) shall be by mail or other \n     appropriate means, as determined by the Secretary.\n       (e) Deadline for Actions.--The Secretary shall complete the \n     actions required by subsections (c) and (d) not later than 60 \n     days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (f) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives a report setting forth the results of the \n     actions undertaken by the Secretary under this section, \n     including any determinations under subsection (c), the number \n     of workers identified under subsection (d)(1)(A), the content \n     of the notice to such workers under subsection (d)(1)(B), and \n     the status of progress on the provision of the notice to such \n     workers under subsection (d)(1)(B).\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 1771.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n       (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and their employees to reach and maintain \n     agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and working \n     conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts through \n     negotiations to settle their differences by mutual agreement \n     reached through collective bargaining or by such methods as \n     may be provided for in any applicable agreement for the \n     settlement of disputes.\n       (3) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent \n     industrial strife between labor and management that \n     interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n\n     SEC. ____03.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``American Servicemembers' \n     Protection Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 1402. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 17, 1998, the United Nations Diplomatic \n     Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an \n     International Criminal Court, meeting in Rome, Italy,\n\n[[Page S10014]]\n\n     adopted the ``Rome Statute of the International Criminal \n     Court''. The vote on whether to proceed with the statute was \n     120 in favor to 7 against, with 21 countries abstaining. The \n     United States voted against final adoption of the Rome \n     Statute.\n       (2) As of April 30, 2001, 139 countries had signed the Rome \n     Statute and 30 had ratified it. Pursuant to Article 126 of \n     the Rome Statute, the statute will enter into force on the \n     first day of the month after the 60th day following the date \n     on which the 60th country deposits an instrument ratifying \n     the statute.\n       (3) Since adoption of the Rome Statute, a Preparatory \n     Commission for the International Criminal Court has met \n     regularly to draft documents to implement the Rome Statute, \n     including Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Elements of \n     Crimes, and a definition of the Crime of Aggression.\n       (4) During testimony before the Congress following the \n     adoption of the Rome Statute, the lead United States \n     negotiator, Ambassador David Scheffer stated that the United \n     States could not sign the Rome Statute because certain \n     critical negotiating objectives of the United States had not \n     been achieved. As a result, he stated: ``We are left with \n     consequences that do not serve the cause of international \n     justice.''\n       (5) Ambassador Scheffer went on to tell the Congress that: \n     ``Multinational peacekeeping forces operating in a country \n     that has joined the treaty can be exposed to the Court's \n     jurisdiction even if the country of the individual \n     peacekeeper has not joined the treaty. Thus, the treaty \n     purports to establish an arrangement whereby United States \n     armed forces operating overseas could be conceivably \n     prosecuted by the international court even if the United \n     States has not agreed to be bound by the treaty. Not only is \n     this contrary to the most fundamental principles of treaty \n     law, it could inhibit the ability of the United States to use \n     its military to meet alliance obligations and participate in \n     multinational operations, including humanitarian \n     interventions to save civilian lives. Other contributors to \n     peacekeeping operations will be similarly exposed.''.\n       (6) Notwithstanding these concerns, President Clinton \n     directed that the United States sign the Rome Statute on \n     December 31, 2000. In a statement issued that day, he stated \n     that in view of the unremedied deficiencies of the Rome \n     Statute, ``I will not, and do not recommend that my successor \n     submit the Treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until \n     our fundamental concerns are satisfied''.\n       (7) Any American prosecuted by the International Criminal \n     Court will, under the Rome Statute, be denied procedural \n     protections to which all Americans are entitled under the \n     Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution, such as the \n     right to trial by jury.\n       (8) Members of the Armed Forces of the United States should \n     be free from the risk of prosecution by the International \n     Criminal Court, especially when they are stationed or \n     deployed around the world to protect the vital national \n     interests of the United States. The United States Government \n     has an obligation to protect the members of its Armed Forces, \n     to the maximum extent possible, against criminal prosecutions \n     carried out by the International Criminal Court.\n       (9) In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States to the risk of international criminal \n     prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the \n     President and other senior elected and appointed officials of \n     the United States Government may be prosecuted by the \n     International Criminal Court. Particularly if the Preparatory \n     Commission agrees on a definition of the Crime of Aggression \n     over United States objections, senior United States officials \n     may be at risk of criminal prosecution for national security \n     decisions involving such matters as responding to acts of \n     terrorism, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, and deterring aggression. No less than members \n     of the Armed Forces of the United States, senior officials of \n     the United States Government should be free from the risk of \n     prosecution by the International Criminal Court, especially \n     with respect to official actions taken by them to protect the \n     national interests of the United States.\n       (10) Any agreement within the Preparatory Commission on a \n     definition of the Crime of Aggression that usurps the \n     prerogative of the United Nations Security Council under \n     Article 39 of the charter of the United Nations to \n     ``determine the existence of any . . . . act of aggression'' \n     would contravene the charter of the United Nations and \n     undermine deterrence.\n       (11) It is a fundamental principle of international law \n     that a treaty is binding upon its parties only and that it \n     does not create obligations for nonparties without their \n     consent to be bound. The United States is not a party to the \n     Rome Statute and will not be bound by any of its terms. The \n     United States will not recognize the jurisdiction of the \n     International Criminal Court over United States nationals.\n\n     SEC. 1403. WAIVER AND TERMINATION OF PROHIBITIONS OF THIS \n                   TITLE.\n\n       (a) Authority To Initially Waive Sections 1405 and 1407.--\n     The President is authorized to waive the prohibitions and \n     requirements of sections 1405 and 1407 for a single period of \n     one year. A waiver under this subsection may be issued only \n     if the President at least 15 days in advance of exercising \n     such authority--\n       (1) notifies the appropriate congressional committees of \n     the intention to exercise such authority; and\n       (2) determines and reports to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that the International Criminal Court has entered \n     into a binding agreement that--\n       (A) prohibits the International Criminal Court from seeking \n     to exercise jurisdiction over the following persons with \n     respect to actions undertaken by them in an official \n     capacity:\n       (i) covered United States persons;\n       (ii) covered allied persons; and\n       (iii) individuals who were covered United States persons or \n     covered allied persons; and\n       (B) ensures that no person described in subparagraph (A) \n     will be arrested, detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned by or \n     on behalf of the International Criminal Court.\n       (b) Authority To Extend Waiver of Sections 1405 and 1407.--\n     The President is authorized to waive the prohibitions and \n     requirements of sections 1405 and 1407 for successive periods \n     of one year each upon the expiration of a previous waiver \n     pursuant to subsection (a) or this subsection. A waiver under \n     this subsection may be issued only if the President at least \n     fifteen days in advance of exercising such authority--\n       (1) notifies the appropriate congressional committees of \n     the intention to exercise such authority; and\n       (2) determines and reports to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that the International Criminal Court--\n       (A) remains party to, and has continued to abide by, a \n     binding agreement that--\n       (i) prohibits the International Criminal Court from seeking \n     to exercise jurisdiction over the following persons with \n     respect to actions undertaken by them in an official \n     capacity:\n\n       (I) covered United States persons;\n       (II) covered allied persons; and\n       (III) individuals who were covered United States persons or \n     covered allied persons; and\n\n       (ii) ensures that no person described in clause (i) will be \n     arrested, detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned by or on behalf \n     of the International Criminal Court; and\n       (B) has taken no steps to arrest, detain, prosecute, or \n     imprison any person described in clause (i) of subparagraph \n     (A).\n       (c) Authority To Waive Sections 1404 and 1406 With Respect \n     to an Investigation or Prosecution of a Named Individual.--\n     The President is authorized to waive the prohibitions and \n     requirements of sections 1404 and 1406 to the degree such \n     prohibitions and requirements would prevent United States \n     cooperation with an investigation or prosecution of a named \n     individual by the International Criminal Court. A waiver \n     under this subsection may be issued only if the President at \n     least 15 days in advance of exercising such authority--\n       (1) notifies the appropriate congressional committees of \n     the intention to exercise such authority; and\n       (2) determines and reports to the appropriate congressional \n     committees that--\n       (A) a waiver pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of the \n     prohibitions and requirements of sections 1405 and 1407 is in \n     effect;\n       (B) there is reason to believe that the named individual \n     committed the crime or crimes that are the subject of the \n     International Criminal Court's investigation or prosecution;\n       (C) it is in the national interest of the United States for \n     the International Criminal Court's investigation or \n     prosecution of the named individual to proceed; and\n       (D) in investigating events related to actions by the named \n     individual, none of the following persons will be \n     investigated, arrested, detained, prosecuted, or imprisoned \n     by or on behalf of the International Criminal Court with \n     respect to actions undertaken by them in an official \n     capacity:\n       (i) Covered United States persons.\n       (ii) Covered allied persons.\n       (iii) Individuals who were covered United States persons or \n     covered allied persons.\n       (d) Termination of Waiver Pursuant to Subsection (c).--Any \n     waiver or waivers exercised pursuant to subsection (c) of the \n     prohibitions and requirements of sections 1404 and 1406 shall \n     terminate at any time that a waiver pursuant to subsection \n     (a) or (b) of the prohibitions and requirements of sections \n     1405 and 1407 expires and is not extended pursuant to \n     subsection (b).\n       (e) Termination of Prohibitions of This Title.--The \n     prohibitions and requirements of sections 1404, 1405, 1406, \n     and 1407 shall cease to apply, and the authority of section \n     1408 shall terminate, if the United States becomes a party to \n     the International Criminal Court pursuant to a treaty made \n     under article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1404.

Mr. KENNEDY submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 1438, to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n2002 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstructions,\n\n[[Page S10017]]\n\nand for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \npersonnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for \nother purposes; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n         TITLE ____PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION\n\n     SEC. ____01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n       (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and their employees to reach and maintain \n     agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and working \n     conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts through \n     negotiations to settle their differences by mutual agreement \n     reached through collective bargaining or by such methods as \n     may be provided for in any applicable agreement for the \n     settlement of disputes.\n       (3) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent \n     industrial strife between labor and management that \n     interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n\n     SEC. ____03. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Authority.--The term ``Authority'' means the Federal \n     Labor Relations Authority.\n       (2) Emergency medical services personnel.--The term \n     ``emergency medical services personnel'' means an individual \n     who provides out-of-hospital emergency medical care, \n     including an emergency medical technician, paramedic, or \n     first responder.\n       (3) Employer; public safety agency.--The terms ``employer'' \n     and ``public safety agency'' mean any State, political \n     subdivision of a State, the District of Columbia, or any \n     territory or possession of the United States that employs \n     public safety officers.\n       (4) Firefighter.--The term ``firefighter'' has the meaning \n     given the term ``employee engaged in fire protection \n     activities'' in section 3(y) of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     (29 U.S.C. 203(y)).\n       (5) Labor organization.--The term ``labor organization'' \n     means an organization composed in whole or in part of \n     employees, in which employees participate, and which \n     represents such employees before public safety agencies \n     concerning grievances, conditions of employment and related \n     matters.\n       (6) Law enforcement officer.--The term ``law enforcement \n     officer'' has the meaning given such term in section 1204(5) \n     of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 \n     U.S.C. 3796b(5)).\n       (7) Management employee.--The term ``management employee'' \n     has the meaning given such term under applicable State law in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act.

In any \n     judicial review of a determination by the Authority, the \n     procedures contained in subsections (c) and (d) of section \n     7123 of title 5, United States Code, shall be followed, \n     except that any final determination of the Authority with \n     respect to questions of fact or law shall be found to be \n     conclusive unless the court determines that the Authority's \n     decision was arbitrary and capricious.\n       (b) Rights and Responsibilities.--In making a determination \n     described in subsection (a), the Authority shall consider \n     whether State law provides rights and responsibilities \n     comparable to or greater than the following:\n       (1) Granting public safety officers the right to form and \n     join a labor organization, which may exclude management and \n     supervisory employees, that is, or seeks to be, recognized as \n     the exclusive bargaining representative of such employees.\n       (2) Requiring public safety employers to recognize the \n     employees' labor organization (freely chosen by a majority of \n     the employees), to agree to bargain with the labor \n     organization, and to commit any agreements to writing in a \n     contract or memorandum of understanding.\n       (3) Permitting bargaining over hours, wages, and terms and \n     conditions of employment.\n       (4) Requiring an interest impasse resolution mechanism, \n     such as fact-finding, mediation, arbitration or comparable \n     procedures.\n       (5) Requiring enforcement through State courts of--\n       (A) all rights, responsibilities, and protections provided \n     by State law and enumerated in this section; and\n       (B) any written contract or memorandum of understanding.\n       (c) Failure to Meet Requirements.--If the Authority \n     determines, acting pursuant to its authority under subsection \n     (a), that a State does not substantially provide for the \n     rights and responsibilities described in subsection (b), such \n     State shall be subject to the regulations and procedures \n     described in section ____05.\n\n     SEC. ____05.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Justice for United \n     States Prisoners of War Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 792. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) During World War II, members of the United States Armed \n     Forces held as prisoners of war by Japan were forced to \n     provide labor for Japanese privately owned corporations in \n     functions unrelated to the prosecution of the war.\n       (2) International law, including international conventions \n     relating to the protection of prisoners of war, was violated \n     when these Japanese corporations--\n       (A) failed to pay wages to captured United States \n     servicemembers for their labor;\n       (B) allowed and promoted torture and mistreatment of \n     captured United States servicemembers; and\n       (C) withheld food and medical treatment from captured \n     United States servicemembers.\n       (3) In the Treaty of Peace with Japan, signed at San \n     Francisco September 8, 1951 (3 UST 3169), the Government of \n     Japan admitted liability for illegal conduct toward the \n     Allied Powers and, in particular, liability for illegal and \n     inhumane conduct toward members of the armed forces of the \n     Allied Powers held as prisoners of war.\n       (4) Despite this admission of liability, Article 14(b) of \n     the Treaty has been construed to waive all private claims by \n     nationals of the United States, including private claims by \n     members of the United States Armed Forces held as prisoners \n     of war by Japan during World War II.\n       (5) Under Article 26 of the Treaty, the government of Japan \n     agreed that if Japan entered into a war claims settlement \n     agreement with a country that is not a party to the Treaty \n     that provides more favorable terms to that country than the \n     terms Japan extended to the parties to the Treaty, then Japan \n     would extend those more favorable terms to each of the \n     parties to the Treaty, including to the United States.\n       (6) Since the entry into force of the Treaty in 1952, the \n     Government of Japan has entered into war claims settlement \n     agreements with countries that are not party to the Treaty \n     that provide more favorable terms than those extended to the \n     parties to the Treaty, such as terms that allow claims by \n     nationals of those countries against Japanese nationals to be \n     pursued without limitation, restriction, or waiver or any \n     type.\n       (7) In accordance with Article 26 of the Treaty, Japan is \n     obligated to extend those same favorable terms to the United \n     States, including to nationals of the United States, who as \n     members of the United States Armed Forces, were held as \n     prisoners of war by Japan during World War II and who were \n     forced to provide labor without compensation and under \n     inhumane conditions.\n       (8) The people of the United States owe a deep and eternal \n     debt to the heroic United States servicemembers held as \n     prisoners of war by Japan for the sacrifices those \n     servicemembers made on behalf of the United States in the \n     days after the ignominious aggression of Japan against the \n     United States at Pearl Harbor, Bataan, and Corregidor.\n       (9) The pursuit of justice by those servicemembers through \n     lawsuits filed in the United States, where otherwise \n     supported by Federal, State, or international law, is \n     consistent with the interests of the United States and should \n     not be preempted by any other provision of law or by the \n     Treaty.\n       (10) Despite repeated requests for disclosure by United \n     States servicemembers, the Department of Veterans Affairs, \n     and Congress, the United States Government has withheld from \n     those servicemembers and their physicians Japanese records \n     that were turned over to the United States and that relate to \n     chemical and biological experiments conducted on United \n     States servicemembers held as prisoners of war by Japan \n     during World War II.\n\n     SEC. 793. SUITS AGAINST JAPANESE NATIONALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In an action brought in a Federal court \n     against a Japanese defendant by a member of the United States \n     Armed Forces who was held as a prisoner of war by Japan \n     during World War II that seeks compensation for mistreatment \n     or failure to pay wages in connection with labor performed by \n     such a member to the benefit of the Japanese defendant during \n     World War II, the court--\n       (1) shall apply the applicable statute of limitations of \n     the State in which the Federal court hearing the case is \n     located;\n       (2) shall not construe Article 14(b) of the Treaty as \n     constituting a waiver by the United States of claims by \n     nationals of the United States, including claims by members \n     of the United States Armed Forces, so as to preclude the \n     pending action.\n       (b) Sunset.--Paragraph (1) of subsection (a) shall cease to \n     apply at the end of the 10-year period beginning on the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 794. APPLICABILITY OF RIGHTS UNDER ARTICLE 26 OF THE \n                   TREATY OF PEACE WITH JAPAN.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States Government to ensure \n     that all terms under any war claims settlement agreement \n     between Japan and any other country that are more favorable \n     than those terms extended to the United States under the \n     Treaty, will be extended to the United States in accordance \n     with Article 26 of the Treaty with respect to claims by \n     nationals of the United States who, as members of the United \n     States Armed Forces, were held as prisoners of war by Japan \n     during World War II and who were forced to provide labor \n     without compensation and under inhumane conditions.\n\n     SEC. 795.

Res. 147\n\n       Whereas alcohol and drug addiction is a devastating disease \n     that can destroy lives, families, and communities;\n       Whereas according to a 1992 National Institute on Drug \n     Abuse study, the direct and indirect costs in the United \n     States for alcohol and drug addiction was $246,000,000,000, \n     in that year;\n       Whereas scientific evidence demonstrates the crucial role \n     that treatment plays in restoring those suffering from \n     alcohol and drug addiction to more productive lives;\n       Whereas in 1999, research at the National Institute on Drug \n     Abuse at the National Institutes of Health showed that about \n     14,800,000 Americans were users of illicit drugs, and about \n     3,500,000 were dependent on illicit drugs; an additional \n     8,200,000 were dependent on alcohol;\n       Whereas the 1999 National Household Survey of Drug Abuse, a \n     project of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration, showed that drug use varies substantially \n     among States, ranging from a low of 4.7 percent to a high of \n     10.7 percent for the overall population, and from 8.0 percent \n     to 18.3 percent for youths age 12-17;\n       Whereas the Office of National Drug Control Policy's 2001 \n     National Drug Control Strategy includes the reduction of the \n     treatment gap for individuals who are addicted to drugs as \n     one of the top 3 goals for reducing the health and social \n     costs to the public;\n       Whereas the lives of children, families, and communities \n     are severely affected by alcohol and drug addiction, through \n     the effects of the disease, and through the neglect, broken \n     relationships, and violence that are so often a part of the \n     disease of addiction;\n       Whereas a National Institute on Drug Abuse 4-city study of \n     1,200 adolescents found that community-based treatment \n     programs can reduce drug and alcohol use, improve school \n     performance, and lower involvement with the criminal justice \n     system;\n       Whereas a number of organizations and individuals dedicated \n     to fighting addiction and promoting treatment and recovery \n     will recognize the month of September of 2001 as National \n     Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month;\n       Whereas the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, in \n     conjunction with its national planning partner organizations \n     and treatment providers, have taken a Federal leadership role \n     in promoting Recovery Month 2001;\n       Whereas National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month \n     aims to promote the societal benefits of substance abuse \n     treatment, laud the contributions of treatment providers, and \n     promote the message that recovery from substance abuse in all \n     its forms is possible;\n       Whereas the 2001 national campaign embraces the theme of \n     ``We Recover Together: Family, Friends and Community'', and \n     highlights the societal benefits, importance, and \n     effectiveness of drug and treatment as a public health \n     service in our country; and\n       Whereas the countless numbers of those who have \n     successfully recovered from addiction are living proof that \n     people of all races, genders, and ages recover every day from \n     the disease of alcohol and drug addiction, and make positive \n     contributions to their families, workplaces, communities, \n     States, and the Nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of September of 2001 as ``National \n     Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation urging \n     the people of the United States to carry out appropriate \n     programs and activities to demonstrate support for those \n     individuals recovering from alcohol and drug addition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/01/senate-section/article/S10024-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.
