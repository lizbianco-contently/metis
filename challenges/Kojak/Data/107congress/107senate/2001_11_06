Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of H.R. 3061, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3061) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \n     related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2002, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Daschle amendment No. 2044, to provide collective \n     bargaining rights for public safety officers employed by \n     States or their political subdivision.\n       Gramm modified amendment No. 2055 (to amendment No. 2044), \n     to preserve the freedom and constitutional rights of \n     firefighters, law enforcement officers, and public safety \n     officers.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there is \nnow 15 minutes for debate to be equally divided and controlled by the \ntwo leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I yield myself 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Daschle-\nKennedy amendment. This is an amendment which, for the first time in \nover 200-some-odd years in our Nation's history, we have the Federal \nGovernment trying to pass a law dealing with collective bargaining for \ncities, counties, and States for fire, police, sheriffs, and emergency \npersonnel.\n  We have never done it before. We shouldn't do it now. That is and \nshould be the prerogative of the States. The 10th amendment to the \nConstitution says all of the rights and powers are reserved to the \nStates and to the people. It doesn't say: States, you have been doing \nthis for all these years, but now we will have the Federal Government\n\n[[Page S11450]]\n\npass a collective bargaining law that also says you should have \nremedies, arbitration, and so on.\n  Why is the Federal Government doing that when States should be doing \nit? The States are doing it. Why should we tell the States they are not \ndoing it well enough? We will have a bureaucrat go in and review the \nState's laws and say, maybe your State doesn't comply. Some people have \nestimated 26 to 30 States don't comply. Maybe the State of Missouri \nwill have to rewrite its collective bargaining law or the State of \nOklahoma. Frankly, over half of the States have local options where the \nState legislatures have said: We will leave that up to the cities. And \nnow the Federal Government will say: No, that is not good enough; we \nwill have the Federal Government come in and make that decision.\n  This bill says we will exempt small communities. Communities that \nhave less than 5,000 will not be covered by this law. If we don't get \ncloture, we will have an amendment because I will raise that number. I \nthink 5,000 is way too small. We will exempt cities with fewer than \n5,000 employees. I think that is too small. We will have to have a \nbigger exemption. The legislation forgot to exempt volunteers. Why \nshould we cover volunteers? So we will have to have an amendment \ndealing with volunteers. There are over 800,000 volunteer firefighters \nand police officers in the country.\n\n  Why should we mandate that people contribute to an organization \nagainst their will? We need voluntary contributions.\n  This bill is legislation on an appropriations bill. It should be \ndealt with separately. It doesn't belong on this appropriations bill. \nLet me read comments from a couple of organizations.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors:\n\n       However, the federal government should not impose \n     collective bargaining procedures and practices on these local \n     governments that have chosen over time to develop alternative \n     methods for the management of human resource and personnel \n     needs.\n\n  The National Volunteer Fire Council:\n\n       . . . representing over 800,000 Members of America's \n     volunteer fire, EMS, and rescue services. . . . On behalf of \n     our membership, I urge you to oppose the Daschle Amendment as \n     currently written that would insert the language of [this \n     bill].\n\n  The National League of Cities:\n\n       . . . the Federal Government should not undermine municipal \n     autonomy with respect to making fundamental employment \n     decisions by mandating specific working conditions.\n\n  From the Vermont League of Cities and Towns, written to Senator \nJeffords:\n\n       The Vermont League of Cities and Towns strongly urges you \n     to oppose the amendment. The amendment would create a Federal \n     collective bargaining law that applies to State and local \n     government employees. We believe strongly this is an issue \n     better dealt with in the Statehouse in Montpelier than in \n     Washington. This amendment is not only intrusive but has the \n     potential of causing confusion with conflicting and \n     overlapping statutes.\n\n  They said it well. The League of Cities said it well. The Conference \nof Mayors said it well. The National Conference of State Legislatures \nsaid it well. Leave this area of jurisdiction to the States, where it \nhas always been, not trying to preempt it by a Federal statute.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on cloture.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, on September 11, Americans were riveted \nnot only by the extraordinary act of terrorism that struck this country \nand the extraordinary loss of life, but also they were struck by the \nextraordinary heroism and bravery of firefighters, police officers, and \nrescue workers, but particularly the firefighters.\n  There may be those who want to suggest reasons we shouldn't permit \nfirefighters to be able to bargain collectively in the public interest. \nWhat is the record when these firefighters have been able to bargain \ncollectively? First of all, there is greater safety for not only the \npublic but for the firefighters. Second, the number of deaths per \nfirefight has gone down. The numbers clearly reflect that. Third, where \nthis has been permitted in States, we have seen the costs for fire \nprotection have actually gone down.\n  Madam President, this is most of all about fairness and decency. This \nis about respect for workers in our country who have demonstrated day \nin and day out that they are prepared to lay down their lives in order \nto save other lives. We don't need any lectures about that in the \nSenate.\n  The real question now is whether the Senate will permit these \nextraordinarily brave and courageous individuals to get together in \norder to have an adequate and decent living. They are not asking for \nthe Moon. If there is going to be an impasse, there are procedures to \nwork out that impasse. We do think they are entitled to the kind of \ncoming together and speaking to the interests and the safety of \nfirefighters which they deserve.\n  I cannot think of a place in our society that has demonstrated a \nstronger commitment to the public good. They are not asking for very \nmuch. All they are asking for is to be treated decently and fairly in \nthe workplace. That is what this is about. Are we going to permit \nfirefighters in our country to be treated decently and fairly in the \nworkplace?\n  If Members believe in that, support the Daschle amendment. That is \nwhat this amendment does.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, it has been nearly a week that the \nSenate has been tied up over the majority leader's amendment to the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill. I have listened to a great deal of \ndebate about how this amendment would affect State and local police, \nfire, and emergency services officers. After the devastating attacks of \nSeptember 11, we know that these men and women are the true heroes of \nAmerica.\n  The issue before the Senate, mandating that State and local \ngovernments allow public safety officers to unionize and collectively \nbargain, raises many passions on both sides of the aisle. In Alaska, \nthis issue has been resolved. Our State and local employees are allowed \nto unionize and engage in collective bargaining and I very much support \nthe right of Alaska police, fire and emergency service personnel to \nunionize.\n  So as far as this Senator is concerned, the issue raised by Senator \nDaschle is one of principle, not labor/management principles but \nprinciples of constitutional proportions.\n  Senator Daschle's amendment preempts the laws of 27 States. These \nStates have decided that they do not believe their police, fire, or \nemergency service workers, employees of State and local governments, \nshould be allowed to engage in union activities. By what constitutional \nright does the Federal Government have the authority to tell State and \nlocal governments what the terms of employment should be for State and \nlocal workers?\n  Here is how the amendment attempts to address the Constitution: ``The \nabsence of adequate cooperation between public safety employers and \nemployees has implications for the security of employees and can affect \ninterstate and intrastate commerce.''\n  This amendment does not pass the laugh test when it comes to \nconstitutionality. If the standard of the Commerce clause can be \nsatisfied with the previously quoted finding, then there is absolutely \nno area where the Federal Government can preempt States.\n  I think it is clear from the recent decisions of the Supreme Court \nthat the Commerce clause is alive and well and that Congress should be \nlegislating in areas that have real impacts on interstate Commerce, not \nphony made-up attempts to preempt all State decisions.\n  Because this amendment clearly contravenes the Constitution, I have \ndecided that I will not vote to invoke cloture.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise to offer a few comments before we \nvote on cloture on the Daschle amendment. I have and always will be \nstrongly committed to our Nation's fire, police and emergency rescue \npersonnel. Career emergency workers and the individuals who are members \nof our Nation's over 22,000 all volunteer fire stations are on the \nfront lines in America's new war on terrorism. They have a critical \nrole in our homeland defense initiatives.\n  Virginia is a Right to Work State and has passed laws explicitly \nprohibiting public safety unions. Passage of the Daschle amendment \nwould impose an unfunded Federal mandate on\n\n[[Page S11451]]\n\nStates and preempt the existing guidelines and laws in the 27 States \nwhich do not have comprehensive collective bargaining rights for public \nsafety employees.\n  States and localities must retain the flexibility to operate \neffectively and manage their public safety workforce as it is most \nappropriate for their particular needs.\n  It is not the right time for the Federal Government to intervene with \nthe rights of State and local governments, burdening them with \nadditional requirements which may strain the limited financial \nresources of our local governments.\n  In particular, many Americans are not aware of the staffing shortages \nwe may face in our fire and rescue departments. The role of firefighter \nin our communities is far greater than most realize. They are first to \nrespond to hazardous materials calls, chemicals emergencies, biohazard \nincidents, and water rescues. These are dangers which are fire rescue \npersonnel deal with on a daily basis.\n  Earlier this year the National Fire Protection Association, a \nnonprofit organization which develops and promotes scientifically based \nconsensus codes and standards, adopted a standard on response \noperational and deployment issues pertaining to fire and rescue \ndepartments. Based upon that standard, almost two-thirds of fire \ncompanies across the country operate with inadequate staffing. The cost \nfor many municipalities to meet these new safety standards, however, \nwould be significant.\n  In Virginia, many professional fire and rescue workers also volunteer \nat their local volunteer station. Their presence is invaluable to these \ncommunities.\n  If Senator Daschle's amendment passes, however, these paid \nfirefighters would be prohibited from serving as volunteers elsewhere.\n  Over the past month, I have heard from a great number of professional \nfirefighters present at the Pentagon that day and the days following. \nVolunteers and paid professionals worked side-by-side in the wake of \nthe tragedies which occurred on September 11, 2001, in New York, \nPennsylvania, and at the Pentagon in Virginia. Volunteer stations from \nthroughout Virginia also helped to serve communities when the fire and \nrescue personnel from that area were on duty at the Pentagon.\n  I am pleased to be actively involved in several legislative \ninitiatives to support our Federal, State and local fire and rescue \nservices.\n  We need to recognize our firefighters and emergency personnel around \nthe country who continue to make sacrifices in their service to the \npublic. We must provide our fire and rescue departments with sufficient \nfunding to hire the necessary personnel in order to ensure that our \nnation's communities are adequately protected.\n  I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of legislation, S. 1617, \nintroduced by Senator Dodd on November 1, 2001, that will provide \nStates and localities with the necessary funding to hire additional \nfirefighters. The Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Act \nestablishes a new grant program that will provide direct funding to \nfire and rescue departments to cover some of the costs associated with \nhiring and training new firefighters.\n  In addition, our fire and rescue services have a critical role in our \nhomeland defense initiatives. I am pleased to have cosponsored an \namendment offered to the fiscal year 2002 Defense Authorization \nlegislation to increase funding for the fire program from $300 million \nto $600 million in 2002. Funds from the fire program are granted to \nlocal fire departments from the Federal Emergency Management Agency \nfor, among other things, training of firefighters and emergency \nresponse personnel, toward the purchase of new equipment, and upgrading \nfire stations and fire training facilities. With the existing and \nemerging threats our Nation is facing, it is now more important than \never that our firefighters receive the necessary training and \nresources.\n  Please know that I recognize the sacrifice firefighters, police, and \nall emergency personnel make in Virginia and across the Nation. I will \ncontinue to support initiatives that will help our Nation's \nfirefighters and emergency workers.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I am opposed to the Daschle amendment on \nboth substantive and procedural grounds.\n  First of all, in terms of substance, the Daschle amendment actually \nempowers a Government agency, the Federal Labor Relations Authority, to \noverride State law. It allows this Authority in some 25 States in the \nUnion to make a determination that would override established State law \nand State constitutions and impose a unionization process which the \nStates have rejected.\n  In my State, we have a local option, so the question of collective \nbargaining and unionization of the local fire department and sheriff's \ndepartment is a matter for local voters. They have a referendum. That \nis our procedure. That is the way we do it in Texas. It has served us \nwell.\n  The Daschle amendment would override State law, override county \nordinances, and empower a government regulatory body, the Federal Labor \nRelations Authority, to override State law.\n  I think this violates everything we claim to believe about \nfederalism. It is very bad policy. It violates the spirit of the tenth \namendment of the Constitution, and I think it is profoundly wrong.\n  Second, let me say on procedural grounds, we are in the process of \ntrying to finish appropriations. We were encouraging our Members to put \naside controversial and extraneous matters until we had an opportunity \nto complete the appropriations process. This bill could be brought up \nfreestanding. The majority leader has the unilateral power to do that. \nBut to put it on an appropriations bill, it seems to me, disrupts what \nwe are trying to achieve and encourages others to follow suit. If this \namendment is clotured, there will be a dozen amendments offered to it \nthat have to do with labor law in America.\n  This is another debate for another day. We will end up having to \ncloture this bill. There will be a lengthy process that will use up our \ntime and energy that would better be spent on something else.\n  I understand this is a time when we appreciate our firemen and we \nappreciate our policemen, but forcing people to pay union dues is not a \nway I show appreciation to people.\n  We have the right in Texas and every State in the Union has the right \nto write its State constitution and to write its laws. Laws related to \nlocal labor relations and the relationship of the city, the county, and \nthe State with their employees is something that should be set by the \ncities, counties, and States, not by the Federal Government.\n  I urge my colleagues, on substance this amendment is profoundly wrong \nand wrongheaded. And on procedure, it puts us into a collision course.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from New \nYork.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I thank our leader once again for \ncoming forward with a very timely amendment. I would like to add my \nsupport.\n  I know people from all over the country were riveted on the great \nwork of our firefighters as well as our police and rescue workers in \nNew York. They did a wonderful job.\n  I can tell you--and I have talked to hundreds of them--the words are \nvery inspiring. But they also need help. They are trying to feed \nfamilies. They are trying to get the kind of benefits that so many \nothers have. In place after place after place in America, they don't \nget them.\n  If we want to show our real feelings, if we want to put our money \nwhere our mouth is, if we really want to help the firefighters--go ask \nthem. Don't rely on some kind of broad ideological mantra. If we want \nto help the firefighters, we should not tell them how we are going to \nhelp them. Let them tell us how we are going to help them. They want \nthis proposal. They are right. I am for it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield 1 minute to the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, this is not a complicated question. The \nAmerican people have watched as these firefighters have put their lives \non the\n\n[[Page S11452]]\n\nline for us. They have provided all of us, all of our families, and \nfamilies all over this country, with the security we need and expect.\n  Now these firefighters have come to us, the Senate, and asked that we \nprovide them and their families with the same kind of security American \nworkers have all over this country.\n  This is not a complicated question. It is a simple question. The \nAmerican people have watched the heroism of these firefighters. It is \ntime for our Senate to provide them with the same kind of security they \nhave been providing to American families forever.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will use whatever leader time I may \nrequire to close out the debate on this amendment.\n  As my colleagues have noted, every day firefighters, police officers, \nand emergency workers literally risk their lives to protect our safety. \nIn 18 States, public safety workers do not currently have the legal \nright--the legal right--to sit down with their employers and talk about \ntheir own health and about their own safety. That is why we offer this \namendment this afternoon, the Public Safety Employee-Employer \nCooperation amendment. It is identical to the bipartisan bill offered \nby Senators Gregg and Kennedy, who both spoke in favor of this \namendment last week.\n  The amendment is very simple. It guarantees that public safety \nofficers have the right to form and join a union; have the right to \nbargain collectively over hours, wages, and conditions of employment--\nperiod.\n  Studies have shown, as Senator Kennedy and others have noted, that \nfewer firefighters are killed in the line of duty in States where \ncollective bargaining exists, States where public safety officers have \na say in their working conditions. Our proposal expressly forbids \nstrikes or lockouts by public safety workers.\n  Contrary to assertions by some of the opponents of this amendment, \nour proposal does not override State right-to-work laws. The opponents \nof this amendment say that allowing public safety workers to join a \nunion will somehow jeopardize public safety. Tell that to the 344 \nunionized firefighters and paramedics who died trying to save the lives \nof people at the World Trade Center. Tell the unionized Capitol police \nwho guard this building and protect our lives every day of the week.\n  These men and women deserve our thanks. They deserve a vote on this \nimportant issue. Instead, when we offered this amendment, we were \ninformed opponents would not give us a vote. So let there be no \nmistake. This cloture vote is the vote on the merits. It is a vote on \nwhether or not we stand with firefighters, the police, and those who \nprotect us day in and day out. This gives all firefighters, regardless \nof where they live, the opportunity to do what they ought to be able to \ndo in this country--to bargain collectively for their rights, for their \nsafety, for their lives in some cases.\n  Madam President, I urge a ``yes'' vote. I hope our colleagues will \nsupport this cloture vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I yield myself 3 minutes under the \nRepublican leader's time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Some people have equated this with a patriotic vote \nbecause we appreciate the firefighters in New York and Virginia. \nCertainly we do. The firefighters in Virginia were nonunion. The \nfirefighters in New York were union. That is not the issue. The issue \nis whether or not the Federal Government is going to go in and preempt \nStates or dictate to the States collective bargaining laws for public \nemployees.\n  We have never passed a law that says we are going to have collective \nbargaining dictated by the Federal Government for State employees or \nfor city employees. We have never done it in 225 years. We never passed \nsuch a law.\n  We have never passed a law that says: Sheriffs, officers, you can \nhave collective bargaining.\n  We have never done that, but we are getting ready to do it. We have \nnever done it to all cities. Right now, this legislation goes to cities \nwith populations of greater than 5,000. Other States have different \nlaws.\n  Every State has a law dealing with collective bargaining, but now we \nare saying we are going to tell the States what to do, and the States \nhave to pass laws that are basically, substantially equivalent with \nthis law or else it doesn't apply. A Federal bureaucrat is going to \ndecide whether the existing State laws are in compliance.\n  Some States have a local option. The majority of States have a local \noption. They let cities make that decision. We are trying to say: \nCities, you can't make it. Small towns in North Dakota, South Dakota, \nOklahoma, you can't make that decision. We are going to make it for \nyou.\n\n  I think that is a serious mistake. I applaud the bravery of \nfirefighters, police officers, people who work in the ambulance system, \nthe sheriffs, officers, but I don't think we, on the Federal level, \nshould dictate their collective bargaining arrangements. That has been \ndone by the States, done by the cities, done by the counties. They have \ndone a good job. We should not tell them how to do it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Preserving the prerogative of the majority, I want to \nclose out this debate. Let me respond in a couple of ways.\n  First of all, this amendment does not federalize state labor laws. \nThis amendment says if a state has a right-to-work law, we will respect \nit.\n  What this amendment also says to every firefighter in the country: If \nyou want to negotiate in a collective bargaining arrangement with your \nemployer, you have the right to do so.\n  The process is not dictated. There is no requirement that employers \nagree with those firefighters who want to enter into a collective \nbargaining arrangement.\n  Who would deny the right to a firefighter today to enter into a \ncollective bargaining arrangement if he or she chooses to do so? That \nis all we are suggesting. We protect right-to-work laws. We protect \nrights of the State. I think we ought to protect the rights of all \nfirefighters too.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Chair \nlays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nstate.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Daschle-\n     Kennedy amendment No. 2044 to H.R. 3061, the Labor, HHS \n     appropriations bill:\n         Maria Cantwell, Joe Biden, Barbara A.

On this vote, the yeas are 56, \nthe nays are 44. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have long been a supporter of collective \nbargaining rights.\n  Although worthwhile, I oppose cloture on the Daschle amendment (SA \n2044) because it would have further delayed the already backlogged \nfiscal year 2002 appropriations process. More than one month into the \nfiscal year 2002, we have sent only 5 of the 13 annual appropriations \nconference reports to the President. We must finish our work and pass \nthese appropriations bills.\n  While I support the Daschle amendment, the Labor-HHS appropriations \nbill was not the proper vehicle to address this issue.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the matter now before the Senate is the \nLabor-HHS Appropriations Act; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2044, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \nDaschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be no \nfurther amendments in order to H.R. 3061, the Labor-HHS appropriations \nbill, the bill be read a third time, and the vote on final passage \noccur immediately, notwithstanding rule XII, paragraph 4.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on H.R. 3061.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                       FARMWORKER HOUSING PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have a question about the migrant and \nseasonal Farmworker Housing Program. I have worked for a number of \nyears to ensure that the Labor Department provide funding for housing \nassistance for eligible farmworkers. There is a well-established \nnetwork of local housing organizations that receive these funds. I am \nparticularly impressed by the work of the organization in my State, the \nDelta Housing Project. The Senate Report accompanying this bill \nrecommends $5,000,000 for farmworker housing. This amount represents an \nincrease of $1,000,000 over the fiscal year 2001 level. In fiscal 2001 \nthe committee increased the fund from $3,000,000 to $4,000,000 \nrepresenting the first increasee since 1982. I am pleased that the \ncommittee has recently increased the funding to this worthwhile program \nso that grant recipients can use these funds for important housing \nprojects. However, despite the fact that in fiscal year 2001 the \nprogram was increased by 20 percent, most all grant recipients received \nless money than they have consistently relied upon for the past 17 \nyears. This does not seem fair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree. We need to continue this program so that the \nwell-established network of local housing organizations can continue to \nprovide these needed services. That is why our subcommittee provided an \nadditional $1,000,000 specifically for housing priorities.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is my intent that these funds be used by the \nDepartment of Labor for the expansion of funding among the network of \nfarmworker housing grantees. It is my understanding that it is the \nintent of this committee that these funds be used for those grantees \nand that any funds for migrant rest center activities would come from \nother discretionary sources. Would the chairman clarify this \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. The legislation is intended to provide funds to the \nnetwork of housing providers in the migrant community and not to be \nused for discretionary purposes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my overall \nsupport for the Labor-HHS bill currently before us. I thank the \nchairman and ranking member for their continued efforts to meet our \ncounty's needs. I recognize the financial limitations we faced in the \nsubcommittee in trying to address our many concerns in labor, health \nand education. This appropriations bill, more than any other bill, \nimpacts every family and every community. The programs in this bill \nfrom education and health services to workplace safety are priorities \nfor Washington families. While I am disappointed by some areas of the \nbill, overall it makes critical investments in our health, safety and \nwelfare. I would like to highlight some of my priorities in this \ncritical legislation, starting with education.\n  Although I appreciate the significant increase in education we \nprovide in this bill, I hope that we will be able to put more money \ninto education programs this year. The education reform bill now in \nconference would impose significant new requirements on our schools, \nand if we are going to ensure no child is left behind, we need to \nprovide the money to back up that bill. I look forward to working with \nSenator Harkin and my other colleagues on the ESEA conference committee \nto fully-fund IDEA.\n  I especially thank the Chair for working with me to ensure sufficient \nfunding to keep our commitment of smaller classes for our young \nstudents. This investment of more than $3 billion in teacher quality \nand smaller classes represents the fourth year that I have successfully \nfought for funds to help districts continue on the path to hiring \n100,000 new teachers to reduce class sizes in the early grades \nnationwide.\n  By including the class size reduction program in the appropriations \nbills over the last 3 years, Congress has taken an important, \nbipartisan step to ensure our students are learning in less crowded \nclassrooms. The first year of Federal class size reduction funds \nenabled schools to hire 29,000 teachers, and last year's funding added \nanother 8,000 to that number. As a result, about 2 million students are \nlearning in classrooms that are no longer overcrowded. On a related \nnote, I am pleased that this bill includes funding to continue the \nschool renovation investments we started this year. These funds are \ncritical to ensuring students learn in safe, modern and uncrowded \nclassrooms.\n  I am also pleased to note that this bill includes funding for the \nTeacher Training in Technology Program. Helping our teachers learn to \nuse technology is essential if we are going to use technology to \nimprove education for all students. I will continue to work to secure \nthis program in ESEA reauthorization, and appreciate the committee's \nsupport in that endeavor.\n  I am disappointed that this bill does not provide more funding to \nsupport some of our most vulnerable students our homeless children. I \nhoped we would follow the lead of the education authorizers who \naccepted my amendment to double the authorization for homeless \neducation. At the current level this program is only able to serve one-\nthird of eligible children, and less than 4 percent of districts \nreceive direct funding. The House mark includes $50 million for this \nprogram, and I hope that the final agreement will include a significant \nincrease over current funding. Family homelessness is increasing. The \nU.S. Conference of Mayors found that demand for emergency shelter \nincreased by 17 percent among homeless families last year. Schools are \nhaving a hard time keeping up with the increasing demand for services, \nand I fear that the changes in our economy will only make the situation \nworse.\n\n  Local homeless education programs use these funds to help homeless \nchildren enroll, attend, and succeed in\n\n[[Page S11454]]\n\nschool in by: establishing liaisons to the homeless community to \nidentify homeless children and connect them to school; providing school \nsupplies and emergency needs--everything from backpacks, paper, \npencils, gym clothes, math/science equipment, to eyeglasses, shoes, \nclothing, and hygiene supplies; offering tutorial services for homeless \nchildren at shelters and other locations; and much more.\n  I thank the managers for adding funding for GEAR UP in this final \nbill, and I hope we can include additional funds in conference to avoid \na cut from the fiscal year 2001 appropriated level. I have seen \nfirsthand the great work this program is facilitating. Research has \nshown that reaching out to disadvantaged middle school students to let \nthem know that the dream of college is within their grasp and \nsupporting them in attaining that dream is the most effective way to \nensure more disadvantaged students get a college degree. In the \ninformation economy of the 21st century we cannot leave children behind \nby denying them access to higher education. I believe we can and must \ndo better for these children by providing an increase in funding for \nthe GEAR UP Program.\n  Finally, I look forward to working with Chairman Harkin and the \nRanking Member, Senator Specter, to secure the funds necessary to \noperate Child Care Aware. Millions of children are in care outside of \ntheir home while their parents work. Yet child care is often more \ncostly than college tuition, and quality care can be hard to find. \nChild Care Aware is a nonprofit initiative, operated by the National \nAssociation of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies, that is \ncommitted to helping parents find the best information on locating \nquality child care and child care resources in their community.\n  Next, I would like to turn to the labor provisions of this bill. I am \npleased that the bill includes $1.549 billion for the Dislocated Worker \nEmployment and Training Activities. This is an increase of nearly $140 \nmillion from fiscal year 2001.\n  Unfortunately, our economy is continuing to slump. Recent indicators \nsuggest unemployment could reach as high as 6.9 percent by the end of \nnext year. Many of these people need help in their search for new \nskills and new jobs. The Boeing company has announced it will lay off \nmore than 30,000 workers from its commercial airline business, which is \nheadquartered in Washington. That is 30 percent of their workforce. \nMany other industries have announced massive layoffs. Those workers \nwill be seeking access to the dislocated workers' program. The money in \nthis bill is a good first step. However, we must also expand \nunemployment insurance, health care and job training programs to assist \nthese newly-unemployed workers. I hope my colleagues will support such \na measure as we debate an economic stimulus package.\n  Finally, I would like to turn to some of the progress this bill makes \nin the area of healthcare. For years, we have known about the important \nrole played by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During \nthe recent anthrax incidents, many Americans have learned about some of \nthe CDC's responsibilities. This bill boosts our investment in the CDC \nby providing $4.4 billion for Disease Control programs--an increase of \n$372 million over last year. This funding will support cancer screening \nand education programs, including breast and cervical cancer screening; \ninjury control and reduction, including rape prevention and education, \nbioterrorism, and improving our local public health infrastructure to \nrespond to public health threats.\n  This bill makes progress for local communities that are working to \nprovide care to the uninsured and underinsured. The bill provides $1.3 \nbillion for Health Centers, which is $175 million more than in fiscal \nyear 2001.\n\n  While this bill makes a lot of progress on health care issues, I am \ndeeply disappointed that this bill falls short of our commitment to the \nCommunity Access Program, CAP, which helps communities research and \ncoordinate care to underserved populations. I can tell you that \nthroughout Washington state, the CAP program is allowing local \nofficials, doctors and advocates to meet the needs of underserved \npatients. In fact, this program is critical in meeting the needs of the \ngrowing population of uninsured. During these difficult economic times, \nwe should be strengthening our safety net programs. That is why, \nearlier this year, the HELP Committee adopted the amendment I offered \nwith Senator Clinton, which assumes an authorization of $125 for the \nCAP program. Clearly, the $15 million in this bill falls short of our \ncommitment. I am hopeful that we can work with the House in conference \nto meet our original commitment.\n  Throughout Washington State, small and rural communities are seeing \nhospitals close. It is becoming more difficult for people in rural \nareas to get the care they need. This bill invests in rural health \ncare. It provides more than $1.6 billion to help increase and improve \naccess to rural health care services, providers and facilities.\n  I am also pleased that the bill supports pediatric medical training. \nIt provides $243 million for GME for children's hospitals. This \nincrease of $8.45 million is important for hospitals like Children's \nHospital in Seattle. In the area of AIDS, this bill provides $1.8 \nbillion for the Ryan White AIDS programs, $75 million more than last \nyear. This bill funds our family planning efforts at $266 million for \ntitle X, an increase of $12 million over fiscal year 2001.\n  When it comes to supporting cutting-edge medical research, this bill \nkeeps us on track for doubling NIH funding by fiscal year 2003. It \nprovides a total of $23.7 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion over \nlast year. I am proud of the research being done in Washington state \nincluding at the University of Washington, the Hutch and many biotech \nand biomedical research facilities throughout the state. In fact, \nWashington state is one of the top five recipients of NIH funding.\n  In the area of poison control, I am pleased that this legislation \nprovides a total of $24 million for fiscal year 2002, that's a $4 \nmillion increase over fiscal year and $7.5 million more than the \nadministration requested. As one of the original authors of the Poison \nControl Prevention and Enhancement Act, I believe this additional \nfunding will prevent unintentional poisonings from everyday products. \nThis bill supports trauma care planning and development by providing $4 \nmillion, an increase of $1 million over fiscal year 01 and $1.5 million \nmore than the administration's request. Finally, as any advocate can \ntell you, our country doesn't have enough shelter space to offer \nprotection for abused women and children. This bill provides $122 \nmillion for battered women's shelters. That is an increase of $5 \nmillion over fiscal year 01 and the Administration's request.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, states are struggling to fund \ncritical health care services with rapidly declining revenues. The \neconomic downturn has created a budget crisis for many states including \nmy own state of Washington. We should recognize the struggle facing \nmany of our states and act to incorporate language into this \nappropriations bill to prohibit or delay any effort by CMS to reduce \noverall Medicaid payments. I know that many of us are concerned about \nefforts by CMS to further restrict the Upper Payment Limit within \nMedicaid. I worked with the previous Administration in 2000 to resolve \nthis matter and phase out any potential loophole. To go back on this \nagreement now would mean significant Medicaid cuts for several States. \nThis is the wrong time to cut the Federal share of Medicaid. I am \nhopeful that we can incorporate language in this appropriations bill to \nprohibit any action by CMS to reduce Medicaid funding.\n  I believe we should be working to enhance the Federal match under \nMedicaid to prevent drastic reductions in health care for low income \nfamilies. At a time when more families will lose health insurance, we \nshould be acting to increase the Federal commitment to Medicaid. I \nrealize that increasing the Federal Medicaid match is a matter which \nmust be addressed in a stimulus package not this appropriations bill. \nHowever, we should use this appropriations bill to send a clear message \nto the administration that this is the wrong time to attempt to reduce \nMedicaid reimbursement to the States.\n  I am pleased that this bill continues our investment in the programs \nthat many senior citizens and their families\n\n[[Page S11455]]\n\nrely on. It boosts funding for OAA nutrition programs. Specifically, it \nprovides an increase of $30 million over fiscal year 01 for home \ndelivered meals (to $177 million) and congregate meals (to $384 \nmillion). It also provides a 10 percent increase for aging programs \nunder the Administration on Aging and supports other investments that \nassist the elderly.\n  When we reauthorized the Older Americans Act last year, we created \nthe Family Caregiver Support Program, which assists families caring for \nan aging relative. This bill provides a $20 million increase in the \nFamily Caregiver Support Program to $140 million.\n  This bill funds efforts to use technology to expand health care \naccess. It provides $1 million for telehealth efforts at Children's \nHospital in Seattle. And in other areas important to Washington State, \nthis bill supports the Franciscan Health System's Program Improving \nCare through the End of Life demonstration program. It funds the \nnational Asian pacific center on aging continuation of funding. And it \nfunds a health profession and nurse retention study in Washington \nstate.\n  Overall, this bill makes progress for our people and our country.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will pass the fiscal year \n2002 appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education and Related Agencies--the largest of the 13 \nappropriations bills before Congress this year. This measure contains \nsupport for some of the most important aspects of our Nation's work \nsuch as medical research that leads to advancements in health, the \neducation of our youth from preschool through college, assistance to \nthe elderly and those with disabilities, and the training of workers \nseeking employment. While there are many noteworthy initiatives in this \nbill, I would like to highlight just a few that are particularly \nimportant to Vermont.\n  Hope for a cure for many diseases and illnesses must come through \nresearch and I am pleased that the Senate continues to work toward our \ngoal of doubling the Federal Government's investment in the \ngroundbreaking biomedical research conducted by the 25 Institutes and \nCenters that make up the National Institutes of Health. With this \nstrong support, NIH funding for next year will increase to $23.7 \nbillion, an increase of $3.4 billion over last year. Millions of \nAmericans suffering from conditions ranging from Parkinson's and \nAlzheimer's diseases, to cancer, diabetes and heart disease, will \nbenefit from the research undertaken by the thousands of NIH \nscientists, including many in Vermont, supported by this funding.\n  This bill establishes an Aging Initiative that takes important steps \ntoward assisting senior citizens in Vermont and throughout America. The \nInitiative is designed to increase the capacity of home- and community-\nbased services to support a high quality life for older Americans. An \nInteragency Task Force on Aging Programs will coordinate and provide \nadditional support to programs that serve older Americans. Increased \nfunding has been provided for supportive services and senior centers, \nlong-term care ombudsmen to prevent and address the problem of elder \nabuse and neglect, the National Family Caregiver Support Program, \nelderly nutrition programs to expand home delivered meal distribution, \nand Alzheimer's disease research. I am confident that this effort will \nresult in an improved quality of life for our nation's seniors, \nespecially for those living in rural parts of our nation.\n  This legislation includes important funding for education that will \nsupport learning opportunities for Vermont schoolchildren of all ages. \nFunding for the Head Start Program, which provides comprehensive \ndevelopmental education services for pre-kindergarten, low-income \nchildren, has been increased by $400 million. We have increased funding \nto assist low-income students who want to receive a college education. \nThis bill will raise the maximum Pell Grant available to American \ncollege students from $3,750 to $4,000. This is the highest Pell Grant \nmaximum in the history of the program.\n  We have also increased funding for our students with special \neducation needs by $1 billion. Although this increase brings us a step \ncloser toward meeting our responsibilities under the Individuals with \nDisabilities Act, we still must do more. House and Senate Conferees on \nthe bill to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \ncurrently have before them the opportunity to mandate that the federal \ngovernment increase its share of special education funding to 40 \npercent of IDEA spending from its current level of 15 percent. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support this provision. It will provide \nsignificant relief to state and local governments as they strive to pay \nfor the quality educational services that our nation's disabled \nstudents need and deserve.\n  I am very pleased that the Senate has provided increased funding for \nthe Office of Civil Rights, OCR, at the Department of Health and Human \nServices. OCR is responsible for the enforcement of civil rights-\nrelated provisions in health and human services programs. Earlier this \nyear, OCR's responsibilities were vastly expanded with the release of \nthe final medical privacy regulation by HHS. Quality enforcement of \nthis new regulation is essential to the protection of Americans' \nmedical privacy. This increased funding will ensure that OCR can \nfulfill its new medical privacy enforcement obligations without \ndereliction from its many other civil rights enforcement \nresponsibilities.\n  Finally, I am pleased that this bill includes $1.7 billion in funds \nfor the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and an additional \n$300 million in emergency funds. LIHEAP is a critical program for \ncitizens of states like Vermont, who endure long, cold winters. Last \nyear LIHEAP helped nearly 18,000 Vermont families stay warm. I am \nconcerned that demand for this program will rise dramatically this \nwinter as the economy slows and incomes decline. I want to thank the \nCommittee for including a significant increase in LIHEAP funding in \nanticipation of this great need.\n  This spending bill is not perfect. There are areas where increased \nfunding is still needed. However, we have taken the right steps in many \nimportant health, education, and human service programs, and I am \npleased to support a measure that provides such great benefit to \nVermonters.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as the Senate is about to adopt H.R. 3061, \nthe Labor-Health and Human Services Appropriations legislation for \nfiscal year 2002, I would like to express my strong support and \ngratitude to Senator Harkin and Senator Specter for their willingness \nto include an amendment to H.R. 3061 on a matter that is very important \nto my home State of Utah.\n  The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, RECA, was signed into law in \n1990 and has provided compensation to thousands of individuals, both \nworkers and civilians, who were exposed to harmful radiation as a \nresult of the government's nuclear testing decades ago. Some of these \nindividuals worked in uranium mines; many drove the trucks which \ntransported uranium ore; and many more happened to live downwind from a \nnuclear test site.\n  The RECA law was amended last year by S. 1515, the Radiation Exposure \nCompensation Act Amendments of 2000. The legislation, which was signed \ninto law last July, expanded the list of illnesses and classes of \nindividuals who may be compensated under the RECA program. Recognizing \nthat it is more effective, cost-beneficial, and indeed compassionate, \nto identify and treat at the earliest stages individuals who may have \nbeen exposed to harmful radiation, RECA 2000 also authorized a grant \nprogram for education, prevention, and early detection of radiogenic \ncancers and diseases. These grants would be provided through the \nAdministrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration and \nwould be used to screen individuals for cancer, provide education \nprograms for detection, prevention and treatment of radiogenic cancers. \nThe grants could also be used to give medical treatment to those \nindividuals who have been diagnosed with radiogenic cancers and \nillnesses.\n  My amendment appropriates $5 million to HRSA for programs associated \nwith RECA. Of that amount, $4 million will be used for the screening \nand prevention program I have just mentioned, which is codified under \nsection 417C of the Public Health Service Act. In addition, my \namendment provides $1\n\n[[Page S11456]]\n\nmillion so the Department of Health and Human Services may contract \nwith the National Research Council in order to review the most recent \nscientific information related to radiation exposure and associated \ncancers and illnesses. The study would also make recommendations as to \nwhether there are additional cancers or illnesses associated with \nradiation exposure that should be compensated under the RECA program. \nFinally, the study would review whether other classes of individuals or \nadditional geographic areas should be included under the RECA program. \nThese recommendations by the National Research Council must be \ncompleted by June 30, 2003 and will be submitted to the Senate \nCommittees on Appropriations; Health, Education, Labor and Pensions; \nand Judiciary for review. The report also will be submitted to the \nHouse Committees on Appropriations; Energy and Commerce; and Judiciary.\n  I am pleased that this amendment has been cosponsored by both \nSenators Reid and Domenici. I have also worked closely with Senate \nMajority Leader Daschle, Senator Bingaman, Senator Campbell, and \nSenator Johnson on the RECA program. All of us have constituents who \nhave been impacted by radiation exposure and all of us want to do \neverything we possibly can to be helpful to them.\n\n  I have met with many RECA claimants in my State. It does not take \nlong to see the pain and suffering they have endured over the years. \nThis is pain and suffering, I might add, that have taken a toll on \ntheir lives and the lives of their families as well. Most of these \nindividuals are now retired; they live on modest incomes and fear their \ndeclining health will only exacerbate their limited family finances. \nMany have lost fathers, mothers, sisters, and brothers due to radiation \nexposure. We cannot forget these brave Americans.\n  It is for these reasons that this amendment is so important--it will \nnot only provide valuable assistance to those who have been exposed to \nradiation exposure, it will also review current data to ensure that all \nof those who have been impacted will be adequately compensated. I \ncannot tell you how many times I have talked to constituents who don't \nunderstand why their cancer is not currently covered under the RECA \nlaw. They don't understand why living in one county allows RECA \ncompensation but living in another county, sometimes as close as three \nmiles away, prohibits them from being compensated as a RECA victim. I \nwant to make sure we are using the best science possible to provide \nanswers to these important questions. The National Research Council \nrecommendations will help answer these questions to the best of our \nability based on all current scientific data.\n  Again, I wish to express my gratitude to my colleagues who serve on \nthe Appropriations Committee, especially Senator Harkin and Senator \nSpecter, for recognizing the importance of this issue. Through this \namendment, we are acknowledging the plight of these Americans and \nletting them know that we in the Congress truly care about their \nwelfare.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank Senators Landrieu and Rockefeller \nfor cosponsoring my amendment, which has been incorporated into the \nmanagers' amendment.\n  Earlier this month, my colleague from West Virginia, Senator \nRockefeller, and I introduced a bill to reauthorize the Promoting Safe \nand Stable Families Act. This is a vital program that provides grants \nto children services agencies to help place foster children in \npermanent homes, provide post-adoption services, and reunify families \nwhen appropriate.\n  I thank Senators Specter and Harkin for working with me to increase \nthe appropriations level for this important program. As reported out of \ncommittee, the Senate bill only provided $305 million for the program, \nwhile the House bill included $375 million. I worked with the managers \nto increase the Senate level to $375 million.\n  I am very pleased that we have increased this funding level because \nthe Safe and Stable Families program provides critical services to at-\nrisk children.\n  The reality is that many thousands of children in our country are at \nrisk because they are neglected or abused by parents or because they \nare trapped in the legal limbo that denies them their chance to be \nadopted. Over a half-million children go to bed each night in homes \nthat are not their own.\n  We have an obligation to these children. We have an obligation to \nprotect these innocent lives.\n  The Safe and Stable Families program is there for these children. The \nfunding provided to the States through this legislation is used for \nfour categories of services: family preservation, community-based \nfamily support, time-limited family reunification, and adoption \npromotion and support.\n  These services are designed to prevent child abuse and neglect in \ncommunities at risk, avoid the removal of children from their homes, \nand support timely reunification or adoption. And, quite candidly, \nPromoting Safe and Stable Families is a very important source of \nfunding for post-adoption services.\n  With a nearly 40 percent increase in the number of adoptions since \nthe implementation of the Adoption and Safe Families Act, funding for \nadoption promotion and support services is especially vital. In \nBaltimore, MD, for example, 5 years ago, there were only 160 adoptions. \nSo far this year, 514 adoptions have been finalized. Such increases \ndemonstrate the need for these services and the necessity for these \nservices to ensure that the adoptions are not disrupted, which risks \nfurther traumatizing a child.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for increasing the current Senate \nfunding level. Protecting this vital program is simply the right thing \nto do.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, for many years, Senator Mike DeWine \nand I have worked with a bipartisan coalition to promote adoptions and \nto strengthen Federal funding to help abused and neglected children, \nespecially through the Safe and Stable Families program. Senator DeWine \nhas been a real leader especially in the key area of defining \nreasonable effort to protect children. We are joined in our effort by \nSenators Landrieu and Craig, both well-known advocates for adoption and \nleaders of the Adoption Caucus.\n  President Bush called for an increase of $200 million for this \nprogram in his State of the Union address and his budget. In OMB's mid-\nsession review, the administration changed its request from $200 \nmillion in mandatory money to discretionary funding. Since then, the \nHouse of Representatives added $70 million in new funding in their \nLabor-HHS-appropriations bill.\n  Children suffering from abuse and neglect are among our most \nvulnerable children. In 1997, Congress enacted new legislation to make \nthe health and safety of a child paramount, and to stress the \nimportance of providing every child a permanent home. The act imposed \nnew time frames for States to consider adoption. Since then, adoptions \nfrom foster care have almost doubled. But these families need support \nto address the special needs of these children. Currently, there are \nover 800,000 children in foster care. About 1 million cases of abuse \nand neglect are substantiated each year.\n  In my State of West Virginia, the number of adoptions are increasing, \nbut the statistics on abuse and neglect of children remain stubbornly \nhigh. New funding will enable my State and every State to expand their \nprograms for adoption, family support, family preservation, and help to \nfamilies in foster care.\n  Our goal is to secure new investments in the Safe and Stable Families \nProgram to help these vulnerable children. I truly appreciate the \ncooperation and support of Senators Harkin and Specter in accepting our \namendment to provide new funding for this worthy cause. Chairman Harkin \nand Ranking Member Specter have a very hard task in overseeing the \nLabor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. Balancing all the needs within \ntheir jurisdiction, including health care, education, worker safety, \nand other issues is a very difficult task, but a task they manage each \nyear with skill and fairness. Their deep concern and compassion for \nchildren is well-known, and their willingness to work with Senator \nDeWine and me further highlights their commitment to some of the most \nvulnerable children, those suffering from abuse and neglect. I am truly \ngrateful for their leadership and support.\n  Things have changed dramatically in our country and in the Congress. \nWe\n\n[[Page S11457]]\n\nneed to respond to the new challenges and the new fiscal issues. But \nthe needs of abused and neglected children remain, and we also need to \nbe sensitive to their problems and their needs. I appreciate the \nsupport from my colleagues.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank both Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin for their hard work on this important legislation which \nprovides federal funding for the Departments of Labor, DOL, and Health \nand Human Services, HHS, and related agencies. Many of these programs \nare even more important as our war on terrorism is placing this Nation \nat great risk, particularly on the homefront. To protect our survival, \nwe must also ensure that adequate support and resources are provided to \nprotect our citizens at home as well as adequately funding our defense \nprograms necessary for engaging in this war.\n  I am pleased to see increased funding for many programs, many that \nare of an increased importance in light of our Nation's war on \nterrorism. This includes an increase in funding for bioterrorism \nactivities and ensuring that our nation's public health infrastructure \nis given the highest priority and strengthened considerably. This \nfunding is critical for our States, localities and our nation as a \nwhole, to ensure that substantial investments and improvements are made \nin our public health infrastructure so we can readily respond to our \ncurrent situation and potentially future threats as well.\n  There is funding to ensure our Nation's food supply remains safe and \nresources for helping meet the health care needs of the uninsured--many \nwho may now be unemployed due to the horrific events of September 11th. \nIn this time of war, we must ensure that adequate resources are \navailable for treating and preventing potential health threats. In \naddition to funding key public health programs, this bill provides \nfunds for helping States and local communities educate our children. \nFurthermore, it provides the necessary funds for supporting our \nscientists dedicated to finding treatments, if not cures, for many \nillnesses, including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and ALS. This bill even \nprovides funds for ensuring our nation's most vulnerable--children, \nsenior citizens and the disabled--have access to quality health care. \nFunds are also provided for important programs that assist working \nfamilies needing child care, adult daycare for elderly seniors, and \nMeals on Wheels.\n  I applaud the appropriators for including very few specific funding \nearmarks, but I am distressed about the extensive list of directives \nthat have been included. It is apparent that the many directives and \nrecommendation language camouflages the number of specific projects \nthat are given special consideration and bypassing the appropriate \ncompetitive funding process. Examples of this language include:\n\n  Language supporting the Wheeling Jesuit University NASA Center for \nEducational Technologies to provide technology training to all \nelementary and secondary West Virginia mathematics and science \nteachers;\n  Language supporting the Missoula Family YMCA in Missoula, MT, to \ndevelop the ``Give Me Five'' after school program;\n  Language supporting the Ellijay Wildlife Rehabilitation Sanctuary to \nexpand its ecological science education programs to make them available \nto more students in Georgia;\n  Language supporting Fresno At-Risk Youth Services in California to \nattack the problem of at-risk youths by coordinating the city's efforts \nthrough an education program coordinator;\n  Language supporting the Northeast and Islands Regional Educational \nLaboratory at Brown University to run a Website called Knowledge Loom; \nand\n  Language supporting the Flint Area Chamber of Commerce in Michigan to \nestablish an ``e-mentoring'' program designed to create a partnership \nbetween employers and students.\n  The bill also includes recommendation language that encourages the \nDepartment of Labor to consider supporting certain projects or \ninstitutions. Examples include:\n  Good Faith Fund of the Arkansas Enterprise Group in Arkadelphia, AR;\n  Las Vegas Culinary Training Center;\n  Western Alaska workforce training initiative;\n  Oregon Institute of Technology; and\n  UNLV Center for Workforce Development and Occupational Research.\n  While each of these programs may deserve funding, it is disturbing \nthat these funds are specifically earmarked and not subject to the \ncompetitive grant process. But there are other job training facilities, \nhealth organizations, and educational sites in America that need \nfinancial aid for their particular programs and are not fortunate \nenough to have an advocate in the appropriations process to ensure that \ntheir funding is earmarked in this bill.\n  There are many important programs impacting the labor force, health \nand education of our nation that depend on the support in this bill. \nHowever, we have diluted the positive impact of these programs by \nsiphoning away funds for specific projects or communities that have \nardent advocates in members on the appropriations committee.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to curb our habit of directing hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars to locality-specific special interests which \nthwarts the very process that is needed to ensure our laws address the \nconcerns and interests of all Americans, not just a few who seek \nspecial protection or advantage.\n  Mr. President, thank you and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to express my dismay that a very \nimportant program to address the health care needs of the uninsured was \nnot included in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill which we passed \ntoday. Now, when our public health infrastructure must be stronger than \never before, it is crucial that we find ways to provide care for \nAmericans who lack health insurance.\n  The Health Community Access Program, or H-CAP, would build on the \nsuccessful Community Access Program, CAP, demonstration program that \ncongress funded last year. CAP has successfully provided grants to \ncommunities to encourage integration among safety net providers of care \nto the uninsured. More then 135 communities have taken advantage of CAP \nto improve health care for Americans who lack health insurance.\n  H-CAP allows communities themselves to design solutions for their \nunique safety-net needs, thus ensuring that the billions of dollars \nthat Congress has already invested in different safety net providers, \ncommunity health centers, family planning clinics, Ryan White AIDS \nproviders, are spent as effectively as possible. By promoting the \nintegration of health care services, H-CAP allow for more preventive \ncare, and good disease management practices that improve overall health \nin the long-run and may reduce the incidence of serious and expensive \nhealth problems among H-CAP recipients later. And because grant \nrecipients must demonstrate that their project will be sustainable \nwithout Federal funding, many communities have successfully found \nsupport through public and private matching donations, in-kind \ncontributions, thus ensuring a relatively small Federal investment.\n  I have worked hard this year with several of my colleagues to \npermanently authorize CAP so that it will receive regular funding and \nsupport from the Federal Government. I also offered an amendment during \ncommittee markup to ensure that this program would be authorized at an \nadequate level.\n  Unfortunately, funding for H-CAP was left out of this bill. I am \npleased that the House did include H-CAP in their bill, which they \nfunded at $105 million, with an additional $15 million for State \nplanning grants. It is my hope that the Senate will include H-CAP in \nthe managers' package, or that this will be resolved during conference \nin the House's favor. I strongly urge my colleagues to make this \nprogram a priority this year.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before we go to the vote, I ask to be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the \nchairman of the subcommittee, for his extraordinary vote on this bill. \nI note for the record the speed with which we passed this bill and the \nconcessions which were made by quite a few Senators to take complicated \nmatters off\n\n[[Page S11458]]\n\nthis bill. We put aside the stem cell issue which I very much wanted to \nhave resolved. We did so in the interest of concluding this bill. We \nhave already started the conferencing issues with both staffs meeting \nearly tomorrow afternoon and Members meeting a little later tomorrow \nafternoon.\n  From our experience in the past, we have seen how difficult it is to \nconference this bill, so we are moving right ahead, and it would be my \nhope, with the example we have set with this complicated appropriations \nbill--on time, with people withdrawing matters to try to expedite the \nprocess--that we would move ahead and complete our work by November 16, \nwhich is when we should finish, and we can go home and take care of \nbusiness in our States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I want \nto respond in kind to my good friend and ranking member, Senator \nSpecter, and thank him and thank all of his staff for a very great \nworking relationship that we have had over many years, especially this \nyear.\n  We have completed our bill in pretty good time. Now we have to go to \nconference. I am convinced we can have a decent conference and get this \nbill back, as Senator Specter said, so we will have it done before we \ngo home for Thanksgiving. So I again thank Senator Specter and his \nstaff for a great working relationship. I especially thank all of the \nstaff: Bettilou Taylor, Mary Dietrich, Sudip Parick, and Emma Ashburn. \nI also thank Ellen Murray, Jim Sourwine, Erik Fatemi, Mark Laisch, Adam \nGluck, Adrienne Hallett, Lisa Bernhardt, and Carol Geagley. A lot of \nthem put in a lot of hours early this year putting this bill together.\n  We have a great bill. It meets the needs of Americans and labor, \nhealth and human services, education, and biomedical research. We have \nmet our obligations. This is the bill that helps lift up all Americans, \nhelps address the needs of our human infrastructure in this country, \nand I believe we have met that obligation to the people of this country \nin this bill.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding me this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/06/senate-section/article/S11458-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. REID.

(a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (referred \n     to in this section as ``LIHEAP'') is the primary Federal \n     program available to help low-income households, the elderly, \n     and individuals with disabilities pay their home energy \n     bills.\n       (2) Congress provided $300,000,000 in emergency funding for \n     LIHEAP in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2001 because \n     regular appropriations were insufficient to help States \n     offset the increase in high utility bills during the winter \n     of 2000-2001.\n       (3) Congress expected that half of the emergency funding \n     would be made available for targeted assistance to States \n     with the most critical needs, and half would be given to help \n     States address unmet energy assistance needs resulting from \n     the extraordinary price increases in home heating fuels and \n     residential natural gas, experienced during the winter of \n     2000-2001.\n       (4) In the winter of 2000-2001, there was a 30 percent \n     increase in households receiving LIHEAP assistance in large \n     part due to the high price of home energy and severe weather.\n       (5) In the winter of 2000-2001, the LIHEAP program was only \n     able to serve 17 percent of the 29,000,000 households \n     eligible for LIHEAP assistance.\n       (6) In the winter of 2000-2001--\n       (A) heating oil prices were 36 percent higher than in the \n     winter of 1999-2000, and residential natural gas cost 42 \n     percent more per cubic foot than in the winter of 1999-2000; \n     and\n       (B) the weather was 10 percent colder than in the winter of \n     1999-2000.\n       (7) In the winter of 2000-2001, record cold weather and \n     high home energy bills took a financial toll on low-income \n     families and the elderly who spend, on average, 19.5 percent \n     of their annual income on energy bills, as compared to 3.7 \n     percent for all other households.\n       (8) Families in the United States need emergency LIHEAP \n     funding to pay home energy bills from the winter of 2000-2001 \n     and restore heat as the succeeding winter approaches.\n       (9) More citizens will need LIHEAP assistance in fiscal \n     year 2002 due to the recent increase in unemployment and the \n     slowing economy.\n       (10) States are being forced to draw down fiscal year 2002 \n     LIHEAP funds in order to address unmet needs from fiscal year \n     2001 and help low-income households pay overdue home energy \n     bills.\n       (11) Emergency LIHEAP funding will provide States with \n     critical resources to help provide assistance to residents.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should immediately release the \n     $300,000,000 in emergency funding for LIHEAP provided by the \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2001.\n       Sec. 517. (a) Section 10 of the Native Hawaiian Health Care \n     Improvement Act (42 U.S.C. 11709) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a) in the matter preceding paragraph \n     (1), by striking ``Kamehameha School/Bishop Estate'' and \n     inserting ``Papa Ola Lokahi''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b)(1)(C), by striking ``Kamehameha \n     School/Bishop Estate'' and inserting ``Papa Ola Lokahi''.\n       (b) Section 338K(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 254s(a)) is amended by striking ``Kamehameha School/\n     Bishop Estate'' and inserting ``Papa Ola Lokahi''.\n       Sec. 518. (a) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the \n     United States shall submit a report to the Committee on \n     Finance and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions of the Senate and to the Committee on Energy and \n     Commerce and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives on the matters described in subsection (b) \n     with respect to the administrative simplification \n     requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and \n     Accountability Act of 1996\n\n[[Page S11471]]\n\n     (Public Law 104-191; 110 Stat. 2021) and programs \n     administered by State and local units of government.\n       (b) Matters Studies.--For purposes of subsection (a), the \n     matters described in this subsection include the following:\n       (1) An assessment of Federal programs administered by State \n     and local units of government, including local educational \n     agencies, explicitly required to implement the administrative \n     simplification requirements under provisions of the Health \n     Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\n       (2) An assessment of other Federal and non-Federal programs \n     administered by State and local units of government, \n     including local educational agencies, that will be required \n     to implement the administrative simplification requirements \n     of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of \n     1996 in order to exchange electronic health data with private \n     sector providers and insurers.\n       (3) An analysis of the costs that will be incurred by State \n     and local units of government, including local educational \n     agencies, to implement the administrative simplification \n     requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and \n     Accountability Act of 1996 in programs described in paragraph \n     (1) or (2).\n       (4) An analysis of Federal resources available to units of \n     State and local government, including local educational \n     agencies, for implementing the administrative simplification \n     requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and \n     Accountability Act of 1996 in programs described in paragraph \n     (1) or (2).\n       (5) An assessment of guidance provided to State and local \n     units of government, including local educational agencies, by \n     the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the \n     Department of Health and Human Services on the implementation \n     of the administrative simplification requirements of the \n     Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 \n     in programs described in paragraph (1) or (2).\n       (6) An assessment of the coordination between the Centers \n     for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Health \n     and Human Services, and other Federal agencies on the \n     implementation of the administrative simplification \n     requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and \n     Accountability Act of 1996 in Federal programs administered \n     by State and local units of government, including local \n     educational agencies, in programs described in paragraph (1) \n     or (2).\n       (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``administrative \n     simplification requirements'' means all standards for \n     transactions, data elements for such transactions, unique \n     health identifiers, code sets, security, and privacy issued \n     pursuant to sections 262 and 264 of the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.\n       Sec. 519.

Under the previous order, the Senate-reported \nlanguage is adopted as the substitute.\n  (The amendment (No. 2106) is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted and Proposed.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as has been agreed to, I am pleased to \nbring the District of Columbia appropriations bill to the floor with my \ncolleague and partner, the Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine. We will speak \nthis afternoon as we bring this bill to the floor and then entertain \nany amendments which should be limited on this bill.\n  I say it is fine work the two of us have done with our committee \nmembers to try to reconcile some of the differences in this bill and to \nbring forward a bill we can support in a bipartisan fashion. I thank \nthe Senator from Ohio for his great work and his diligence, \nparticularly in some very important areas in this legislation that we \nlay out.\n  Also, I recognize the staff who has been very helpful to us in \npreparing this important piece of legislation. They will be with us in \nthe Chamber today.\n  Mr. President, this total budget before us for the District of \nColumbia, our Nation's Capital, and one of the premier cities, if not \nthe premier city in our Nation, is $7.1 billion. I think it is \nimportant to note for the purposes of what we are going to be \ndiscussing this afternoon that $5.3 billion of this money is raised \nthrough the local tax base, local levies, local ordinances governing \ntax collections and fees paid by the residents of the District and \nthose tourists and citizens who visit the District.\n  We also have within this budget $1.7 billion in Federal grants, which \nincludes all of the Federal programs that all of our cities and States \nparticipate in so readily, not the least of which is Medicaid, which is \na very familiar program to many.\n  In addition, the area that we have concentrated our work on mostly is \nthe $400 million included in this District of Columbia appropriations \nbudget for criminal justice, prisons, and courts; under a recent \nstatute the Federal Government has taken on the responsibility to \nhopefully do a better job--a system that was in some disarray with some \nunfortunate mismanagement, and to relieve the District of that \nfinancial responsibility, helping them to get back on good financial \nfooting. So that is the general outline of the moneys in this bill. I \nwill come back to them in some detail.\n  In opening, let me say--and I know Senator DeWine shares the same \nhope with me--we can lead in a new way with this bill, in a new time, a \nmomentous time for our country and for the Nation's Capital since the \nunwarranted and unexpected and tragic attacks of September 11. Some of \nthe terms that have been used to describe the relationships between \nCongress and the District have been old ones such as ``partisanship'' \nand ``bickering,'' a battleground for competing ideologies that might \nhave been better fought on a broader theater or on a broader \nbattleground.\n  Sometimes I think our District has been treated as a national guinea \npig instead of the Nation's Capital. I hope, as we bring the bill to \nthe floor this year, we can use new words to describe this \npartnership--instead of ``partisanship,'' ``partnership''--words such \nas ``trust'' and ``respect,'' respect for local decisionmaking, which I \nthink is so important in this relationship with the District.\n  Instead of a battleground, I hope we can find common ground to build \non some of the principles and issues that are important not only to the \nDistrict but to our country.\n  I would like to think this bill represents a thrust toward economic \nvitality. The ranking member and I believe very strongly in job \ncreation in the District, along with the Mayor and City Council, \nobviously, and we want to do what we can to make sure there is \nvitality.\n  In addition, words such as accountability, transparency, excellence \nin management, excellence in the education system, and investments in \nstrengthening the health care system of the District are issues about \nwhich our committee feels very strongly.\n  I commend the work of the Mayor and the City Council, and so many \nothers, particularly the Chief Financial Officer and others on the \nfinancial front who have helped to lead the District to a sound \nfinancial footing.\n  It is important to note that this is the first budget we will be \nconsidering as a Congress in 5 years that is post-control board. The \ncontrol board that was in effect and helped bring the District back to \nrelatively strong financial health, even in a time of crisis and \nchallenge, came to an end on September 30. This is the first budget to \ncome forward without the control board being in place.\n  As the control board has moved off the scene, what has moved front \nand center are the authorities and responsibilities of the Chief \nFinancial Officer. So many of the charges to keep the District in good \nfinancial stead will now lie with the Chief Financial Officer, and it \nis my hope that throughout this year and the coming years we will be \nable to strengthen that office and the systems within the DC government \nto make sure it is clear who is accountable for what and that there is \ntransparency and accountability, because without strong finances the \nDistrict will never be able to reach all of its many worthy goals, some \nof which I have just outlined.\n  I wanted to note that before I get into my prepared remarks.\n  The second principle that is embedded in this mark that I present is \nthe elimination of some of the time-worn restrictions on the ways the \nDistrict can spend some of its local funding. In our States, we all \nhave cities and jurisdictions that want to be and should be autonomous \nin terms of the ordinances they propose and on what they choose to \nspend their money.\n  Too often, in my opinion, Congress has stepped in to try to \nmicromanage, supersede, mandate, and attach too many strings to the way \nin which this city wanted to spend its own resources. Again, it is its \nown tax dollars spent by its own elected board. I have tried in \nappropriate ways to eliminate in this mark many of those riders or \nmeasures that were placed not because of the issues to which they \npertain, but because of the principle.\n  I want this mark to suggest that we are entering an era, hopefully, \nof mutual respect and partnership, trust and respect of local \ndecisionmaking. I would expect that for the city of New Orleans, for \nthe city of Baton Rouge, and for the city of Lafayette. Senator DeWine, \nI am sure, expects that for the city of Cleveland. We should have no \nless of a level of appreciation for the District of Columbia.\n  The third principle of this bill is a significant investment in child \nwelfare. This has been one of the mayor's top priorities. It has been, \nI believe, the citizens' top priority as, unfortunately, 200 children \nin the last 10 years have lost their lives at the hands of people who \nsupposedly love them, supposedly were caring for them. They have been \nmurdered, tortured, and abused because the system in DC is not strong \nenough. This bill represents an extremely significant investment in \nthat respect.\n\n  Counting what the city is putting up and what the Senator from Ohio \nand I have determined is an appropriate investment reaches almost $40 \nmillion in new money to create and to strengthen the court system \ncreating a new family court that will be complementary to this effort \nin hopes to correct this terrible situation and reverse this trend. I \ncan state this is one of the best provisions in this bill.\n  In addition, particularly due to 9-11, the $16 million for security \ninvestments for the District is to help the District establish better \nmanagement and security plans, and I will go into that in more detail.\n  The other principles are investments in education, the environment, \nand children's health. Investments are an important part of any growth \nplan for a city or for a State. We can tighten budgets, we can have \nfiscal discipline, we can try to keep those budgets in balance, but the \nsmart money goes to those cities that are making long-term strategic \ninvestments.\n  We can never overinvest if we spend it wisely in education or the \nphysical environment, such as bringing back the Anacostia River, the \nNavy Yard, which\n\n[[Page S11477]]\n\nis an important developmental opportunity for the District, and in \nchildren's health, which Senator DeWine has led.\n  To restate, the tragic events of September 11 have reminded us all of \nthe safety, security, and financial strength of the District, our \nNation's Capital, and how it serves as a vital symbol of our national \nresolve. This bill, as I said, serves the needs of the District's \npolice, fire, public health, and emergency management services--the \npeople who are on the front lines today, who were on the front lines on \nSeptember 11, and who will be there when we have another attack. We \nhope we do not have another attack, but we are prepared for one and \ngetting better prepared every day.\n  Given the strategic importance of maintaining stability in the \nNation's Capital, the Appropriations Committee decided to maintain the \noriginal funding for the IMF conference that was canceled. Instead of \ncanceling the funding, we reoriented that funding to be used for these \nimportant security needs.\n  In the days after the attack, local officials and the media began to \ndetail some of the shortfalls in the present emergency protocol. \nSpecifically, articles in the Washington Post highlighted the need for \ncoordination and improvement. I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator \nSarbanes for their input on this subject, as well as Delegate Norton, \nwho is in the Chamber, along with the Mayor and others as we worked out \na security plan that is robust, a security plan that has redundancy \nbuilt into it, a security plan that will work for the residents of the \nDistrict, for the thousands of people from the region who visit daily \nto work and enjoy the sites, and the millions of people who travel \nthroughout the year to celebrate in the Nation's Capital.\n  I expect Mayor Williams and his staff to give attention to this real \nand immediate concern. I thank them for the work they are doing, and I \nlook forward to working with them diligently in the months ahead.\n  Fiscal year 2002 will be an important year for the District. Overall, \nthe District has moved from a negative accumulated fund balance of $518 \nmillion in fiscal year 1996 to a positive fund balance of $464 million. \nThat is almost a swing of $1 billion in 5 years. That took a lot of \nhard work and a lot of dedication. There was a lot of anguish and a lot \nof disagreement about how that should happen, but it did happen. The \nDistrict is in a positive financial posture due to a lot of hard work, \nand we want to keep it that way with appropriate mechanisms, even with \nthe Control Board moving out of its area of responsibility. The city \nmet all the requirements under the 1005 Financial Responsibility and \nManagement Assistance Act and is no longer under the general \nsupervision of the Control Board.\n\n  The Chief Financial Officer will begin to fulfill many of the \nfinancial management functions previously performed by the board. The \ntermination of several significant receiverships, particularly in child \nwelfare, indicates a stronger, more effective, local government.\n  With each success, the District gains more independence. This bill \nmaintains Congress' commitment to ensure that District officials have \nthe tools they need to continue to serve DC and those who visit the \ncapital.\n  While this is often a challenging role for the Federal Government to \nmake, it is an important one. It is imperative Congress work with the \ncity so the foundation of resources are in place to ensure this \nindependence will result in success. To accomplish this, the \nAppropriations Committee has worked diligently to forge a partnership \nfor progress between Congress and DC local elected leaders. Determined \nto be a supportive partner of the city's agenda, we have done our best \nto construct a Federal budget that supplements but not supplants the \ncity's efforts to fulfill its promise to enrich the lives of the \ncitizens in the District.\n  The bill before us is now evidence the committee shares the city's \nvision for quality education, a clean environment, improved child and \nfamily welfare, and continued financial strength. In each of these key \nareas, we have worked with local officials to determine the best course \nof action for all concerned.\n  Over the past 10 years, the District of Columbia has struggled to \nreview and reform its child welfare system. I am certain my colleague \nfrom Ohio will speak in more detail about this because he has been such \nan extraordinary leader in this particular area.\n  First, under the guidance of a court-appointed receiver and now under \nthe direction of a newly-appointed Child and Family Services Agency, \nthis committee would be hard-pressed to find a greater priority than \nthe well-being and safety of the children of the District. For this \nreason, as I said earlier, we have included a significant increase in \nthe funding of a family court reform effort, the Child and Family \nServices Agency, and Court-Appointed Special Advocates, CASA.\n  The ranking member and I believe strongly that investing more money \nwithout reforms, without accountability, without principles such as one \nfamily/one judge, without principles such as people should choose to do \nthis job because they want to, not because they are forced to, that \nlawyers should take these cases because they want to, not because they \nare forced to, and the principles that volunteers in courtrooms looking \nout for the interests of the child will make a difference in that \nchild's life and in that family's life, are crucial to the \nunderpinnings of the reform.\n\n  I will be pleased to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nand in both Houses of Congress toward that end.\n  In addition, we have made note of the progress made by many DC public \nschools. In particular, the committee has included language and funding \nintended to serve as a catalyst for the ever-growing DC charter school \nmovement. However, I am concerned about the current financial and \nmanagement challenges of the schools and hope to work with the city on \nthis front more specifically.\n  Let me say as an aside, before I get into my conclusion about \nschools, we all represent hundreds and thousands of schools in our own \nparticular States and each one of us in our own way has worked with our \nmayors and our superintendents and our Governors to help reform and \nuplift and to build a stronger school system. In my mind, never has it \nbeen more important than in the post-September 11 attacks to think \nabout what our school systems mean to our democracy.\n  Let me be as clear as I can possibly be on this subject. Pretty good \nis just not good enough. Schools that do all right is just not going to \ncut it or make it happen in the world that we face today. In these \nchallenges, where it is important for us to understand our country \nwell, to understand other countries well, other cultures and other \nreligions, it is important for people to be well educated and well \ntrained and well read and well versed on history and art and \nphilosophy. It is important for our children to have the finest \neducation.\n  Why? So they can become the kind of citizens that not only can govern \nin this Nation but literally lead the world. The world looks to America \nfor leadership. They do not look necessarily to the elected officials \nof our country for leadership, although we are the voice of the people, \nbut as the people of the United States that must lead. People can lead \nbetter when they are well educated and well prepared, well read about \nthe actual character and conditions of this world.\n  I hope we really appreciate how important it is for not only the \nschools in the District of Columbia to work at a higher and more \nexcellent level but how important it is for all of our schools. I am \nwilling to take on some battles there because we have to think outside \nof the box, in a new way. We are going to do that in a bipartisan way, \nin an appropriate way, to help strengthen the schools for every child \nin this District, in our Nation's Capital, which is host to people from \nmany places around the world, to provide a quality education, a \nwonderful education, not with just a pretty good teacher, not with a \ngood teacher but with a great teacher, a well-motivated and well-\ntrained teacher, to give children the kind of education in partnership \nwith their parents, to provide that education for the children to \ncreate better schools, a stronger community, a stronger Nation and \ncitizens that can truly lead the world in the decades ahead.\n\n[[Page S11478]]\n\n  Finally, I am proud to say this bill includes funding to support \neducation, public health, economic development projects. As the mayor \nand I have both said, a community with clean parks, beautiful waterways \nand safe streets is one in which people are proud to live. So if the \nschools are excellent, they serve as an economic catalyst for \nbusinesses that want to stay in the District and grow. When there are \nclean parks and places where children can play, when the waterways are \nclean enough to recreate and to swim in, and when the streets are safe, \nthat is what makes a great community all the more great, and that is \nwhat our hope is for this District and for all of the cities that we \nrepresent in this great Nation.\n\n  I want to say particularly how impressed I am with the work of Mayor \nWilliams, who has worked tirelessly on this and many other fronts. This \nis home for the Federal Government and its employees. It seems only \nright that we should do our fair share to see the District remains the \nbeautiful place it is.\n  Amendments may be offered to this bill to restrict the District's \nability to use its own locally collected tax revenues to operate \nspecific programs hundreds of cities across this country operate. I \nhope those amendments will not be offered, but if they are, we will \ndebate them with a limited time and move on so we can get this \nimportant bill passed and signed by the President.\n  In many parts of the country, some of these issues are controversial. \nThroughout the entire country, the issue of the direction of local \nfunds is something that is universally, I believe, supported.\n  Let me conclude by thanking my ranking member and by saying I am \nproud to offer this mark, which puts the District in financial balance \nwith a financial surplus, that outlines some of the strong principles \nof education, investments in health and in the environment which will \nmake this city even stronger. With the emphasis on security and \ninvestments we have made, I think this mark will serve this city well \nfor the next many years and in the decades to come.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Landrieu for her comments \nbut, more importantly, for the great work she has done over the last \nfew months. It has been a great pleasure to work with the Senator from \nLouisiana. Her dedication to her job, her dedication to children in the \nDistrict of Columbia, comes out every single day I meet with her and \nevery time we talk about these issues. This bill is truly a reflection \nof that dedication.\n  Senator Landrieu and I have really been partners in our efforts to \nensure that the children who come into contact with the court system in \nthe District of Columbia are placed in a safe and a stable environment.\n  The bill before us today will go a long way toward ending the \nsuffering of innocent children by providing resources to strengthen the \nDistrict's family court system. Today, as Senator Landrieu has \noutlined, we are providing $140.2 million for the DC court system, an \nincrease of approximately $35 million over last year's enacted level. \nThe majority of these funds will be dedicated to improving the family \ncourts so case workers can adequately address the individual needs of \nthe children and the families who come into contact with the court \nsystem. These funds will help implement the reforms outlined in the \nfamily court bill that Senator Landrieu and I have introduced. These \nreforms will help the District hire, train, and equip additional staff \nand construct additional courtrooms.\n  It is not a question of money. That is why we have, as Senator \nLandrieu outlined and talked about a moment ago, introduced the family \ncourt bill, a bill I hope we will have within a short period of time \nfor debate and for passage.\n  We are fulfilling today part of our commitment to the children of the \nDistrict of Columbia. We need the reforms outlined in our DC family \ncourt bill, and we need the money contained in this bill to implement \nthose reforms.\n  The family court bill we will take up later has a fundamental \nprinciple. And, that is that we have judges who, every single day, \nspend 100 percent of their time worrying about the children in the \nDistrict of Columbia. ``Family court'' means exactly what the title \nindicates: The judges deal with family problems. They deal with \nchildren every single day. We need these judges to do this full time--\nwe don't want them to be spending their time on felony trials or other \ncivil cases. We need them to develop the expertise in family law. \nTeachers tell me it takes 4 or 5 years before an eager new teacher \nbecomes a seasoned, experienced, and excellent teacher. The same is \ntrue with a judge. Our bill provides that longevity, that experience, \nthat training, to focus on our children.\n  Our family court bill also has the basic principle: One judge, one \nfamily--again, this is so the children are not moved from judge to \njudge to judge. There needs to be an institutional memory with that \nfamily. If that judge knows whom he is dealing with, knows what has \nhappened in the past, that judge can better deal with that family. That \nis the family court bill. It is not before us today, but it will be \nbefore the Senate, we hope, in the next few weeks.\n  I don't have to remind anyone in this Chamber or anyone who reads the \nnewspaper about what a mess the District of Columbia child welfare \nsystem has been and still is today. There are a lot of good people \nworking very hard to change that. I believe we have to do our part. The \nbill before the Senate is a downpayment--a downpayment--on that job and \nthat obligation.\n  Next, this bill contains $147.3 million for the court services and \noffender supervision agency, an increase of $34.7 million over last \nyear's level. With these funds, the District will have the resources to \nprovide drug treatment services to over 2,700 offenders in the District \nof Columbia criminal justice system, an increase in treatment slots of \nabout 54 percent over last year. Initially, funds will be used to \nrepair and renovate the District drug facilities. Some of the money \nwill be used to hire additional drug treatment counselors.\n  This increase, which meets the President's request, is particularly \nimportant because 80 percent of the individuals in the District of \nColumbia criminal justice system have a substance abuse problem. This \nis not unique to the District of Columbia. I saw it when I was a county \nprosecuting attorney. I saw it when I was lieutenant governor in Ohio. \nOne of my responsibilities was to oversee the Ohio criminal justice \nsystem. Roughly that 80 percent of the people in Ohio prisons and our \njails had substance abuse problems. That is true for the District of \nColumbia, as well.\n  Spending money on treatment of people behind bars may not be the most \npopular thing to do, but it does make sense. It is cost effective. It \nis the right thing to do. The sad truth is we already pay to house, \nfeed, and clothe the prisoners. Doesn't it make sense, while we have \ntheir attention, while they cannot leave, that we work to try to give \nthem some drug treatment while they are in prison or jail? Almost every \nsingle prisoner will someday walk out the door and return to society. \nIt makes good sense to spend money for drug treatment. We do this and \nprovide a significant increase in the funding of this bill.\n  Third, the bill includes $16 million to provide security protection \nfor those living and working in the District of Columbia. The September \n11 Pentagon tragedy and the tragedy in New York and Pennsylvania \nclearly demonstrated the need in every district in this country to have \nan integrated emergency management system in place. It certainly \ndemonstrated that need in the District of Columbia. This funding will \npay for a coordinated emergency plan for the District of Columbia in \nnational security situations including, of course, terrorist threats, \nprotests, natural disasters, or other unanticipated events.\n\n  As a condition of receiving these funds, in this bill, we are \nrequiring that the District develop and submit to Congress a \ncomprehensive plan to improve security measures and procedures in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Fourth, the bill includes funding for the local Federal Police Mobile \nWireless Interoperability Project to provide equipment to facilitate \ndirect communication to between the D.C. Metropolitan Police, the U.S. \nSecret Service, the U.S. Park Police, and the U.S. Capitol Police. We \nwere pushing this prior\n\n[[Page S11479]]\n\nto the September 11 attacks. The recent tragedy highlighted how \nimportant it is that the District's law enforcement teams are able to \ncommunicate effectively. It is important in every city in this country, \nbut in this city we have a unique problem. Our unique problem is we \nhave so many different agencies that have authority: The D.C. \nMetropolitan Police, the U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Park Police, and \nthe U.S. Capitol Police. This effort will coincide with the integrated \nemergency planning to help enhance the District's overall response to \nsecurity threats.\n  Briefly, I will mention three other important initiatives included in \nthis bill. I am pleased the bill includes funds for the Green Door \nMental Health Clinic to expand the facility. Our friend and colleague \nfrom New Mexico, Senator Domenici, has been a very strong advocate and \nsupporter of this program. I thank him for his strong support and his \ndedication. The Green Door is a community program for people with \nsevere and persistent mental illness. The Green Door program serves \nabout 300 people. Of the people it serves, 70 percent are African \nAmerican. Of those 300 people, about 75 percent are schizophrenic.\n  In a separate, but equally important provision of the bill, we have \nincluded funds to assist the D.C. Safe Kids Coalition to expand their \npermanent child safety seat fitting station programs. These stations \nare vital to help reduce motor vehicle-related deaths and injuries--the \nleading cause of injury-related deaths among children age 14 and under. \nFunds will help the District distribute additional child safety seats \nto low-income families.\n  The Safe Kids Coalition is a group I worked with in Ohio. I have seen \ntheir great work in Ohio. I have seen their great work in the District \nof Columbia. I have seen it across our country. They are literally \nsaving lives every single day. They are doing things that matter. The \nsmall amount of money we have included in this bill, I believe, will \nhelp them save the lives of children in the District of Columbia.\n\n  Finally, this bill provides funding to the Children's National \nMedical Center to help renovate its facilities, update its equipment, \nand provide private areas for families. Each year, the children's \nhospital in the District of Columbia provides care to approximately \n200,000 infants, toddlers, youngsters, teenagers, from every State in \nthe Union. Kids from all over the country are treated here. Kids travel \nhere, their families travel here. This children's hospital really has a \nnational focus.\n  The Center conducts Federal research for the National Institutes of \nHealth and supports pediatric specialists who are nationally and world \nrenowned. We are very fortunate to have the children's hospital here in \nthe District of Columbia, the Children's National Medical Center. We do \nserve children, not just in the District, but throughout the world.\n  Anyone who has a child has probably at one time or the other taken \nthat child to a children's hospital. My wife, Fran, and I have had that \nexperience on several occasions. Each time we go into that setting as \nvery apprehensive, worried parents, I can tell you it is a great relief \nto deal with professionals who know what they are doing, who know \nchildren are not just miniature adults, that they are different and \nthey have to be dealt with differently. That is something with which I \nthink we need to help the District of Columbia and help private \nagencies that are helping the National Children's Medical Center to \nimprove its facilities, to improve its research to better help with our \nchildren. So we have provided money in this bill to do that.\n  Let me again thank my colleague, Senator Landrieu, for her great \nwork. It has been a pleasure to work with her. As she has indicated, we \ndo have maybe two or three amendments that we will, I think, dispose of \ntomorrow. I anticipate it will not take us very long to debate these \nissues. There were a couple of issues we just could not get resolved in \nthe committee. They will be resolved within an hour or two tomorrow, \nand I hope we will then be able to move, by about mid-day, to final \npassage of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, we will be open for amendments under the \ntime agreement in just a few moments. I thought I would add a couple of \nclosing remarks. We may have amendments presented tonight. We are \nanticipating probably those amendments will be presented in the \nmorning.\n  I wanted, for the record, to also thank not only my distinguished \ncolleague from Ohio and ranking member but also the other members of \nour committee for their fine work. I thank the Senator from Illinois, \nMr. Dick Durbin, the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, and the \nSenator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed, for their work and dedication to \nhelping us bring this bill to the floor, working on all these issues in \ngreat detail, conducting meetings, conducting phone conversations, \nconferences, meeting with House Members to resolve many of these issues \nand to work with the local officials in such a respectful, progressive, \nand forward-looking way.\n  I also thank my colleague and counterpart in the House, Congressman \nKnollenberg from Michigan, for his fine work as a chair on the House \nside, and also the Congressman from Philadelphia, Mr. Fattah, for his \nwork on these important issues.\n  I want to mention a couple of important projects. Senator DeWine \nmentioned a few. I see some other Senators are coming to the floor--\nSenator Sessions and others--but I would like to take a moment to \nmention a few other projects that are in this bill.\n  One is an investment of a half-million dollars that I think will help \nus begin to build up for the city--and with the partnership of the \nFederal Government and with the city government and related agencies \nand, most important, with the families of the District--a partnership \nto help us build and develop, over time, hopefully some of the finest \nrecreation sports fields and facilities in the Nation.\n  As Senator DeWine said, as a parent of eight children--I am a parent \nof two and actually am a soccer mom on weekends here in the District, \nand in Louisiana to some extent also--I am visiting and spending a lot \nof time with soccer moms and soccer dads. I played a little baseball in \nmy day. I know, growing up in New Orleans, how important sports and \nathletics are to the development of our family. I watched how important \nthat was for many other families. I think here in the District there \nare some wonderful opportunities of which we are not fully taking \nadvantage.\n  I shared this with the mayor. He expressed not only his commitment \nbut enthusiasm. The city council and its members and leaders in the \ncity, expressed their enthusiasm for working with Congress in \npartnership to help create better opportunities for our children in \nevery neighborhood and every area of the city to participate in \norganized sports and to have opportunities for soccer fields, baseball \ndiamonds, and basketball courts. In this particular bill we have a \nstudy to be conducted for possible locations--close, in this region--\nthat could help us build the kind of facilities that are now available \nin jurisdictions just right outside of the District, in Maryland and \nVirginia.\n  Bond issues have been passed. Great corporate partnerships have come \ntogether. So if you live in Maryland or live in Virginia, the chances \nare on the weekend you can get to a soccer field that is actually well \nmaintained and well manicured and kids and parents can have so much fun \nand enjoy the beautiful scenery and great opportunity that sports \nbring to teach children lessons and bring families together.\n\n  Unfortunately, we do not have those kinds of extensive facilities in \nthe District. It is one of my goals to work with the many different \norganizations in the city, and the elected officials, to help build a \nfoundation.\n  In addition, I understand the District itself would like to host the \nOlympics in 2012, which is a wonderful goal. It is going to be quite a \nchallenge. Building these sports facilities is not only great for \nimproving the quality of life and helping give children and families \nthe kind of experience we all hope for in the communities in which we \ngrow up, but it is also a great economic opportunity for the District \nto position itself as a potential contender for the Olympics. So I am \nvery keen and very passionate and committed to this particular area.\n  In addition, I thank Senator DeWine for his work with Children's \nHospital\n\n[[Page S11480]]\n\nand for the investments he has made in creating the children and family \ncourt system. Let me take a minute on that particular subject.\n  We hope every child in this country and the world will stay in the \nfamily to which they were born. I think it is what God intended. It is \nwhat we hope for and work for every day. But there are facts, \ntragedies, and circumstances where children cannot stay with their \nbiological parents. There are some tragedies that have occurred in this \nDistrict and in places around the Nation. We are hoping to build a \nbipartisan consensus in this country, and I might say in the world, on \nthe simple notion that all children deserve a family to call their own. \nChildren should not be raised in hospitals, left to grow up alone on \nthe streets, to comfort themselves when they are sick, to put \nthemselves in bed, and get themselves up in the morning at ages at \nwhich you could not believe they could be capable of doing that.\n  It is incumbent upon our Government, working with the private sector \nand nonprofit organizations, to make sure every child has a family. We \nwant them to stay with their biological families if at all possible; \nbut if not, to not leave them alone or in a situation that is not \npermanent, and move them to adoption.\n  So investing in a new court system, starting up a family court, is a \ngreat step toward that goal of helping children to be connected to at \nleast one loving, responsible adult.\n  I am proud to say that adoptions in the District are up, but we still \nhave too many children in foster care.\n  I can't give this speech nearly as well as the mayor himself, who \ncame out of foster care at the age of 4. He was basically declared to \nbe mentally unfit at that age. His emotional capacity was questioned. \nHis adoptive mother, Ms. Williams, gave a beautiful testimony. She said \nshe looked at this child and could see something very special in his \neyes and decided to take him into her family. She raised him, and the \nrest is history. He went on to a fine university and is now mayor of \nthis great city.\n  I hope people can see hope in the mayor of this city, in him and his \nadoptive family, and what can happen when the system works well--to \nconnect the child who needed a mother and father, a mother and father \nwho wanted a child, and to see how this community and Nation will \nbenefit when that system works.\n  This bill is committed to laying a foundation to help this system \nwork for the District and hopefully serve as a model for the Nation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been listening to the Senator's \nopening remarks, and especially to what she just stated, and her \nhumility. She can speak with great authority about adoption. The \nSenator and her husband, Frank, have two beautiful children, Mary \nShannon and Connor. I remember going to her office, and Mary Shannon \nwas there on the floor, having recently come into her life and all of \nours.\n  I am sure that Mayor Williams can give a very dramatic speech. \nSenator Landrieu speaks from experience, and she speaks volumes. As \nchairman of the subcommittee, she is focusing on that which needed to \nbe focused for a long time in the District of Columbia. I think that \nsays a lot.\n  I want everyone within the sound of her voice to understand that she \nspeaks about something which is not read in a book. They adopted two \nbeautiful children. They are very happy and very fortunate children.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I appreciate those \nremarks. Frank and I are blessed. As adoptive parents, we can't believe \nthat we are so blessed to have an opportunity to take children into our \nhome. People think you are doing them a great favor, but actually they \ndo a great favor by just being the beautiful children that they are.\n  As the Senator said, I am an advocate because I have seen the benefit \nof not only adoptive children but as an adoptive family. I have seen \nthe benefits of birth families and birth mothers who have made such a \nselfless decision. Given all of the desires expressed, and the needs of \nthe parties, the least our government can do is to invest some money \nand some time to put in structure and accountability so these matches \ncan be made. Our whole society benefits.\n  I am proud that this is in this bill.\n  I hope this bill will be the beginning of new investments in the \nDistrict public school system, particularly giving more choices for \nparents in the District for charter schools, for magnet schools, and \nfor more public school choice, by helping to return ownership of the \nschools to the communities and to the parents, by breaking down some of \nthe systematic barriers that fight against excellence and greatness, \nwhich keeps us thinking that mediocrity is what we strive for when that \nis not the case. We strive for excellence. We strive for greatness in \nour schools. We have to keep pushing forward, thinking in different \nways and helping us stabilize the middle class as it grows in the \nDistrict, both black and white and people of all races. We cannot \nstabilize the middle class without an excellent school system. I want \nto work with members of local government to help do that.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for S. 1543, the District of Columbia \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  The Senate bill provides $408 million in discretionary budget \nauthority, which will result in new outlays in 2002 of $368 million. \nWhen outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the Senate bill total $416 million in 2002. \nThe Senate bill is at its section 302(b) allocation for both budget \nauthority and outlays. The bill does not provide any emergency-\ndesignated funding. In addition, the bill approves the District \ngovernment's budget for 2002, including granting it the authority to \nspend $7.154 billion of local funds.\n  The Congress is far behind in passing the 13 regular appropriations \nbills for 2002. Much of this delay is the result of the extraordinary \nevents of this year. I am hopeful that the bipartisan agreement reached \nbetween the President and congressional appropriations on the 2002 \nbudget earlier this month will result in a quick completion of the 2002 \nappropriations. It is particularly important that the Senate act \nexpeditiously to pass this bill, which not only provides a limited \namount of federal funding to the District, but also, through the \nenactment of its budget, allows the city to obligate and spend its own \nlocal revenues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget committee \nscoring of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    S. 1543, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002, SPENDING\n                    COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority...............          408            0          408\n  Outlays........................          416            0          416\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............          408            0          408\n  Outlays........................          416            0          416\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget Authority...............          398            0          398\n  Outlays........................          408            0          408\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............          342            0          342\n  Outlays........................          362            0          362\n \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............            0            0            0\n  Outlays........................            0            0            0\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget Authority...............           10            0           10\n  Outlays........................            8            0            8\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............           66            0           66\n  Outlays........................           54            0           54\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ For enforcement purposes, the budget committee compares the Senate-\n  reported bill to the Senate 302(b) allocation.\n \nNotes.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, in just a few minutes we will be voting \non a Federal judge nominee for the Federal District Court of the \nNorthern District\n\n[[Page S11481]]\n\nof Alabama, Karon Owen Bowdre. Senator Shelby and I are pleased that \nPresident Bush chose to nominate her. Her nomination moved through the \ncommittee and will be up for a vote in just a few minutes.\n  Karon Bowdre is a first-rate judicial nominee. Karon Bowdre has been \na student, a legal practitioner, and a professor of law. She graduated \ncum laude from the Cumberland School of Law, where she served as \nassociate editor of the Cumberland Law Review. Cumberland may be the \nlargest school in Alabama. It is an excellent law school.\n  After graduating from law school Mrs. Bowdre served as a law clerk \nfor the Honorable J. Foy Guin, Jr. in the Federal District of Northern \nAlabama, the court to which she has been nominated. She is very \nfamiliar with the Federal district court, having clerked and practiced \nthere.\n  Judge Guin, a wonderful Federal judge, has taken senior status. He \nwas number one in his class at the University of Alabama School of Law. \nHis father was an excellent practitioner. I had the honor of practicing \nin his law firm immediately after his going on the bench in Birmingham. \nMrs. Bowdre has a good background. She clerked for the Federal judge in \nthe very district that she will be serving. Prior to becoming a full-\ntime professor, Mrs. Bowdre spent several years as associate and \npartner, practicing law at the well-respected law firm of Rives & \nPeterson in Birmingham, our State's largest city. Rives & Peterson is \nan outstanding firm and her serving as partner in that firm is proof of \nher legal ability.\n  During a substantial part of that practice, she litigated a number of \ncases in the Federal court system. For the last 11 years, Mrs. Bowdre \nhas been teaching students about the rule of law. As a professor and \ndirector of the Legal Research and Writing Program at the Cumberland \nSchool of Law, she has authored numerous articles on insurance law and \nlegal ethics. She has established a reputation as a professor who \ninsists on quality work from students, and high ideals and high ethics.\n  In addition, she has been called to testify as a legal expert on \ninsurance issues and has been involved in lecturing at Continuing Legal \nEducation seminars.\n  Mrs. Bowdre knows how to deal with lawyers, with witnesses, and with \nparties. These experiences have no doubt prepared her for service on \nthe Federal bench.\n  Her reputation as a lawyer and as a scholar has earned her broad \nsupport in the community. I would like to quote a letter submitted by \nperhaps one of the most successful plaintiff lawyers in Alabama, Jere \nBeasley. Even though Mrs. Bowdre, as an insurance defense attorney, was \ngenerally arguing the opposite position of Mr. Beasley, he had this to \nsay on her behalf.\n\n       I have known Karon for a number of years and believe that \n     she will be an outstanding U.S. District Judge. She will have \n     wide acceptance from lawyers . . . regardless of whether they \n     represent plaintiffs or defendants. While my practice is one \n     that represents plaintiffs only, I am convinced that Karon \n     will be fair and competent to all concerned and that is all \n     that any lawyer should ask of a judge. She is highly \n     qualified and, in my opinion, will do an outstanding job.\n\n  Her integrity, experience, and commitment to the rule of law are \noutstanding.\n  I commend Chairman Leahy for placing her on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee agenda last month and for moving the nomination. I recommend \nher to my colleagues in the Senate without reservation.\n  I served for almost 15 years--12 years as U.S. Attorney and 2\\1/2\\ as \nAssistant U.S. Attorney in the Federal court. Those 15 years of \npractice full-time in Federal court gave me a basis to appreciate the \nvalue of a good Federal judge. When you go to court every day and you \nare there before a Federal judge who has a lifetime appointment, they \ncan afford to be irritable, if they so choose, and there is nothing you \ncan do about it. This knowledge makes you realize the importance of \ngood Federal judges.\n  I am confident that Mrs. Bowdre will be the kind of judge that will \nserve the litigants and lawyers well that appear before her. Day after \nday and hour after hour she will give her best service to the country, \nand she will give her honest and best rulings in case after case that \ncomes before her. You can't ask for more than that.\n\n  She has integrity, outstanding legal ability, and broad experience. \nShe will be an outstanding Federal judge. I am honored to have \nsubmitted her name. I am confident she will be confirmed in a few \nminutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/06/senate-section/article/S11481-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11481-S11483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AVIATION SECURITY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from \nLouisiana and the ranking Senator from Ohio for their work on the \nDistrict of Columbia Appropriations Act. I am pleased to support it, \npleased as a member of the Appropriations Committee to support it.\n  I intend to support the judge my colleague from Alabama just \ndescribed. That judge has a commendable record of public service. I am \npleased to support the President's nomination.\n  I rise to comment about something that is not in the appropriations \nbill. Then I will speak on an amendment I intend to offer. First, on \nthe issue of aviation security, I believe we are or probably have \nappointed conferees from the Commerce Committee on the issue of writing \nan aviation security bill in conference between the House and Senate. I \nwill be one of those conferees.\n  It is a shame we have had to wait this long. We passed a bill dealing \nwith aviation security 100-to-0 in the Senate. It wasn't a great \ncontroversy, just judging by the margin of the vote--100-to-0--people \nhere believing that we needed to improve security of the country's \nairlines.\n  We need to give people a feeling of security that when they board an \nairplane their fellow passengers have been properly screened, that we \nhave made certain there is not a risk that we are going to have \nadditional hijackings. The airport security bill was very important. We \npassed it 100-to-0. The House of Representatives dragged their feet and \nwaited and waited and didn't act.\n  Finally, they acted. They passed a piece of legislation that is \ndeficient. Their concern was that the Senate bill would have \n``federalized'' workers at airports who are screening baggage and other \nrelated activities dealing with security.\n\n  Let me describe a couple of things about security. Yesterday I was in \nChicago. I came back by commercial air from Chicago to Washington, DC. \nAs I picked up the newspaper in the Chicago airport, I read about the \nevents of the previous day, Sunday, at O'Hare Airport. Most people have \nnow heard of that circumstance on Sunday, but let me describe it for a \nmoment. It is not an isolated instance.\n  A fellow named Subash Bahadar Gurung, age 27, was arrested Sunday in \nChicago on charges that the night before he tried to bring knives, \nchemical spray, and a stun gun onto an airplane.\n  Here is the frightening part of all this: This fellow, who according \nto news reports is in this country illegally, got through the initial \nscreening with the X-ray machine and reached the gate to board his \nairplane. At the screening they discovered he had two knives. They \nconfiscated the knives, then let him go to the gate.\n  At the gate, he went through an expanded screening and they opened \neverything he had and discovered he had seven additional knives, a can \nof mace, and a stun gun. I don't know if the guy is a terrorist, but I \ndo know he is stupid. Nine knives, mace, and a stun gun, showing up at \nthe airport?\n  There is something else that is wrong: He got all the way to the gate \nwith seven of his knives, a stun gun, and a can of mace.\n  The Secretary of Transportation had a lot to say about that \nyesterday. But the point is this: We don't have a security system in \nplace that gives people confidence. Just ask yourself: If someone can \nget through O'Hare Airport, one of our largest airports, can get \nthrough the screening process with seven knives and a stun gun and a \ncan of mace, what kind of confidence does that give people who are \ntraveling?\n  Let me give you a couple of other suggested incidents that ought to \ngive us cause for concern. In Westchester County Airport in New York \nlast Friday, a woman was arrested on charges of criminal possession of \na weapon\n\n[[Page S11482]]\n\nwhen she had a palm-size .22-caliber handgun that showed up on an x-ray \nof her luggage. So they caught her at the screen.\n  She said: Well, this gun belonged to a boyfriend and besides, it \nhadn't shown up on an earlier flight.\n  That gives you a lot of security, doesn't it, a real feeling of \nsecurity?\n  She said: It is my boyfriend's gun, but it didn't show up on the \nprevious flight when I went through.\n  We can go to Tuesday, a Mississippi man in New Orleans was able to \nget through the security checkpoint with a loaded gun in his carry-on \nbag, and he was allowed to board a plane at Louis Armstrong \nInternational Airport. He got on the plane with this loaded gun. He \nsaid he didn't realize the handgun was in his briefcase. He discovered \nit in the middle of the flight and immediately handed it over to a \nflight attendant. He said it was a pure accident.\n  The question is, How do you get through a checkpoint, a screening \nprocess, with a loaded handgun in your briefcase?\n  Let me describe the company that was screening at O'Hare Airport in \nChicago this past weekend. Argenbright apparently is the largest \ncompany that employs screeners around the country. They employ \nscreeners at more than 33 airports in the United States. In fact, I \nbelieve they are an international company that provides services around \nthe world.\n  They were fined $1.5 million in October of last year and placed on 3 \nyears probation for making false statements to the FAA concerning \ntraining, testing, and background checks. In other words, they were \nhiring people with criminal backgrounds, not training them properly, \ndoing a lot of things, and lying to the FAA about it, certifying that \nin fact things were just great, when in fact they were not. They were \nfined $1.5 million and put on probation.\n\n  Then last month, they were found in violation of their probation for \ncontinued violations regarding their screening services.\n  Last weekend, they were still on the job, the same company. Filing \nfraudulent statements with the FAA, fined $1.5 million, put on \nprobation, found in violation of probation, and still working? Would \nthat happen to people, real people, do you think? I don't think so. \nThey would lose their job. But not big companies.\n  Last weekend, this company and its employees allowed a guy to get \nthrough a screening with nine knives--caught two of them, missed \nseven--a stun gun and a can of mace. Talk about incompetence; talk \nabout a story that once again undermines people's confidence in flying \non commercial airlines, this is it.\n  The question is, Is there an emergency in this Congress to do the \nright thing: to pass an aviation security bill and do it the right way, \nand do the right thing? You bet your life there is.\n  What happened was, we saw that process get hijacked in the House of \nRepresentatives by two Congressmen from Texas. Why? Because they said \nthey didn't want these people to be Federal employees. I don't care \nwhose employees they are. All I care about is accountability. I care \nabout making something work. I care about getting something done the \nright way.\n  I say to those people who always denigrate public employees: Why \ndon't you say that to the families of the firemen who were climbing up \non the 25th and the 35th and the 45th floors as the World Trade Center \nwas burning and about to come tumbling down on these brave men and \nwomen who served on the firefighters force and the law enforcement \nforces who were in those buildings and lost their lives, say to them \nthat public service doesn't count. Say to them that somehow being a \npublic employee is a second class citizen. Say it to them or their \nfamilies.\n  The fact is, we have an obligation to do this right. Security is a \nresponsibility--in this case, at our airports--of ours, of the \nGovernment.\n  We passed a piece of legislation here that was Hollings-McCain, \nDemocrat and Republican, a bipartisan piece of legislation that was \nsupported by 100 Senators and passed 100-to-0. Then we run into this \nbrick wall--people who object to everything all of their lives. They \nget up in the morning cranky and can't find anything right about \nanything, and they come up with legislation that doesn't solve a \nproblem. It is just the same old approach that will put us back in the \nsame old rut.\n  So as we tackle this question of airport security, aviation security, \nas one member of the conference, I will insist on doing the right thing \nright now, not next week or the week after. The American people have a \nright to expect we will do the right thing, the responsible thing, that \nwill improve security at this country's airports.\n  Madam President, I will mention one other issue, and it deals with \naviation security. Every day, we have aircraft coming into this country \nfrom overseas, commercial airliners that are landing as I speak at some \nairport in the United States, carrying passengers who are guests of \nours. They are given a visa to visit our country. They are guests of \nour country. We have allowed them to become guests through the visa \nprocess. We have said: You are given a visa and you may come to the \nUnited States.\n  On most of those flights, the carrier--the airline sending these \nguests to the United States--sends us an advance list of their names. \nIt is called the APIS, advance passenger information system. Do you \nknow why they do that? Since 1988, they have been doing that in order \nthat we might check a list of the foreigners coming to the United \nStates against our list at the FBI, Customs Bureau, and 21 other \nFederal agencies, to determine, are these people known or suspected \nterrorists, violent criminals, and others who should not be allowed \ninto our country? Are they? Well, we get the list and we check it \nagainst all of these data bases. It has been a very successful thing to \ndo.\n  The problem is we don't get all of the names. We get 85 percent of \nthe names; 15 percent of the names we don't get. We don't get the names \nfrom airlines from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, and we didn't get them \nfrom Kuwait until last week. From Egypt we don't get names, and from \nJordan, and I could go on.\n  The result is that since the day the President signed the \ncounterterrorism bill on October 26, 178,000 people have landed in this \ncountry without having their names submitted for preclearance to our \ndatabase at the FBI, Customs, and other law enforcement agencies. That \nis an approach that would allow us to weed out suspected terrorists and \nothers.\n  The Customs Commissioner testified before a committee I chair, and he \nsaid this should be made mandatory. I said: I agree, it should be; \nlet's ask the airlines not complying to do so. So I offered an \namendment during the counterterrorism bill when it was debated in the \nSenate, and the Senate agreed to it unanimously. That was that. That \nbill then went to conference, and some people in conference from the \nother side said: Gee, I don't know, this is about our committee \njurisdiction; it didn't go through our committee, therefore we reject \nit.\n  They kicked it out of conference. So when President Bush signed that \nbill, this provision wasn't there. It means that the counterterrorism \nbill, where this was when it left the Senate, did not have a central \nprovision that is necessary for us to prescreen passengers coming into \nthis country, especially from countries such as, yes, Pakistan, Egypt, \nJordan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and others.\n\n  Somebody said: When you raise these issues about certain countries, \naren't you profiling? The answer clearly is no. We are only interested \nin profiling terrorists or suspected terrorists, or those who associate \nwith them, because we don't want them to come in as guests of our \ncountry. So we do profile people who are either known terrorists or who \nassociate with terrorists because we want to keep them out of this \ncountry.\n  Is that selfish? No. That is self-protection. We have every right to \ndecide we don't want a guest in this country who is going to try to \ninjure this country. So I included that amendment in the \ncounterterrorism bill. It got knocked out in conference. I don't like \nto use this language, but I said: Of all the boneheaded things for \npeople to do--to assert committee jurisdiction on an issue of national \nimportance such as this.\n  But on the last appropriation bill we passed, earlier today, I \noffered this amendment last week. The Senate just passed it again. I \nintend to put it on\n\n[[Page S11483]]\n\nthis appropriations bill. I am going to offer it on every piece of \nlegislation until we get people to think more about national security \non the other side than they are thinking about committee jurisdiction, \nand until they understand airplanes should not land in this country \nunless they have complied with the APIS system, which has been in place \nsince 1988.\n  Since September 11, we ought to understand the obligation we have to \nbe careful about screening those who are guests in our country. You \ncannot provide security in this country unless you provide security for \nour borders. Part of our border security is to deal with those roughly \n70 million, 80 million people a year who come into this country on \ncommercial airlines as guests, coming from foreign countries. So I \nintend to offer that amendment again today. I will offer it to any \nother legislation we have on the floor. I know people will say that is \nblue slip, or it is this, or it is that. It is none of that. That is \nall nonsense.\n  Mr. BURNS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask the Senator, we passed the airport security law in \nthis body and we changed the authority--moving the authority from the \nDepartment of Transportation to the Department of Justice. That was my \namendment. I contended at that time that we really don't have a problem \nwith the laws; we have trouble with enforcing the law. I would be \ninterested in seeing what the Senator's thoughts are on keeping the \nbright line of authority to the Attorney General rather than leaving it \nwith the Department of Transportation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This particular issue happens to be the Department of \nCustoms with respect to advance passenger information. They run all of \nthese names against the Justice Department list, the FBI list, and 21 \ndifferent Federal agencies that keep lists of undesirable people coming \ninto the country. That is a separate issue in conference. I think the \nSenator from Montana is probably one of the conferees on the aviation \nsecurity bill. I am going to be one as well. We can talk about all of \nthose issues.\n  All I really care about--going back to the issue of aviation \nsecurity--is that we get the job done. The one thing that is clear to \nme is companies that have been fined for defrauding the Government--in \neffect, companies that have been put on probation and violate their \nprobation, that hire screeners who leave the company to fry hamburgers \nbecause they get more money to do it, and to let somebody come through \nwith nine knives, a stun gun, and a can of mace--those are companies I \ndon't want screening baggage. I want somebody on whom I can rely. All I \ncare about is accountability and results.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. We know there are areas of responsibility. Who best can \nhave access and be a model for us, without expending a lot of money or \nbuilding a new bureaucracy? We know we have to have passenger lists and \nwe need intelligence. Who best to do that other than the Department of \nJustice? We need security at the check-in area and also the gate area. \nWho best, other than the Justice Department, knows how to secure \nFederal buildings, Federal courts, moving Federal prisoners--all of \nthese things they already do? Some they do themselves and some they \ncontract out to companies that have a very good reputation with them.\n  I think the conference ought to get underway right away. I am \nsupportive of the Senator's views on that and say we ought to be in the \nbusiness of protecting the American public as best we know how, instead \nof writing a law and putting it into the hands of the administrative \nrule writers, who sometimes write rules for their own benefit and not \nfor the protection of the people.\n  Mr. DORGAN. In closing, the issue is not so much the jurisdiction of \nwhich agency. In fact, we do have a law enforcement function and \nsecurity functions at DOT. Some say maybe it should be the FAA. But the \nfact is, the big dispute, the thing that held up forever was that the \nHouse of Representatives didn't want to have people who were public \nemployees, Federal employees. So that was the big thing over in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I do not think it was in the Senate. We passed the bill in the Senate \n100-0 largely because we believed if we had good training and \naccountability, if we hired good people and had guidelines for them to \nfollow, then we would be able to provide security in our country's \nairports.\n  One thing is very clear from all of these reports: We do not have \ngood security with the current system. This system needs changing. This \nsystem does not work, and all we need to do is look at O'Hare in \nChicago last Saturday and look at the papers on Sunday and Monday and \nunderstand how bad the system is and why we have to get at this job \nnow, this week, and get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/06/senate-section/article/S11483-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11483-S11486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATIONS OF KARON O.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today has \nconfirmed Stephen P. Friot, an outstanding individual and a superb \nattorney, to be U.S. District Court Judge for Oklahoma's Western \nDistrict.\n  President Bush could not have chosen a finer individual to serve our \ncountry as a district court judge. Steve Friot is exceptionally well \nqualified and will prove to be a great asset to the judicial system in \nOklahoma and our country.\n  Steve graduated from the University of Oklahoma School of Law in 1972 \nand upon his graduation went to work for the firm that now bears his \nname, Spradling, Alpern, Friot & Gum. While focusing his practice on \ncorporate, tort defense and aviation litigation, Steve has shown a \nstrong commitment to equal justice for all. He has continually strived \nto include pro bono cases in his practice.\n  Steve has been actively involved in the Oklahoma legal community. He \nhas been very active in the Oklahoma Bar Association serving several \ntimes as a member of the Association's House of Delegates. He has also \nserved as chairman of the association's committees on Legal \nSpecialization and Administration of Justice. Steve served as president \nof the Oklahoma County Bar Association and is the current president of \nthe Ruth Bader Ginsburg American Inn of Court. He is described by \ncolleagues as being a ``competent, honorable individual who possesses \nthe judicial temperament and intellect we all want on the Federal \nbench.'' His colleagues know him as an extremely hard worker with the \nhighest ethical standards.\n  Steve's commitment to his community is hardly limited to the legal \nprofession. He has been very active in the Boy Scouts of America where \nhe currently serves as Assistant Scoutmaster for Troop 4. Steve has \nalso worked diligently for the Central Oklahoma Habitat for Humanity \nwhere he currently serves as vice chairman of the board of directors. \nIn 1995, Gov. Frank Keating appointed Steve to serve on the Board of \nTrustees of the Oklahoma Housing Financing Authority. Steve currently \nserves as vice chairman of the board which assures that the agency is \nserving Oklahomans in need of affordable housing.\n  Steve and his wife Nancy, a dedicated kindergarten teacher, have been \nmarried for more than 25 years. They are particularly proud of their \nson Andy whose early involvement in the Boy Scouts encouraged Steve's \ncommitment to that organization. Andy is in the Air Force ROTC at Le \nMoyne College in Syracuse, NY. His dedication to his country is in no \ndoubt a reflection of his parents who have shown a strong sense of \ncommunity with a commitment to serving the public good in Oklahoma.\n  I congratulate Steve and his family on his having earned the position \nfor which President Bush has selected him. I thank Chairman Leahy and \nSenator Hatch, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, for their \nwork on Steve Friot's nomination. I applaud the Senate for confirming \nhim. He will make an outstanding judge who will work diligently to \nadminister justice in the Western District of Oklahoma.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Senate has had both the honor and the \npleasure of considering the nominations of several extremely well-\nqualified individuals to serve as Federal judges.\n  Although I was unable to be here due to an unavoidable scheduling \nconflict, I am pleased that last night the Senate confirmed Larry R. \nHicks to be a Federal district judge for the District of Nevada. He \nearned a bachelor's degree from the University of Nevada at Reno and a \nlaw degree from the University of Colorado School of Law before going \nto work in 1968 as a Deputy District Attorney in Washoe county, NV. \nThree years later, he became the Chief Criminal Deputy District \nAttorney. In 1975, Mr. Hicks was elected the District Attorney for \nWashoe County, where he gained extensive experience in litigating \nmurder, robbery, and other major felony trials. He remained in that \nposition until 1979. Since that time, Mr. Hicks has been a partner in a \nprivate law firm in Reno. He has been chairman of the firm's litigation \nsection since 1985. Mr. Hicks has also served as a settlement judge \nsince 1998 for the Nevada Supreme Court. He has compiled an excellent \ntrack record, having successfully achieved settlement in all but 5 of \nthe 40 cases assigned to him.\n  I am also please that Christina Armijo was confirmed today to be a \nFederal district judge for the District of New Mexico. She earned both \nher Bachelor of Arts degree and her Juris Doctor degree from the \nUniversity of New Mexico. After 3 years of practicing law for Sandoval \nCounty Legal Services, she started her own private practice in her \nhometown of Las Vegas, NM. Her practice consisted not only of general \ncivil and administrative law, but also included long-term contracts to \ndefend felony criminal cases as a public defender, litigate child abuse \ncases on behalf of New Mexico, and serve as a Due Process Hearing \nOfficer for the state Department of Education. After 18 years of \nprivate practice, Judge Armijo was appointed to serve on the New Mexico \nCourt of Appeals in early 1996. She was elected to a full 8-year term \nlater that year. In her almost 6 years on the bench, none of her \ndecisions has been reversed.\n  We now have the opportunity to consider the nomination of Karon Owen \nBowdre to be a Federal district judge for the Northern District of \nAlabama. She received her bachelor's degree cum laude from Samford \nUniversity and graduated cum laude from the Cumberland School of Law in \n1981, where she was associate editor of the Cumberland Law Review and a \nmember of the Moot Court Board. After graduation from law school, \nProfessor Bowdre served as judicial law clerk in the United States \nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Alabama and then practiced \nwith a private law firm in Birmingham, AL. She handled numerous trials \nin State and Federal court, primarily involving insurance, product \nliability, medical malpractice, fraud and bad faith, and discrimination \ncases. Since 1990, Professor Bowdre has taught at the Cumberland School \nof Law at Samford University.\n  We are also considering the nomination of Stephen P. Friot to serve \non the Federal bench in the Western District\n\n[[Page S11485]]\n\nof Oklahoma. While attending the University of Oklahoma College of Law, \nMr. Friot was a member of the Order of the Barrister, and was the \nrecipient of the Law Day Moot Court Award and the United States Law \nWeek Award. Upon graduation in 1972, he joined a private law firm, and \nhas spent the past 29 years practicing civil trial and appellate law in \nOklahoma City. In the last 10 years, Mr. Friot has tried cases \ninvolving employment law, product liability, aviation product \nliability, title insurance, slander of title, interference with \ncontract rights, ground water pollution, real property covenants, \ninsurance marketing practices, partnership law, and healthcare law. He \nhas been listed as one of the ``Best Lawyers in America'' for Business \nLitigation since 1989.\n  I have every confidence that these nominees will serve the United \nStates with honor and distinction. I want to thank Senator Leahy for \nmoving their nominations, and Senator Schumer for chairing their \nconfirmation hearing. I fully support the nominations of these \ncandidates, and urge my colleagues to do so as well.\n  I must note, however, that one nominee for the Federal appellate \ncourt, Edith Brown Clement, had her hearing before these nominees, on \nOctober 4, and was voted out of committee on the same date as these \nnominees. She is exceedingly well-qualified for the Fifth Circuit, \nhaving served as a Federal district court judge for the past decade. I \nlook forward to the Senate's prompt consideration of her nomination as \nwell.\n  I must also note that at least one committee member submitted written \nquestions to these nominees on October 30, a mere 2 days before the \ncommittee was scheduled to consider their nominations. Another \ncommittee member waited until November 1 to submit questions to one of \nthese nominees. This was nearly one month after the nominee's October 4 \nconfirmation hearing, and despite the fact that it was announced at her \nhearing that the record would remain open for only 1 week. I am \nconcerned that the practice of submitting additional questions to \nnominees long after their confirmation hearings is becoming a tool to \ndelay consideration of their nominations. I urge my colleagues to give \nthese nominees a fair shot at confirmation by submitting their \nquestions in a timely fashion.\n  I would also like to respond to remarks made yesterday regarding the \nSenate's pace of confirming judges. The short answer is that the \nconfirmation of 16 judges when there are 102 vacancies in the Federal \njudiciary is nothing to brag about. And despite the fact that the \nSenate has confirmed only 4 Federal appellate court judges this year, \nthe Judiciary Committee refuses to hold any more hearings on appellate \ncourt nominees. This pace pales in comparison when you consider that we \nheld hearings on 14 appellate nominees in 1998, 12 appellate nominees \nin 1995, and 10 appellate nominees in 1999.\n  Another point that was made yesterday was the number of nominees \nwhose paperwork was not complete. By my count, the ABA has not \nsubmitted ratings on 11 pending nominees. Five of these nominations \nhave been pending for more than 8 weeks. Another has been pending more \nthan 6 weeks. This is despite the ABA's pledge to submit its ratings \nwithin 35 days at the least. It seems to me that even if the Democratic \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee are willing to give the ABA a \npreferential role in evaluating judicial nominees, even where the \nConstitution does not, they should not allow the ABA to hold judges \nhostage by failing to submit timely ratings.\n  In sum, we need to take a hard look at the number of judges we have \nconfirmed in light of the astronomical number of vacancies on the \nFederal judiciary, and judge our progress on confirmations by that \nstandard. The fact remains that the pace of vacancies has exceeded the \npace of judicial confirmations. We in the Senate must do our part to \naddress the real and serious vacancy crisis that threatens to clog our \nnation's Federal courts and deny the administration of justice to \nAmerican citizens. We can only do this by speeding up the pace of \nconfirmations before the end of this session.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate confirmed M. Christina \nArmijo of New Mexico to be a United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of New Mexico. We now have the opportunity to act on the \nnominations of two additional judicial nominees. When we vote to \nconfirm Karon Bowdre of Alabama and Stephen Friot of Oklahoma, the \nSenate will have confirmed 16 judges since July 20 of this year. When \nwe confirm these District Court nominees, the Senate will have \nconfirmed more District Court judges this year than were confirmed in \nthe entire first year of the first Bush administration in 1989.\n  In addition to our work on the antiterrorism legislation since \nSeptember 11, the Senate Judiciary Committee has persevered in the wake \nof the terrible events of September 11 and will by tomorrow have held 5 \nhearings for 21 judicial nominees.\n  Within 2 days of the terrible events of September 11, I chaired a \nconfirmation hearing for the two judicial nominees who were able to \ndrive to Washington while interstate air travel was still disrupted.\n  At our committee meeting on October 4, 2001, we reported those two \njudicial nominees and held another confirmation hearing on five \njudicial nominees that same day.\n  On October 18, 2001, in spite of the closure of Senate office \nbuildings in the wake of the receipt of a letter containing anthrax \nspores and Senate staff and employees testing positive for anthrax \nexposure, the Committee proceeded with its previously scheduled \nbusiness meeting under extraordinary circumstances in the United States \nCapitol and reported four judicial nominees favorably to the Senate. On \nthat same day, despite the unavailability of the Judiciary Committee \nhearing room and the closure of Senators' offices, we proceeded with \nanother confirmation hearing for an additional five judicial nominees.\n  Two weeks ago, while the Senate Republicans were shutting down the \nSenate with a filibuster preventing action on the bill that funds our \nnation's foreign policy initiatives and provides funds to help build \nthe international coalition against terrorism, the Judiciary Committee \nnonetheless proceeded with yet another hearing for four more judicial \nnominees on October 25, 2001, our third hearing involving judicial \nnominees in October.\n  Tomorrow morning we are holding another hearing for five more \njudicial nominations.\n  The facts are that since the committee was assigned its members on \nJuly 10, 2001, the committee will have held nine hearing involving 28 \njudicial nominees. By tonight the Senate will have already confirmed 16 \njudges, including four to the Courts of Appeals. These numbers show \nthat there have been more hearings for more nominees, more \nconfirmations of more judges to the District Courts, and more \nconfirmations of more judges to the Courts of Appeals this year than by \nthe same date in either the first year of the first Bush administration \nor the first year of the Clinton administration. The facts are that the \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate are ahead of the confirmation pace \nfor judicial nominees in the first year of the first Bush \nadministration or the first year of the Clinton administration.\n  I know that Karon Bowdre has the strong support of the senior Senator \nfrom Alabama who came to introduce her at her hearing. I am told that \nSenator Sessions came to the floor earlier today to speak in support of \nthis nomination. I recall that the senior Senator from Oklahoma came to \nthe hearing to speak in favor of Stephen Friot and that he has the \nsupport of Senator Inhofe, as well.\n  Both these nominees were among those District Court nominations sent \nto the Senate just before the August recess. They had to be returned to \nthe White House without action when the Republican leader objected to \nretaining them here over the recess. They were nominated in early \nSeptember and the Committee received their ABA peer review ratings in \nearly October. They were then scheduled to participate in a hearing on \nOctober 18, considered by the committee at last week's business meeting \nand are being confirmed today, November 6, which is approximately 1 \nmonth after receiving the ABA ratings.\n  I congratulate the nominees and their families on these \nconfirmations.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S11486]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexplain my absence during yesterday's roll call vote on the nomination \nof Larry Hicks to be U.S. District Judge of the Nevada District. I do \nnot dissent on Mr. Hick's nomination and if I had been present, I would \nhave voted aye.\n  Unfortunately I was absent during yesterday's rollcall vote because \nmy attendance was necessary at a meeting to discuss the economic future \nof my home State of Montana. I discussed the State of Montana's timber \nindustry with Plum Creek Timber Co., the largest wood products business \nin Montana. To be specific, we discussed what tools are necessary to \nensure that business in Montana survives our Nation's current economic \ndownturn.\n  The future of a specific industry in my State brings me to a larger \npoint, the economic state of rural America after September 11, 2001. \nMuch attention has been paid, as it should, to the economic effect of \nthe terrorist attacks on our major centers of commerce. Primarily \nAmerica's largest cities and the coasts. However, the impact has been \nfelt equally as hard in rural America where the economy was already \nslowing.\n  In addition to the wood products industry, agricultural commodities \nwhich are the lifeblood of Montana and rural America are hurting worse \nthen ever before. The past 3 years have been disastrous due to drought. \nNow Montana's farmers are faced with sharply escalating operating costs \ndue to higher energy and fertilizer prices. According to the most \nrecent projections provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, \ntotal farm expenses are expected to rise again this year, right on the \nheels of a $10 billion increase last year.\n  As costs spiral out of control, farm income has not kept pace. Last \nyear net farm business income was at a decade low according to USDA. \nUnless Government assistance is continued, net farm income in 2001 is \nprojected to be even lower.\n  The downturn in rural America is especially calamitous because \nprolonged economic depression often means extinction for these rural \ncommunities. A few bad years forces everyone out of business, not just \nthose that sell commodities for a living. The very people and places \nthat make up the fabric of the American economy are forced to seek \nopportunity elsewhere. This is a price that I am not willing to pay.\n  As we consider economic recovery measures we cannot forget rural \nAmerica. We must not let the immediate damage that we see every night \non the evening news blind us to the crisis that is happening in rural \ncommunities across America. We simply do not have a choice. The cost is \nsimply too high.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/06/senate-section/article/S11486-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me today \nin congratulating the Jewish Community Center of Metropolitan Detroit \non the occasion of the golden anniversary of the Jewish Book Fair. \nSince 1951, the book fair has nourished the literary appetite of the \nmetropolitan Detroit community.\n  Along with the Book Fair, the Jewish Community Center of Metropolitan \nDetroit has enriched Jewish life and supported Jewish unity in and \naround the Detroit area for 75 years. The Community Center also strives \nto enhance life in the general community and welcomes all those in \nsoutheast Michigan to take advantage of the Center's facilities and \nprograms.\n  The Jewish Community Center's Annual Book Fair is the largest and \noldest in the country, and its programs\n\n[[Page S11487]]\n\nare offered free of charge to the public. This November, 40 authors of \nnational and international acclaim will come to the week long fair. \nParticipants at this year's fair will include a diverse range of \nauthors from noted attorney Robert Shapiro, to the author of the Scooby \nDoo Mysteries, James Gelsey, to Dr. Ruth Westheimer. In addition, the \nfair will offer the largest selection of books by Jewish authors and of \nJewish content available in the Detroit area. The organizers of the \nfair expect over 20,000 visitors.\n  The Jewish Community Center has long enriched the lives of those \nresiding throughout southeast Michigan. This year's book fair will \nsurely continue this worthy legacy. I trust that my Senate colleagues \nwill join me in recognizing The Jewish Community Center of Metropolitan \nDetroit on the Occasion of the 50th Annual Book Fair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/06/senate-section/article/S11487-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RAMAPO COLLEGE\n\n Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I honor today Ramapo College and \nwelcome its new president, Dr. Rodney Smith.\n  As those of us in New Jersey have known for many years, Ramapo's real \nstrength lies not just in its academics, but also in its emphasis on \nglobal and hands-on learning. In recent years, this fine institution \nhas also become nationally recognized as one of the top liberal arts \ncolleges in the northeast, offering degrees in fields as diverse as the \narts and humanities, and the sciences and business. Ramapo's reach \nextends far beyond its Mahwah, NJ, location. The strength of Ramapo's \nacademic reputation attracts students seeking a varied and quality \neducation--students from not only every county within my home State of \nNew Jersey, but also from neighboring states, across the country and \naround the world.\n  On November 14, 2001, Dr. Smith will offer his first State of the \nCollege to the students, faculty and friends of Ramapo College. \nAccepting this prestigious post as Ramapo's third president, Dr. Smith \njoins the college at an exciting time in its history. With enrollment \nand applications continuing to rise, the college continues to grow, \nboth in the number of programs it offers and the number of students it \nserves.\n  An accomplished author and educator, Dr. Smith joins Ramapo College \nfrom Hampton University, where he served in several capacities, most \nrecently as Vice President for Planning and Dean of the Graduate \nCollege. Prior to his tenure at Hampton university, Dr. Smith held \npositions at a number of esteemed institutions, including Harvard \nUniversity. As we enter into a new century and mark the beginning of \nthe College's fourth decade, Ramapo can be confident in Dr. Smith's \nability to lead, guiding one of New Jersey's premier colleges in its \npresent course of providing progressive programs and a concerned and \ncommitted faculty.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to invite my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating Dr. Smith's distinguished career and his future endeavors \nat Ramapo College.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/06/senate-section/article/S11487-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING JULIA CHILD\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is a special honor for me to \ncelebrate one of Massachusetts' most famous citizens and one of \nAmerica's most famous chefs, Mrs. Julia Child. For over 40 years she \nhas brightened our lives with recipes, books, and television shows that \nhave broadened our palettes as well as our understanding of the world \nand on November 7 her peers will gather to honor her invaluable \ncontributions to her craft. I am proud to join so many of Greater \nBoston's restaurants in celebrating this remarkable career at this and \nthe many other events planned to recognize a uniquely American journey.\n  Over the past four decades, Julia revolutionized the way America \ncooks and eats, expanding and elevating the sophistication of the \nAmerican appetite. Her influence can be seen in the bookstores of the \ncountry, where dining and cooking sections have grown to compete with \nhistory and commerce, and on the television, where cooking shows have \nproliferated and now present and celebrate traditions from all over the \nworld.\n  Julia is widely credited with exposing the American kitchen to the \ntastes, practices and history of international cooking, with specific \nfocus on France. Her television shows, all of which were peppered with \nspontaneity, the occasional gaffe and her radiant personality, made \ncooking fun and accessible. She loved the basic mechanics of the \nkitchen, the how and why behind each step. Somehow, in its entirety, \nher career struck that elusive balance between removing the mystery of \ninternational cuisine while still celebrating its mystique.\n  For those who know Julia, who understand the steel and the intellect \nof this magnificent woman, it will come as no surprise that she made \nsubstantive contributions to American life even before she found fame \nin America's kitchens. After graduating Smith College and volunteering \nat the Red Cross, she joined the CIA's precursor, the Office of \nStrategic Services, OSS, and served throughout the World War II. When \nthe OSS announced the need for volunteers to staff offices overseas, \nJulia was thrilled by the prospect of serving her country in a higher \ncapacity. Her work in America's first intelligence agency took her to \nCeylon, now Sri Lanka, India and China. Like so much else in her \npioneering career, Julia was one of the first women to contribute to \nthe war's intelligence effort in such an active position, earning \npromotions and accolades in what was very much a male-dominated agency.\n  After the war, Julia and her husband, Paul, moved to Paris where he \njoined the U.S. Information Service. It was in the famed gourmet \nrestaurants along the Seine that Julia developed her insatiable love of \nFrench cuisine. Inspired by the simple yet majestic culinary creations \nfound across the Atlantic, French cooking soon became Julia's \nobsession. Determined as ever, she entered the prestigious Corden Bleu \ncooking school, again as the lone woman. Just six years out of culinary \nschool, Julia and three fellow expatriates founded the ``L'ecole des \nTrois Gourmandes,'' a school of the culinary arts in Paris. Ten years \nafter her first taste of souffle Julia published with two other chefs \nwhat is still the most thorough and comprehensive French cooking manual \nbrought to the States, ``Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume \nI.'' In this book, which has since become a classic, Julia made the \ncomplex and unpronounceable cuisine accessible and appealing to \nmainstream America, forever changing how America approaches cooking, \ndining and entertaining.\n\n  After the publication of Volume I, Julia returned to America and \ncommenced one of the most fruitful television careers in history. ``The \nFrench Chef,'' a show that began with Julia using her own hot plate and \nfrying pan in a news studio at WGBH in Boston, became one of the \nlongest running television shows in history. As a deeper testament to \nher commitment to the public good, Child donated her whole salary to \npublic broadcasting in order to help fund future public television \nendeavors.\n  Julia donned the apron in seven other television cooking shows, \nincluding Dinner at Julia's and The Master Chef Series. She has won \nseveral Emmy Awards and just last year was elected to the French Legion \nof Honor, an extremely prestigious honor awarded by the French \nGovernment. Characteristically, Julia has used her success to forge \nmany philanthropic efforts and broaden global understanding, including \nthe American Institute of Wine and Food and the Julia Child Circle.\n  This month Julia is moving to California after devoting more than \nfour decades to her profession. She has changed forever the way we will \ncook and eat in America, she upheld the highest standards of \nprofessionalism and generosity throughout her career, and wrote an \nindelible chapter in the progress of women in our society.\n  Her cheer and wit will be greatly missed on our television sets but \nthe knowledge and insight she served will remain in our kitchens for a \nlong time to come. I honor her to say, and I wish her the best of luck \nas she begins this new chapter in her life by borrowing the phrase that \nshe not only concluded every show with, but also added into the popular \nAmerican lexicon--Bon Apetit!\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/06/senate-section/article/S11488-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11488]]\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-4533.

A bill to authorize the negotiation of a Free Trade \nAgreement with Taiwan, and to provide for expedited congressional \nconsideration of such an agreement; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the United \nStates--Taiwan Free Trade Agreement Act of 2001. This bill authorizes \nthe President to begin negotiations with Taiwan on a Free Trade \nAgreement, FTA, and provides for fast track consideration of a \ncompleted agreement by the Congress. Like the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade \nAgreement that was passed earlier in the session, this bill emphasizes \nthe importance of promoting sustainable development and maintaining \nstrong labor laws.\n  Over the past two decades, Taiwan has emerged as an important U.S. \nally in the Asia-Pacific region. Together, we have worked to maintain \npeace and promote development throughout the region. As part of this \nprocess, the United States has committed itself to defending Taiwan \nfrom aggressive attacks, and provides millions of dollars annually in \nmilitary aid to the island.\n  Taiwan has emerged as a vocal supporter of U.S. policy throughout \nAsia and the world. After the September 11 terrorist attacks, Taiwan \nwas one of the first nations to express condolences and offer whatever \naid we might need.\n  The ties between the United States and Taiwan extend beyond political \nones, however.\n  Taiwan is the United States' eighth largest trading partner, despite \nnot yet being a member of the World Trade Organization. In 2000, the \nU.S. exported more than $22 billion worth of goods and services to \nTaiwan, more than we exported to either China or Hong Kong.\n  The trade relationship between the United States and Taiwan has \nblossomed despite the fact that Taiwan is largely excluded from the \ninternational forums that help promote economic and political \nliberalization. For example, Taiwan is not a member of the United \nNations.\n  This international isolation will start to end in 2002, when Taiwan \nis scheduled to become a member of the World Trade Organization, WTO. \nAs part of the membership process, Taiwan made a number of trade \nconcessions to further liberalize its trade regime; the U.S. will \nbenefit from the lowered tariffs and declining market barriers that \nwere part of these concessions.\n  There are opportunities in the Taiwanese market that we must look to \nseize. For example, U.S. agricultural producers have been particularly \nunder-represented in the list of exports to the region.\n  A U.S.-Taiwan FTA could eliminate the last barriers to U.S. exports \nto Taiwan. Exporters, particularly agricultural exporters, would \nfinally have unfettered access to a market of more than 22 million \npeople. Moreover, importers would benefit from reduced tariffs and \neasier customs regulations.\n  The economic rationale for a U.S.-Taiwan FTA is indisputable. But the \nUnited States has always exported more than just its goods and \nservices. This Nation's support of freedom and democracy throughout the \nworld has been its most important trade policy for more than two \nhundred years.\n  Taiwan shares these values and deserves the continued support, both \npolitical and economic, of the United States. Over the past fifty \nyears, Taiwan has evolved from single-party rule to a nation of free \nand open elections, where the transfer of power takes place\n\n[[Page S11492]]\n\nsmoothly and peacefully. Today, it is a vibrant democracy that is \ncontinuing to progress towards open markets and liberalized trade. \nSupporting this process with an FTA not only encourages Taiwan to \ncontinue its economic reforms, it also serves as an explicit example of \nthe very real benefits of opening markets for those countries that are \njust beginning to participate in the global trading system.\n  A free trade agreement with Taiwan is a concrete step that the United \nStates can take towards supporting an ally that shares our values. The \nfact that such an agreement also promises concrete economic benefits to \nAmerican farmers and manufacturers makes this process even more \nessential.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the United States-\nTaiwan Free Trade Agreement Act of 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 1638. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to study \nthe suitability and feasibility of designating the French Colonial \nHeritage Area in the State of Missouri as a unit of the National Park \nSystem, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nrecognizing the historical significance of downtown Sainte Genevieve, \nMO. Sainte Genevieve was one of the first European settlements west of \nthe Mississippi River, and still contains many structures and artifacts \nthat have survived from its rich early history. Establishing this area \nas a unit of the National Park System will provide an unparalleled \nopportunity for Americans to be educated about our Nation's colonial \npast.\n  Sainte Genevieve was founded by French settlers in the mid Eighteenth \nCentury. These early pioneers traveled south from French Canada, and \nbuilt the rare French Colonial style structures that remain in place to \nthis day. Today, the area contains an invaluable wealth of Native \nAmerican and French Colonial sites, artifacts, and architecture. \nPerhaps most impressively, downtown Sainte Genevieve contains three of \nonly five poteaux-en-terre (posts in the ground) vertical log French \nhomes remaining in North America, dating from the 1790's.\n  In addition to the historic downtown district, the area adjacent to \nSainte Genevieve is rich in historic sites. The ``Grand Champ'' common \nfield of the French colonists still retains its original field land \npattern. The area's saline salt springs were an important industry \nsource for Native American and European settlers. And nearby ceremonial \nmounds are evidence of a prehistoric Native American village.\n  This area is a truly valuable asset to the State of Missouri, and I \nfeel that it is only fair to share it with the entire nation by \nestablishing the French Colonial Heritage Area as a unit of the \nNational Park System. My legislation would take the first step toward \nsuch an establishment by directing the National Park Service to conduct \na study of the historic features of Sainte Genevieve. After a thorough \nstudy, I am confident that the National Park Service will determine \nthat Sainte Genevieve is the best tool with which to tell the important \nand fascinating story of the French in the New World.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS (for himself and Mr. Nickles):\n  S. 1641. A bill to impose additional requirements to ensure greater \nuse of the advance payment of the earned income credit and to extend \nsuch advanced payment to all taxpayers eligible for the credit; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to discuss \nlegislation I have offered that would be good public policy for the \ncountry and a terrific stimulus for the economy beginning in January. \nLet me explain what this is about.\n  We have in this country a policy of helping the working poor called \nthe earned income tax credit. That was passed in 1975. It was designed \nto help lower income people working on an hourly wage have a higher \nincome to take care of their families. It is shaded in fact pretty \nheavily in favor of low-income people who have children.\n  It has worked well on the whole. There have been a lot of people who \nhave criticized it. They have called it welfare. In a way, it is a \nbenefit given. But it is a benefit given in exchange for work, when a \nperson works. It is a benefit from the Federal Government called the \nearned income tax credit. It is a tax credit. If you work, you earn it. \nIt has in general been a good way to help the working poor, as we call \nthem today. Since 1975, we have done that.\n  The way the person receives the money, however, is detached from \ntheir work. The way a person receives their earned income tax credit is \nto file their tax return in February, March, April and get a tax return \nthe next year after working all year. For example, for the year 2001, a \nlow-income worker with two or more children could claim $4,008 in \nearned income tax credit, a worker with one child could receive up to \n$2,428, and a worker with no children could receive $364. The average \nearned income tax credit for a beneficiary with a qualifying child, one \nchild, in 1999, was $1,941. That is about $150 a month, almost $1 an \nhour when figured on 160 hours for a month. It is a significant benefit \nfrom the Federal Government.\n  From a public policy point of view, it has been less effective in \nachieving the goal we want it to achieve, which is to encourage work, \nbecause it is received at the end of the year, really the next year; \nand it is disconnected to the work the person has undertaken.\n  We want to encourage people to work. We want work to be more \nrewarding. We want a person making $6 an hour making $7 an hour, just \nlike that. Let's have them make $8 an hour if they were making $7. This \ncould be done if we could in fact have this earned income tax credit \npaid at the time the person works, as part of their paycheck.\n  In fact, this idea had been discussed earlier, a number of years ago. \nWe passed a bill in this Congress that would allow people to choose \nthis and, oddly, not many people have. However, most people don't fully \nunderstand it. Others are afraid they might end up having a tax \nliability next year and didn't choose it. I don't think businesses have \nencouraged people to take it as much as they should and, as a result, \nonly 5 percent of the people who are eligible and choose this earned \nincome tax credit have it paid to them in advance when they work. So I \nthink we have a problem there. We can strengthen our economy and we can \nstrengthen the reward for a person going to work if we tie this credit \nto the work they do, to their paycheck.\n  In addition, I have discovered that the earned income tax credit is \nworth, for America, $31 billion a year. That is a lot of money by any \nstandard. As we are looking at this time how to create an infusion of \ncash into our economy in a way that would strengthen this economy to \nmake it more healthy, more vibrant, to get people purchasing again, to \nput dollars in the hands of consumers, I can think of no better way \nwith the least possible cost to the Treasury than to have this money \nthat would be entitled to come in the next fiscal year actually start \ncoming in January on a person's paycheck. I think that would be a \ntremendous way to pour additional money into the economy without having \nany impact on the Treasury, except the loss of interest on the money \nthe Federal Government would be sitting on. This would not hurt poor \npeople in any way. It would not withhold or delay them receiving any \nmoney. But in fact it would advance their receipt of the money. So they \nwould be receiving in February, March, April, May, when their tax \nrefund comes due, their refund under the earned income tax credit for \nthis year's work, but they would have already begun on January 1 of \nthis year to receive on their paycheck the money for next year. So it \nwould advance that payment and would provide a real stimulus to the \neconomy because low-income people are going to be the ones who are most \nlikely to spend it.\n  Remember, it would impact their paychecks significantly in that there \nis no withholding from this earned income tax credit. They will have \nalready paid their insurance, retirement benefits, Social Security, \nFICA, and withholding taxes. All of that would have already been paid. \nWhatever they get in addition would be money they could put into their \npockets. So it would achieve the goal of the earned income tax credit \nto enhance and make work more valuable and, at the same\n\n[[Page S11493]]\n\ntime, would provide a tremendous stimulus to our economy. I am excited \nabout this possibility, and I know Senator Reed, who is in the chair, \nand I have discussed this. He was at least intrigued by this idea.\n  I was pleased today that Senator Nickles, who has been a critic of \nthe earned income tax credit, one who has studied it carefully and has \nobserved some of its problems, believes it is a good reform, and he is \nsupporting and has signed onto this bill as an original cosponsor.\n  So we have an opportunity to do something good for the economy, to do \nsomething good for poor people, to in effect have the businesses that \nnow have to provide the option to their employees to go on and provide \nthis money, which is reimbursed by the Federal Government immediately--\nit doesn't cost them anything--and their workers would receive 50 or 60 \ncents an hour pay raise as a result of this payment. I think it is \nsomething they ought to be excited about doing. I think it would \nenhance their workers benefits from working and make them better \nemployees.\n\n  So it is time for us to do it now. I have been concerned about the \nissue. I have studied it for a number of years. I had some independent \nresearch done on it several years ago, and I have been thinking and \nlooking for an opportunity to present it in the form of legislation. At \nthis time, when we need a financial stimulus, I can't think of a better \ntime. So I am asking the Finance Committee, and I have talked with the \nDirector of the OMB, Mitch Daniels, the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. \nO'Neill, and his top staff person. They are all intrigued by this and \nbelieve it has merit.\n  I think it is time for us to consider that this be a part of our \nstimulus package. It has little long-term impact on the Federal \nTreasury, but it would provide a tremendous infusion of cash into the \neconomy just at the time we need people to go to the store and buy \nthings, generating demand out there that would allow factories to \nproduce more products. It would be giving additional wages to people \nwho may be getting less overtime now than they were a year ago--maybe \nnot even getting 40 hours a week now as they were last year. Those \npeople would receive higher wages for each hour they do work.\n  I talked to a businessperson today, and they said they were on 4-day \nworkweeks with their employees. They hated to do it, but there wasn't \ndemand for their products sufficient to keep them fully engaged. Rather \nthan lay people off, they put everybody on a 4-day workweek. So a lot \nof people are losing hours, and this would help keep them from losing \nincome. I think it is good for the low-income workers in America. I \nthink it is good for the economy, and I think it is good public policy \nfor America.\n  Mr. President, we have talked with members of the Finance Committee \nand with the administration. I hope they will seize this opportunity to \ndo something that, to me, has a win-win-win all over it, with no \nnegatives. It is the right thing to do. Some say, well, business people \nmay not want to handle the paperwork on this. Businesspeople print \ntheir checks out by computers, and it is not difficult for them. The \nmoney is paid to them. I talked to one gentlemen who hires employees--\nquite a number of low-income workers. He said he though it was a \nwonderful idea. It would be great for his workers, and it would be no \nproblem at all for them to make that a part of their payroll check \nplan. It is just a matter of getting the person who processes that to \nfactor it in, and it works rather easily.\n  Again, I believe it is a good idea, and I have submitted it to the \nSenate. I will be talking with the leadership and urging its passage. \nIt is the right thing to do, and I think we ought to do it. The time is \nlong past that we make this earned income tax credit really do what it \nis supposed to do, which is encourage work. It is to encourage people \nto work and, at the same time, when we do it by advancing it this year, \nwe will provide a stimulus to the economy in a very significant way. We \nestimate that out of $31 billion in earned income tax credit, we would \nbe advancing at least $15 billion next year, and that would be a \nhealthy stimulus indeed for the economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI:\n  S. 1642.

Mr. President, I want to update the Senate on a \nsituation that is of interest to many people and of acute interest to \nmany of us: the remediation of the Hart Senate Office Building.\n  It was 3 weeks ago yesterday that an envelope containing anthrax was \nopened in my Hart office by a member of my staff. It is the \nresponsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency to recommend how \nthe Hart Building is to be remediated. No other entity has the \nexpertise to make those recommendations.\n\n  One week ago today, on October 30, the Environmental Protection \nAgency officially took control of the Hart Building and the Hart \nremediation project. At the time, EPA officials outlined for us what \nthey said was an experimental but promising plan to use a chlorine \ndioxide fumigant throughout the building to kill the anthrax spores. \nUnder that plan, the Hart Building could have reopened as early as \nNovember 13--1 week from today. Unfortunately, it is now clear that EPA \nwill not be able to meet its initial optimistic schedule. EPA now says \nthat the Hart Building will not re-open until at least November 21.\n  Earlier today, EPA officials came to the Hill to brief Senators who \nhave offices in the Hart Building on the reasons for the delay. They \nalso spoke with chiefs of staff and office managers from those offices. \nSince this situation affects the entire Senate family, I want to share \nwhat the EPA officials told us. When EPA told us last week about their \nplans to remediate the entire Hart Building using chlorine dioxide as a \nfumigant, they said they believed it was the safest, most effective, \nmost comprehensive, and least disruptive way to remediate Hart. At the \nsame time, they said their plan would not be final until it had passed \na peer review--until leading scientists in government and the private \nsector had examined it and agreed it was a reasonable way to go.\n  According to EPA, over the weekend, some of those scientists raised \nquestions about the plan. While they all agreed that a chlorine dioxide \nfumigant will kill anthrax spores, some of the experts EPA consulted \nexpressed concerns about using chloride dioxide gas on a building as \nlarge as the Hart Building. According to EPA officials, this is not a \nscientific issue. It is an engineering issue. As a result of these \nquestions, EPA is now formulating a new plan for the Hart Building.\n  The Senate Sergeant at Arms has appropriately insisted that the \nentire Hart Building be tested for anthrax. The building will remain \nclosed until the EPA deems that it is safe to reenter. I understand the \nfrustration and disappointment of Senators and staff who have been \ndisplaced by the Hart Building closure. We have all been greatly \ninconvenienced, and we are anxious to get back to the regular order in \nour offices. But we are dealing with a deadly bacteria. Safety must \ncome before convenience. Twenty members of my staff and 8 other members \nof the Senate family were exposed to anthrax when that letter was \nopened. I do not want one more person to have to face that situation.\n  It is important that we all understand the EPA, and only the EPA, has \nthe expertise to declare the Hart Building safe. We will follow their \nlead and re-open Hart when they certify it is safe to do so. The safety \nand health of the people who work in the Hart Building and those who \nvisit there must be our guide.\n  I appreciate the patience and the understanding of all our \ncolleagues, their staffs, and those who find themselves as dislocated \nas my staff. I intend to continue to give periodic reports as they are \nnecessary, and I will share whatever information is made available as \nsoon as it is provided to me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/06/senate-section/article/S11504-4", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
