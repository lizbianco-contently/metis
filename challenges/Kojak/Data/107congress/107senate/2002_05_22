Mr. President, as I have done on other occasions, I want \nto bring attention of the Senate to where\n\n[[Page S4658]]\n\nwe are in education funding, an issue which is of central concern to \nfamilies all over this country. I think if we asked the families across \nAmerica--I know around Massachusetts--they are obviously concerned, \nparticularly in the last few days and certainly in the last few months \nabout the dangers of terrorism. They want to be sure we are going to be \nable to support our forces overseas. They are very concerned about it.\n  In my State, even with the rosy predictions of some, we still have \ncommunities with sizable unemployment. Families have a great deal of \nuncertainty about their future.\n  But right underneath the surface are two other major issues. One is \nhealth care, and that is reflected in the cost of prescription drugs \nand the availability of prescription drugs, but, second, and equal to \nthat, is the question of ensuring their children will receive a quality \neducation.\n  We addressed that issue in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nlast year. We worked together with President Bush. We are proud of the \nfact we were effective in working together, bridging many of the \ndifferences. We were able to get a sizable downpayment for that \nlegislation.\n  We have still left many children behind. Even though the bill is \ncalled No Child Left Behind, we are still leaving millions of children \nbehind. Under the administration's proposal, we are going to even leave \nadditional children behind.\n  As this chart shows, as we started the proposal last year, the Bush \nproposal was 3.5 percent. We were able to effectively get it up to 20 \npercent.\n  All of us are very familiar with the statements, the comments the \nPresident has made about how we all have responsibility. Students have \nresponsibility and accountability; schools have responsibility; parents \nhave responsibility.\n  That raises another issue. In the drafting of the rules, I think all \nof us understand the first educator for a child is the parents. We have \nput a special requirement in the legislation to make sure parents will \nbe involved every step along the way in the implementation of the act \nwe passed last year.\n  So it brings us some dismay that the administration has failed to do \nthat, and done this in such a way that the parents are now bringing a \nsuit against the administration because they are being excluded at the \nlocal level. That makes no sense. We should welcome parents in at the \nlocal level. We should welcome parents into the process of the \neducation of their children.\n  But very quickly, before leaving this chart, I, again, want to show \nfrom the 3.5-percent increase, we were able to raise that up to 20 \npercent. We heard the administration talk a great deal, with the great \nsense of pride they had, with all the additional resources, and now it \nis back to 2.8 percent.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Please.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator has hit an important point when we \ntalk about the future of education and teachers. That chart tells an \ninteresting story.\n  In Illinois, when I went to one of the universities that graduates \nmore teachers than other schools, I said: What are we going to do about \nthe shortage of teachers which we are facing in America? How are we \ngoing to find more teachers?\n  They said: Certainly we need more teachers, and good teachers, but \nour biggest problem is retaining teachers. Teachers who are educated, \nwho graduate with student loans and the burdens that they face, start \nteaching in a classroom and after 2 or 3 years get discouraged, leave \nthe classroom and go into the private sector. They said that we have to \nfind a way to retain good teachers.\n  That is also an important element.\n  What the Senator pointed out here is that if the Bush administration \nwill not continue its funding level for teachers, there is going to be \nunpredictability, unreliability for the teacher in the future.\n  My State is facing budget problems. Most are. They are going to be \ncutting back on education. So the double hit from both State funding \nand the Bush administration's refusal to fund its own education bill is \ngoing to jeopardize the number of teachers who are going to be \navailable.\n  I think that is going to create problems far beyond next year.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate what the Senator has pointed out. This \nchart indicates that $742 million was added by the Congress last year \nfor teacher quality. That is effectively zeroed out in terms of this \nyear for teachers, in terms of recruiting teachers and in terms of \nretaining teachers. This is professional development.\n  I want to remind the American people that we have an administration \nwhich says, with the No. 1 domestic priority of education, we are \nconfined to $600 billion in tax cuts that they asked us to verify and \nmake permanent for the future. And here we have virtually zero in terms \nof increasing the retention of teachers, training of teachers, and \nprofessional development.\n  Do the American people really believe this is the first domestic \npriority for the administration when they don't fund it and they asked \nthe Congress to make permanent $600 billion in tax cuts over the next 7 \nyears?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, will the Senator from Massachusetts yield \non another question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield to the leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate very much what the Senator \nfrom Illinois said. Last weekend I spoke in South Dakota at the last \ngraduation of a high school at Hecla in my State. Hecla is closing its \ndoors. They will no longer have a high school in that small town. What \nI find is that what is happening in Hecla is happening in places all \nover my State and in the country. Budgets are collapsing at the local \nlevel. They are not able to fund the priorities because the property \ntax base is shrinking. Every school administrator and every school \ndistrict president I have talked to says they no longer have the budget \nthey had just a couple of years ago. The situation is exacerbated by \nthe tremendous loss of revenue at the local level.\n  On top of that, we now see a loss of revenue at the Federal level. \nSchools are getting caught in the squeeze. There is less money at the \nlocal level to hire teachers, to do what they have to do to improve the \nschools, and to ensure they have the proper classroom size at the very \ntime of a double whammy by the administration which comes out with a \nbudget that is sorely lacking in commitment of resources needed to meet \nthe issues and challenges these schools are facing.\n  We are going to continue to see schools close, schools downsize, \nclasses get larger, and students subjected to teachers who in some \ncases may not be qualified, in large measure because funding is not \nthere.\n  We cannot have reform that we hear this administration wants without \nhaving resources. I appreciate very much the Senator from Massachusetts \ncalling attention to that fact. But I ask: Does the Senator from \nMassachusetts have any similar situations he has experienced? Are \nschools not having that problem now not only in rural areas but in \nurban areas as well?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. I think the Senator \nwould agree with me that parents back home just want their children \neducated. They want a partnership. I imagine in South Dakota and \nMassachusetts they want a partnership to make sure we are going to have \ninvestment in children.\n  It is a question of priorities. The leader has pointed out what was \nhappening in his State. This isn't just something that the Senator from \nSouth Dakota has pointed out. Here is an article from the Wall Street \nJournal. This is not an organ of the Democratic Party. It is a very \nextensive article about the tight budget posing a threat to the smaller \nclass sizes, which as we have all seen has a direct impact on children \nlearning.\n  The article says:\n\n       In the prosperous 1990's, cutting class sizes gained \n     importance, fueled by a Clinton-era program providing Federal \n     aid for teacher hiring. But now some districts can't afford \n     smaller classes partly due to unexpected costs of the hiring \n     they've already done, and partly because of the economic \n     slowdown.\n\n  And it is escalating dramatically.\n  It is an extensive article. I ask unanimous consent to have the \narticle printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S4659]]\n\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 16, 2002]\n\n              Tight Budgets Pose a Threat to Small Classes\n\n                           (By Robert Tomsho)\n\n       The crowded classroom may be coming back.\n       In the prosperous 1990s, cutting class sizes gained \n     importance, fueled by a Clinton-era program providing federal \n     aid for teacher hiring. But now some districts can't afford \n     smaller classes partly due to unexpected costs of the hiring \n     they've already done, and partly because of the economic \n     slowdown.\n       Meanwhile, a new federal policy shift soon will permit \n     states to spend federal money formerly dedicated to smaller \n     classes on other school programs.\n       Districts that stopped maintaining smaller classes may not \n     see class sizes go up for a few years. Still, worried \n     advocates of small classes are starting to take action now to \n     protect a policy widely popular among parents and teachers.\n       In 1996 the Irvine Unified School District, near Los \n     Angeles, joined California's big push to reduce class sizes \n     in kindergarten through third grade to no more than 20 \n     students per class. With the state picking up 70% of the tab, \n     the district hired about 200 teachers. Since then, related \n     costs have increased as these new teachers moved up the pay \n     scale. Because state funding hasn't kept up, Irvine had to \n     tap local revenue, thereby increasing classes in the higher \n     grades. Since the district began reducing K-3 class sizes in \n     1996, it has had to raise class sizes in grades 4-12 to an \n     average of 35 students per class, up from 33. The jumps have \n     been sharpest at the high-school level: Some classes have as \n     many as 40 students.\n       Barbara Kadar, an Irvine first-grade teacher, says the \n     program allowed her to spot individual problems early on. She \n     says she's shocked at the policy reversal. ``They found the \n     goose that laid the golden egg, and now they're killing it.''\n       At least nine other California school districts, out of \n     1,048, including the Cabrillo Unified School District, in \n     Half Moon Bay, and Livermore Valley Joint Unified School \n     District, in Livermore, made similar moves. State education \n     officials expect many more districts to do the same by fall.\n       Similar funding cuts for class-size reduction programs have \n     been proposed in Massachusetts, Wisconsin and other cash-\n     strapped states. Even in places where state money for them \n     has gone untouched, sharp cuts in state aid have forced \n     districts to consider staff cuts that would result in higher \n     class sizes. Brian Benzel, superintendent of schools in \n     Spokane Wash., said: ``We are going to be in a very difficult \n     set of trade-offs.''\n       Parents aren't likely to sympathize. This past month, \n     dozens attended a meeting of the Riverside, Calif., board of \n     education to protect its elimination of class-size reduction \n     for the third grade. Meanwhile, in Memphis, amid a campaign \n     by the local PTA, parents have been driving to the state \n     Capitol in Nashville to demand that Tennessee legislators \n     pass a budget that keeps the state's program. Recent polls \n     show that an overwhelming margin of Florida voters back a \n     constitutional amendment requiring the state to adequately \n     fund a drive for smaller classes. ``I can't go anywhere in \n     public without someone coming up to me and saying that we \n     have to do something,'' says state Sen. Debby Wasserman-\n     Schultz, a Florida Democrat involved in an effort to put the \n     proposed amendment on the November ballot.\n       For fiscal 2003, the Bush administration has combined the \n     stand-alone federal class-reduction program with a program \n     intended to enhance teacher quality. Now, states and school \n     districts can decide whether to use about $2.85 billion in \n     related funds for new hires or to bolster teacher quality. \n     The move was designed to give states more ``flexibility and \n     accountability,'' says Eugene Hickok, U.S. undersecretary of \n     education.\n       Critics say the federal move enables states to shrink their \n     own programs and sets the stage for endless wrangling over \n     future funding for such initiatives. ``It's going to come \n     down to how much clout the teachers and parents have,'' says \n     retired Tennessee State University education professor Helen \n     Pate-Bain, a prominent advocate of smaller classes and former \n     head of the National Education Association, a teachers union.\n       About 25 states have class-size reduction programs. In \n     1998, President Clinton, who championed the cause, called the \n     hiring of 100,000 new teachers and establishing the federal \n     class-size reduction program.\n       Research over the years has indicated that smaller class \n     sizes lead to higher achievement in the primary grades, with \n     the most marked improvements occurring when a classroom has \n     20 or fewer students. The effect of small classes beyond \n     third grade is more mixed. During the 30 years of reduction \n     in the federal ratios, nationwide achievement trends were a \n     mixed bag: Math scores rose steadly as science results fell \n     for some age groups.\n       California, having already spent nearly $8 billion since \n     1996 to hire 28,000 new teachers, expects to complete an \n     evaluation of its program by summer. Meanwhile, its program \n     has had some unintended effects: In its hiring binge, the \n     state had to take on more uncertified teachers to fill its \n     classrooms, and about two-thirds of districts cut other \n     programs, such as in music and art, to keep the classes \n     small.\n       Such side effects haven't blunted support for small \n     classes. Earlier this year, California's program was barely \n     touched by budget cuts. Even as individual districts cut \n     their programs, the California PTA is lobbying the state for \n     more funding for smaller classes. ``Parents and teachers \n     still strongly believe that this is good for their kids,'' \n     says Teri Burns, California's deputy superintendent of \n     education, governmental affairs. ``That pressure is still \n     there.''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is at a time when the administration \nis asking for $600 billion more in tax cuts. We cannot help the \nparents, the small towns, communities, and working families make sure \nthey are going to have a qualified teacher in every classroom in South \nDakota, in Illinois, and New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, will the Senator from Massachusetts yield \nfor an observation?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Please.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, the point the Senator from Massachusetts \nis making with regard to cutting the resources we have available for \neducation and then not funding the mandates really bites in the State \nof New Jersey. We have a $6 billion budget deficit in the upcoming \nyear. Educational funding is going to have to be cut just to balance \nthe budget. We have serious conflicts going on between teachers and \nadministrations across the State.\n  If I have heard the Senator correctly, we are going to have virtually \nno increase in education spending at the Federal level this year at a \ntime when we have decided we want to make permanent these tax cuts \nwhich really are going to people who are doing extraordinarily well in \nsociety.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has defined the choice. This is a question \nof priority which the Senator has outlined, the challenges in his home \nState, and what the choices are.\n  The administration, whatever we think about the past tax cuts, has \nnow requested of this Congress $600 billion more. The administration \nindicates that they have two priorities: Low-income children and \nspecial needs children.\n  I see both of my colleagues are here on this issue. They have \nindicated that the President has these two priorities.\n  Look at the special needs children. If we fund the $1 billion each \nyear, as the administration proposed, it would take 33 years to fully \nfund IDEA. A first grader at the time IDEA was first enacted would be \n67 years old by the time the Republicans' proposal fully funded IDEA.\n  That is the program that helps communities with special needs \nchildren. That program was fully funded when it passed here and went to \nthe conference when the Republicans ran the Senate. When it came back, \nit was zeroed out. It was called special interest funding.\n  Then, as a matter of principle, the decision was made by our \ncolleague and friend, the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords. He said \nthat isn't enough. He became an independent because he did not believe \nmeeting our responsibilities to special needs children was a boondoggle \nor pork spending.\n  I don't think the Senator from Illinois or the Senator from New \nJersey believe that either. I want to know if they believe, as I do, \nthat this is a national priority and should be a national priority, and \nthat we ought to be willing to make sure we meet our commitment to \nthose families who have the special needs children and to the taxpayers \nin those communities to make sure it is adequately funded.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, that is the \nimportant point, the last statement is the important point, because \nschool districts in Illinois, New Jersey, and Massachusetts are facing \na Federal mandate. Children with special needs, with learning \ndisabilities, physical disabilities, and other problems are going to \nhave to be given every opportunity to learn and be productive members \nof society.\n  That is something Congress and the Federal Government said to the \nlocal school districts. Yet we have not provided them the opportunity \nto do it.\n  The Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, and the Senator from \nMassachusetts, as well as the Senator from New Jersey and I, want the \nFederal Government to keep its words. We do not want to say to school \ndistricts: This is your responsibility; you figure\n\n[[Page S4660]]\n\nout how to pay for it. In some States, school districts have to move \nchildren great distances to find that special learning situation and \nenvironment where they can prosper, and at great expense. That is money \ntaken out of the regular classrooms, from the students and teachers. We \nneed to make sure there is quality education for all kids.\n  The Bush administration says it is a good mandate. But if they want \nto spend additional money for tax cuts, we can't see it. They want to \nput $600 billion more into tax cuts primarily for wealthy Americans and \nnot for education, for teachers, for students, and particularly for \nchildren with special needs. That is exactly the burden my school \ndistricts face in Illinois.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. There are smaller towns and communities that have \nchildren with special needs. When the school districts attempt to \nprovide for children with special needs, suddenly the property tax \nrates go up in the local towns and communities. Parents feel they are \nblessed to have children with special needs. They understand the \nchallenges faced in trying to take care of those children. I have never \nmet a parent who does not believe in some way that child gives them an \nadditional sense of purpose in life. All we are trying to say as a \nnation is we are going to try to help relieve that community from those \nvery special kinds of additional obligations. We are going to provide \nsome help--not all but some help and assistance.\n\n  Can either Senator explain to me why that is a lesser priority than \ntrying to have this $600 billion tax cut? That is the choice. Are we \ngoing to help small towns? They can be in North Carolina the State of \nour Presiding Officer, or they can be in South Carolina. They can be in \nwestern Massachusetts, southern Illinois, or any part of the State of \nNew Jersey. But these local communities are hurting and hurting deeply.\n  We have a lot of lip service, but if we are to follow what the \nadministration has said in terms of funding for IDEA, it is going to \ntake us another 33 years in order to do it.\n  Mr. CORZINE. If the Senator will yield for just a moment, I will make \nthe observation this is not only for small communities. I think about \ntowns such as Camden and Newark in the State of New Jersey, where class \nsizes average about 30. Many of these children who have special needs \nare mainstreamed, but they have special programs to try to lift those \nwith learning disabilities.\n  These towns and cities do not have the tax base to even raise the \nnecessary money. So what happens is, in fact, we are forcing failure to \ncomply with the law, failure to meet the needs of our children. And if \nwe, as a nation, do not begin to prioritize these elements of our \npopulation in this educational process, we are going to recycle these \nproblems because it just goes on and on, and it is extraordinarily \ndangerous in our small towns and cities for our urban kids, \nparticularly where you combine the problem of large class size and \nspecial needs for kids who have been mainstreamed in classrooms because \nthere are no other choices.\n  I hope we can speak strongly about doing what we always argue: That \nwe want to make sure we fully fund IDEA. It is not happening. I commend \nthe Senator from Massachusetts for his effort.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator because we have recognized this IDEA \nprogram has been built upon the Supreme Court holdings about \nresponsibility. We have the responsibility to make sure education is \ngoing to be available and accessible to children with special needs. \nThat is effectively the Court's decision.\n  So we have said we are going to provide help and assistance. We have \nfailed to do so. As the Senator points out, the fact is, 25 years ago \nthere were 4 million children who were effectively either being kept at \nhome or pushed off in different kinds of settings who never had the \nopportunity for education. Now we know those children are working their \nway through.\n  What we have found, in terms of the graduation rates, employment \nrates, and even the college graduation rates, they have all \ndramatically increased. And the difference it has made is extraordinary \nin terms of their lives, living lives of independence and even being \ntaxpayers.\n  My friend from New Jersey is in the Chamber. I want to mention one \nother area in which I know he is interested; that is, what has happened \nwith the Pell grants.\n  We just have a brief opportunity. We have seen what the cost of \neducation has been, the shrinking buying power of the Pell grants. We \nknow how important this is in terms of children. The average income is \n$17,000 for those who are eligible for the Pell grants.\n  We found out back in the mid-1970s that paid for about 80 percent of \nthe tuition for children who went to 4-year public colleges less so in \nprivate institutions. Now we have seen that purchasing power go down.\n  Does the Senator not agree with me that we, at some time, made a \ndecision we were going to try to make sure that children of ability and \ntalent, from wherever they came, whatever part of the country--despite \ntheir families' resources--would be able to gain entrance into a fine \nschool or college in New Jersey or Massachusetts or any other State, \nthat they would be able, with their limited means, to put together the \nPell grants, have the Work-Study Program, and with their summer \nincome--the extra work they might be able to do--have an education?\n  Will the Senator comment about what has happened with that Pell grant \nwhich has really been the key to opportunity? We will hear a lot of \nspeeches in this body and a lot of speeches being made in America about \nthe importance of education and how that opens the doors of \nopportunity. Does the Senator from New Jersey not agree with me that \neffectively we are closing those doors for a very significant number of \nAmericans and, therefore, we are losing, at least for those young \nAmericans, the real hope and opportunity that education provides?\n  Mr. CORZINE. The Senator from Massachusetts is exactly correct. It is \nextraordinarily disappointing that we have seen this kind of trend, \nparticularly at our public universities, which were really designed to \ngive every American access to higher education. I have not studied the \nnumbers in the last couple months, but I think the average earnings of \na college graduate relative to a high school graduate are almost double \nfor someone who completes a 4-year college degree.\n  If we do not understand that reflects productivity into our economy \nand into our society, we are making a huge mistake. This kind of \nunderfunding of access to the American promise, the American dream, I \nfind hard to conceive. I know it has been important in my life, and it \nhas been for many of our colleagues.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the Senator's comments because this Nation \nhad been committed to that value. We had the land-grant colleges in the \n1870s, which was the beginning of the commitment to make sure children \nwith limited means would be able to go to college. We had the GI bill \nafter World War II, and every evaluation shows that those who received \nthe GI bill paid five times as much in taxes as it actually cost.\n  We had this commitment in the early 1960s with the Pell grants and \nthe Stafford loans to put together, and day after day, when we have \nfailed to fund this program, we are increasingly denying that \nopportunity for millions of Americans.\n  We have a responsibility to invest in the children of this country. \nThe choice is clear: Are we going to follow what the President has \nsuggested, $600 billion more in terms of tax cuts, or are we going to \ninvest in the children of this country in K-12 to help provide help and \nassistance to those families, the special needs children, and the \ngifted and talented children, to take advantage of the Pell grants, or \nto otherwise be denied the education?\n  Mr. President, this is a matter of importance to every family. We \nwant to give them the assurances that we on this side, on the \nDemocratic side, are going to stand with the families. We are going to \nfight for this funding because it is our priority, their priority, and \nwe will do everything we possibly can to make it a reality.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we have been very involved in relatively \nfew issues over the past 6 weeks. We were on energy, and for about 3 \nweeks we have been on trade. Obviously, our attention has been very \nstrongly on terrorism and doing the things that are necessary both \noverseas and internally. At the same time, we have talked among \nourselves, of course, and one of the elements is to do normal business.\n  Today, I want to talk about an issue that is quite often normal \nbusiness, particularly for those of us in the West, and that is public \nlands. Of course, there are a lot of aspects to public lands.\n  In States such as Wyoming, about 50 percent of the State belongs to \nthe Federal Government, and therefore what is done with public lands \nhas a great deal to do with our economy and our activities. We feel \nvery strongly about it, of course. It is a big issue for us. The idea \nof multiple use is one that is always debatable and is being discussed. \nThere are different kinds of public lands. There are those set aside \nfor wilderness, for a special use, for a special reason, and there are \nthose with various restrictions, set aside for parks or U.S. forests. \nSo there are constant issues that relate to the use of that land.\n  Of course, much of our domestic energy is produced on public lands. \nSo we need to make sure we can work on the extraction of energy and \ndomestic production and, at the same time, maintain the quality of the \nenvironment. That is a debatable issue. I think we can do that, and we \nhave demonstrated in Wyoming that you can have multiple use and \nproduction of resources, and you can have grazing and, at the same \ntime, protect the land and the environment. So energy has become very \nmuch an issue.\n  As you know, the whole question over ANWR was the idea that we now \nlook overseas for about 60 percent of our energy. We need to increase \nour domestic production so we become less dependent upon others. That \ncontinues to be an issue. But it is not only ANWR. That was simply the \nposter child. The fact is, in the West it is a very continuing and \nimportant issue. We are involved in doing EISs right now, and EPA and \nendangered species issues, which go together to make decisions.\n  Access is also very important. People like to visit public lands with \nmultiple use. The question of roads comes up. Most people agree that \noutside of the wilderness, limited roads are the answer. Again, we have \nto protect the environment.\n  One of the things we have pushed for and continue to do so--and this \nadministration has promised to do and I think is doing--is to allow for \nmore flexibility and more local input. It is true the locals cannot \nmake the decisions regarding public lands, but they can have very \nhelpful input into how they are managed.\n  We are also talking about the use of snow machines in Yellowstone \nPark. Of course, there is some controversy about that. Some people \ndon't think there ought to be anybody in the park in the wintertime. \nMillions of cars are there in the summer, but there are only a few \nthousand in the winter and that seems to upset them. Nobody is \nsuggesting we continue to do it as we have in the past. But there are \nnow reliable sources that can make quieter machines so that they can be \nmanaged better and separated from cross-country skiers. You can do a \nnumber of things to allow the owners to participate in public lands.\n\n  Another issue that has been discussed is the matter of fires. We are \ninto that season now and we have already had forest and grass fires in \nsome places. Certainly, we are better prepared for that now, partly \nbecause we have had three dry years. The Forest Service has invested a \ngreat deal more in personnel and equipment to deal with that problem.\n  One of the other issues that sometimes is controversial is the idea \nof trying to prevent forest fires by the removal of excess forage and \nfuel. It is something that has been done and can be done, and we have \nnot done enough of it perhaps. We ought to be able to do some thinning \nin various places that will make fires less likely to occur, rather \nthan putting all of our emphasis on fighting a fire after it has begun.\n  So public lands has a lot of interesting issues and always will, of \ncourse. There are people on both sides that sort of take extreme \npositions. Some say we should not touch those lands; they should be set \naside totally. Others are not concerned about damage to the \nenvironment. So we need to find a reasonable middle ground so we can \nhave access, so we can have multiple use and, at the same time, we can \npreserve the resource.\n  I want to talk briefly today about one aspect of it and that is our \nnational parks. National parks are different, at least for one reason, \nin that they were set aside as national parks for a specific reason. \nThe reason that is so different is the BLM lands--Bureau of Land \nManagement. Most of the lands in Wyoming were not set aside, they were \nresidual, what was left after the Homestead Act had been completed. So \nthey may or may not have any particular significant character to them. \nParks, on the other hand, do have significant character or they would \nnot be designated as parks. So we have been working on that.\n  In 1998, I was successful in passing Vision 2014 in which we dealt \nfor the first time in a number of years with ways to help strengthen \nparks, in terms of management and their concessions, and in terms of \ndealing with the natural resource needs, and dealing with financing of \nnational parks. It provides for improved management, increased \naccountability. As in any other issue, there has to be accountability \nwhen you are talking about millions of dollars. Of course, it has to be \nmanagement when you are talking about millions of people going there. \nSo we were very pleased with that law. I think it is doing some things \nthat are very useful.\n  Part of the funding in the past has been what has been called the \ndemonstration fee project, which created park passes. That has been in \nplace now for 3 years. The National Park Foundation has been \ninstrumental in its success. Now there is a very attractive portfolio \nand picture and so on, and persons can buy this pass, which does two \nthings. One, it gives accessibility to all 385 national parks and also \nhelps to contribute to the sustenance of those parks. We certainly want \nto continue that program, but we are now going to be working on \nsomething that does expire. It is called the Demonstration Fee \nProgram. It expires at the end of this year. It has been in existence \nfor about 5 years. It was an opportunity for some small additional fee \non certain parks and allowed for income and the opportunity to make \nexpenditures on what is good for visitors in the parks. It extended not \nonly to the Park Service but also the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Forest Service.\n\n  It turns out the collection of the fee in many places is very \ndifficult. In fact, with the BLM it is almost impossible. If there is a \npublic land forest, and in some instances there are facilities, they \ncan probably do that, but it is very difficult. On the other hand, \nparks almost always have an admission site, a gate for entry.\n\n[[Page S4662]]\n\n  So the idea is the principal support for parks and public lands is \nprovided through taxes from everyone, and then some small contribution \nmade by those visitors. We are trying to avoid the idea of each park \nhaving various charges.\n  Eighty percent of the funds that come from the fees are used in the \npark where they are collected. Some parks cannot collect, so 20 percent \nis reallocated generally. But a major part of the fee goes to the park \nwhere the fee is collected.\n  We modified it some. We are making a permanent fee, rather than the \ndemonstration fee which expires. We made provisions and criteria for \nthe charging of the fee. We have a business management plan on the park \nand determine the feasibility of this program. Not all parks will be \ninvolved. We will do away with the nickel-and-dime fees where you pay \nfor every little thing.\n  This provides a great opportunity. We talk a lot about the lack of \nfunding for parks. Particularly in the infrastructure, that is probably \ntrue. This administration has made it clear they intend to increase the \nfunding for the infrastructure, particularly of larger parks such as \nYellowstone or Yosemite where there are millions of people visiting, \nwhere we have highway problems, sewer problems, facility problems. We \nhave introduced a bill that makes this permanent. It helps fund our \nparks and keep them strong.\n  We have over 385 national parks in America. In addition, there are \nheritage sites and other parks administered by the Park Service. That \nis one of the real treasures of the United States, our national parks--\nwhether they be in Florida, in the Everglades or elsewhere.\n  We are working on a fee demonstration program for national parks. The \npurpose is to keep them the valuable asset they are. They have to be \npreserved. We changed some concessions so they contribute more, yet \nmake them competitive. We are seeking to get business management in the \nlarger parks. They are big business, operating in millions of dollars \neach year. Times change. We are seeking to change with it. The purpose \nis to effectively manage the resources so they are available to their \nowners to visit.\n  We look forward to the passage of the fee demonstration project.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 11:30 \na.m. shall be for debate only, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled by the two leaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we have had 3 good weeks of debate on \nthis bill. I urge my colleagues now to think about voting to invoke \ncloture so we can get past this bill and get on to other business. We \nhave already disposed of 19 amendments. A number of other proposed \namendments have been addressed through colloquies and will also be \nincluded in the managers' amendment at the end of this legislation.\n  I might say, early in the debate we were able to forge a historic \ncompromise on trade adjustment assistance which expanded the program to \ndeserving groups of workers and, for the first time, provided health \ncare adjustment to TAA recipients.\n  That is an extremely important development. Currently, trade \nadjustment assistance--that is, assistance to workers displaced because \nof trade--is paltry. It doesn't help workers very much. It only applies \nto primary workers anyway. We made huge, significant improvements to \nhelp develop a consensus on trade; that is, so more people\n\n[[Page S4663]]\n\nget in on the benefits of trade or at least are not harmed when there \nis natural change in our economy because of globalism and economic \nreadjustment.\n  This trade adjustment assistance part of it, it should be understood, \nI might say unpretentiously, is an extremely important part of this \nbill. As it stands now, I believe this bill is the most forward-looking \nand significant trade legislation to be considered by this body in over \n15 years.\n  The fast-track extension included in this bill provides authority for \nthe President to negotiate trade agreements, both multilaterally and \nunilaterally. Using fast track, the President will be able to open new \nmarkets for U.S. exporters and for the benefit of U.S. consumers.\n  As I have noted before, this section of the bill is also the most \nprogressive ever to gain serious consideration by the Congress. Not \nonly is the trade adjustment assistance provision most progressive, but \nalso the fast-track TPA portions of the bill are most progressive. For \nthe first time, labor and environmental issues are part of the core of \nany future trade agreements. That is monumental.\n  I cannot tell you, Madam President, the number of years that issue \nhas been debated. Those who did not want labor to be included at all in \nthe negotiating objectives of trade agreements, who did not want \nenvironmental issues at all considered, won the day. But, frankly, I \nthink it was the breakdown of the ministerial in Seattle; that is, the \ntrade ministers' meeting in Seattle, which could not cope with all the \nchanges in the world, including the necessary inclusion of labor and \nenvironmental provisions, that has now brought this to where, in this \nlegislation, we are doing so.\n  This bill for the first time includes labor and environmental issues. \nIt also continues U.S. priorities such as opening agricultural markets. \nWe all know one of the biggest challenges we face as Americans is \nknocking down agricultural trade barriers worldwide. The European Union \nis one of the greatest offenders.\n  We also know we want to preserve our U.S. trade laws, such as section \n201 of our countervailing duty laws or antidumping, which are there to \nhelp keep other countries honest; that is, to help prevent other \ncountries from dumping in America, from subsidizing their production \nand sending it over to America. We need those laws to help keep those \nother countries honest because our borders are significantly more open \nthan are the borders of other countries.\n  So we need our trade laws to help them do what they know is the right \nthing to do. If we do not have our trade laws, they are unlikely to do \nit.\n  The legislation before us, as I mentioned, extends and expands trade \nadjustment assistance. It is critically important. This is long \noverdue. Let me just explain in some detail, although not much detail, \nwhat that provides.\n  We extend coverage to ensure workers can complete job retraining. \nThat is an extension. We have a whole new pilot program on wage \ninsurance, so a lot of people who are dislocated on account of trade \nhave the option not to take the trade adjustment benefits but, instead, \ncan take wage insurance, which essentially compensates the employee for \nhalf of the difference between his old job and his new job, the beauty \nof this being it helps people work again; they are back at a job \nworking, as opposed to just receiving benefits.\n  We also expand coverage to secondary workers--not just primary \nworkers.\n  For example, if an auto plant lays off employees, what about the \nsupplier of windshields or the supplier of engine parts? They get laid \noff, too. Those are the secondary workers who are now covered under \nthis bill. It is a huge benefit. We expand it to farmers and to \nfishermen. They get displaced because of trade many times.\n  As I mentioned, it is extremely important. For the first time, we \nprovide health insurance for displaced workers. It is critically \nimportant in these days where, unfortunately for many people, it is \nhard to get health insurance anyway.\n  When you are displaced and lose your job, what are you going to do \nabout your health insurance? You are going to need health insurance. We \nprovide health insurance under trade adjustment assistance.\n  These matters should not be taken lightly. They are extraordinarily \nimportant. Those trade adjustment assistance provisions will be \navailable to people who are displaced because of trade irrespective of \nwhether it was a consequence of a fast-track bill, irrespective of \nwhether that dislocation was a consequence of some trade agreement not \nsubject to fast track--most trade agreements are not subject to fast \ntrack--irrespective of whether there is any agreement of any kind \nbecause the world economy is so fluid and some changes are almost \nchaotic. Those benefits in the legislation will be available to anybody \nwho qualifies and loses a job on account of trade, irrespective of any \nfast track or any trade bill. It is vitally important.\n  The bill also extends and expands two very vital preference programs. \nOne is the Generalized System of Preferences, GSP, and the other is the \nAndean Trade Preference Act, which is very important, particularly if \nwe want to increase trade in South America. European countries and \nothers have trade with South America. We need to get moving and have a \nbetter trading relationship with at least the Andean countries in South \nAmerica. This bill extends those preference programs for 5 years, and \nalso rebates tariffs paid since expiration which was the end of last \nyear.\n  The two I mentioned are also improved. The Andean Trade Preference \nAct now includes a petition process for reviewing the progress of \nAndean countries in meeting the objectives set out in the bill. And the \nGSP Program has been updated to take into account the definition of \ncore worker rights promulgated by the ILO's 1998 declaration. That is \nan update. It helps to bring ILO standards up to date.\n  Further, in this debate on this bill, Senators have improved the \nlegislation through their amendments. Senator Kennedy, for example, won \nan amendment to ensure that the global AIDS crisis is properly \nrecognized in trade legislation. Senators Dayton and Craig contributed \nan important amendment to ensure U.S. trade laws are not needlessly \ntreated as bargaining chips in trade negotiations. I intend to see to \nit that this issue is properly addressed as this legislation moves \nforward.\n  Senator Edwards added an amendment to ensure that the interests of \ntextile companies and their workers are treated fairly in trade \nnegotiations, and under trade adjustment assistance.\n  I congratulate each of these Senators for their contributions and \nhope they will help us in moving their amendments and the entire \nlegislative package forward.\n  We have had a good and full debate on this trade bill. I plan to \ncontinue to work with Senators to see to it that their concerns are \naddressed.\n  But it is time to begin to think about passing this bill. It is time \nto wind down the debate. It is time to invoke cloture. There are always \ngoing to be further amendments that some Senators wish to offer. But at \nsome point we need to declare that enough is enough and move this \nprocess forward. I believe we are at that time. For the sake of \nAmerican workers, for the sake of American business, for the sake of \nevery American farmer and rancher, particularly American workers and \nemployees, and because a very important part of this bill is to help \nthose who are dislocated on account of trade, I urge my colleagues to \nvote for cloture.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will speak briefly on the pending \nlegislation, which is the trade promotion authority, the trade \nadjustment authority, the Andean trade agreement, the general agreement \non tariffs language.\n  There is that old adage: If there are two things you do not want to \nwatch being made, one is sausage, the other is law. Regrettably, that \napplies to this undertaking.\n  For reasons which still escape me but which appear to be necessary \nfrom the\n\n[[Page S4664]]\n\nstandpoint of the administration, there was a negotiation which \noccurred which involved how this bill would come to the floor. The \nmajority leader decided to, out of the course which is typical, hook \nthree major pieces of legislation together: Andean trade, trade \nadjustment, and trade promotion.\n  Traditionally, trade promotion, which has historically been noted as \nfast track, has been taken up as a single issue. It was not linked to \ntrade adjustment nor with another treaty, which in this case would be \nthe Andean trade promotion agreement. But the majority leader decided \nto bring the three to the floor, and the administration, working \nthrough the leadership on the Republican side of the aisle, working \nwith Senator Grassley, Senator Lott, and Senator Gramm, entered into \nextensive negotiations as to the makeup of the final package.\n  The result of that was, as I mentioned, something you probably should \nnot watch, whether it is the making of sausage or the making of this \npiece of legislation because within this bill there are major new \ninitiatives which have very little to do with trade, but a great deal \nto do with bad public policy, as we try to address issues such as \nhealth care and people losing their jobs.\n  There is no question but that the trade adjustment concept is a very \nimportant one. I have used it extensively in my role in public policy. \nThere have been instances in New Hampshire where people have been put \nout of work because of what appeared to be unfair trade activity, and \nwe have used trade adjustment to assist those individuals. It has been \nvery successful.\n  Its purpose--the original concept of trade adjustment--was to train \npeople, to give them new talents, new abilities, new capabilities, so \nthey could go back into the workforce after losing their job because \nthe job which they lost no longer existed because trade, competition \nhad basically left it behind. We helped those people get back into the \nworkforce and actually have more talent, more ability, and thus be more \nproductive and actually end up being citizens who have a better earning \ncapacity.\n  That is the goal of trade adjustment, a very laudable goal, \nappropriate goal, and something which actually has worked rather well, \nat least in my experience as it has been applied in New Hampshire. I \nused it aggressively both as Governor and since then, on occasion, I \nhave had the chance to use it to help people in my role in the Senate.\n  But this bill takes the trade adjustment concept and moves it into an \nentirely different exercise. It moves it into an exercise of what \nbasically amounts to welfare, in many instances, and to social \nengineering, in other instances, and into an attempt to address a \nhealth care need which is significant but which, when addressed in the \nmanner in which it is addressed in this bill, puts us on a path which \ncould lead to a radical expansion in the cost of health care for the \ntaxpayers of America who have to bear the burden of these types of \ninitiatives.\n\n  The bill has in it two major new entitlements, something called wage \nsubsidy, which is a European model program that essentially says you \nare going to pay people to take less productive jobs. Somebody who is \nout there working hard, earning money, paying taxes, they are going to \ntake their tax dollars and pay somebody who is out of work to take a \njob where that person will be less productive, encourage them to move \ninto a less productive job--just the opposite of what the original \npurpose of trade adjustment was--a concept which is purely reflective \nof what is done in our European neighbors' economies, where they \nbasically pay people to be nonproductive citizens.\n  That is the first entitlement initiative called wage subsidy: A \nperson gets $5,000 to make up the difference between what they were \nbeing paid in the job they lose and the job they take. There are no \nlimitations on this. There is no requirement of necessity. There is no \nrequirement that there be an arm's length agreement. There is no \nrequirement, if there is a similar or substantially similar job out \nthere that the person could have taken at an equal amount of pay or \nbetter, that the person take that job. There is no requirement the \nperson stay in the community.\n  There are none of the requirements that are the concepts built around \ntrade adjustment, which are a person should basically be retrained, \ngiven new talents, new opportunities to find a new job within the \nmarketplace where they lost their job. None of those protections are \nthere. There are no protections against fraud and abuse, mismanagement \nof this brand new entitlement. And it opens the door to a massive \nexpansion of this concept, which we see.\n  It is not as if that is a concern that is not relevant. We see that \ncourse of action being followed in our sister states, sister economies \naround the globe, where you have this concept of: If you pay people to \ndo less and be less productive, that is actually an appropriate \ngovernment policy where you take taxpayer dollars out of one person's \npocket and put them in another person's pocket and don't ask that \nperson to be more productive. You actually ask them to be less \nproductive.\n  That attitude of governance, which is paternalistic and which is what \ndominates the continental European economies, has huge impacts on your \nproductivity as a society and, therefore, on your creation of jobs and \nwealth and, as a result, on your creation, maintenance, and improvement \nof a standard of living.\n  There is an interesting article by Paul Johnson, one of the great \nhistorians of the last 20 or 30 years, on this specific point which is \ncontained in a book entitled ``Our Times.'' It is one of the reasons he \nviews the European economy as having failed to maintain itself, because \nthe European economy pursued this paternalistic approach toward \neconomic activity on which we are embarking as a result of choosing \nthis type of brandnew entitlement.\n  The second major entitlement in this bill is the health care \nentitlement, much more complex and difficult. The wage subsidy is just \na pure outrage. If you have any interest in marketplace economics, it \nis an affront. If you happen to believe in a paternalistic approach to \ngovernance, it is a great program. But if you believe in the \nmarketplace, it is an affront.\n  The health care entitlement in this bill, which has no place in trade \npromotion--it should be debated in the context of major health care \nreform--is much more complex but equally problematic because it creates \na brandnew major entitlement. Basically what this says is, if you lose \nyour job because of a trade-related activity, the Federal Government \nwill come in and pay you 70 percent of the cost of buying health care \nunder the terms with which you held health care prior to losing your \njob or under some sort of pooling agreement. It doesn't say you can go \nout and buy health care in the private marketplace or that you can join \nsome other group such as an association and buy health care through \nthat. It says you have to buy this new health care through your old \nhealth care provider or some new pooling agreement, a State-sponsored \npooling agreement.\n  This concept is a prefunded tax credit, essentially a welfare \npayment. That is a new title for it, such as when someone comes up with \na term to try to avoid the real meaning of what is happening. In this \ninstance, what we have is a welfare payment which is being made to an \nindividual who loses their job.\n  It is perfectly reasonable that we try to figure out some way to give \nreasonable health care coverage to people who lose their jobs. That is \nperfectly reasonable. But to do it in this narrow band of activity \noutside of a more substantive reform of the health care arena is to \nstep us off on a path which is slick and which is clearly downhill and \nwhich will probably lead to incredible mismanagement of our health care \ninitiatives and our attempts to correct the health care problems.\n  Right on the face of it, this creates an unbelievably difficult \nsituation for people who are working and don't have health care. If you \nare working and you don't have health care today, you are now going to \nbe paying taxes, probably increased taxes, to pay for somebody who is \ngoing to get health care who is not working. How fair is that? You \ncan't afford health care. You are paying taxes. Your taxes go up so \nthat somebody who doesn't have a job but who has a variety of different \nsupport mechanisms, including an additional 2 years of unemployment, \nsignificant\n\n[[Page S4665]]\n\nbenefits in the area of retraining, significant other benefits which \nare tied to trade adjustment--that person will also now get a 70-\npercent payment from you, the working American who does not have health \ncare, to that person, the nonworking person who does not have health \ncare, which creates a perverse incentive in the marketplace for the \nperson who doesn't have health care, who is out of a job, to stay out \nof a job or maybe the person who needs health care who has a job to \ngive up their job in order to get health care coverage.\n\n  It is very bad policy. It is unfair. It is extremely unfair to the \nperson paying taxes who does not have health care coverage.\n  The second problem with it is, by demanding that the person who is \ngetting this new coverage, the 70 percent of tax dollars to pay for \nthat health care insurance--how many people in America today have 70 \npercent of their health care paid for them by the Federal Government? I \nguess the Part B premium on Medicare is the only people who will be \ncompetitively in the same situation; about 75 percent of your Part B \npremium under Medicare is paid for by other taxpayers. But in this \ninstance, that 70-percent subsidy which comes from other taxpayers will \nnow have to be used to purchase the highest cost health insurance that \nis probably out there, which is the health insurance left over from the \njob you just lost.\n  You can't buy anything other than a COBRA-based health policy or this \nnew State pooling concept which does not exist. I am willing to almost \nguarantee it is not going to exist in most States because most States \ndon't have enough people who are affected by trade adjustment to create \na pooling agreement which would be viable through which to buy that \nhealth care insurance. They would have to set up an entirely different \ngroup of people to participate in the agreement. Maybe they will do \nthat, but most States are not going to set one up just for trade \nadjustment.\n  As a result, a person will have a 70-percent subsidy to buy the most \nexpensive health care rather than allowing that person to go out in the \nmarketplace and make an intelligent and thoughtful decision as to where \nthey will buy their health care.\n  You have immediately created an entitlement which is going to be \ndriven perversely in the amount of cost it will incur and where the \ndollars are going to flow in order to purchase health care, instead of \ncreating an atmosphere where the person without health insurance, who \nis out of a job, becomes an intelligent consumer of health care where \nthey go out in the marketplace and say: What do I really need? What can \nI really afford here? And what do I really need in health care \ninsurance? They look around and figure out what their best options are.\n  You are instead saying to that person: You must go out and buy the \nhighest end insurance out there. You may not need it, but you have to \nbuy it. Of course, 70 percent of it will be paid for by the poor person \nworking down the street who has a job and doesn't have health care at \nall.\n  It makes no sense. If you wanted to throw a door open and look out \nover an abyss of massive complication, this is it. To step into the \nuninsured health care issue in this manner is to do exactly that. It is \na massive new entitlement in its own right but a colossal mistake from \nthe standpoint of health care policy and a major entitlement initiative \nas it expands from here.\n  This is going to basically become a roadmap for the future. It will \nbe a rut that is going to be very hard to get out of intelligently as \nwe move down the road of health care reform, especially for uninsured \nAmericans. This is a big issue, something that has to be handled with a \nlittle more thought and foresight.\n  These are the two huge entitlements from a public policy standpoint. \nFinancially, they are not scored that aggressively in this bill. But \nfrom a public policy standpoint, these are the two massive new \nentitlements in this bill. They represent an explosion of new \nentitlement activity that is incurring in this Congress and under this \nadministration. The farm bill, scored at $80 billion when it first came \nthrough here over budget, is now somewhere over $100 billion, probably \nmore than that, and most of it is in a new entitlement program.\n  There are a variety of other ones in the wings coming at us, whether \nthey are mandated private sector activities or whether they are going \nto be something such as a drug benefit which now has a floor on it of \n$350 billion with no ceiling in sight.\n  When I came here in 1992, having just served as Governor of my State, \nmy focus was mainly on two things. In fact, it was the main focus of \nfour or five of us as new members, as Republicans, including Senators \nCoverdell, Bennett, Kempthorne, Hutchinson, and later Campbell. The \nfocus was on unfunded mandates that were being put on the States. The \nsecond was the explosion of entitlement costs. We took aggressive \naction because we were facing a significant deficit and had been \nthrough many years of it, to try to get entitlements under control. We \naggressively pushed that as new Members of the Senate.\n\n  It is sort of like ``deja vu all over again,'' to quote Yogi Berra. \nHere we are facing a deficit, and we don't know how severe it is going \nto be. We are piling on entitlements, and the most difficult spending \nto get under control in Government is entitlement spending because it \nis automatic. It creates interest groups and basically is not capable \nof being reined in efficiently or effectively in public bodies that go \nup for election every 2 and 6 years.\n  I think the trades made in this bill are difficult, to say the least. \nTo get fast-track authority--a procedural process for the President to \nhave an opportunity to make his points on trade agreements, which \ncannot be amended by the Senate, that is a very important point on \nadministrative prerogative, but it is procedural. In exchange for that \nprocedural right, we are trading away very significant new entitlement \ninitiatives which have explosive potential and are bad public policy.\n  As a result, I have deep reservations about this package. I regret it \nhas been negotiated in the manner it has been by our leadership in the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we will be conducting a vote on cloture \nat 11:30. Prior to the time we have that vote, I want to make some \nfinal comments about what I consider to be the importance of bringing \ndebate on the bill to a close and making sure that we have a good vote \non cloture this morning.\n  We opened the debate with a recognition of how critical it is in this \ncountry, with this economy, that we recognize especially the importance \nof our globalized markets and the need to be competitive in them. Under \nthe strong leadership of Senator Baucus and with help from Senator \nGrassley, we put together a historic package of trade legislation that \ndealt first with the Andean Trade Preference Act, an act that has \nalready proven itself to be invaluable to not only those countries in \nSouth America that have benefited directly from increased trade with \nthe United States, but this country as well--a recognition that this \ntrade partnership ought to be extended, a recognition that it is not \nonly an economic partnership but a strong political one, and that if we \ncan continue to provide political communication and coordination in a \nway that allows us better economic return, we are going to strengthen \nthose countries politically as well as economically.\n  That is what ATPA does. It is an opportunity for us to reaffirm our \nrecognition of a partnership of South American countries and our \nconfidence that economic trade is good for both.\n  Secondly, we added legislation to this package that, for the first \ntime, addresses meaningful assistance to those workers who are \ndisplaced as a result of trade. My view has always been that there are \nfar more winners than losers in expanding our trade around the world. \nBut we also recognize that there are some losers and some who, for \nwhatever reason, may have been dislocated. When those occasions occur, \nI think our country owes those workers a future, owes those workers \nsome safety net to ensure that their health needs and, hopefully, their \nshort-term unemployment needs are addressed.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance Act that we have put into this \npackage addresses that need. It does so very effectively. For the first \ntime, trade adjustment assistance will help those\n\n[[Page S4666]]\n\nwho have lost their jobs get coverage for health care under COBRA at 70 \npercent of the cost of the program itself. Seventy percent is an \nunprecedented statement about our commitment to those workers who have \nlost something as a result of changes in the environment that have been \ncreated as a result of job loss because of globalized market \ndevelopment.\n  We also provide new wage insurance legislation that helps older \nworkers who may just be on the verge of retirement but not quite there. \nThey are too old, perhaps, to get training for job relocation. They may \nbe much closer to retirement than to the possibility of a better job \nthrough new training and the acquisition of new training skills. So \nthis wage insurance is something the Heritage Foundation supports, \nsomething that trade study groups and think tanks have supported for \nmany years, something that the U.S. Trade Representative also signed \nonto as an effective tool for assisting those who are also adversely \naffected.\n  So there is no doubt, when you look to the first two components, the \nopportunity for us to address workers who are adversely affected and \nthe opportunity for us to extend the trading partnership with South \nAmerica, I have no doubt that on that basis alone we have all the \nreasons we need to pass this legislation.\n  Finally, let me say the bill itself--the base bill--the TPA, trade \npromotion authority, provides us with yet another reason we should be \nsupporting cloture this morning. We not only started with a good \npackage; in my view, we improved upon it. We added the Dayton-Craig \namendment on trade law that gives Congress an additional role, an \nopportunity for us to enhance the role as new trade agreements are \npresented.\n  We added the Dorgan amendment on transparency for the North American \nFree Trade Agreement, and the Kennedy amendment which helps us fight \nthe AIDS epidemic all over the world. There were other efforts I \nsupported that didn't become part of the bill, such as the Rockefeller \namendment on steelworkers.\n  I must say that overall we have debated more than a dozen amendments, \nmany of them very consequential. We have adopted eight of them. I \nbelieve the Senate has had the opportunity to work its will. There \ncomes a time when the debate has run its course and we are called upon \nto bring that debate to a close and move on to final passage and other \nissues. I remind my colleagues that even after cloture we will have 30 \nhours of debate.\n  Senator Baucus just noted to me that there are a number of amendments \nstill pending that will be debated and voted upon prior to the time we \ncome to final passage of the bill. But this is our opportunity to say \nas strongly and unequivocally as we can that, first, we recognize the \nextraordinary importance of U.S. participation in global markets, and \nwe are going to give this President--and any President--the tools with \nwhich to ensure that we have the framework in place to do so \neffectively.\n  Secondly, we recognize particularly the important partnership we have \ncreated with Latin America. We want to extend that partnership not only \nfor economic, but political and diplomatic reasons as well.\n  Finally, we recognize there are those who are ultimately going to be \nadversely affected. And while they may be in the distinct minority of \nall workers affected and the greater realm of good created in this \nlegislation, we cannot ignore them. We are going to provide them health \nbenefits, wage insurance, and the kind of safety net that they deserve \nwhen this kind of circumstance befalls them.\n  This is a good package. This warrants our support. I hope my \ncolleagues will join in a bipartisan effort to support cloture this \nmorning in an effort to move to the final phase of consideration of \nthis legislation prior to the vote on final passage. I urge my \ncolleagues to support cloture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, all Senators should recognize the very \nhard work the majority leader has put into this legislation, \nparticularly, in my judgment, the underlying strongest piece, and that \nis trade adjustment assistance. The majority leader, along with the \noccupant of the chair, Senator Bayh, both pushed very effectively to \naddress a large gap, frankly, in American trade policy, and that is the \ninadequate attention given to those who lose their jobs as a \nconsequence of trade. They built up the trade adjustment assistance.\n  All American employees who may in the future lose or who have lost a \njob as a consequence of trade should recognize the efforts of the \nSenate majority leader, Mr. Daschle, as well as the present occupant of \nthe chair, Senator Bayh of Indiana, who were the primary movers in \ndrafting the cornerstone part of this bill. We all owe them a great \ndebt of gratitude.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will tell my friends and colleagues, \nboth the majority leader and chairman of the Finance Committee, that I \njoin them in urging our colleagues to vote in favor of cloture so we \ncan move this bill on, so we can finish it. We have been on it now for \nalmost a month. We have considered a lot of amendments.\n  That having been said, I do not agree with the process. The Senator \nfrom Montana knows that well. There are three bills that have been \njammed into one. It is a very complicated bill. Two of the bills were \nreported out of the Finance Committee. We marked up those bills. They \nwere included with trade adjustment assistance which was rewritten on \nthe floor. It did not come out of the Finance Committee. So I objected \nto that, and I objected to some of the amendments that colleagues tried \nto add. We fought those battles. We have had some good debate. We have \nwon some; we have lost some.\n  Now is the time to have a cloture vote so we can bring this bill \ncloser to passage and end the debate on trade promotion authority, \nwhich I happen to think is the most important provision in the bill.\n  I also believe the Andean Trade Preference Act needs to pass. Its \nauthorization expired months ago, and tariffs were supposed to be \nimposed last week on four Andean countries that really need our help, \ntariffs as high as 15, 25, 30 percent on countries that have not had to \npay those tariffs for the last 10 years. We need to assist those \ncountries. It is not fair to Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, and Ecuador. They \nare our friends and allies. They have negotiated in good faith with the \nU.S. Government for a reduction in tariffs.\n  We have abided by that agreement for the last 11 years, and we said \nwe were going to extend it. We have not done so. It is up to the \nSenate. That is our constitutional responsibility. We need to get that \ndone.\n\n  I do not think the Andean Trade Preference Act should be in that \npackage. I lost that debate. Senator Daschle and Senator Baucus decided \nto put it together. The only way we can help those countries is to pass \nthis bill. If we do not get cloture, I am afraid the list of amendments \nwill continue and never cease.\n  The only way I see getting to closure is to vote for cloture. I urge \nour colleagues, Democrats and Republicans: Let's vote for cloture; \nlet's address those amendments that are still remaining that are \ngermane postcloture. There will probably be a few. There is no reason \nwe cannot finish this bill either later tonight or tomorrow sometime \nand get it to conference.\n  It is going to have a difficult conference because there are big \ndifferences. Frankly, the majority insisted on including trade \nadjustment authority and insisted on adding brandnew entitlements we \nhave never had before in trade adjustment authority, including items \nsuch as wage insurance, which is almost anathema to the free enterprise \nsystem, but that is in this bill. We have to negotiate that with our \nHouse colleagues.\n  We have to negotiate a whole new tax credit to provide health care \nbenefits that has never been a part of trade adjustment assistance. I \nam sure that is going to be debated extensively.\n  Anyway, it is going to be a very difficult conference. We need to \nbegin that conference as soon as possible and hopefully come up with a \nbill that actually will promote trade, increase jobs, make us \ncompetitive, and help us to comply with international agreements.\n\n[[Page S4667]]\n\n  I urge our colleagues to support this cloture motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. I believe we have \nabout 6 or 7 minutes remaining. Five minutes. I yield myself some time \nunder my leader time. That will still leave the final 5 minutes for the \nchairman and ranking member to speak.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture. We have been on this \nlegislation for quite some time. I believe this is the fourth week we \nhave been working on it, at least part of the time. We have had a \nnumber of amendments. We have won some, we have lost some, depending on \nyour point of view. It has been a good debate. Senators have had a \nchance to offer amendments. It is time we bring it to a conclusion.\n  We need trade promotion authority for this President. We needed it \nfor our previous President. I was for it when President Clinton was \nPresident. I think it is irresponsible for us not to have this \nauthority to allow our Presidents, our administrations, to negotiate \ntrade agreements that will help America and help our trading partners.\n  I do not want to get into a philosophical argument, but clearly it is \nthe way America needs to go. We need to open markets, not be closing \nmarkets or closing our own markets. We can compete in the world trade \nmarket. We can produce more goods and more commodities. Our farmers \nneed these markets, and this is the way to do it.\n  The second part of this legislation is the Andean Trade Preference \nAct. These countries in the northern tier and western side of South \nAmerica are trying very hard to move toward economic growth, democracy, \nand freedom. They are doing a great job under very difficult \ncircumstances--Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, and of course Colombia.\n\n  It is very unfair that we have not already acted on this legislation. \nWe are in an extension of time right now. Clearly, we need to pass this \nlegislation. We need to separate the Andean Trade Preference Act and \nmove it on in an expeditious way.\n  Last but not least is trade adjustment assistance. Different people \nwill argue it is too much, it is not enough, but we have had trade \nadjustment assistance in the past. We do need to give some assistance \nto our workers, a bridge to the next job, maybe some training. There \nare health benefits. You can argue whether this is the best way to do \nit.\n  The bottom line is, we have done it. We have significant legislation \nin this area. When you put all of them together, it is time we bring it \nto a conclusion. If we vote for cloture now, we can finish this bill \nnot later than tomorrow, and it would be a very high note for the \nSenate to finish up work before we go to the Memorial Day recess.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: We have done a good \nenough job. We should move to invoke cloture, stop the extraneous \namendments, and then move to a conclusion.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Three?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three and a half.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, with today's vote on cloture on the \ntrade bill, we move one step closer to reestablishing the United States \nglobal leadership and credibility in trade.\n  We move one step closer to being better able to advance this \ncountry's economic interests in this hemisphere. And we will be one \nstep closer to bringing greater economic prosperity to every American \nfamily. That is because with today's vote, the President will be one \nstep closer to getting one of the most important tools he needs to \nstrengthen the American economy, and to create new American jobs.\n  American leadership in trade has floundered for the last several \nyears. We have seen over 130 preferential trade agreements signed by \nour trading partners in the last few years, none of which included the \nUnited States. This proliferation of preferential trade agreements \namong other nations--including major U.S. trading partners such as \nCanada and Mexico--is harmful to U.S. trade interests. These agreements \nprovide their members with preferential access to one another's \nmarkets--while disadvantaging American agricultural products, \nmanufactured goods, and many services.\n  Some American companies overcome these barriers by producing \noverseas. Many small- and medium-sized companies can't do this however, \nand because they are less competitive, they lose opportunity after \nopportunity to their foreign counterparts. This loss of competitive \nability by our export-dependent firms, as well as our farmers, means \nfewer jobs.\n  It means lost wages or income. It means that hard-working American \nfamilies aren't able to pay the mortgage, or the farm loan, or provide \nbetter education or other opportunities for their children.\n  Today, as we speak, the United States is engaged in new global trade \nnegotiations in the WTO. We played a central role in launching these \nnegotiations. Last year, we helped draft a Ministerial Declaration--a \nroadmap for the new round of trade talks--that contained nearly every \none of our priority negotiating objectives, particularly in \nagriculture. As a result, we are poised to win unprecedented new market \naccess for American agricultural products around the world.\n  In my State of Iowa, we know how important trade is to the family \nfarmer. We export more than $1 billion worth of everything we grow or \nproduce on the farm, accounting for more than one-third of total Iowa \nexports to the world. Our farmers, our pork producers, our soybean \ngrowers all depend on the income they earn from exporting to take care \nof their families and their communities. And the plain fact is, they \nwould have more export-related income if world agricultural tariffs \nwere lower, and other trade barriers were reduced.\n  Restored United States leadership in free trade will benefit other as \nwell. An aggressive, American-led effort to open world markets will \nmean more jobs for our highly competitive manufacturing sector. At the \nJohn Deere plant in Waterloo, IA, for example, one out of every five \ntractors built in the plant is exported, accounting for over 800 \nexport-related jobs. If we gain access to more overseas markets through \nlower tariffs, we could sell a lot more of these tractors and create \nmore jobs. Our service sector, which provides nearly 8 out of every 10 \njobs in the United States, is even more reliant on open world markets.\n  Because we are so competitive internationally, we have an $83 billion \ntrade surplus in services. Liberalization of trade in services is only \n5 years old. The potential to build even more American export growth in \nservices is tremendous. TPA will help us realize this potential. With \ntoday's historic vote, America's days on the sidelines are numbered. \nAmerica is almost back in the game.\n  I want to commend Senator Baucus and his staff for all they have done \nin moving this bill forward, and for working on a bipartisan basis to \nhelp restore America's leadership in world trade.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on \ncloture.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe White House.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                         Washington, May 22, 2002.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley: On behalf of the \n     Administration, I wanted to thank you for all of your efforts \n     to produce a bipartisan trade package. Those efforts appear \n     to be nearing a successful conclusion with this morning's \n     cloture vote.\n       It is our hope that a substantial majority of the Senate \n     will vote to close off what has been a full and fair debate \n     and then proceed to final passage of the bill. In that vein, \n     I wanted you to know that the Administration\n\n[[Page S4668]]\n\n     is opposing all further amendments to the bill. We hope that \n     you will join us in order to ensure prompt passage of the \n     bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Nicholas E. Calio,\n\n                                    Assistant to the President for\n                                              Legislative Affairs.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 37 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. Under the previous \norder, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Baucus-\n     Grassley substitute amendment for Calendar No. 295, H.R. \n     3009, the Andean Trade Preference Act.\n         Max Baucus, Chuck Grassley, Orrin Hatch, Zell Miller, \n           Blanche L.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on \namendment 3401 to H.R. 3009, an act to extend the Andean Trade \nPreference Act to grant additional trade benefits under that act, and \nfor other purposes, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are \nrequired under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

On this vote, the yeas are 68, the nays are \n29. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, Senator Nelson from Florida is ready to \ngo with his amendment. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for \nSenator Nelson to call up his amendment No. 3440.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is now pending. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Thank you, Madam President.\n  May I inquire of the chairman of the Finance Committee, it is my \nunderstanding that the number of the amendment that you just asked me \nto call up--I want to make sure that is applicable postcloture, because \nI have amendment No. 3454 that I understand is in order. It is the same \nsubject matter, but there was some technical scrivener's reason of why \nthere had to be two amendments instead of one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order. The Senator \nfrom Florida has the floor on pending business before the Senate. \nPlease take your conversations off the floor to the cloakroom.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. To answer my good friend from Florida, it is my \nunderstanding that either of the two could properly be called up at \nthis time.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, I want to have a further \nunderstanding of where we are parliamentary-wise. The Senator from \nFlorida is asking to take up a different amendment than the amendment \nthat dealt with citrus?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. No. The amendment is the same. It is my \nunderstanding that for a technical reason, postcloture, it was to be \ndivided into two amendments instead of one. It is the same amendment. I \nam just asking, before we start debating the amendment, to make sure we \nhave the proper one called up.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, further answering the basic question of \nthe Senator from Florida, the amendment we have on the list that is \nready to be brought up is No. 3440. That was my understanding; that is \nthe amendment to be brought up.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. That is fine with me. I wanted to make sure we \nwere in the proper legal structure because I had filed two other \namendments that were the same subject matter that would be correctly \ndrawn to the bill. As long as the chairman indicates that the one we \nhad filed originally is OK, that is fine with me. The subject matter is \nidentical.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I have to temporarily object until we \nhave an opportunity to study the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the order was already entered and no \nobjection was heard. Amendment 3440 is the amendment that is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I raise a point of order against the \npending amendment. It has a drafting error and it amends the bill in \ntwo places and is therefore out of order. I raise a point of order.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The present amendment does not amend the bill \nin two places. The one that has been called up by the chairman of the \nFinance Committee is the original one. The junior Senator from Florida \nis purely trying to get the issue out so that we can discuss it. I was \ntold that postcloture it had to be drafted in a separate way. It is an \nidentical amendment.\n  I will proceed with the amendment on the reliance of the statement by \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken. The \namendment as drafted to amend the bill in two places is out of order on \nits face.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida does have the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I will continue to speak on \nthe amendment, and for whatever reason you all are objecting, I wish \nyou would find out what technical reasons you have for an objection. I \nassure everyone, this is the identical matter.\n\n[[Page S4669]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I think we can clear this up. I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I do not want to relinquish \nthe floor. I yield to the Senator from Nevada without losing my right \nto the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we go into a \nquorum call with the Senator from Florida recognized when we come out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3454 To Amendment No. 3401\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, pursuant to the discussions \nwe have had, I call up amendment No. 3454 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson], for himself and Mr. \n     Graham, proposes an amendment numbered 3454.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To limit tariff reduction authority on certain products)\n\n       At the end of section 2103(b), insert the following new \n     paragraph:\n       (4) Products subject to antidumping and countervailing duty \n     orders.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a product that is \n     the subject of an antidumping or countervailing duty order at \n     the time of the agreement referred to in paragraph (1), \n     unless the agreement provides that as a term, condition, or \n     qualification of the tariff concession, the tariff reduction \n     will not be implemented before the date that is 1 year after \n     the date of termination or revocation of such antidumping or \n     countervailing duty order with respect to all exporters of \n     such product.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I rise today to address the \nSenate on trade promotion authority and the opportunity this country \nhas before it to participate in free trade.\n  I am a free trader. I believe it is a net benefit for both my State \nand the country to reduce tariff barriers and open markets to other \nnations.\n  We must do this in a manner that respects fair trading practices by \nimportant industries in the United States that are the engine of our \neconomy. Need I remind everyone that in the war against terrorism, it \nis not only that we have to be politically and militarily strong, but \nwe have to be economically strong as well?\n  There is some debate over our last free trade agreement with Mexico \nand Canada. I was a supporter of NAFTA and believed it was an important \npart of the economic growth the United States experienced in the decade \nof the 1990s. But NAFTA arranged for side agreements relating to \ncertain industries our trading partners did not live up to. One of \nthose clearly affected Florida. It was a side agreement that was going \nto be protective of winter vegetables, specifically tomatoes. That side \nagreement was not lived up to with regard to the importation of Mexican \ntomatoes, with the result that whereas Florida used to have a huge \npercentage of the national market of winter vegetables, we now supply \nonly 30 percent. You can imagine what that has done to some of the \nfruit and vegetable farmers in Florida.\n  As we open our markets to all of the countries of the Western \nHemisphere, we must consider how we can learn from and prevent these \nkinds of situations we have had in the past with things such as NAFTA \nand how we can prevent that from occurring in the future. That is why \nSenator Graham and I have introduced this amendment to the TPA \nlegislation that cuts right to the heart of free and fair trade.\n  This amendment says tariffs may not be reduced on commodities on \nwhich there is an existing antidumping order or an existing \ncountervailing duty order. What does that mean? Well, I am going to \nexplain it, if I may. When the executive branch, the Congress, or \nparticular industries believe a certain nation is engaging in some kind \nof unfair trade practice on a particular commodity, then they go out \nand petition the International Trade Commission to investigate the \ntrade of that particular commodity. That is what has happened with the \nrecent steel case. If a thorough investigation by the International \nTrade Commission finds that an important product is being sold below \nfair market value and that a U.S. producer is thereby being harmed, it \nis considered dumping, an anticompetitive practice. Dumping is, in \nessence, price discrimination against U.S. consumers.\n\n  Now, there is another kind of order. This is an order that if a \nforeign government is subsidizing a particular commodity--a foreign \ngovernment subsidizing a particular commodity--then that order would \nprovide that those foreign manufacturers, or exporters--because they \nhave that unfair competition because their government is subsidizing \ntheir particular commodity, and they are going to have an unfair \ncompetitive advantage; therefore, the Department of Commerce would \nissue a countervailing duty order.\n  So it follows that if a country or company is found by the \nInternational Trade Commission, or the Department of Commerce, to be \nactually engaging in unfair trade practices in such a clear-cut manner \nthat it is issued either an antidumping or countervailing duty order, \nthen under this amendment, while those orders are in place, those \ntariffs would not be reduced on those commodities until that dumping, \nor subsidizing, had ceased and the order had been removed. That is just \nas common sense as you can make it.\n  If you have anticompetitive behavior by a foreign government or \nforeign countries and there is an order out there put in place by the \nDepartment of Commerce or the International Trade Commission, as long \nas those orders are in place, you are not going to let the tariff be \nreduced that protects the U.S. consumer because it simply doesn't make \nsense to reward countries by further opening U.S. markets to \ncommodities that are currently being dumped in the country by our \ntrading partners until the dumping has ceased.\n  Now, some may argue that this amendment is not compliant with the \nWorld Trade Organization, the organization that administers trade \nagreements among nations, the organization that acts as a forum for \ntrade organizations, the organization that settles trade disputes, and \nthe organization that reviews trade policy. Well, some may argue that \nthis amendment doesn't comply with that. I disagree.\n  First of all, the World Trade Organization's compliance should be \njudged based on the substance of trade agreements. This legislation is \nnot the substance of trade agreements; rather, this legislation states \nthe terms by which Congress will consider providing fast-track \nauthority to such trade agreements. World Trade Organization compliance \nwill be assessed later when a trade agreement is completed. So that \nargument doesn't wash as a counter to Bob Graham's and my amendment.\n  Second, they might argue that this amendment provides a double \npenalty upon countries that practice anticompetitive behavior. Well, \nthat argument is not accurate either. It is widely understood that \nantidumping orders are not viewed by the WTO as punitive. Instead, they \nare viewed as remedial.\n  Finally, some would argue against this amendment and act as if tariff \nreductions are a divine right. Tariff reductions are not a divine \nright. Tariff reductions should be viewed and approved on their face \nafter consideration of all the facts. They should be viewed as mutually \nbeneficial in a bilateral or multilateral scenario. Withholding a \nbenefit should not be considered assessment of a penalty.\n\n  I might also add that this amendment of Senator Graham's and mine \ndoes not violate the core basis of the Uruguay Round of tariff \nnegotiations, and ultimately that Uruguay Round created the World Trade \nOrganization. WTO compliance is not an issue in this debate. Instead, \nit is being used as a red herring to try to defeat this amendment.\n\n[[Page S4670]]\n\n  For all of these reasons, I submit that this legislation doesn't \nviolate the norms of the WTO and, actually, should strengthen the \nadministration's hand at the negotiating table. Let me say that again \nto my friends in the administration, who have fought Senator Graham and \nme tooth and toenail on what is free and fair trade. This amendment \nwill actually strengthen your hand at the negotiating table by being \nanother instrument to help you make sure there is free and fair trade, \nas we want to open up free and fair trade.\n  While the $9 billion Florida citrus industry is a concern to this \nSenator and my senior Senator from Florida, this amendment clearly \naffects many other commodities, including honey, steel, preserved \nmushrooms, Atlantic salmon, and sugar, and a whole number of other \nitems I am going to list. We must not reward countries that engage in \nanticompetitive, predatory trading practices.\n  Madam President, my concern that we not undermine our antidumping \nprocedures does not make me any less of a proponent of trade promotion \nauthority in the best interests of my State and the country. Florida is \nan exporting State, and exports mean good jobs. According to the \nDepartment of Commerce, 11 greater Florida metropolitan areas posted \nexports of more than $120 million in 1999: Miami; the Tampa Bay area; \nFort Lauderdale; Orlando; the West Palm-Boca area; Jacksonville; \nMelbourne, my hometown in the Brevard County area; Lakeland; Sarasota; \nPanama City; and Daytona Beach. Florida exported goods worth $24 \nbillion in that year to more than 200 foreign markets.\n  These goods include computers, electronic products, machinery \ntransportation equipment, chemical manufacturing, electrical equipment, \nappliances, and agricultural products. Trade promotion authority has \nthe potential to open markets to Florida's entrepreneurs and small \nbusinesses and farmers.\n  I have been contacted by many Floridians asking me to support TPA, \nand I have by voting for cloture so we can move on with this bill. I \nhelped out the Senator from Texas yesterday when there was an amendment \nthat was threatening the stability of the bill. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport TPA, and I also ask our colleagues to support this amendment of \nSenator Graham and me that improves the underlying legislation and \nwould ensure we have free and fair trade.\n  I will tell my colleagues how important this is--other than to \nSenator Graham and me for frozen orange juice concentrate, of which \nBrazil has 50 percent of the world market. If that tariff protecting \nthe Florida citrus industry, the California citrus industry, and the \nArizona citrus industry from unfair competition by dumping a product is \ntaken away, Brazil, with 50 percent of the market, will take over 100 \npercent of the market, and that is not free and fair trade.\n  I do not know why the Senator from Texas and others--we talk about \nthe purity of the legislation. I helped him yesterday. I cannot \nunderstand. We are talking about free and fair trade. We are not \ntalking about monopoly trade which will occur to the detriment of \nCalifornia, Arizona, and Florida unless this amendment is adopted. \nThere are plenty of other States, I say to Senators, that better be \nforewarned and forearmed that if they do not protect this legislation \nwith this amendment, then those orders protecting the commodities from \ntheir States are not going to be protected in the future.\n  Let's talk about some of them. How about Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, \nNew York, Maryland, and Illinois with regard to steel products--steel \nproducts including barbed wire, welded carbon steel pipe, line and \npressure pipe, oil country tubular goods, hot-rolled carbon steel flat \nproducts--all of those products that are manufactured in Senator \nLugar's State of Indiana.\n  The two Senators from the State of Ohio, Senators DeWine and \nVoinovich, and the two Senators from Pennsylvania: Are you paying \nattention?\n  The Senators from New York: Are you paying attention?\n  Maryland, Illinois: You are going to lose the protection of your \nsteel products and the orders that are out there protecting them unless \nyou vote for this amendment.\n  Let's take honey. The Senators from Montana, North Dakota, South \nDakota, and California--California has a big honey industry: You are \ngoing to lose your protection of those existing orders if this \namendment is not adopted.\n  How about sugar? Sugar is going to be threatened by Belgium, France, \nand Germany, and I am talking about Louisiana, Hawaii, Texas, \nCalifornia, Idaho, Michigan, and Minnesota.\n  I inquire, Madam President, it is my understanding the side proposing \nthe amendment has 1 hour; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Chair.\n  I want to make sure those interests that are protecting sugar from \nthe European Union, Germany, France, and Belgium, which include \nLouisiana, Hawaii, Texas, California, Idaho, Michigan, Minnesota, New \nMexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming, Nebraska, and \nMontana--do you realize that your commodities are threatened if you \ncannot protect them with your existing orders?\n\n  Let's talk about some of the steel products that would be threatened \nby Brazil. Carbon steel butt welded pipe fittings, iron construction \ncastings, brass sheet and strip--and I could go through a whole list of \nsteel products. Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, \nIllinois, Wisconsin: Senators, are you listening?\n  How about fresh Atlantic salmon from the States of Maine and Alaska? \nSenators from Maine, Senator Collins, and Senator Snowe: Are you \nlistening? Your orders protecting the dumping of products out of Chile \nare not going to protect your salmon.\n  Senator Murkowski: Are you listening? You are not going to be \nprotected from Chile's dumping of Salmon unless you protect those \norders that are outstanding.\n  How about Oregon's mushrooms being protected from Chile? If they do \nnot keep those orders and they allow those orders to be cast aside and \nthe tariff to be reduced, it is not going to protect them.\n  How about Alabama, Georgia, Texas, and Kansas on the cement industry \nbeing protected from Mexico? Senators from Alabama, Senator Shelby and \nSenator Sessions: You are not going to be protected on your orders that \nprotect your cement industry unless you protect those orders from being \nundermined by the adoption of this amendment.\n  What about the State of New York? Antifriction ball bearings being \nprotected from Singapore. There is an order there.\n  How about Montana, the Dakotas, and California, as I mentioned \nearlier on honey? The last time I mentioned honey, it was Argentina. \nYour products are not going to be protected.\n  Also in Argentina, they produce hot-rolled carbon steel flat \nproducts, and Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, \nIllinois, Senator Fitzgerald, they are not going to be protected, those \nsame States being protected from Brazil on a countervailing duty.\n\n  Earlier, I talked about the antidumping orders, honey from Argentina, \nhot-rolled carbon steel flat products from Argentina; steel products \nfrom Brazil has another kind of order against it, according to the \nDepartment of Commerce, because they have evaluated the situation and \ndetermined those two countries have unfairly subsidized those products \nI just listed--honey, affecting Montana, the Dakotas and California; \nArgentina, affecting hot-rolled carbon steel flat products affecting \nIndiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland, and Illinois; and \nBrazil, affecting a multiplicity of steel products; that the \ngovernments were, in fact, subsidizing those products; that the \nDepartment of Commerce of the United States would have an order to \nprotect those products.\n  Folks, this is a foreign country subsidizing against the products \ncoming from your States, the U.S. Department of Commerce issues an \norder, and that order is going to be in jeopardy of being ignored \nunless you adopt our amendment. It is a commonsense amendment. It is an \namendment that simply states that as long as there is an order from \neither the International Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of \nCommerce protecting a commodity because it is being unfairly dealt with \nin anticompetitive behavior\n\n[[Page S4671]]\n\nin international trade, that as long as that order exists, this \namendment says you cannot reduce the tariff.\n  Madam President, to retain the floor, since we have had some \nsquabble, I yield to my colleague, and upon the finishing of his \nremarks, I seek to retain the floor. I yield to my colleague from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator seeking consent to that effect?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Senator cannot control the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Then, Madam President, it is interesting we \nare talking about free and fair trade. What we ought to have is free \nand fair debate. Earlier, because of some technical reason, people from \nthat side of the aisle were trying to prevent me from offering my \namendment that I have been waiting in the queue very patiently for \nweeks to offer. I have become a constant visitor with the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee and with the ranking member, seeking to protect \nan industry from Florida facing life or death, an industry that is so \nimportant to the State of Florida that the license tag of the State of \nFlorida has emblazoned upon it the emblem of that industry, the Florida \norange.\n  I thought about free and fair trade we could have a free and fair \ndebate. So, Madam President, I have said my piece. I will relinquish \nthe floor. I hope others will accord me the privilege within the span \nof the hour, that should additional things arise, they will give me the \ncourtesy of being able to speak. I thank the Senate for indulging us \nand giving us an opportunity in which to air an issue that is most \nimportant to all of these States and most important to the United \nStates of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, let me first respond by saying each \nSenator has a right to the floor. No one can prevent a Senator from \nhaving an opportunity to be recognized. Second, the Senator is offering \nthis amendment now because of the willingness of the chairman and the \nranking member and every Member of this body to allow him to jump ahead \nin line of literally dozens of amendments that were filed earlier and \nthat could have been offered before his amendment.\n  If we had followed the rules of the Senate, instead of granting the \nSenator special privilege, we would have had a fairly substantial \nnumber of amendments that we would have had to deal with before he \ncould have ever presented his amendment. I don't know if there is any \nperception of a grievance here. A, I am sorry; and, B, I don't think \nthere is a basis for it.\n  Now, let me address the substance of this amendment. It always amazes \nme when people are free traders and all they can talk about is your \ncommodities are threatened and you are losing protection. This \namendment is a protectionist amendment. This amendment is an effort to \ntake all those products the Senator mentioned off the table in terms of \nfuture negotiations, even if the negotiations have to do with \neliminating unfair trade practices.\n  It is also based on a false premise. Every Member of the Senate \nshould understand this false premise. The false premise is that if \nthere currently is a countervailing duty or an antidumping order on a \nproduct from Texas--let me take honey; I don't know that there is such \nan order, and I am not seeking such an order, but for every honey \nproducer I have, I probably have 500,000 honey consumers. So it always \nis amazing to me that everyone is willing to let consumers pay a higher \nprice by preventing competition, but let me just take my example--say \nthere was a countervailing duty on honey, that we concluded that honey \nwas being sold too cheaply to schoolchildren. It is an excellent source \nof nourishment, an excellent product people like to eat. But it is \nbeing sold too cheaply. We don't want them to have it that cheaply. So \nwe have a countervailing duty on it.\n  Listening to the Senator from Florida, one would assume that if there \nis a trade negotiation put into place and is consummated, and in that \nprocess we change the duty on honey, that it overrides the antidumping \nagreement. That is totally and verifiably false. Let me say that again. \nIf there is a countervailing duty on honey, if there is an antidumping \norder on honey, and under this bill the President negotiates a trade \nagreement, say, with Chile, that affects honey--it does not override \nthe countervailing duty, does not override the antidumping order--those \norders would still stand until they are removed.\n  In listening to the Senator from Florida, you get the idea that the \nPresident can negotiate away these antidumping orders. Not so. They \nstill stand until they are removed.\n  If you look at the language of the Senator's bill, it is clear his \nconcern is not with countervailing duties and dumping, even if they are \nremoved. Even if the cause of their imposition is eliminated, you \ncannot negotiate a trade agreement involving those items for 1 year \nafter the problem is fixed. In the end, this amendment takes off the \ntable in trade negotiations literally hundreds of items.\n  Let me argue why that should not be done. We are trying to promote \ntrade. We are trying to see a benefit from trade through competition.\n  Second, how can the President negotiate with countries if we are \ntaking all the things they produce--the things they are most sensitive \nabout, the things they are most concerned about, and the things they \nhave a comparative advantage in--off the table? If this amendment were \nadopted, it would be a body blow to our whole effort to negotiate free \ntrade agreements with countries such as Chile, countries that are major \nagricultural producers.\n  I remind my colleagues what the Senator's amendment does is deny the \nability to negotiate a trade agreement containing these items, even \nthough the fact they are contained in the agreement does not override a \ncountervailing duty, if the agreement is ratified by the Senate, does \nnot override a dumping order. We simply have this being used as a ruse \nto take numerous items off the table.\n\n  We are down to the point now where we have debated, for many weeks, \nthe effort to give the President fast-track authority. The \nadministration is adamantly opposed to this amendment because they \nbelieve it guts the very foundation of trade promotion authority and it \ndoes it in two ways. It takes off the table numerous items that are \nimportant to other countries, in terms of their negotiation and, quite \nfrankly, important to us.\n  Part of a trade negotiation can be aimed at unfair trade practices \nwhere, if a country is subsidizing steel or some other product, part of \nthe trade negotiation can be to require, as part of what they are \ngiving in return for our opening markets here, they are opening their \nmarkets there--part of what they can give up is these subsidies. But \nthe amendment of the Senator would say: No, those negotiations cannot \noccur within the context of trade promotion authority, even if the \nnegotiations occurred, unless the antidumping order were vacated. \nUnless the countervailing duty were overturned because the causes of it \nwere changed, nothing in this new free trade agreement would have any \nimpact.\n  If Chile is dumping honey--and, God forbid, because schoolchildren \nwould be getting honey too cheaply and they would be harmed, I guess--\nbut if Chile is dumping honey, under this amendment you could negotiate \na trade agreement that involved honey, even though no trade agreement \nwe could negotiate would overturn the countervailing duty. It would \nstill be in place. Only if it is removed in the future because the \nunderlying cause is removed, then the trade agreement would go into \neffect.\n  The Senator talks about life and death of his State. We already have \nin the bill a limitation on the ability of the President to negotiate \nin the area of frozen concentrated orange juice, one of America's great \nfoods. Every child in America should drink orange juice every morning. \nYet we have prohibited the President from having full power to \nnegotiate with regard to frozen orange juice. Why? Basically because \nthis industry wants protection. We have chosen between orange juice \nproducers--and I have some in my State--and all the children in America\n\n[[Page S4672]]\n\nwho ought to be drinking orange juice in the morning.\n  Talk about unfair trade practice, that is one of them. The point is, \nit is not as if we have not already given special protections to the \nvery industries the Senator is talking about. What he is doing is \ntrying to take off the table a massive range of items that, in reality, \nwould say that you could vote for trade promotion authority knowing no \ntrade is going to be promoted. This amendment would destroy the \nfoundations of trade promotion authority and it should, and I believe \nwill, be beaten.\n  But I finally want to address one point that I have just been dying \nto address throughout all these debates. Some people act as if you can \nhave trade without having trade; that when you enter into a free trade \nagreement it is fine to have trade as long as your trading partner \ndoesn't sell anything in your country.\n  I have been on the Finance Committee for some time now. The Senator \nfrom Florida mentioned tomatoes. When we entered into a free trade \nagreement with Mexico, they started selling a lot more tomatoes. I am a \nbig tomato buyer. I speak with some authority on the subject. Why is \nMexico selling all of these tomatoes? For two reasons. No. 1, they are \nbetter; they taste better. If you have not compared a Mexican tree-\nripened tomato with a domestically produced tomato then you are making \na bad mistake. I ask anybody in America to submit to the taste test. \nThe Mexicans have sold more tomatoes for one simple reason--well, two, \nreally, but one is dominant: It is a better product. It is a superior \nproduct. You can taste it and you can taste the difference.\n\n  The reason they can do it is they handpick these tomatoes and they \nput them in these cartons like egg cartons. They are ripened when they \nare picked, they ship them to market, and people buy them.\n  It is true that the people who were producing tomatoes before we \nentered into the agreement are not selling as many tomatoes, but what \nis trade about? If trade is not about letting superior products \ndisplace products that are not as good, what is the purpose of it?\n  The second reason they sell more tomatoes is they are cheaper. So how \nin the world can we claim we are for free trade, we want more trade, \nbut then we protest, we are self-righteous, we are outraged, when our \ncompetitor, producing a better product at a lower price, is successful?\n  People are for free trade but they are not for trade. They are for \nopening markets as long as nobody sells anything in the United States. \nIt is amazing to me, the convoluted way we see trade. If we could just \nsend everything we own abroad, people would be happy. Exporting they \nlove--just give it away, let it go--but if we bring anything to \nAmerica, somehow, something is wrong with it.\n  I close with this point. It is interesting how differently we view \nthe world today on this issue than it has been viewed historically. I \ngo way back by quoting Pericles. When Pericles spoke in the funeral \noration, and he was trying to sum up the greatness of Athens, it is \ninteresting that the example he came down to was imports.\n\n       The luxuries of the world are as freely available in Athens \n     as they are at those places in the world where those items \n     are produced.\n\n  The greatness of America is that people we do not even know, who do \nnot even know us, are working to produce things to bring to our market \nthat we can consume. You have products coming on trains and boats, this \nwhole effort, all aimed at bringing to our feet the benefits of trade. \nBecause we are the one nation in the world that understands how we \nbenefit.\n  Look, I am sympathetic. I have lots of people in my State who have \nlost from trade, who could not compete. But has the Nation lost? If I \nhad tomato producers in the valley who lost their markets to Mexican \ntomatoes, they have lost. But has America lost if we have better \ntomatoes at a cheaper price? And what will Mexico do with that money? \nEvery dollar they get, they are going to spend on American products.\n  We know from trade data that the wages in those industries where they \nare going to buy products are 16 percent above the norm.\n  I submit with all respect that when we focus on trying to protect \npeople from losing from successful trade, rather than focusing on \ntrying to develop more winners, we miss the genius of the product.\n  Finally, provisions in this bill--which I do not support but are in \nthe bill and I voted for cloture and I am going to vote for the bill--\nsay that if you are a tomato producer and you lose your job, you get 2 \nyears of unemployment benefits, you get 70 percent of your health care \ncost, you get a wage guarantee. Whereas, if other people lose their \njobs because a terrorist blew up a plant they worked at, they get 26 \nweeks of unemployment and nothing else. So it is not as if we are not \ntrying to cushion people who happen to lose from successful trade.\n  I submit that this amendment is protectionist and that it aims at \nprotecting industries from competition. It is based on the false \npremise where it tries to get people to believe that by letting the \nPresident negotiate in areas where we have antidumping and \ncountervailing tariffs, somehow those negotiations overturn those \ntariffs and those countervailing duties. They do not. Those stay in \neffect until they are removed, even if there is a free trade agreement.\n  I have not proposed--and I don't know anyone who has proposed--that \nthey be removed because of the free trade agreement. The source of \nunfair trade has to be eliminated for those countervailing duties and \nfor the antidumping measures to be repealed.\n  But to simply say, even though they will not be changed by free trade \nagreements, that you can't even negotiate a free trade agreement that \nwould involve products that are currently subject to these penalties, \neven if the negotiations are aimed at eliminating the subsidies, and \nthen saying even if you eliminate the penalties, even if you find they \nhave stopped dumping for a year after there is no problem, you still \ncan't negotiate an agreement--it seems to me that the sole purpose of \nsuch an amendment is to prevent the President from negotiating \nagreements.\n  The problem with it is that we want to negotiate because we want \neverybody in the world to have an opportunity to fly on a great airline \nor to use the finest computers or to buy things we produce. But in \norder for people to be willing to let our products into their markets, \nwe have to let their products into our market. There is no such thing \nas a single-entry bookkeeping system where people say: Well, whatever \nis great for you we agree to, but then nothing that is great for us can \nbe considered.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  Let me tick off some of these States. If you were from Texas--and I \nam, and I thank God for it every day--and we have honey producers--and \nI thank God for them, too--and they were subject to protection under \nantidumping, and the President under this bill negotiated a free trade \nagreement with Chile--which I hope he will, and I am for it--it would \nhelp Chile, and it would help America; it would be good for the world.\n  Please understand that will not overturn countervailing duties \nagainst honey. It will not overturn antidumping measures against honey.\n  The same is true for steel from Pennsylvania. The same is true for \navocadoes from Arizona or from California. Nothing in our bill gives \nthe President the power to negotiate eliminating antidumping measures \nor countervailing duties. He can negotiate tariff reductions that go \ninto effect once those problems have been solved. But a treaty \nnegotiated under this bill does not override those measures. Since it \ndoesn't override those measures, why in the world would you want to ban \nthe President from negotiating in these areas?\n  It seems to me there are two reasons. One is you are confused--I \ndon't believe any Member of the Senate is confused--or you want to \nprotect these items from competition. It would be great if you had this \nview of the world and would not let people competing with us sell \nanything. We sell everything. That is a strange view of the world. But \nsome people have it. But nobody else will do that.\n  If you implement all of these restrictions, just understand, when the \nSenator from Florida went through that \n\n[[Page S4673]]\n\nlong list of things that could not be negotiated--it was a long list; I \nam sure he has more--and asking if Senators were listening--how would \nyou ever negotiate a trade agreement if you couldn't negotiate any of \nthose items? Those are all items we import. I can assure you that Chile \nor Europe or whoever is negotiating with us is very interested in those \nitems.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. We have shown by an \noverwhelming vote that we want to give the President trade promotion \nauthority. To go back now and enact a gutting amendment that would \ndestroy the whole trade authority for the bulk of items that America \nbuys on the world market would mean it is not useful. It would be like \ngiving the President a car without an engine or wheels. You could say \nyou gave him 90 percent of a car; it just doesn't have a starter. What \ngood is it? You can look at it, you can sit in it, but you can't do \nwith it what cars are supposed to do.\n  If we give the President this trade authority but we don't let him \nenter into any agreement in all these different areas, what have we \ngiven him? Something nobody will let us use in negotiating with them.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment and vote for the motion \nto table.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, it is my understanding that \nthe Senator from Iowa wants to speak. I would simply defer if he would \nlike to speak. But in light of the fact that he is not seeking \nrecognition, let me address some of the points the Senator from Texas, \nmy friend, has just raised.\n  The Senator from Texas said the President can negotiate. The fact is \nthat this amendment will help the President in his negotiations, for \naddressing the question of the existing orders in trade negotiations is \nultimately going to foster that negotiation. The question is not \nwhether the President and the administration can negotiate. Clearly, \nthe President is unimpeded in that ability to negotiate. The subject of \nthis amendment is whether or not, when there are orders existing, they \nhave to be taken into consideration in the negotiations with regard to \nthe reduction of a tariff.\n  Mr. Gramm, the Senator from Texas, asserts that clearly 100 items \nwith existing orders and protection from anticompetitive behavior would \nbe taken off the table. He is right.\n  The Senator and I agree on two things. First of all, we support the \noverall legislation as free traders. We certainly agree that there are \nlots of items. All of these items are covered by antidumping orders or \ncountervailing duty orders. This amendment forces the President to \naddress the anticompetitive behavior that led to the order being issued \nin the first place.\n  Who issues the order? If it is anticompetitive behavior through \ndumping of a product onto a market and trying to drive the U.S. \ncompetitor out of business, then it is the U.S. International Trade \nCommission. If it is the anticompetitive behavior of a foreign \ngovernment that is subsidizing the product to the disadvantage of the \nAmerican product, then the order is issued by the U.S. Department of \nCommerce.\n  So this amendment does not deny the ability to negotiate. It does \nassist the negotiations. I think in this arcane language of trade \npromotion, and so much of which we refer to by acronyms--TPA, and TAA, \nand whatever the acronym is for the Andean Trade Act, which I support--\nit is often lost over the bottom line of what is free and fair trade. \nWe, of course, want international trade. We want competition.\n  So as I see my colleague from Florida in the Chamber, who wants to \nspeak on this amendment, I will just again reiterate the points that I \nmade before in rebuttal to the Senator from Texas.\n  First of all, in relation to World Trade Organization compliance, \nwhenever anybody says this is going to mess up the process of the WTO, \nwell, the WTO compliance should be judged based on the substance of \ntrade agreements. With this particular amendment, the substance of the \ntrade agreement is not harmed, but, rather, this amendment states the \nterms by which the Congress will consider providing the fast-track \nauthority to such trade agreements. The World Trade Organization \ncompliance will be assessed later when a trade agreement is completed. \nIt does not impede the President's ability to negotiate at all.\n  Second, when the opponents of this amendment say this amendment \nprovides a double penalty upon countries that practice anticompetitive \nbehavior, that is not accurate. It is widely understood that \nantidumping orders are not viewed by the WTO as punitive, that they are \nviewed as remedial.\n  Third, let's understand that tariff reductions are not a divine \nright. Tariff reductions should be viewed as mutually beneficial as we \ngo about the process of bilateral and multilateral negotiations. \nWithholding of a benefit should not be considered assessment of a \npenalty. Rather, what we should try to strive for is the goal, at the \nend of the day, of free and fair trade, not the running of a particular \nbusiness or industry out of business just for the sake of doing that, \nwhen, in fact, there are existing orders to protect them against \nanticompetitive behavior.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and look forward to the comments \nof my distinguished senior Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I am very pleased to join this afternoon \nwith my colleague, Senator Nelson, in offering this amendment to the \ntrade legislation.\n  I am a strong supporter of expanded trade. I believe in the principle \nthat if the world trades with each other, it will not only give us \ngreater assurance that competition will be in commercial areas, not in \nmilitary areas, it also gives to the world the opportunity to get the \nbest quality and priced products that are available.\n  I believe in competition and that the United States will, in the \nfuture, as it has in the past, fare very well if that competition is \nfair. Free trade does not mean trade with rules of anarchy. Free trade \nis associated with fair trade, trade that is under a rule of law that \nsets certain standards of behavior for the participants, whether they \nbe nations or individual economic entities in that trade.\n  Madam President, as you will recall, we spent a considerable amount \nof time last week debating what is known as the Dayton-Craig amendment. \nThat amendment, offered by our distinguished colleagues from Minnesota \nand Idaho--one a Democrat, one a Republican--essentially said this: \nThat while we were granting, with the Trade Promotion Act, broad \nauthorities to the President to negotiate, and we were giving to the \nPresident our future right to amend those negotiated agreements by \naccepting the fact that whatever is negotiated we could either provide \na green light of ``yes'' or a red light of ``no,'' but we could not \noffer a yellow light of ``caution'' or ``modification,'' but that we \nwere going to exclude certain items. We voted, therefore, for the \nDayton-Craig amendment, which said that from that general policy of \nproviding the President broad negotiating authority, we were going to \nexclude certain items and require that they be brought back to the \nCongress for a vote on those items, specifically without the protection \nof fast track.\n  First, what was it that we protected? We said if our negotiators were \nto negotiate and alter the basic laws that this Nation has developed \nover the years, which give us greater assurance that trade will not \nonly be free but fair, those matters would require specific and \nindividual congressional approval.\n  The first provision was the antidumping provision. Antidumping is \nwhere a specific commercial entity is alleged to be trading in a \nproduct at a price which is below that company's cost of production in \nthe country in which it produced the product. So that whether it is an \nagricultural product or an industrial product, America is not going to \nbecome the ultimate target for predatory marketing practices, where an \nentity that has a product of which it cannot otherwise dispose dumps it \non the United States market at a price below what it cost them to \nproduce, therefore threatening the survival of American enterprises \nwhich have to sell their product at least at what it cost them to \nproduce or they will be out of business and their workers will be out \nof jobs. That does not seem to be an unreasonable provision.\n  The second provision that the Dayton-Craig amendment gave special\n\n[[Page S4674]]\n\ntreatment to was countervailing duties. What is that? Those are \ndirected at nations which have practices that subsidize a particular \nproduct, so that when it is sold, it is effectively sold at less than \nwhat should have been the cost of production. That is where a \ngovernment provides special benefits that distort the competitive \nmarketplace.\n  Those are the two areas that were protected from fast track by the \nDayton-Craig amendment. Those were adopted by the Senate by a \nsubstantial majority. We have done this because we recognize the \nimportance of protecting the international marketplace of commerce from \nthese trade practices which could be so distorting and which would \ndefeat one of the basic principles of free trade which is that you \nencourage competition on a level playing field and whoever can prevail \non that is the victor. This tilts the playing field toward one company \nor one country because of practices that distort that level playing \nfield.\n  The amendment that Senator Nelson and I are offering today is the \nimplementation of the objective of the Dayton-Craig amendment. Dayton-\nCraig intends to assure us that we will continue unless the Congress--\nand I think it is unlikely--would vote to eliminate our current laws \nagainst dumping and against providing government subsidization at below \nthe cost of production--but assuming that those basic principles of \nfair trade prevail, what our amendment says is that the reduction in \ntariffs that are provided under the Trade Promotion Act ``shall not \napply to a product that is'' at that time ``the subject of an \nantidumping or countervailing duty order . . . unless''--and the \nSenator from Texas, my good friend whom I respect and refer to as my \nTeutonic cousin, did not mention the provision--``unless the \nagreement''--that is, the trade agreement which purports to change the \ntariff on a particular product--``provides that as a term, condition, \nor qualification of the tariff concession, the tariff reduction will \nnot be implemented before the date that is 1 year after the date of \ntermination or revocation of such antidumping or countervailing duty \norder with respect to all exporters of such product.''\n  Under our amendment, our negotiators would be authorized to negotiate \ntariff concessions, but at the same time they would have to negotiate \nappropriate conditions or qualifications that would assure to the \nUnited States that those concessions would not be implemented until 1 \nyear after that country or that company has met the requirement to rid \nitself of the antidumping or anticountervailing duty provision, which \nmeans that they had stopped the predatory practices that had disrupted \nthe level playing field of international commerce.\n  I do not find that to be a radical or extreme position. If you \nbelieve we should have these methods of enforcing fair trade, \nantidumping and countervailing duties, then certainly you have to \nbelieve we should have the means of protecting ourselves against a \ncountry which has violated those laws, is under a sanction for that \nviolation, and is now trying to get tariff concessions to increase \ntheir ability to act in a predatory way against the United States.\n  This issue should not be partisan. It should not be regional. It \nshould not be a provision which divides the Senate, in my judgment, \nparticularly based on the vote we took last week on Dayton-Craig. It \nought to be a unifying amendment.\n  This issue has been a unifying issue in our State of Florida. I will \nsubmit for the Record a letter which was sent today by our State \nGovernor, Jeb Bush, to both Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley. I will \nsubmit it for the Record, but let me read in part:\n\n       I fully recognize the importance of supporting free but \n     fair trade for all concerned. However, Florida's citrus \n     industry has been forced to compete for years with countries \n     that implement unfair trade practices, forcing the industry \n     into financial decline. I support legislation that would \n     require trade negotiators to take into consideration \n     agriculture products that have been subject to antidumping or \n     countervailing duty orders before negotiations begin.\n\n  I believe this is a very important amendment, if we are dedicated to \nthe principle of providing our President the capability to negotiate to \nexpand trade in the United States. But we have reserved for the \nCongress the right to review specifically any changes that are made in \nthat process that relate to our ability to enforce fair trade.\n  And now with this amendment, we would give real teeth to that \nsanction by saying, having preserved our ability to maintain a level \nplaying field of fair trade through the ability to impose \ncountervailing duties against a nation or antidumping orders against a \nparticular commercial entity, now we can give strength to that by \nsaying, if you are under those sanctions, either one, you would not be \neligible for tariff concessions until you had purged yourself for 1 \nyear of those predatory practices.\n  I believe we should send a very strong signal to our trade partners \nthat if they are willing to play by the basic rules of fair \ninternational commerce, we are prepared to open our markets even \nfurther to them. But until they are willing to do so, until they are \nwilling to give up their previous practices that have distorted that \ninternational market, they will have to pay the price of those actions \nin the form of their noneligibility to receive any tariff concessions \nfrom the negotiations by our President which will be eventually \nsubmitted to this Congress for its up-or-down vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I thank our colleagues from Florida, \nSenator Graham and, in particular in this case, Senator Nelson. They \nare really good Senators. Senators are elected to defend the interests \nof their State and defend their people and try to help economic growth \nand development in their States. We all do that, all of us as Members \nof the Senate. For those folks in Florida who may be watching and are \ninterested in this subject, I want them to know that their two Senators \nare doing a great job. I hear from Senator Nelson and Senator Graham \nconstantly on this issue: What we can do; how can we work this out; how \ncan we compromise; what can we do to help here. I commend the two of \nthem for their very strong, valiant effort.\n  This is a subject with which we are wrestling. We have to make a \njudgment as to where we draw the line with respect to helping protect \nindustries and products in our own country and States. The real \nquestion is, What about agricultural products which are by their nature \nsensitive? Under current law, the President does not on his own have \nthe authority to reduce tariffs on such products. He has to get the \napproval of Congress. That is current law. The other body passed \nlegislation which basically gives the President the authority to reduce \ntariffs on certain products by proclamation, up to 50 percent of the \ncurrent tariff rate. The other body added that the President may not \nreduce tariffs by proclamation with respect to import-sensitive \nagricultural products; not only not by 50 percent, but not a single \npercentage point in reduction of tariffs for these products.\n  Our underlying bill has those same provisions; namely, the President \nhas the authority, by proclamation, to reduce tariffs by up to 50 \npercent on most products, but not with respect to import-sensitive \nagricultural products.\n  There are other provisions in this bill which help address the \nconcerns raised by the Senators from Florida. For example, the bill \nprovides a special consultation procedure for negotiations on import-\nsensitive agricultural products. That is, before initiating \nnegotiations on these products, the U.S. Trade Representative is \nrequired, under the provisions of this bill, to engage in special \nconsultations with the Finance Committee and with the Ways and Means \nCommittee in the other body and also with the Agriculture Committees in \nboth bodies.\n  This measure is designed to help give that extra protection for those \nvery sensitive industries. I know the Senators from Florida would like \nto go further. They would like the legislation to provide that the \nPresident may not come back to Congress with tariff reductions.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter from which I quoted in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S4675]]\n\n\n                                                 State of Florida,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                    Tallahassee, FL, May 22, 2002.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Senate Finance Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus: I am writing to bring to your \n     attention an important issue concerning Florida citrus during \n     your consideration of Presidential Trade Promotion Authority. \n     It is critical that the Congress support the citrus \n     industry's efforts to address unfair trade practices and \n     dumping against Florida's agriculture interests.\n       As Governor of a state with a large agriculture base and a \n     vibrant international trade sector, I fully recognize the \n     importance of supporting free but fair trade for all \n     concerned. However, Florida's citrus industry has been forced \n     to compete for years with countries that implement unfair \n     trade practices, forcing the industry into financial decline. \n     I support legislation that would require trade negotiators to \n     take into consideration agriculture products that have been \n     subject to antidumping or countervailing duty orders before \n     negotiations begin. The continued encroachment of unfairly \n     traded imports will severely impact the citrus industry.\n       In seeking to create legislation that will help promote \n     free but fair trade for our country's industries, I hope that \n     you will take into consideration the need to support import \n     sensitive products in pending legislation and future \n     negotiations. I appreciate your consideration of my comments. \n     Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have \n     questions or concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Jeb Bush,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Under the Nelson amendment, not only can the President \nnot proclaim tariff reductions on import-sensitive agricultural \nproducts, he cannot even negotiate a new agreement reducing tariffs on \nthose products. To be truthful, that presents a lot of problems. It \nviolates the principles of MFN--most-favored-nation trading status--\nwhich is, whenever we grant a tariff reduction to one country, it is \ngranted to all countries. That is the basic underlying principle of \nGATT and WTO for all countries. What you give to one, you give to all. \nOtherwise, there would be this crazy system where it would be virtually \nimpossible to trade.\n  This amendment would violate MFN, because, if the United States were \ntrying to negotiate tariff reductions on a certain product in various \ncountries, but at the same time there was an outstanding order on the \nsame product with respect to one particular country, this amendment \nwould say the President cannot reduce tariffs because of that one \ncountry. If one particular country were under restrictions, this \namendment would prevent the tariff from being reduced on that product \nfor all countries. Therefore, it violates the principles of MFN.\n  Madam President, I very much understand the efforts of the Senators. \nThey make some good points. I just don't know that it is proper to tie \nthe President's hands to such a great degree. This amendment will \nprevent the President from coming back to Congress in negotiating \ntariff reductions when there is an outstanding order.\n  I urge Senators not to support this amendment. We have given a lot to \nimport-sensitive agricultural products in this bill. The pending \namendment goes too far. I think it should be rejected.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator from Montana yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If there is no more debate, I am ready to put \nthe question. If the Senator will instruct Senator Graham and me when \nto put the question, we will request the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, in answer to the Senator's question, I \nknow of no other debate. However, due to extraneous circumstances, we \ncannot have a vote until at least 2:05. We can get the yeas and nays \nand order the vote for an up-or-down vote on the amendment. The vote \ncan begin at 2:05.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Is it in order to ask unanimous consent to \nhave the yeas and nays and a vote to occur at 2:05?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we would have no objection from the \nRepublican side if that would be a motion to table rather than a \nstraight up-or-down vote.\n  I amend the request of my friend from Florida by asking unanimous \nconsent that we have a vote at 2:05 on this amendment, that it be on a \nmotion to table that will be made, with no intervening amendment to \nthis, and then we can set this aside and move to something else for the \nnext half hour or so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Reserving the right to object, I would like to \nput into the Record--and intended to do so earlier--a letter from the \nFlorida citrus industry indicating their support for our amendment. I \nask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      Florida Citrus Industry,\n\n                                                     May 16, 2002.\n     Hon. Bill Nelson,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: First we want to express the \n     appreciation of the Florida citrus industry for all your work \n     on behalf of the industry with respect to Trade Promotion \n     Authority. The industry knows the time and effort you and \n     your staff have devoted to ensuring additional safeguards are \n     placed in TPA for Florida's citrus industry.\n       We would like to reiterate our support for the Nelson/\n     Graham amendment with respect to anti-dumping and \n     countervailing duties. We appreciate the efforts you and \n     Senator Graham have made with Senator Baucus and the \n     Administration in pursuing this language, and the \n     counterproposals offered by Senator Baucus and the \n     Administration. However, we believe the alternative presented \n     does not adequately address the underlying concerns by the \n     industry. As you recall in your meetings with the industry \n     over the last several months, the growers are clear in their \n     support for an exemption for citrus. We understand the \n     Administration and Senate leadership were clear in opposing \n     those attempts and we are appreciative of your willingness to \n     look for creative ways to provide additional steps in TPA to \n     help our industry.\n       Again, thank you for offering the Nelson/Graham amendment. \n     It is an important issue for our industry and we appreciate \n     your efforts on this matter and look forward to working with \n     you and your staff as negotiations move forward both in \n     Conference and in FTAA.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Crawford,\n       Executive Director, Florida Department of Citrus.\n     Andrew W. LaVignc,\n       Executive Vice President/CEO, Florida Citrus Mutual.\n     Barbara Carlton,\n       Executive Director, Peace River Valley CGA.\n     Doug Bournique,\n       Executive Director, Indian River Citrus League.\n     Ron Hamel,\n       Executive Director, Gulf Citrus GGA.\n     Ray Royce,\n       Executive Director, Highlands County CGA.\n     Lisa Young Rath,\n       Executive Vice President, Florida Citrus Processors.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Nevada?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Chair and thank the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we have a long list of amendments ahead \nof us, many of which are not germane, particularly since the invocation \nof cloture. Clearly, they are not going to get 60 votes to override the \npoint of order that would apply to them.\n  In the greater interest of moving this bill, which I think is the \ndesire of a very significant majority of Senators--witness the vote for \ncloture; 68 Senators voted for cloture--beginning 10 minutes from now, \nI am going to begin calling up amendments that are on the list which \nwill be declared not germane. I will make a point of order against each \nof those amendments that it is not germane. If the Chair agrees, we \nwill, therefore, dispose of a lot of amendments accordingly.\n  I give Senators 10-minute notice to come to the Chamber because if \ntheir amendment is yet to be called up and\n\n[[Page S4676]]\n\nthey have not yet called it up, it will most likely be declared by the \nChair as not germane. I am giving them an opportunity to come over and \nmake their case publicly to the Chair for why they think the amendment \nshould be germane. If they are not here within 10 minutes, I am going \nto, on behalf of Senators who have amendments, call them up and make a \npoint of order.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to Senators, this is not something Senator Baucus has \ngone around lobbying, suddenly making these nongermane or raise points \nof order because of the budget. This is something that has been done by \nthe Parliamentarian.\n  As the Senator indicated, if it is a germane point of order, it takes \na simple majority to override that point of order. As we learned in the \npast, they are not going to get 51 Senators to override germane points \nof order. It has created real tangles for the Senate in the past. That \nis not going to happen.\n  Those amendments relating to budget matters, if they can get 60 \nvotes, fine. We will have to see how that happens. I hope to facilitate \nmoving this bill. The chairman of the committee, the manager of the \nbill, is doing the absolutely right thing. It is going to happen at \nsome time. As I indicated, those who are following their amendments \nknow whether it is germane or not germane because the Parliamentarian \nmade that decision a long time ago.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In the interest of fairness and notice to Senators who I \nalso hope are fair with respect to the rest of the body--and I know \nthey will be--the amendments I have in mind are amendment No. 3445 \noffered by Senator Bayh; amendment No. 3447 offered by Senator Byrd; \namendment No. 3450 offered by Senator Byrd; amendment No. 3451 offered \nby Senator Byrd; amendment No. 3452 offered by Senator Byrd; amendment \nNo. 3453 offered by Senator Byrd; amendment No. 3431 offered by \nSenators Boxer and Murray; amendment No. 3432 offered by Senators \nBoxer, Mikulski, and Durbin; amendment No. 3457 offered by Senator \nDurbin, as well as amendment No. 3459 offered by Senator Harkin.\n  They have about 6 more minutes. I thank the Chair and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3467.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, will the Senator indicate \nwhich amendment he is calling up?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This is the amendment on human rights and democracy \nwhich is germane. I am trying to get the amendment offered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Can we get a copy of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3467\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3467.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3467.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n            (Purpose: To protect human rights and democracy)\n\n       On page 246, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following \n     new paragraph:\n       (12) Human rights and democracy.--The principal negotiating \n     objective regarding human rights and democracy is to obtain \n     provisions in trade agreements that require parties to those \n     agreements to strive to protect internationally recognized \n     civil, political, and human rights.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for their \ngraciousness.\n  This amendment which I offer to the fast-track portion of the \nsubstitute is critical to ensuring fairness in this global trading \nregime. It will improve the majority of the lives of Americans and our \ntrading partners.\n  The amendment adds a principled negotiating objective regarding human \nrights and democracy. It says to our negotiators that they should \nobtain provisions in trade agreements under which the parties to the \nagreements strive to protect internationally recognized civil, \npolitical, and human rights. These are rights guaranteed under existing \ninternational covenants.\n  This is not a debate about fast track, and again, I believe it is a \nprofound mistake for us to give up our right to amend trade agreements \nbecause these trade agreements are going to have such a critical impact \non the lives of the people we represent.\n  This amendment says: The rules of international trade ought to \nreflect American values. Our country ought to be a leader when it comes \nto promoting the values of democracy, when it comes to promoting the \nvalues of respect for human rights.\n  What we are saying is: U.S. trade negotiators, during your \nnegotiations, we want you to obtain a provision in the trade agreement \nwhich makes it clear that the parties that they must make a commitment \nto strive to protect internationally recognized civil, political, and \nhuman rights.\n  I say to Senators, in some ways I do not think this amendment should \nbe controversial.\n  There are some who say we have to be a part of this international \neconomy. I agree. The international economy is a new reality. I agree. \nWe should not put up walls on our border. I agree. Free trade--or I \nwould argue fair trade--could work well for our consumers and make our \nbusinesses more competitive.\n  As we lead in this new international economy, let's lead with our \nvalues. We ought to at least say to our trading partners: We call on \nyou to respect human rights and democratic principles. It is an \nimportant proposition and, at a minimum, we should demand countries try \nto do better. That is what this amendment says.\n  Here are some examples of the behavior of some of our trading \npartners. From the State Department Country Reports on Human Rights, \n2001 for China: Police and other elements of the security apparatus \nemploy torture and other degrading treatment in dealing with some \ndetainees and prisoners. Former detainees and press reported that \nofficials used electric shocks, prolonged periods of solitary \nconfinement, incommunicado detention, beatings, shackles, and the list \ngoes on.\n  Is it too much to ask that our trade agreements have a provision that \ncalls upon our partners to strive to meet the standards of recognized \ninternational covenants meant to protect the civil, political and human \nrights of the citizens of the world?\n  Another example is Russia. Again, this is from our own State \nDepartment Country Reports, 2001. There were credible reports that some \nlaw enforcement officials used torture regularly to coerce confessions \nfrom suspects and that the Government does not hold most officials \naccountable. Torture that was recognized in the State Department report \ntakes one of four forms: Beating with fists, batons, or other objects; \nasphyxiation using gas masks or bags sometimes filled with mace; \nelectric shocks; or suspension by body parts.\n  Again, all I am saying is, if you have governments that engage in the \npractice of torture, when we enter into trade agreements with those \ngovernments, shouldn't we have as a goal of the agreement that the \ngovernment will strive to protect internationally recognized civil, \npolitical, and human rights? Can't we make it a negotiating objective \nto get that commitment?\n  Another example is Colombia. From the Amnesty International Global \nReport of 2001: The human rights crisis continues to deepen. More than \n4,000 people were victims of political\n\n[[Page S4677]]\n\nkillings, over 300 ``disappeared,'' and an estimated 300,000 people \nwere internally displaced.\n  The report notes that some of this was the work of the FARC, the \nradical left guerilla group, but it also reports that some of the mass \nkillings were done by the paramilitary, often linked to the military.\n  My point is simple. It is un-American to allow an agreement to come \nto this body that we cannot change, that we may not even get a decent \namount of time to talk about, that allows us to trade unconditionally \nwith nations that torture their citizens, that summarily execute people \nfor exercising their basic right to question the government, that \npractice forced abortion, and that arbitrarily arrest, detain, and \nexile their citizens.\n  I make the point again. It is un-American to allow an agreement to \ncome to this body that we cannot change, that we may not even get a \ndecent amount of time to talk about, that allows us to trade \nunconditionally with nations that torture their citizens.\n  We should include in this fast-track bill a negotiating objective \nthat calls upon our trading partners to strive to live up to \ninternational civil, political and human rights standards. We ought to \ndo that. We ought to lead with our values. We ought to say this should \nbe a part of any negotiating strategy.\n  It is un-American to trade unconditionally with nations that deprive \ncitizens of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil Rights and \nPolitical Rights, such as the right to worship and the right to a fair \ntrial.\n  If we are going to enter into agreements with countries that deny \npeople the right of worship or the right to a fair trial or that \ntorture their citizens, or that summarily execute people because they \nquestion these governments, at the very minimum, we should make it \nclear, the Senate should make it clear, that we want to have a \nprovision in these trade agreements that at least calls upon these \ncountries to strive to live up to these basic standards.\n  I also argue it is un-American to trade unconditionally with nations \nthat intimidate their citizens and are so corrupt that public \nparticipation is out of the question.\n  It is important to lead with our values. We ought to be promoting \nhuman rights. What makes me most proud to be an American citizen, to be \na first-generation American, to be a Senator from Minnesota, is the way \nour country stands for human rights and for democracy and for freedom. \nI am saying in mild, moderate language, that our trade negotiators \nshould have a principle negotiating objective, like the ones already in \nthis bill for intellectual property rights and agriculture, that calls \nupon our partners to strive to live up to international human rights \nstandards. Why not have the U.S. Government be part of that?\n  I am not saying don't trade with them. And my amendment doesn't say \ndon't trade with them. I am saying trade in a way that lives up to \nAmerican standards. Use trade agreement to get commitments out of \ntrading partners to shape up--to respect the rights of their citizens.\n  In the January/February 2000 edition of Foreign Affairs National \nSecurity Advisor Condoleezza Rice said: ``There are no guarantees, but \nin scores of cases from Chile to Spain to Taiwan, the link between \ndemocracy and economic liberalization has proven powerful over the long \nrun.'' In remarks made to the Society of American Business Editors and \nWriters last April, USTR Zoellick said: ``. . . we have to ensure that \ntrade policies are aligned with our society's values. Free trade is \nabout more than economic efficiency. It promotes freedom abroad.'' In \nan address to the Council of the America's earlier this month, he said: \n``Democracy is more than just holding elections. It is the Liberal idea \nembodied by the phrase, `The rule of law, not of men.' It is a neutral, \ncomprehensive framework of rules enforced impartially and justly.''\n  And Monday, when talking about Cuba, the President said:\n\n       Political and economic freedoms go hand in hand . . . \n     Without major steps by Cuba to open up its political system \n     and its economic system, trade with Cuba will not help the \n     Cuban people. It's important for Americans to understand, \n     without political reform, without economic reform, trade with \n     Cuba will merely enrich Fidel Castro and his cronies. With \n     real political and economic reform, trade can benefit the \n     Cuban people and allow them to share in the progress of our \n     times.\n\n  It seems the administration has the rhetoric linking political and \neconomic progress--especially when it comes to embargoes. But where is \nthe commitment? Where is the commitment to ensure this progress with \nour trading partners? It is with our trading partners that we can \nactually make a difference. How can we stand here and debate a bill \nthat doesn't even demand that our trading partners try to do better \nwhen it comes to human rights and political freedom? Economic, \npolitical, and social progress have always gone hand-in-hand. If public \nparticipation in the political process, if transparency in government, \nif acknowledgment of the fundamental rights of man come second to \ntrade--to economic property rights--it is exploitation. It is the text \nbook definition of exploitation because someone owns those property \nrights--rights that affect everyone in society--but very few have had a \nsay in their distribution. Today there are negotiators at the table at \nthe WTO negotiating away rights over which the citizens of those \nrespective nations have absolutely no say.\n  If that is the case, why does this fast track bill make anti-\ncorruption in the trading regime and transparency at the WTO, principal \nobjectives for U.S. trade negotiators? Why do those advocating this \nbill think these things are important enough to demand them from \ncountries in the trading arena, but not important enough to demand that \nthese same nations allow such public participation in decisionmaking \nfor their own citizens? Why? I will tell you why--it is because the \ncurrent trading regime is all about protecting the rights of the \ninvestor regardless of the situation of the worker.\n  When I look at some of the statements made by the administration, in \nthe abstract, there are some I absolutely agree with. We have to \npromote human rights and democracy. We must insist on it in our foreign \nrelations. But this must be more than rhetoric. We must have a \ncommitment. Including a principle negotiating objective calling upon \nour trading partners to strive to live up to these standards is a way \nto show that commitment.\n  I have been talking about values but I could talk about competitive \ndisadvantages too. A lot of what is going on throughout the world puts \nour working people at a severe disadvantage. Whether I look at Mexico, \nColombia, or many other countries around the world, the situation is \nthe same. People, quite often, if they try to organize and bargain \ncollectively to get a better wage and working conditions, wind up in \nprison. They end up being tortured.\n  Who pays the price? The people in the other countries pay the price \nfor it. Our workers pay the price for it. It is hard for working people \nin our country to compete against a corporation that can go to another \ncountry, exploit children, work them 18 hours a day, and not abide by \nfair labor standards or abide by human rights standards. They can not \ncompete against it and they should not have to. In my opinion, this \ntreatment: persistent violations of human rights, payment of slave \nwages, exploitation of people at the workplace by making them work \nunder the most uncivilized working conditions, is a trade barrier. I \ndon't think our corporations and our companies and American businesses \nor American workers should have to compete with this.\n  Given the floor situation I will make my final two points. This \namendment is about values and this amendment is about economics. We \nshould lead with our values. If we are going to enter into trade \nagreements with other countries, can't we at least have a provision in \nthe trade agreements that calls on them to live up to basic human \nrights standards? Should we be silent on these questions? Should we be \ndoing business with countries all around the world without at least \ncalling on them to live up to the international covenants respecting \nbasic civil, political, and human rights? I think not.\n  The United States of America should not be silent when it comes to \nhuman rights. We should not be silent when it\n\n[[Page S4678]]\n\ncomes to persecution against people trying to practice their religion. \nWe should not be silent when it comes to people being rounded up and \nimprisoned for trying to organize a labor union and having decent \nworking conditions and wages to support their families.\n  Finally, without at least some language dealing with democracy and \nhuman rights, we put American companies and American workers at a \nsevere economic disadvantage. We find it very difficult to compete with \ncompanies located in countries whose governments violate basic human \nrights standards, that allow children to be worked to death, that \nallows slave wages, that allow uncivilized working conditions, and that \ncrack heads when people try to organize and join a union in order to \nget a better standard of living. This human rights and democracy \namendment strengthens this legislation and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it. Since my colleagues were gracious enough to let me speak, I \nyield the floor and eagerly await their response.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3445 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent amendment No. 3445 \nthat was introduced by Senator Bayh be withdrawn. I have his \npermission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I do not want to interfere with other \ncolleagues who might come out and offer amendments. If colleagues are \nnot anxious to speak now, I would like to make another point or two. \nSenator Grassley indicates that is fine.\n  I want to read from the International Confederation of Trade Unions \nAnnual Survey of Violations of Trade Union Rights for 2001.\n\n  In Mexico:\n\n       Independent trade unionists faced difficulties in \n     organizing during the year . . . there are frequent abuses in \n     the country's 4000 or so maquiladoras; 1.3 million workers \n     are paid less than six dollars a day to work in often \n     deplorable conditions and only 40% of them stay more than 3 \n     months in their job; unpaid overtime, sexual harrassment, \n     discrimination in employment, non-existent health and safety \n     precautions and unfair dismissals are just a few examples of \n     the daily lot of maquiladora workers.\n\n  In Colombia:\n\n       In 2000, more trade unionists were killed in Colombia than \n     in the whole world in 1999! One hundred and thirty-five trade \n     unionists, both leaders and members, were assassinated during \n     the year, bringing the total number of trade unionists killed \n     since 1991 to several thousand. At least another 1,600 have \n     received death threats over the last three years, including \n     180 in 2000. 37 were unfairly arrested and 155 had to flee \n     their home region; another 24 were abducted, 17 disappeared, \n     and 14 were the victims of physical attack.\n\n  The 2002 International Labor Organization (ILO) Global Report on \nChild Labor has estimated that over 8 million children worldwide are \ntrapped in the unconditional worst forms of child labor--which are \ninternationally defined as slavery, trafficking, debt bondage, and \nother forms of forced labor, forced recruitment for use in armed \nconflict, prostitution, and pornography, and illicit activities.\n  Madam President, 180 million children aged 5-17--or 73 percent of all \nchild laborers--are now believed to be engaged in the worst forms of \nchild labor, comprising hazardous work and the unconditional worst \nforms of child labor. This amounts to one child in every eight in the \nworld. Of the 171 million children engaged in hazardous work, nearly \n\\2/3\\ are under 15 and should be immediately withdrawn from this work \nand rehabilitated.\n  From an April 2002 Human Rights Report titled ``Tainted Harvest: \nChild Labor and Obstacles to Organizing on Ecuador's Banana \nPlantations'':\n\n       In 1994, according to government estimates, approximately \n     38 percent of all children in Ecuador between the ages of 10 \n     and 17 worked, or roughly 808,000 children approximately \\1/\n     2\\ of these children were between the ages of 10 and 14; in \n     the rural sector, roughly 59 percent of children between ages \n     10 and 17 worked, or approximately 568,000 children. In 1998, \n     another government survey indicated that the percentage of \n     children at work between the ages of 10 and 17 in Ecuador had \n     risen to 45 percent. Child workers were exposed to toxic \n     chemicals, handled insecticide-treated plastics, worked under \n     fungicide-spraying airplanes in the fields, and directly \n     applied post-harvest pesticides in packing plants. They \n     described using sharp tools, including knives, short curved \n     blades, and machetes, and lacking potable water and \n     sanitation facilities. One child described his situation when \n     he was 11: ``I went under the packing plant roof until the \n     [fumigation] plane left--less than an hour. I became \n     intoxicated. My eyes were red. I was nauseous. I was dizzy. I \n     had a headache. I vomited.''\n\n  Of course nations must be held accountable. But where is corporate \naccountability?\n  There are numerous reports that Coca Cola is not taking decisive \npublic action to prevent the killing of union members at its plants in \nColombia. You can be certain that if a Coca Cola plant in Colombia \nfound a product defect there, it would call out the dogs. Coca Cola \npersonnel would be on the first plane out of Atlanta and in Colombia \ndoing immediate quality control, figuring out where the problem is and \nfinding a solution. I am outraged there isn't the same response when it \ncomes to credible reports of violence against union leaders and \nactivists in its plants. Is a life worth less than a trademark? A \nrecent investigative report into the closing of a Phillips-Van Heusen \nCorporation factory in Guatemala by the U.S./Labor Education in the \nAmericas Project found that PVH closed the factory and busted the only \nunion with a collective bargaining agreement in Guatemala in order to \nshift production to poverty-wage sweatshops that are in flagrant \nviolation of Guatemalan labor law, as well as the White-House-initiated \nApparel Industry Partnership code of conduct.\n  I have many examples of absolutely deplorable working conditions, \npeople who are exploited, people who die at work, many of whom are \nchildren.\n  I will say it one more time: U.S. companies cannot compete with this. \nMore importantly, they should not have to. We ought to at least call \nupon our trading partners to shape up when it comes to basic worker \nrights. We ought not be undermining our own economy. We ought not be \nundermining our own companies. We ought not be undermining Americans \nwith this trade policy.\n  I say to my colleague from Iowa, this is a perfect marriage of values \nand economics. There are a lot of governments in this world, at least \n70, that systematically torture their citizens. If we know this is the \ncase, and we are entering into trade agreements with these nations, \nshouldn't we at least have a provision in the trade agreement that \ncalls upon them to strive to live up to internationally recognized \nhuman rights standards? How can anybody be against that proposition?\n  When it comes to economics, I will say it one more time, one of the \nreasons there is so much suspicion about these trade agreements, which \ncan be very good, is that often times they are not in the best interest \nof working people. Workers in Minnesota understand this and workers \nacross the country understand it. They know they cannot compete against \nworkers who make $6 a day, or $3 a day, and who work under deplorable \nworking conditions. They cannot compete a country that lacks respect \nfor basic human rights standards, that lacks respect for basic economic \nconditions, that doesn't allow people to speak up and call for a \ndifferent policy without ending up in prison and being tortured.\n  Colleagues, I have a democracy and human rights amendment on the \nfloor. I am calling on the Senate to be its best. I am calling on us to \nsupport these values.\n  I did not say that, as a condition of trade, we should say to these \ngovernments that they must live up to these standards though that is my \nwish. Instead, I am saying, at the very minimum we make it a priority \nin our trade negotiations and in our trade relations with other \ncountries to at least call upon those countries to strive to meet \ninternationally recognized civil, political and human rights standards. \nThis amendment ask only that countries try. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 3454\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question recurs \non the amendment of the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, No. 3454.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

The regular order is the Grassley second-\ndegree amendment to the Brownback first-degree amendment.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I want to do a \nunanimous consent request. I have an amendment that has been offered \nand is pending, amendment No. 3431. That amendment is not germane \npostcloture, but I do have a germane version of the amendment. The \namendment deals with making sure that the truckdrivers who will lose \ntheir jobs when we start having trucks coming into this country driven \nby noncitizens through the NAFTA agreement would be eligible for help.\n  I ask unanimous consent to substitute amendment No. 3511 for \namendment No. 3431 and that it be considered in the same order as \namendment No. 3431.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am not surprised that my friend would \nobject to this. I will simply make one more unanimous consent request, \nand then I will yield the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be set aside \ntemporarily so I might call up amendment No. 3511. This would put my \namendment that is germane on the list at the end of the list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very sorry that we can't vote on this \nissue because I believe truckdrivers, who are some of the hardest \nworking people in this country, are going to be thrown out of work. It \nis very sad.\n  Fortunately, I have talked to Majority Leader Daschle. He has assured \nme that we will have a vote on or in relation to this particular issue \non the next bill that comes up that is not an appropriations bill.\n  I am very pleased at that. I thank the majority leader and thank my \nfriends.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President. I rise to support the amendment that \nSenator Grassley has offered to the Brownback amendment.\n  On the eve of the President's summit with President Putin, I join my \ncolleagues in recognizing the importance of out ties with Russia and \nthe Central Asian republics. These countries have been very reliable \nallies in our war on terrorism. They have shared intelligence with us, \ngranted overflight and refueling rights, and cooperated in the \nstationing of U.S. troops. They also have supported our efforts in the \nUnited Nations to undermine terrorist organizations.\n  All of these efforts warrant our recognition and our gratitude. It is \nmy expectation that President Bush will be conveying the sincere \nappreciation of the American people for Russia's close cooperation with \nthe U.S. in recent months.\n  I want to draw attention to a key provision in the resolution. It \nstates that the Senate ``supports terminating the application of title \nIV of the Trade Act of 1974 to Russia in an appropriate and timely \nmanner.''\n  Title IV of the Trade Act refers to the so-called Jackson-Vanik \namendment. In order for Russia to have permanent normal trade \nrelations--PNTR--with the U.S. we have to terminate application of \nJackson-Vanik. Granting PNTR will be a requirement when Russia joins \nthe WTO, which may still be a year or more away.\n  I want to be clear about what we mean when we say that PNTR should be \ngranted ``in an appropriate and timely manner.'' It means that we \nshould extend PNTR when we have a clear picture of the terms on which \nRussia will join the WTO.\n  That is the responsible thing to do. That is how we approached PNTR \nfor China. It also is how we approached PNTR for other Jackson Vanik \ncountries, including Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Mongolia, Georgia, and \nKyrgyzstan.\n  I look forward to the day when we can welcome Russia into the WTO, \nalong with other countries covered by this resolution. At that time, I \nhope and expect that Congress will give its strongest backing for PNTR.\n\n\n     Amendment No. 3474, As Further Modified, To Amendment No. 3446\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send a further modification of my \namendment to the desk. The purpose of the modification is to make some \nchanges to satisfy the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the United \n          States-Russian Federation summit meeting, May 2002)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted inset the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE UNITED STATES-\n                   RUSSIAN FEDERATION SUMMIT MEETING, MAY \n                   2002.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) President George W. Bush will visit the Russian \n     Federation May 23-25, 2002, to meet with his Russian \n     counterpart, President Vladimir V. Putin;\n       (2) the President and President Putin, and the United \n     States and Russian governments, continue to cooperate closely \n     in the fight against international terrorism;\n       (3) the President seeks Russian cooperation in containing \n     the war-making capabilities of Iraq, including that country's \n     ongoing program to develop and deploy weapons of mass \n     destruction;\n       (4) during his visit, the President expects to sign a \n     treaty to significantly reduce deployed American and Russian \n     nuclear weapons by 2012;\n       (5) the President and his NATO partners have further \n     institutionalized United States-Russian security cooperation \n     through establishment of the NATO-Russia Council, which meets \n     for the first time on May 28, 2002, in Rome, Italy;\n       (6) during his visit, the President will continue to \n     address religious freedom and human rights concerns through \n     open and candid discussions with President Putin, with \n     leading Russian activists, and with representatives of \n     Russia's revitalized and diverse Jewish community; and\n       (7) recognizing Russia's progress on religious freedom and \n     a broad range of other mechanisms to address remaining \n     concerns, the President has asked the Congress to terminate \n     application to Russian of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 \n     (commonly known as the ``Jackson-Vanik Amendment'') and \n     authorize the extension of normal trade relations to the \n     products of Russia.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--The Senate--\n       (1) supports the President's efforts to deepen the \n     friendship between the American and Russian peoples;\n\n[[Page S4680]]\n\n       (2) further supports the policy objectives of the President \n     mentioned in this section with respect to the Russian \n     Federation;\n       (3) supports terminating the application of title IV of the \n     Trade Act of 1974 to Russia in an appropriate and timely \n     manner; and\n       (4) looks forward to learning the results of the \n     President's discussions with President Putin and other \n     representatives of the Russian government and Russian \n     society.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on the eve of President Bush's European \nvisit, it is appropriate to point out how attitudes have changed \nregarding the President's actions with respect to the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty. A little more than a year ago there was widespread \nconcern over President Bush's decision to withdraw the United States \nfrom the ABM treaty. Recently there has been a general change of mind. \nIt appears that many of Bush's biggest critics incorrectly guessed \nRussian President Vladimir Putin's reaction. Instead of renewing cold \nwar tensions by increasing nuclear arsenals, the United States and \nRussia have continued to strengthen their friendship.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of an article in today's \nWashington Post that underscores President Bush's foresight in dealing \nwith Russia and the ABM treaty.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Criticism Softens on ABM Move\n\n                           (By Dana Milbank)\n\n       A year ago, on President Bush's first presidential trip to \n     Europe, allies in Western Europe and congressional Cassandras \n     worried about the administration's plan to abrogate the 1972 \n     Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Russia.\n       They argued that Bush's plans for a missile defense system, \n     at the same time NATO was expanding to Russia's border, would \n     throw the world into a nuclear arms race. ``We need to \n     preserve these strategic balances, of which the ABM Treaty is \n     a pillar,'' said French President Jacques Chirac. German \n     Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder joined Chirac in issuing a joint \n     statement defending the ABM.\n       As Bush arrives tonight in Berlin for a seven-day overseas \n     trip, European leaders still oppose the White House's policy \n     on issues ranging from Iraq to global warming. But many \n     concede Bush may have been right about Russia and the ABM.\n       The United States pulled out of the ABM Treaty, and NATO \n     expansion in the Baltic nations is on track. Instead of an \n     arms race and hostility resulting, Bush and Russian President \n     Vladimir Putin became fast friends. They agreed on an accord \n     reducing nuclear weapons and are pursuing new ways to \n     cooperate in commerce, intelligence and defense.\n       ``We were worried a year ago that Bush's position would \n     create a terrible confrontation,'' a senior German diplomat \n     said. ``Maybe we underestimated Putin's creativeness and \n     farsightedness.''\n       Bush loyalists say the administration had a clearer view \n     than Western Europeans did on Russia. Bush, like Putin, \n     understood the conflict had shifted from one of East against \n     West to a new struggle of wealthy democracies against \n     dictatorial regimes and stateless terrorists. Bush also \n     perceived that Putin wished to be on the side of the wealthy \n     democracies.\n       ``It has been a pattern for 50 years that people yell \n     Chicken Little any time we ask the Russians to do anything,'' \n     said Kenneth Adelman, who ran the Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency in the Reagan administration. ``It's all \n     been wrong and predictably wrong.''\n       In the new, ``asymmetrical'' warfare against rogue states, \n     the Russians are allies, Adelman said. ``They'll be with us \n     on these issues probably more than France, and they'll be \n     more important. They fear Islamic radicalism, they fear \n     weapons of mass destruction, and they need Western investment \n     and Western ways and means.''\n       Officially, the Bush administration is not gloating. But \n     Bush aides did compile a list of Chicken Little remarks made \n     by politicians and commentators last year. Its title: \n     ``Quotes of Criticism on ABM Withdraw and National Missile \n     Defense.''\n       The list, mostly Democrats, includes Clinton national \n     security adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger saying Bush had \n     put the nation on a ``collision course'' with Russia and NATO \n     allies.\n       Senate Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.) declared: \n     ``I believe it would be a grave mistake for the United States \n     to unilaterally abrogate the ABM treaty in order to deploy a \n     robust national defense system. Unilateral actions will \n     trigger reactions all around the world. Those reactions \n     themselves could make our nation less secure.''\n       House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) vowed to \n     block any missile defense system that violated the ABM \n     Treaty. ``Europeans are worried,'' Gephardt said, saying the \n     administration may ``prevent us from seizing a historic \n     opportunity for engagement with Russia.''\n       And former president Jimmy Carter said Bush's missile \n     defense plan, which required abrogating the ABM Treaty, was \n     ``technologically ridiculous'' and would ``re-escalate the \n     nuclear arms race.''\n       One Republican made the compilation. Sen. John W. Warner \n     (Va.) said Bush should leave ``some vestiges of the ABM \n     Treaty in place'' to assure allies.\n       Included in the collection of quotes was a press release \n     quoting Washington arms control expert Daryl G. Kimball \n     predicting Bush's missile defense idea and ABM position would \n     ``set off a dangerous action/reaction cycle, involving the \n     United States, Russia, and China.''\n       Gephardt spokesman Erik Smith, asked about his boss's old \n     remarks, acknowledged that ``the White House has made \n     progress'' with Russia. But he said Bush has yet to make \n     progress with Russia on nuclear proliferation, Iraq and \n     dismantling nuclear weapons. ``There were several other \n     points . . . that have not been addressed,'' Smith said.\n       Kimball was unrepentant about his earlier words. ``I stand \n     behind the quote,'' he said. ``The potential for a dangerous \n     action/reaction cycle remains, especially because the Bush \n     administration has failed to lock in verifiable reductions of \n     Russia's nuclear forces.''\n       Bush aids dismiss such concerns.\n       ``What keeps Russia and the United States from going to war \n     today is not the number of nuclear weapons that they have on \n     either side or the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty or some \n     outdated notion of strategic stability,'' national security \n     adviser Condoleezza Rice said. ``It's that they have nothing \n     to go to war about.''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, we are still waiting to \nhear from one Senator. We should be able to do that momentarily, if he \nwill withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly on the matter \nin front of the body, the Grassley substitute amendment on granting \nRussia and central Asian countries permanent normal trade relations. I \nam glad we have taken up the resolution itself, the sense of the \nSenate. It is a positive statement. We should take up PNTR. Otherwise, \nas I stated last night, I recognize that the votes are not here today \nto deal with that issue for Russia or some of the central Asian \ncountries, but I want to take this opportunity to address the body on \nthis particular point because we really need to recognize what has \ntaken place and move with some speed in the near future to address this \ntopic because of what is taking place in the world.\n  I realize we are a body that takes time, and it takes some time and \neffort to move some of these issues. But look at what has taken place. \nThe President of the United States is going to Russia this week. Last \nweek Russia announced a two-thirds reduction in nuclear missile \ncapacity, an enormous agreement. Last week Russia joined closer and \ncloser to NATO, the very organization that previously had been \nstructured to defend against the Soviet Union. Now the successor \norganization of Russia is joining closer to NATO.\n  Jackson-Vanik, that is what PNTR is addressed toward--permanent \nnormal trade relations is not granted until a Jackson-Vanik waiver is \ngranted. Jackson-Vanik addresses the issue of whether you allow free \nimmigration of religious minorities, particularly Jews, out of the \nformer Soviet Union. That is what the particular bill was directed \ntoward. That is taking place. There is no question but that is taking \nplace in Russia. As we look to the future and as we seek to reduce \ndependence on Mideastern oil, Russia and central Asia are going to \nfigure larger and larger into the picture, along with their own \ndomestic production.\n\n  I make the point as well that we have granted China PNTR after a \nlong, extended debate about that. Yes, we have granted China permanent \nnormal trade relations. If we look at their human rights record versus \nthat taking place in Russia--you have a number of abuses, a number of \npeople not being allowed to leave China--that is occurring in Russia. \nBut the different standard we are putting forward here is striking.\n  Even today, there are a number of North Koreans who have gone to \nChina from North Korea, who don't want to go back to North Korea. Yet \nthey are being forced to, by bounties given by the Chinese, to round \nthem up and send them back to North Korea. That is not human rights and \nreligious freedom in China. Yet we have granted permanent normal trade \nrelations with them. I\n\n[[Page S4681]]\n\nvoted for it. I thought we should because the overall issue is about us \nengaging these places in the world, engaging China.\n  Now, clearly, we should be engaging Russia. The President has \ndeveloped a strong relationship with President Putin. President Putin \nis leaning forward a long way with his country in engaging the West in \na remarkable fashion--a fashion that I think anybody here would have to \nsay is nothing short of miraculous, about how far forward he is taking \nhis country in a short period of time in working with the West. These \nare breathtaking results, really.\n  The notion that we would hold up and be slow about an issue of \npermanent normal trade relations when we granted it to China, which has \nmissiles pointed this way, has human rights abuses, and is selling \nweapons technology to rogue regimes around the world--it is striking \nthat it would be different.\n  As far as central Asia--and that is what else was in the base bill. \nIn Uzbekistan, we have troops. In Kazakhstan, we have troops. In \nAzerbaijan, we have landing rights. In Armenia, Armenian Americans are \nseeking development. What we are talking about with PNTR is the ability \nof having normal trade relations with this country so they might grow \nwith us.\n  Realizing the votes are not here today to grant PNTR to these \ncountries, I think it is time we pick up the pace on doing this because \nof the speed of events taking place, and it is so important that we \nengage these areas. Hopefully, in the near future, we will reduce our \ndependence on oil in the Middle East and have more coming from U.S. \ndomestic sources and countries such as Kazakhstan and Russia. There \nwill be a closer economic tie that should be basic in the relationship.\n  We need to send a strong message of support from the United States to \nthe Russian Duma and President Putin that we deeply appreciate and \nagree with the actions he has taken on behalf of Russia last week. He \ndid incredible things last week. We are doing a sense of the Senate. It \nis a positive statement. We should do that. It is a right sort of \nstatement for us to make to Russia. It pales in comparison to what the \nRussians have done themselves. All we are asking is that we put forward \nbasically a normal trade relationship between the United States and \nRussia--a country that seeks to grow much closer to the United States. \nWe should encourage that with a great deal of speed and effort on our \npart.\n  So I rise in support of the Grassley substitute for Russia and \ncentral Asia. The central Asian and south Caucasus nations are a part \nof this. We should be granting PNTR and engaging as they are with us. \nThey are frontline for us in the war on terrorism. They were in the \nAfghan conflict when our men were based out of Uzbekistan to go into \nAfghanistan. Without them, we would have a great deal of difficulty. \nThis is a modest proposal for us to move forward. I support the \nGrassley substitute. I hope we can be more forward-leaning ourselves in \nengaging central Asia and Russia in this overall effort. I support the \nGrassley amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3467\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am going to try to make the most \nefficient use of time. When colleagues are ready to do some other work, \nI will certainly be pleased to yield the floor. There is no surprise \nhere. I say to Senator Grassley, as I said to the Senator from Montana, \nI am going to speak for a few minutes. When we are ready to get back to \nbusiness, I will be pleased to yield the floor. This is no 5-hour \nspeech that I have planned right now.\n  Mr. President, I want to one more time discuss the human rights and \ndemocracy amendment. For the life of me, I actually do not understand \nthe basis of opposition.\n  In the legislation before us, there is a listing of objectives. \nBelieve me, one of the objectives is to do everything we can to protect \nproperty rights, to do everything we can to make sure patents are \nprotected--you name it--intellectual property is protected. Fine.\n  What this amendment says is one of the listed goals of trade policy \nought to be the promotion of human rights and democracy. It should be \none of our goals. We should list this as a goal of trade policy and \nthen call upon our trading partners to strive to meet these standards.\n  I want to say in not the hardest hitting way but in a little softer \nway at first that this is the greatness of our country. We should lead \nwith our values. We should be promoting human rights in the world.\n  I gave examples of any number of different countries right out of our \nown State Department report where governments systematically torture \ncitizens, where people who dare to speak up and challenge a government \nare imprisoned, where people who dare to organize a union to make \nbetter wages and support their families wind up in prison. There are at \nleast 70 governments in the world that systematically still use torture \nagainst their citizens.\n  I am saying that I think it would make us a better Senate and would \nmake each Senator a better Senator if we would say one of our goals--\nthat is all this says--should be the promotion of democracy and human \nrights and that we should at least call upon our trading partners to \nstrive to meet internationally recognized civil, political, and human \nrights.\n  I do not understand the opposition. I know we are now in a situation \nwhere cloture has been invoked--this is a germane amendment--where we \nhave a limited amount of time. That is why I came to the Chamber now. \nOther Senators have amendments, and I do not want to crowd out their \namendments, but I certainly would like the opposition at some time \nbefore a vote to explain the basis of a ``no'' vote.\n  I believe as a first-generation American Senator from a human rights \nState, Minnesota, which has always been at the forefront in promoting \nhuman rights and has always been at the forefront in promoting \ndemocracy--and, by the way, many refugees who have fled persecution \nhave come to Minnesota--I do not understand why the Senate would not go \non record with a 100-to-0 vote that one of the goals of our trade \npolicy should be the promotion of human rights and democracy and that \nwe would call upon our trading partners to strive to meet those goals.\n  Haven't we read about enough reports dealing with deplorable child \nlabor conditions? How many more children need to die? How many more \nbrave men and women need to be tortured? How many working people in \nthese other countries need to wind up in prison? How many workers need \nto die at an early age because of the carcinogenic substances they work \nwith because there is no protection, and if they dare to speak out, \nthey wind up in prison?\n  How many more men and women in our country are going to have to lose \ntheir jobs because we have no trade agreements that call upon \ngovernments to live up to these standards?\n  This is a values vote, and it is a working family vote. It is a \nvalues vote because we should lead with our values, and we should at \nleast vote to make this a goal of our trade policy.\n\n  My colleagues know me. This is my pragmatic best. This is the most \npragmatic language I can come up with: That we should list human rights \nand democracy as a goal and call upon our trading partners to strive to \nmeet that goal.\n  Now, to be more serious, we should lead with our values. This is what \nI love about our country: Promoting human rights. I am in awe of the \nmen and women I have met in my life. I do not know how they do it. You \nlive in some of these countries, and you dare to speak up when you know \nit is not just that you might be rounded up and tortured--here is what \nis worse, Mr. President, here is how these governments silence \ncitizens: They threaten that they will round up your children or your \nwife, your husband, your loved ones, and they will be tortured or they \nwill be raped or they will be murdered.\n\n[[Page S4682]]\n\n  I am saying today in this Chamber that we ought to at least vote to \nmake a goal of our trade policy respect for human rights and democracy.\n  My second point is a working family point. I am positive that the \nfamilies I represent with this vote are not lobbying furiously because \nthey are not usually the ones with that much clout. The vast majority \nof people in our country and the vast majority of people in Minnesota \nare absolutely for good trade policy, but I think people would like \nsome reassurance that we would strive in our trade agreements with \nother countries to establish some goals where they do not get put out \nof work because they are competing with a 13-year-old who has to work \n19 hours a day at 30 cents an hour. It is not good for that 13-year-\nold, and it is not good for workers in our country.\n  I see colleagues in the Chamber. I will not belabor the point, but I \nwill come back to this again. Frankly, I think opposition to this \namendment, unfortunately, tells a larger story about what is profoundly \nwrong with this legislation. Legislation that does not establish that \ngoal and is afraid to speak out on promoting the goal of human rights \nand democracy in the world is legislation that does not deserve \nsupport. I hope there will be support for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Order for Recess\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The acting majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that between 4:30 \np.m. and 5:30 p.m. today, the Senate stand in recess and that the hour \naway from the Senate will be counted against the 30 hours postcloture. \nThe reason for this is that Secretary Rumsfeld is here for a secret \nbriefing and all Senators should go to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3474, As Further Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the Grassley second-\ndegree amendment to the Brownback amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3474, as further \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3474), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3446\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the first-degree \namendment, as amended?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3446, as \namended.\n  The amendment (No. 3446), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the managers of the bill. \nWhat we would like to do now is move off the Dorgan amendment No. 3442. \nSenator Dorgan is going to be here momentarily to deal with that \namendment. We would like to move off that and move to amendment No. \n3443, the amendment of Senator Reed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3443\n\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding now that we are on this amendment, \nthe Senator from Rhode Island wants to ask unanimous consent for \nsomething. After having done that, we will deal with his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I have an amendment that is now pending \nthat, prior to the cloture vote, would have been in order for \nconsideration, but after cloture, at this point I ask unanimous consent \nI be allowed to substitute another amendment which is in order for \nconsideration if accepted by the body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I appreciate the point that has just been \nmade. My amendment, if I was allowed to proceed, would have dealt with \nthe issue of secondary workers, providing them the same types of \nprotections which are available to workers in facilities that are \ndirectly affected by trade actions. This is an amendment that is \ncosponsored by Senator Bingaman, the Presiding Officer, Senator \nCorzine, and others. It comes directly from the original legislation \nthat Senator Bingaman submitted, S. 1209, which recognizes that the \neffects of trade are not discretely limited to individual companies but \nalso affect those vendors, suppliers, and workers who support that \ncompany. I think that is a principle that is beyond debate.\n  When a factory closes, it is not just the factory workers, it is the \ntruckers, it is the tradesmen who work in that facility who very often \nsee their livelihoods completely exhausted by the effects of trade.\n  As a result, this legislation was originally proposed by Senator \nBingaman. It was part of the proposal Senator Daschle made. It was part \nof the discussions. Unfortunately, regretfully, and I think unfairly, \nit was deleted from the provision which is in the underlying bill.\n  As a result, I would have offered either the substitute amendment or, \nindeed, would offer the amendment now which would have included the \neffects of the trade adjustment benefits for those secondary workers. \nAgain, I think it makes quite a bit of sense.\n  Our definition of a secondary worker is someone who must have \nsupplied a service or contract to the firm that has been certified as \ngoing out of business due to the direct effect of international trade. \nPerhaps the most compelling examples are those individual teamsters who \nservice businesses that might, in fact, go out of business because of \ntrade. They, too, lose their livelihood.\n  I know my colleague, Senator Boxer of California, has offered an \namendment that deals directly with the issue of truckers and teamsters. \nMy amendment would apply to any worker who could validly make the claim \nof being, as I said, by contract or some relationship, related to a \nfactory that is being closed down.\n\n  The point I should also make is this provision would only give the \nworkers or their representatives the opportunity to apply for these \nbenefits because they have to be certified. It has to be shown that \nthey have lost their job because of the effects of trade. The \ncertification process, as we all know, is a rather difficult one. It is \nnot presumed. It has to be proven. In this context, we are not opening \nup the floodgates. We are merely giving people who have lost their \nlivelihood because of trade a fair chance.\n  The most compelling point I urge in this whole area is we did \nprecisely this under the NAFTA agreement. We provided for TAA benefits \nfor workers, secondary workers, who were affected by the NAFTA \nagreement.\n  So I urge very strongly that we overlook any of the procedural \nimpediments and go to the heart of this matter. Give secondary workers \nthe same rights as those factory workers who might lose their jobs \nbecause of the adverse effect of trade.\n  We can do that by accepting the Reed-Bingaman-Corzine amendment. We \ncan do that as we did in NAFTA and give all workers who have lost their \njobs because of trade the benefits of the TAA assistance that has been \nprovided on a limited basis in the underlying agreement.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this effort.\n  At this time I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3442\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask we return to the regular order, which I understand is \nthe Dorgan amendment.\n\n[[Page S4683]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The regular order \nis amendment No. 3442.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the pending business is amendment No. \n3442; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3442 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I offered this amendment prior to the \ncloture vote. I understand a point of order would lie against it \npostcloture because it is not germane postcloture. I will withdraw it \nbecause I do not think at this point the amendment would survive the \nvote because it is not germane. But I am, frankly, surprised. The first \namendment I offered prevailed here in the Senate on a rather \nsignificant vote.\n  This amendment is an interesting amendment. It is very simple. Those \nwho come to the floor of the Senate and talk about trade normally turn \nthe volume up a bit and talk about how this country needs to be able to \ncompete, that we need to be able to do so around the world.\n  Let me talk about competition for a second and what this amendment is \nabout.\n  We had an investigation with respect to Canadian wheat. It has \nflooded into this country unfairly. It has done so for years following \nthe United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. In fact, that flood, \nthat avalanche of Canadian grain, was in contravention to an agreement \nthat Mr. Yeutter put in writing to the Congress saying: This won't \nhappen. The representation of good faith on both sides of the border \npost-United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement means we will not have a \nsignificant change in the flow of grain across our border. He put that \nin writing to the Congress.\n  Guess what happened. That trade agreement was approved--not with my \nvote. I voted against it. But instantly we had an avalanche of unfairly \ntraded grain coming into this country. Did anyone lift a finger to do \nanything about it? We have had all of this discussion about helping the \nAmerican farmer, but no one was willing to lift a finger to do \nanything.\n  The farmers had to put their own money together in a 301 \ninvestigation that went through the ITC and the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative. The U.S. Trade Representative and the ITC concluded \nthat Canada is guilty of unfair trade. It hurt our farmers. So the \njudgment was guilty.\n  What is the remedy? The remedy is we are going to say you had better \nwatch it. We are not going to do anything about it. There is no trade \nremedy, no sanction, and no tariff quota--no nothing.\n  Here we are. The farmers spent their money in a section 301 action. \nThey won. Canada is guilty of unfair trade and is taking money right \nout of family farmers' pockets. And we have people prancing around the \nfloor of the Senate talking about we ought to be able to compete \nanywhere in the world as long as the competition is fair. It is not \nfair. It has been judged to be unfair. Yet we can't get a trade remedy.\n  Why is the ambassador unwilling to stand up for family farmers? The \ntrade ambassador stood up for steel. He stood up for lumber. Why is he \nunwilling to stand up for family farmers and propose a remedy--for \nexample, a tariff quota? Why? Does anyone have an answer to that? I \ndon't think so.\n  So I offered the softest possible amendment. I offered that \nprecloture. The amendment I understand now postcloture will fall on a \npoint of order. So I shall withdraw it.\n  But the amendment is very simple. Anyone who says they stand for \nfamily farmers ought to support this amendment. It simply says we want \nthe trade ambassador to report back to the Congress within 6 months, \ntelling us what his remedy is going to be for the judgment that has \nalready been rendered that Canada is guilty of unfair trade, yes, \nunfair trade, and shipping an avalanche of unfairly subsidized Canadian \ngrain into our market at secret prices by a state-sanctioned Canadian \nWheat Board which is a monopoly that would be illegal in our country, \nand also underpricing us in other markets, particularly northern Africa \nand other places where we have been injured in international trade in \nother markets.\n  My amendment simply says the ambassador shall report back to the \nCongress within 6 months the specific proposed trade remedy that will \nbe administered on behalf of the American farmers who have already been \nable to achieve through their own filing of a 301 case and through the \nuse of their own money to bring a case and get a guilty verdict against \nthe Canadians.\n\n  One is going to ask--and farmers certainly should ask--of what value \nis it to have a trade remedy if at the end of the day it is judged that \nfarmers are victims of unfair trade and our trade authority? Our \nlegislators say, by the way, the perpetrators of this unfair trade \nshall not have to bear any responsibility or any burden or be on the \nreceiving end of financial sanctions.\n  I just do not understand it. I do understand what is going on with \nrespect to the fast-track trade agreement, which I don't support. The \neffort here is to try to tighten it up, like putting a big tarp on a \nbig truck. You tighten the rubber bands around it, hook it altogether, \ndon't let any wind in, and drive it through as fast as you can.\n  That is what this is all about. It is good for those who do it.\n  After this particular legislation is enacted, they will see another \nincrease in America's trade deficit. In every single circumstance in \nthe last 15 years when we bragged about forcing open foreign markets, \nand when we passed fast-track trade authority and negotiated another \ntrade agreement, our trade deficit increased, yes, with Europe, with \nMexico, with Canada, with Japan, and with China. In every single \ncircumstance, that trade deficit is on a relentless path upward. \nEverybody knows it.\n  Therefore, while everyone is sitting around saying let us ignore this \nhuge, growing tumor called this trade deficit, over $1 billion a day, \nevery single day, 7 days a week represents the trade deficit. Over $1 \nbillion every day is the amount of goods we bring into this country \nwhich exceeds the amount of goods we ship out. Somebody is going to \nhave to pay for that.\n  I used to teach economics in college. I have told my colleagues many \ntimes. But I have been able to overcome that experience and do other \nthings in life as well. But what we taught in college in the field of \neconomics was that you could explain a budget deficit by a deficit that \nyou owe to yourself. That is a plausible explanation. Under the U.S. \nfiscal policy, a budget deficit is money we owe to ourselves. You \ncannot make a similar explanation with respect to the trade deficit. \nThe trade deficit is money we owe to others. It will be someday, in \nsome way, paid for by a lower standard of living in the United States. \nThat is inevitable and is not debatable.\n  The question is: When are we going to care about the trade deficit? \nWhen does an American trade deficit of $440 billion-plus begin to \nmatter to our country and to our economy, and, yes, to the children who \nwill inherit that and will have to pay others around the world to \nsettle that trade deficit? Part and parcel of that trade deficit are \nthe trade circumstances in which our producers and our workers are \nvictimized.\n  One instance of that is America's farmers who produce this grain and \nlifestyle and find themselves victimized by unfair trade. It is \nadmonished by politicians of virtually every stripe that it is \nimportant for them to go forward and to compete: You must compete. You \nmust be competitive. We can be competitive anywhere in the world. I am \nconvinced of that. But you can't do it with one hand tied behind your \nback. You can't do it with rules that aren't fair, especially with \nrespect to grain.\n  The judgment is already in. The ITC and the U.S. Trade Representative \nhave already said our farmers are victims of unfair trade. It is just \nthat the remedy is nonexistent.\n  Unfortunately, I am not able, apparently, to put on this piece of \nlegislation a very simple amendment that would ask the Trade \nRepresentative within 6 months to report back a remedy by which people \nstand up for and\n\n[[Page S4684]]\n\nsupport those who are victims of unfair trade with Canada; that is, \nfamily farmers and family ranchers across this country.\n  I regret that. But then there will be other days and other ways to \naddress this issue. This is the place to have addressed it. This is a \ntrade bill. This is the place, and this is the time to have addressed \nthis issue on behalf of family farmers.\n  I regret that we could not get the 60 votes necessary to overcome the \npoint of order postcloture to stand up for family farmers on this \nmatter. As a result, I will ask consent to withdraw the amendment, and \nI make such a request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3474, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we just adopted, I understand by UC, a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution that relates to Jackson-Vanik. With the \npermission of my colleagues, I would like to speak to that for just a \nfew minutes.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate resolution proposed by Senator Grassley \nreinforces a commitment that I support, which is to extend all efforts \nto expand our relationship with Russia.\n  Russia has taken very significant steps toward working with NATO, \ncooperating with us against terrorism in central Asia and the north \nCaucasus, providing a stable world oil market, and opening up its \ndomestic markets.\n  But we have to keep in mind that while Russia, under President Putin, \nis moving toward greater acceptance of the rule of law, free trade, and \na market economy, it is not there yet.\n  It hopes to join the World Trade Organization, it is seeking foreign \ninvestment, and it is working to revise its legal and business \nstructures toward those ends. But it still falls by the wayside on \nsignificant points.\n  Most visibly, on March 1 of this year, Russia imposed an unexpected \nand arbitrary embargo on imports of U.S. chicken parts, causing serious \ngrief and economic loss to an industry.\n  Now, chickens and chicken parts are a multibillion-dollar industry, \nbigger than most of the industries in most of your States. And it is a \nbig deal in my State.\n  While I appreciate the worldwide problems of finding common health \nstandards, the timing, as well as the arbitrary and sudden imposition \nof Russia's ban, indicates that political and financial reasons, not \nthe claimed health reasons, were the cause. They came up with a \nspecious argument.\n  After some intense negotiations and the President basically telling \nthe Russians, ``Hey, look, if you want to play in the world of \ninternational trade, you have to play by the rules. You have to be \nfair''--they went ahead and ``lifted'' the embargo, which was specious \nfrom the outset. When they lifted the embargo, though, they lifted it \nonly in principle. The Russian bureaucracy, with or without the \napproval of the central authorities, continues to delay and limit \nimports of chicken parts.\n  Let me explain what I mean. You have to have an importer in Russia to \naccept the chickens when they get there. They changed the law, and said \nno more embargo, but--guess what--all importers have to get new \nlicenses. Now we cannot ship from Delaware, Allen Chickens or Perdue \nChickens or Tyson Chickens, any chicken parts to Russia unless we are \nsending them to someone who is going to accept them.\n  You have to have an importer's license. Guess what. If you lift an \nembargo, but if you limit or do not give a license to somebody with \nwhom I can deal, then I am still out of the market.\n  Now, Russian officials and Russian parliamentarians and members of \nthe Russian Senate are very frank with me in my meetings. They have \nsaid that the reason this is the way it is, is pure bribery--pure, \nunadulterated bribery and that the oligarchs have a piece of the \naction.\n  There are only a couple of chicken outfits in Russia. I am serious, I \nam not joking about this. As long as imported chicken parts do not come \nin, the price of chicken goes up. The oligarchs, who own and purchase \nthose chickens, those chicken dealers--what happens? make money. As \nlong as they can keep this dragging on, they are making money.\n\n  So, in my view, it is possible that this isn't something that is \nbeing coordinated at the highest levels. But the bottom line is that \nresponsible governments have to react.\n  Last year, Russia imported $630 million worth of chickens from the \nUnited States--8 percent of all U.S. poultry exports. Russian suppliers \nhave not been able to fill that gap, and as a result, many Russian \nconsumers, mostly pensioners who cannot afford the higher prices for \nRussian chicken, are suffering. Right now, other countries are moving \nin to take over this lucrative market from our own U.S. suppliers. This \nmove is a direct contradiction to Russia's professed desire to join the \nworld community of fair trade practices and a slap at our efforts to \nwork with Russia in gaining accession into WTO.\n  As everyone in this Chamber knows, I am a strong supporter of good \nrelations with Russia and its President, the first leader since Peter \nthe Great to look as far west as he has.\n  I support and commend every effort the administration is making to \nsupport good working relations with Russia, including the discussion \nthat will start in Moscow tomorrow.\n  I met with Condoleezza Rice before they left for an extended period \nof time to discuss this. I am chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I have been one of the guys criticized on this floor for \nbeing too supportive of Russia. But before I can support taking steps, \nof any form, to lift trade limits on Russia, I want to make sure they \nhave their act in order, and make sure Russia's commitment to fair and \nopen trade and the rule of law is in the works.\n  Now, look, let me make something clear to you: You put a ban on \nAmerican chicken. You then lift the ban. You then make it difficult or \nimpossible to get a license to move in, but you give other people \nlicenses to move in. We lose the market.\n  This is not like the drug companies in the State of my friend from \nNew Jersey, or the drug companies in my State of Delaware. If they put \na ban on our stuff, we have patents, so they can't get it from anywhere \nelse. We don't lose the market. We lose the profit margin. We lose the \nmarket temporarily, but we don't lose it permanently.\n  This is a big deal. This is a multibillion-dollar deal, over time, to \nus. So I want to let everybody know, I can either be Russia's best \nfriend or worst enemy. And if they keep fooling around like this, they \nare going to have me as their worst enemy.\n  This resolution expresses a sense of the Senate that supports \nterminating the application of Jackson-Vanik to Russia in an \n``appropriate and timely manner.'' I am the guy who has been pushing \nthat for a year--when the Russians are acting appropriately.\n  But I tell you what. In my view, it will only be appropriate to act \non such legislation when it is clear that Russia is living up to its \nbilateral trade agreements and arrangements with the United States. I \nam not talking about trade disputes. I am not talking about legitimate \ntrade disputes. I want them not only to live up to the letter of the \nlaw, but to the spirit of the law. Only then, only when we can be sure \nRussia is committed to adhering to commitments already made, should we \ngraduate Russia from Jackson-Vanik, which in principle, I think we \nshould.\n  I am convinced we will be able to do that because I am convinced that \nPresident Putin has gotten the message. And I was told personally that \nthe President of the United States of America is going to raise this \nissue. Tomorrow it begins. He is going to raise this issue personally \nwith the President of Russia.\n  So I will be happy, at the appropriate time, to be one of those who \nmoves for Russia's graduation out of Jackson-Vanik. But I am not going \nto do that, as one Senator--and I think the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee--unless the Russians begin to act appropriately.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence, and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n\n[[Page S4685]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Senator Kennedy and I are going to be \ninvolved in a colloquy for a couple of minutes as we await another \namendment. It pertains to the minimum wage. I will have a unanimous \nconsent request that I will propound in a moment.\n  As we are debating new trade practices, we must not forget important \nprotections for America's workers. Many of these protections are \naddressed through the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act, but for the last \n60 years there has been another important protection for workers, and \nthat is the minimum wage.\n  It has now been over 6 years since Congress voted to increase the \nminimum wage. In that time, the cost of living has increased 12 percent \nwhile the real value of the minimum wage has steadily declined. In \nfact, by 2003, all of the gain achieved through the last increase will \nhave been wiped out.\n  Today, minimum wage employees working 40 hours a week 52 weeks a year \nearn only $10,700--more than $4,000 below the poverty line for a family \nof three.\n  In the last 6 years, the purchasing power of the minimum wage has \ndeteriorated to near record low levels. Teacher's aides and health care \nworkers are among the hard-working Americans who are unable to make \nends meet on a $5.15 per hour wage.\n  In fact, the current minimum wage does not provide enough income to \nallow full-time workers to afford adequate housing in any area of the \ncountry. In my State of South Dakota, the minimum wage is hardly enough \nfor a family to make ends meet.\n  According to the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, a minimum \nwage earner can afford a monthly rent of no more than $268. In South \nDakota, a worker earning the minimum wage must work 79 hours a week in \norder to afford a typical two-bedroom apartment. In fact, estimates \nshow that for a worker to be able to afford a two-bedroom apartment in \nSouth Dakota, they would have to earn $10.12--nearly 200 percent of the \npresent minimum wage.\n  That is why we need to pass Senator Kennedy's new minimum wage \nlegislation. It would provide a $1.50 increase over the next 2 years. \nThis is the least we can do, and it is long overdue.\n  By increasing the minimum wage by $1.50, working families will \nreceive an additional $3,000 per year in income. While this increase \nwould not be enough to lift the family of three above the poverty line, \nit would provide the resources to buy over 15 months of groceries, 8 \nmonths of rent, 7 months of utilities, or tuition at a two-year \ncommunity college. The reality is that American workers are working \nharder and harder for less and less.\n  It is time for Congress to address the needs of America's working \nfamilies. It is time to act and raise the minimum wage.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wonder if the majority leader would be \nkind enough to yield for a few questions.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, now we are dealing with the trade bill \nwhich will provide benefits, obviously, to many corporations. We also \nought to think of the workers, especially those workers at the bottom \nrung of the economic ladder.\n  I listened with interest to the Senator from South Dakota. As the \nSenator pointed out, if we fail to increase the minimum wage, which has \nnot been increased in 6 years, the purchasing power of the minimum wage \nwill near an all-time low.\n  All we are trying to do is bring it up a little bit, which would be \ngenerally below what the average has been over recent years.\n  Is the Senator aware that if we fail to act with an increase in the \nminimum wage, it will be virtually at an all-time low if we don't act \nthis year?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is not as well known as I wish it were. But how \nironic it would be if in the same Congress that passed tax breaks for \nthose at the very top--tax breaks worth $50,000 a year to those in the \ntop 1 percent--we could not do something to address the needs of those \nat the lowest end of the income scale.\n  I certainly appreciate the graphic depiction of the trend of the \nminimum wage which the Senator from Massachusetts has outlined. That is \nthe whole idea behind this legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to ask the Senator a further question. Does \nthe Senator not agree with me that for years this body--Republicans and \nDemocrats--thought that people who worked 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of \nthe year should not have to live in poverty in the United States? Does \nthe Senator understand now that the minimum wage is well below the \npoverty line for working families?\n  Some will say we have an earned-income tax credit. But still the fact \nis for a single mom, or even for families of three, they are still well \nbelow the poverty line.\n  Does the Senator not agree with me, as I believe most Democrats do, \nthat work ought to pay and that those individuals who work 52 weeks of \nthe year, 40 hours a week should at least be at a poverty line, not a \nliving wage even, but a poverty line?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the answer to that would be emphatically \nyes, especially given the stated desire of Members of Congress who have \npassed welfare reform. The whole idea behind welfare reform was to make \nwork pay, to make work more palatable than welfare. But it is hard for \nme to understand how a head of household can see how work pays when \nthey are working for the minimum wage, 52 weeks a year, 40 hours a week \nand earning only $10,700 a year.\n  That is why we have people in South Dakota--and I am sure in \nMassachusetts--working two and three jobs. That is why we are concerned \nabout the pressures on families these days. It is hard to raise \nchildren, and it is hard to address all of the other familial \nresponsibilities if you are working two and three jobs a week in an \neffort to rise above that poverty line that the Senator's chart \nillustrates.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Of course, I believe the increase in the minimum wage is \na women's issue because the majority of those earning the minimum wage \nare women. It is a children's issue because so many of those women have \nchildren. It is a civil rights issue because great numbers of those who \nreceive the minimum wage are men and women of color, and it is a \nfairness issue.\n  In looking over the historic increases that have been enacted by the \nCongress since 1956, the proposal is an increase of $1.50--60 cents the \nfirst year, 50 cents the next year, and 40 cents. This represents in \nthe bar chart what the percentage increase would be going back to 1956. \nIt will be actually one of the lowest over the period of the next 3 \nyears.\n  When the Senator propounds his unanimous consent request, we will \nprobably hear those who will say this is new legislation when we talk \nabout an increase in the minimum wage. We haven't had a chance to study \nit. This is something that sort of takes us by surprise.\n  Will the Senator not agree with me that this issue is as old as the \n1930s, effectively, when we first enacted the minimum wage, and that \nthis proposal of $1.50 over 3 years is actually a very modest proposal \nindeed?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is absolutely right. Not only is it modest \nbut it is overdue.\n\n[[Page S4686]]\n\n  As I noted in my opening comments, it has been 6 years since we \npassed an increase in the minimum wage. During that time, as the \nSenator's chart illustrates, the minimum wage has dramatically \ndeclined. The number of hours people have to work goes up and the real \nvalue of the money they receive goes down.\n  More and more people are faced with the prospect of taking two and \nthree jobs in order to climb above that poverty line, at the very time, \nironically, when we say that we want work to pay to ensure that they do \nnot go back to welfare.\n  So I compliment the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership in \nthis effort and, again, reiterate that the moderate increase that he is \nproposing is one that is in keeping with past precedent here in the \nCongress; and it certainly recognizes the need to do something this \nyear.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the majority leader will yield, I thank the leader \nfor the excellent presentations he made this evening on this issue, as \nwell as the excellent speech he made earlier today.\n  He mentioned that $3,000 may not mean a lot to Members of Congress \nwho have had four pay increases since the last increase in the minimum \nwage, but for a minimum wage worker it means 15 months of groceries, 8 \nmonths of rent, 7 months of utilities, or full tuition for a community \ncollege.\n  This is, as the majority leader pointed out, a family issue. It \nrepresents, to those children, the value of work. And it is a fairness \nissue.\n  I thank the majority leader. I hope there will not be objection to \nthe proposal he is about to make.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask, therefore, unanimous consent that \nthe majority leader, after consultation with the Republican leader, may \nturn to the consideration of S. 2538, the minimum wage increase bill; \nthat the Senate proceed to its consideration no later than the close of \nbusiness, June 24; and that it be considered under the following time \nlimitation: That there be one amendment for each leader, or their \ndesignee, dealing with minimum wage/taxes; that no other amendments or \nmotions be in order, except possible motions to waive the Budget Act; \nand that no points of order be waived by this agreement; that upon the \ndisposition of these amendments, the bill be read a third time, and the \nSenate vote on final passage of the bill, without any intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first of all, we are here debating the \ntrade bill that is all about trying to raise wages. It is interesting, \nin looking at Senator Kennedy's charts, that in the period where the \nminimum wage was not raised, the number of children living in poverty \ndeclined by 20 percent in America.\n  How did that happen? The Government did not raise the minimum wage. \nYet we had, in a decade, a precipitous decline in the number of \nchildren and people living in poverty.\n  How is it possible for people to escape poverty without the minimum \nwage being increased? It is possible because of economic growth. There \nare many people in this Chamber who have worked at the minimum wage--\nbut they didn't work at it long. A minimum wage job is a steppingstone \ntoward economic progress and success in America.\n  The plain truth is, we are debating a bill that is more important to \nworking people making low incomes than any minimum wage law that has \never been adopted by any legislative body in history. This bill is \nabout trade, which creates jobs. The average job generated through \ntrade pays wages that are almost 20 percent higher than wages in the \nother jobs in the American economy.\n  In dealing with this pro-high-wage bill, we are asked to consider a \nmeasure we have never seen; that is not on the calendar; that, as far \nas I know, has never been introduced; that is not relevant or germane \nto this debate.\n\n  So I have to say, it is hard for me to take this request seriously, \nthough I would say to Senator Kennedy that we would love to stay and \nhear him speak on this at length. If he would like to have time set \naside from this debate to talk about minimum wage, it is a subject \nwhere certainly we have people who are interested in it, who could \nalways be enlightened, who would enjoy hearing Senator Kennedy talk \nabout it. I would like to do something about wages by passing this \ntrade bill because I think it will do more for people making low \nincomes than any wage law we could pass.\n  Let me also say, I have never understood minimum wage laws. If they \nreally work, if we could just pass a law and make wages what we want \nthem to be, why not make wages $1 million an hour? Then people who need \nmany millions of dollars could work all week and be very rich, and \npeople who need only one million dollars could work 1 hour and be rich.\n  But there is a problem. And the problem is something you learned in \nthe third grade: anything times zero is zero. The cruel hoax of minimum \nwage laws is, by setting artificially high wages, it prevents people \nfrom getting their foot on the first rung of the economic ladder. It \nprevents them from getting into the most effective training program in \nhistory: on-the-job training.\n  I wonder, if we had the kind of minimum wage that the Senator from \nMassachusetts is talking about when I was out trying to get jobs--jobs \nwith the Tom Houston Peanut Company, throwing the Columbus Ledger \nInquirer and working for Kroger Grocery Store--I might have been \nprotected right out of a job. I did not appear to have any skills, and \nin fact I did not have any skills.\n  But I learned great things in those jobs. The most important skill \nthat I acquired was the knowledge that I did not want to do those \nthings for a living.\n  So we would certainly love to hear about this. My colleague is here \nfrom Utah. I think he would like to have something to say about it. But \nwe would be perfectly willing to debate this subject tonight at any \nlength that the Senator from Massachusetts would like to talk about it.\n  But at the end of the talk, we want action. And the action we want is \npassing this trade bill because it is going to create new jobs at high \nwages, with great futures. It is going to share the American dream with \nmore people than have ever had it before, with people who missed it the \nfirst time around. We are excited about it. And it is going to happen \nsince we have a certain amount of time that has to run off the clock \nnow. So if people want to debate minimum wage, we do not object to \ndebating it. We just want to deal with this trade bill first because we \nbelieve it will do more good.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, the Senator, as I understand from his comments, is \nprepared to debate it, but he is going to object to any consideration \nto give the Senate of the United States an opportunity to act on it \nprior to the July recess, as I understand it.\n  Am I correct in understanding the Senator's position, that he would \nwelcome the discussion and debate, but he objects to any action on the \nbill--the Senator was glad to ensure that there was going to be voting \non the questions of the trade bill in support for the cloture earlier \ntoday to make sure we were going to vote on a trade bill. But, as I \nunderstand the Senator's position, he objected to the majority leader's \nrequest to permit the Senate to vote on the issue of the minimum wage?\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reclaiming my time, let me say his problem is not with me \nbut with the fact that we are on a trade bill of which almost 70 \nMembers of the Senate voted for cloture, saying they want to get on \nwith passing this trade bill to create more jobs, more growth, more \nopportunities.\n  The Senator has proposed a measure which we have never seen, that he \nhas never filed, that is not on the calendar, that is not relevant or \ngermane. We are being asked to waive the rules of the Senate and delay \nthe creation of new jobs from trade for an amendment that is not in \norder today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield for a point, this is not being \noffered as an amendment. It is just a unanimous consent request. We \ntake action on it later on in the session. It was not an attempt to \noffer it as an amendment tonight.\n\n[[Page S4687]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me say that----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. But I understand the Senator has objected to that as \nwell.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We are in the minority here. You control the flow of \nlegislation. I don't understand why you are asking us for permission to \nbring up bills. All I know is we are here trying to pass a trade bill, \nand you are talking about another subject. The point I was making is \nthat thanks to the wisdom of our Members, we now have some--how many \nhours do we have postcloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-three hours.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Twenty-two hours?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-three hours.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Twenty-three hours. So we have ample time, if the Senator \nwants to talk about this issue, to do it. I know the Senator from Utah \nwants to say a word about it.\n  So I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Texas. I would say \nto the Senator from Massachusetts if he were still in the Chamber, I \nwould be happy to take action on his bill. The action I would seek to \ntake would be to kill it. That is effectively what we have done with \nour objection. But if the Senator from Massachusetts can get the \nmajority leader to bring it up in another place, I will be happy to \nvote to kill it in that place, too.\n  I do so not because I am hardhearted, not because I think the people \nwho are at the bottom of the economic ladder don't need help, not \nbecause I want to hurt them, but because I want to help them. I have \noften said that if I could control what we carve in marble around here, \nalong with the Latin mottos and the other statements we have, we should \nprobably have before us at all times the statement: You cannot repeal \nthe law of supply and demand.\n  We keep trying in government to repeal the law of supply and demand. \nWe keep trying to set prices or wages at a level different than the \nmarket. Well, I don't have the Ph.D. degree in economics my friend from \nTexas has, but I learned in Economics I that when government sets a \nprice different from where the market would set it, you get one of two \nthings: either a shortage or a surplus. If government sets the price on \na commodity and says, this is what we will pay for this commodity \nbecause everybody ought to have access to it, and they set the price by \nlaw too low, you get a shortage of that commodity because no one wants \nto produce it at that artificially low price.\n  We have seen that. Remember when there was price control on natural \ngas and there was an insufficient supply of natural gas. You got a \nshortage. When Ronald Reagan became President, he said: We are going to \nremove price controls on natural gas, and many people--I was not in the \nChamber so I can't tell you whether there are some who are still here \nwho were there at the time--said: Without price regulation, the price \nof natural gas will go through the roof.\n  Guess what happened. When we removed the artificial restraint on the \nprice of natural gas, it went up temporarily enough to get a lot of \npeople producing natural gas, and then it came down, ironically, to a \nprice below the price the Government had set, once the market forces \ntook over and people started producing natural gas. You can get a \nshortage or you can get a surplus.\n  I remember when my father was on the Banking Committee and the \nGovernment set the price of silver for silver coinage. It was higher \nthan the market would pay for silver, and the Government stockpile of \nsilver got bigger and bigger and bigger because people were producing \nsilver, not for the market but for the Government, at an artificially \nhigh price.\n  What does that have to do with the minimum wage? Simply this: If you \nset the price of unskilled labor by Government fiat at a place where \nthe market would not put it, you are going to create a shortage of \njobs. If Government guarantees a price of labor higher than the market, \nyou will get a surplus of people applying for those jobs. It is as \nsimple and as inexorable as that. You cannot repeal the law of supply \nand demand.\n  What segment of our economy has the highest level of unemployment? It \nis the inner cities, among African-American males of teen age. They \nhave the highest level of unemployment of any group measure in the \ncountry. Why? Because jobs in the inner city for teenagers who don't \nhave skills have been priced out of the market by minimum wage \nlegislation.\n\n  The Senator from Texas talked about his first experience. I went to \nwork at 50 cents an hour when I was 14 years old, and I had the same \nkind of experience the Senator did. I didn't need the money, but I \ncertainly needed the experience. It taught me the necessity of showing \nup on time. It taught me the necessity of being dependable, of doing \nthe kinds of things my supervisor wanted me to do whether I wanted to \ndo them or not. It got me involved in a way that I have found valuable \nall the rest of my life.\n  If the minimum wage, which was 40 cents an hour at the time--so I was \nabove the minimum wage by 10 cents--had been raised to 65 cents an \nhour, I would have lost my job. I wasn't worth 65 cents an hour to my \nemployer. Frankly, I was barely worth 50. I would have lost my job.\n  I cannot understand why some people insist that the poor are better \noff unemployed at a high rate than working at a slightly lower rate. \nBut that is what we have; that is where we are.\n  We are talking about this trade bill. We are saying it will help the \nAmerican economy. At the time when the economy was doing perhaps its \nbest, during the 1990s, and Alan Greenspan came before the Banking \nCommittee, a Senator asked him: In these boom times, Mr. Chairman, who \nis benefiting the most from America's prosperity?\n  I could tell by the way the Senator framed the question that he \nexpected Greenspan to say ``the people at the top'' because the Senator \nwas particularly concerned about what he considered to be an improper \ngap between the people at the top and the people at the bottom, and he \nwas going to use Greenspan's answer to make a case for raising the \nminimum wage: The people at the top have gotten well, the people at the \ntop have gotten fat in this time of great economic prosperity; it is \nthe people at the bottom we need to help.\n  I could tell that was the attitude of the Senator as he asked the \nquestion. He was disappointed in Greenspan's answer. Greenspan replied: \nUnquestionably, Senator, it is the people at the bottom who have \nbenefited from this economic boom.\n  My memory tells me he said the bottom fifth because, being an \neconomist, he always has to quantify everything. So it was the people \nin the bottom quintile, to use an economist's phrase, who had benefited \nthe most from the economic boom.\n  Then the dialog went back and forth between Chairman Greenspan and \nthe Senator, with the Senator saying: Yes, but the people at the top \nhave gotten these enormous financial rewards by virtue of the good \neconomy.\n  Chairman Greenspan said: Yes, that is true, if you measure the \nbenefit solely in dollars. However, if you measure the benefit in terms \nof life impact, the people at the bottom, who have had a 40-, 50-, 60-\npercent blessing in their lives by virtue of the fact that the economy \nis creating jobs for them, their life has been impacted far more than a \nmillionaire who was at $2 million net worth and then saw his net worth \ngo to $3 million. His lifestyle doesn't change much. His life \ncircumstances don't change, if at all. He has more money to invest, and \nwe hope he invests it in a way that will further stimulate the economy, \nbut in terms of what happens in his life, nothing really changes by \nvirtue of his increase in net worth. But someone who could not get a \njob or who couldn't see his job increase because the economy was flat, \nnow in these times of prosperity can get a job and can see his \nopportunities increase.\n  I remember in those times when I talked to employers in the State of \nUtah and I would ask them: What is your biggest problem?\n  They said: We can't find anybody to hire. The economy is so good that \neverybody can get a job.\n  I had one employer say to me: We will hold a mass job interview. We \nwill advertise in the paper, and 15 or 20 people come in to listen to \nour pitch as to why they should come to work for us. We will start \nthrough our explanation of what this job is, and half of them will get \nup and walk out because they\n\n[[Page S4688]]\n\nknow they can walk down the street and hear somebody else's pitch and \nthey can pick and choose. Our problem is, because the economy is so \ngood and there are so many jobs, we are having hard times even filling \nthe entry-level jobs.\n  Right now, the economy is not so good. Right now, we don't have \nemployers who are complaining about that problem. And right now is not \nthe time to artificially price those entry-level jobs out of the market \nby attempting to repeal the law of supply and demand.\n\n  Who will get hurt the most by an increase in the minimum wage? Ross \nPerot won't get hurt. Donald Trump won't get hurt. The people at the \ntop won't be affected one way or the other. It is the person who is \nworking for today's minimum wage, whose economic benefit to his \nemployer would not justify the proposed minimum wage, who gets laid \noff. That is who gets hurt. It is the people at the bottom whom we are \ntrying to help, who will, ironically, suffer the most if the minimum \nwage goes through.\n  I can take you to employers in my State who laid people off the last \ntime the minimum wage went up. Employers said: I simply cannot justify \nit anymore. I would like to pay them, I would like to have them working \nfor me. But, frankly, the economic return I get from them is not worth \nit when the minimum wage goes up. I am going to lay them off. I can get \nthe same job done with mechanization or some other device, or I can \nsimply do without it in my business. It is just not worth it to me to \npay that much.\n  So those people walked off the job into the unemployment lines, with \nthe cold comfort that their nominal rate was now 50 cents or 75 cents \nhigher than it had been. They were not collecting it, but at least they \nhad the warm feeling of knowing the Government determined that was what \nthey were worth.\n  The market determines who gets hired. The market determines who gets \npaid. We cannot repeal the law of supply and demand.\n  So I say again, the Senator from Massachusetts says he wants action \non this bill and he is disturbed that we are not willing to take \naction. I would be willing to take action, and the action I would want \nto take for the benefit of the people at the bottom, for the benefit of \nthe African-American teenagers in inner cities who cannot get work, for \nthe benefit of those who are just trying to start out, would be to say \nlet's kill this bill, let's take care of the people at the bottom the \nbest way we can, but one of the things we should not do is price their \njobs out of the market and put them in the unemployment lines.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/22/senate-section/article/S4688-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4688-S4695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE EXPANSION ACT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is amendment No. 3447 my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. The pending amendment is the second-degree amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will speak on the first-degree amendment.\n  Mr. President, there can be little doubt that the various agencies of \nthe executive branch are increasingly in the driver's seat on the \nimportant matter of trade. Meanwhile, the Congress and the American \npeople are merely being brought along for the ride.\n  There are many reasons for this growing inequity, not the least of \nwhich is the willingness--at times, in fact, the eagerness--of this \nbody to give us its rights and responsibilities under the Constitution. \nThe Constitution mandates to the legislative branch--the people's \nbranch--authority over foreign trade matters. It cannot, however, force \nthe institution to exercise this authority and assert itself in trade \nmatters. That requires the will of the Members. The lessons we have \nlearned from our most recent experiences with trade agreements should \nbe incentive enough for us to insist on our rights with regard to trade \nmatters. We, after all, represent communities that have lost businesses \nto other countries and families who have lost their jobs to foreign \nfirms.\n  Yet here we are, once again, considering a measure that further ties \nthe hands of the members of this institution in the area of trade. \nPerhaps even worse, we are continuing a trend of blinding ourselves to \nthe details of the trade agreements on which we must ultimately vote. \nIt is almost as if we don't want to know,\n  At the very least, we should do more to lift the veil on trade \nnegotiations so that we have some idea as to what it is this Nation is \nsigning up to when the agreements go into effect. But to do so we need \nto establish the means for Members to participate more broadly, and in \nmore detail, in important trade negotiations, as well as to carry out \nthe important oversight functions that our complex trade laws require.\n  The fast track bill now before the Senate opens that door. The bill \nestablishes the Congressional Oversight Group to serve as an official \nadviser to\n\n[[Page S4689]]\n\nthe U.S. Trade Representative on matters that include the formulation \nof specific trade objectives and negotiating strategies, the \ndevelopment of new trade agreements, and the enforcement of existing \ntrade agreements.\n  The establishment of the Congressional Oversight Group is intended to \nhelp the legislative branch play a more substantial role in trade \nnegotiations, but as laid out in this legislation it does not go quite \nfar enough.\n  As established by the bill, the Congressional Oversight Group will be \ncomprised of five Senators, each of whom must serve on the Finance \nCommittee, five Members of the House of Representatives, each of whom \nmust serve on the Ways and Means Committee, and, on an ad hoc basis, \nthe chairman and ranking members of the various committees of the House \nand Senate that would have jurisdiction over provisions in the trade \nagreement that is under negotiation. This select group, of perhaps as \nfew as 10 Members of Congress, would then be given the authority, under \nlaw, to advise the U.S. Trade Representative on important matters of \ninternational commerce. Choosing members of the Finance and Ways and \nMeans Committees was a logical move on the part of the authors of this \nprovision. These are committees with, perhaps, the greatest degree of \nexpertise in trade matters. But our trade negotiators, and the American \npeople, should have the greater benefit of the breadth of expertise \nthat can be offered by a more diverse representation of the Congress.\n  Mr. President, in some respects, the Senate has already gone over \nthis territory. We have the National Security Working Group to assist \nthe Foreign Relations Committee and the Armed Services Committee with \nreviewing important arms control agreements. The National Security \nWorking Group is not a replacement for those communities, but it is a \nuseful back channel between the legislative and executive branches \nduring the early stages of arms control negotiations, just as the \nCongressional Oversight Group is intended to do for trade negotiations. \nBut the National Security Working Group has functioned well because its \nmembership is not limited to those Senators who serve on the committees \nof jurisdiction. The National Security Working Group has 20 members, \neight of whom serve on neither the Armed Services Committee or the \nForeign Relations Committee. Indeed, one of the group's greatest \nstrengths is that it draws its membership from the whole Senate, rather \nthan just one committee.\n\n  The amendment I offer expands the Congressional Oversight Group to 22 \nmembers, selected from the membership of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives who do not serve on the Finance Committee in the Senate \nor the Ways and Means Committee in the House. Just as with the National \nSecurity Working Group, the leadership of each House of Congress will \nserve on this panel. In addition, the leadership of each House will \nselect eight additional members to complete the Congressional Oversight \nGroup. It also authorizes expenses for Senate staff, so that the group \ncan follow the negotiations of trade agreements on a full-time basis, \nnot just as the schedules of the members of the group allow.\n  The changes that I propose to the composition of the Congressional \nOversight Group as established in the fast-track bill do not in any way \ndetract from the consultations between the administration and the \ncongressional committees of jurisdiction. The Trade Act of 1974 \nestablished a process for consultation between the congressional \ncommittees of jurisdiction and the executive branch. At the beginning \nof each Congress, the President pro tempore of the Senate is directed \nto appoint, after consultation with the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, five members of that committee to work with the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative during the negotiation of trade agreements. The Speaker \nof the House is also directed to make appointments for members of the \nHouse committees of jurisdiction to serve in the same advisory role.\n  The U.S. Trade Representative is directed to keep these congressional \nadvisors ``currently informed on the trade policy of the United \nStates,'' and make these advisors aware of any proposed changes to our \ntrade policy. This is the mechanism by which the members of the \ncommittees of jurisdiction can remain informed of the progress in \nnegotiating fast-track agreements.\n  My amendment prevents the congressional Oversight Group from being a \nredundant entity, as it currently is configured in the fast-track bill, \nand expands it to include a broader group of members of Congress in \nboth Houses who are interested in trade, but do not serve on the \nFinance Committee or the Ways and Means Committee. The amendment does \nnot elevate the Congressional Oversight Group above the status of the \ncommittees of jurisdiction on trade matters. In fact, my amendment \nspecifically directs that any meetings that are open to the \nCongressional Oversight Group shall also be open to congressional \nadvisers for trade policy.\n  Because trade agreements encompass so many issues, including labor \nprotections and environmental standards, as well as adjustments to our \nown trade rules, all committees with jurisdiction should be fully \nconsulted at all stages of negotiations on a new trade agreement. But \nmany Senators who do not serve on the committees of jurisdiction also \nhave great interest in our trade laws and they can offer significant \ncontributions. These Senators should have the opportunity to receive \nsimilar consultations. The Congressional Oversight Group, as laid out \nby my amendment, would allow these Senators with an interest in trade \nmatters to be fully informed of the progress of negotiations.\n  The fast-track procedure for considering trade bills turns the \nlegislative process on its head. It forbids Senators from offering \namendments, even for the purpose of clarifying the intent of the \nagreement in question. The fast-track procedures limit the time that a \ntrade agreement could be debated, as if Senators should not be given \nthe time to learn what is really in the agreement.\n  In that case, the only Senators who would really know what a trade \nagreement does, and why it needs to be done, are those Senators who \nparticipate during the negotiation of those agreements. Right now, only \nfive Senators have been appointed to be congressional trade advisors to \nthe U.S. Trade Representative, and every one of those Senators serves \non the Committee on Finance. It is all well and good to draw upon the \nexpertise of the members of the Finance Committee, but what about the \nrest of us?\n  At what point will we, who do not serve on the Finance Committee, be \nmade aware of the progress of trade negotiations? When will those \nMembers of the Senate who are not on the committees of jurisdiction \nhave an opportunity to see that the interests of our States are \nprotected by a trade agreement? Is it when the agreement is signed, \nsealed, and delivered to Congress for an up-or-down vote? Or are we, as \nthe elected representatives of the people, entitled to have our input \non these trade agreements while there is still an opportunity to do so?\n  In an increasingly global marketplace, the ramifications of trade \nnegotiations are undoubtedly reaching into the smallest crevices of our \neconomy. The types of industries, the numbers of businesses, and every \nAmerican's everyday concerns that are being impacted by foreign trade \nare real and constantly growing. The consultation of a broader number \nof Senators on potential trade agreements will more adequately and \nappropriately address the pervasive influence of foreign trade on \nAmerica today. My amendment to change the composition of the \nCongressional Oversight Group will help end the exclusive nature of \ntrade consultations. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from West Virginia will yield for \na question.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. First, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a \ncosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the Senator from West Virginia has \noffered a very sound proposal to this so-called fast-track legislation. \nI was wondering if the Senator from West Virginia, who has been in this \nChamber a long while, knows of circumstances where other\n\n[[Page S4690]]\n\nthings have been given ``fast track'' treatment in ways that help \nordinary folks.\n  Has the Senator from West Virginia been aware of circumstances where, \nfor example, legislation that affects ordinary Americans is given fast-\ntrack authority to be considered here?\n  Mr. BYRD. No, no.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How about the disputes against unfair foreign trade \npractices that the steel industry raises or that family farmers or \ntextile manufacturers raise--do the disputes they deem they need to \nbring because they are victims of unfair trade get fast-tracked or do \nthey get slow-tracked?\n  Mr. BYRD. No, they get slow-tracked.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will agree that, while fast track \nis making new agreements and shoving them through the Congress with no \namendments, efforts to correct the problems in trade that are faced by \nso many American workers and so many businesses cannot get any action, \nlet alone slow-track; they get no movement at all. Is that not the \ncase?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is the case, precisely.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, it is ever more important that the \nSenator's amendment be approved. To the extent Congress is going to \nprovide so-called fast-track authority, we need people looking over the \nshoulders of those who are going to negotiate these trade agreements.\n  I was in a room in Montreal when the United States-Canada Free Trade \nAgreement was negotiated. It did not do much good, frankly. I went \nthere and heard what the negotiator had to tell us, but it was not part \nof the negotiations. When I got back here, I discovered that which was \nnegotiated behind the scenes in a secret agreement did not come out \nuntil 2 years later, much to the detriment of American farmers.\n  Senator Byrd is on the right track saying if fast track is going to \nhappen--and I do not support fast track--but if it is going to happen, \nin future negotiations, let's have more people looking over the \nshoulders of those who are negotiating on behalf of our country.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I rise as a cosponsor of Senator Byrd's \namendment, and I wish to express my support for this amendment, if my \nvoice will let me do so.\n  I am very proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment. It is a very \nimportant improvement to this legislation. I particularly believe those \nwho found the Dayton-Craig amendment to be anathema should look at this \nvery closely, welcome it, and support it, as should all of my \ncolleagues.\n  It does provide, as the Senator from North Dakota just said \ncorrectly, an ongoing involvement of the Members of both the House and \nthe Senate in these negotiations. If we are going to be asked to \napprove these agreements on an expedited basis when they come to us, \nthen I think it is essential we have this opportunity to participate.\n  The Byrd amendment provides us with a group, the staff, and resources \nnecessary to make qualified judgments. That is an essential role if we \nare going to have a true partnership with the executive branch.\n  I note the Constitution of the United States, which the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia knows so well, ascribes to the legislative \nbranch the sole authority for governing trade negotiations and all \naspects of trade. It does not mention the executive branch. Certainly \nthat responsibility has been devolving to a shared relationship, but it \nis certainly not one this branch could responsibly cede nor would it \nwant to cede.\n  I also point out that given the arrangements with the World Trade \nOrganization, which is still expanding its breadth and its reach, once \nrules have been established by that body, it is my understanding they \ncan only be changed by unanimous concurrence of all participating \ncountries, which means that once this country has given up to the World \nTrade Organization any of the laws or the protections that have been \nestablished for the benefit of the American people, we cannot \nunilaterally take them back, which makes it even more important that \nthe amendment of the Senator from West Virginia be passed to give the \nCongress that oversight and chance to anticipate ahead of time what the \nconsequences are going to be of some of these decisions.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Minnesota. I \nappreciate his willingness to cosponsor the amendment, and I value his \nassociation in the matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 3448 And 3449\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia controls 48 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I speak on amendments Nos. 3448 and 3449, which I \noffered earlier.\n  Madam President, for nearly 50 years I have worked to preserve the \ninstitutional integrity of the Senate and the House. Throughout this \nlong period, I have repeatedly and consistently opposed exactly the \ntype of fast-track provisions that are contained in this bill. During \nmy decades in the Senate, I have staunchly opposed fast-track because I \nbelieve it improperly delegates to the Executive Branch unwarranted and \nexcessive power over the regulation of foreign commerce. I have to say, \nhowever, that upon reviewing this bill, I find its provisions are some \nof the most offensive to date. This bill continues the sorry trend of \ngiving the President carte blanche to determine what will be contained \nin a series of trade agreements, and--except for the provisions on \ntrade remedies exempted by the Dayton-Craig amendment--deprives the \nSenate of any opportunity to amend these agreements in order to either \nimprove their provisions or correct any deficiencies they may contain.\n  This bill impedes the ability of the Senate to enact a resolution of \ndisapproval against a trade agreement that it finds objectionable. \nAlthough, at first glance, the bill appears to permit a Senator to \nintroduce a resolution of disapproval rejecting a trade agreement that \nis brought back to the Senate by the President, the reality is that \nsuch a resolution most probably would never come to the floor of the \nSenate for a vote.\n  This is because the bill states that, once a resolution of \ndisapproval is introduced and referred to the Senate Finance Committee, \nit will not be in order for the full Senate to consider the resolution \nif it has not been reported by that committee. In other words, a \ndisapproval resolution cannot be forced to the floor through a \ndischarge of the Senate Finance Committee. The way this bill is \ncurrently written, if a resolution of disapproval is not reported out \nof the Senate Finance Committee, it might as well never have been \nintroduced. The resolution simply languishes, and languishes, and \nlanguishes, and languishes.\n  This means that, so long as the Senate Finance Committee endorses the \nPresident's agreement, the views of the rest of the Senate are \nirrelevant. Enacting fast-track in this bill not only provides the \nPresident with unfettered authority to negotiate trade agreements, it \nalso prevents the Senate from exercising its constitutional \nresponsibility to reject or modify trade agreements that are not in the \nbest interests of the American people.\n  The Constitution in Article 1, Section 8, not only provides Congress \nwith the power to ``lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and \nexcises'' and to ``regulate commerce with foreign nations,'' but it \nalso gives the Congress the authority to enact all legislation that \n``shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the \nforegoing powers.'' This authority of the Congress to enact or to \nrefuse to enact legislation\n\n[[Page S4691]]\n\napplies specifically to the trade agreements that the President seeks \nto negotiate under fast-track.\n  It is imperative that every Senator retain his or her right to \nintroduce a resolution of disapproval that can be considered in the \nlight of day by the full Senate. The rules of the Senate exist not only \nto protect the rights of its Members. In fact, it should be said that \nthe rules and procedures exist to protect the rights of the people. \nThis body is uniquely structured to provide a voice and power to the \nminority. I repeat, the minority. And I remind my colleagues in this \nChamber that a minority can be right. The rules of this body, in fact, \nprovide each individual member with leverage, and each of us has a \nstake in ensuring that these rules are respected, and that procedural \nchanges of this type are only undertaken with great care and \nthoughtfulness.\n\n  To this end, I am introducing two amendments to require that, upon \nintroduction, any resolution of disapproval--including an extension \nresolution of disapproval--will be referred not only to the Senate \nCommittee on Finance, but also to the Senate Committee on Rules and \nAdministration. After all, it is the Rules Committee that is charged \nwith making the rules and procedures that govern this institution, and \nits expertise is essential to guarantee that the commitments undertaken \nby our trading partners in the trade agreements we negotiate are \nenforceable under U.S. law.\n  Under these amendments, each of these committees will be required to \nreport the resolution of disapproval that has been referred to it \nwithin 10 days of the date of its introduction and, if either of these \ncommittees fails to report the resolution of disapproval within that \ntime, either of these committees shall automatically be discharged from \nfurther consideration of the resolution. The resolution shall then be \nplaced directly on the Senate Calendar. Once the disapproval resolution \nis placed on the Senate Calendar, any Senator may make a motion to \nproceed to consider that resolution, and the motion to consider the \nresolution shall not be debatable.\n  The language in this bill and its accompanying report prohibiting a \nresolution of disapproval from being discharged from the Finance \nCommittee constitutes a sharp distortion of the Senate's rules that \nwould dramatically impede the rights of the 79 Members of the Senate \nwho happen not to serve on the Senate Finance Committee. In other \nwords, almost four-fifths of the Senate will have no say regarding \nwhether what the President has negotiated is right or wrong.\n  If enacted as currently written, this bill would effectively cut a \nmajority of Senators out of the trade regulation process, preventing \nthem from correcting sweeping changes in trade law that could unfairly \naffect the lives of their constituents who rely on the Senate to \nprotect their interests. It is not as if Senators, in recent years, \nhave had much of a say in trade matters. They have not. And what little \nvoice they have had has been suppressed, if not silenced, on too many \noccasions by this gimmick called fast-track, a gimmick now renamed \n``trade promotion authority.'' This legislation goes beyond fast-track \nin its impairment of the Senate's prerogatives.\n  I cannot support surrendering the rights and prerogatives, the duties \nand responsibilities of the Senate to any president of any political \nparty. We in the Congress have an obligation to strike down trade \nagreements that adversely affect the American people. But it is \nimpossible for us to do so if we do not provide ourselves the \nopportunity to adequately review, debate, amend, or reject their \nprovisions as we are rightly empowered to do under the Constitution of \nthe United States. These amendments ensure that we retain the power to \nmodify or reject trade agreements that are not in the best interests of \nthe majority of the people of the United States and, in so doing, \nprotect the economic well-being of the Nation and of the people we \nrepresent.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I support giving the President trade \npromotion authority, as the bill now before the Senate would do. It is \nessential that we work with President Bush to ensure that we break down \nbarriers and promote the sale of U.S. goods and services and \nagricultural commodities in other countries.\n  Export markets are absolutely necessary to assure the profitability \nof American agriculture. America's farmers are producing more but \nexporting less.\n  Last year, exports of U.S. farm products amounted to just over $50 \nbillion. That is a decrease from 5 years ago when we reached a high of \n$60 billion in foreign exports.\n  For our country to prosper, we must have access to foreign markets. \nThese markets not only help farmers; they help create jobs in \nprocessing industries, as well as transportation.\n  Tariffs in other countries against our farm products are too high. \nThey can be reduced through aggressive negotiation by our President. \nThe tariff on U.S. agricultural products averages over 60 percent \ncompared to under 5 percent on other domestic goods. If the President \nhad the authority to negotiate international trade agreements, farm \nreceipts would go up and not down as has been our recent experience.\n  One out of every three acres planted by farmers across America is \nintended for export. But because we aren't selling all we produce, \ncommodity prices are going down, and the agricultural sector is having \na very hard time making ends meet.\n  One of my State's biggest exports is poultry. The Mississippi broiler \nindustry, which is one of the largest in the Nation, accounts for 40 \npercent of all farm receipts in my State. That industry especially \nbenefits from trade agreements that prohibit quotas and reduce tariffs.\n  As a result of breaking down trade barriers on poultry, my State's \nexports to the Philippines, for example, have risen over 600 percent. \nThis is a clear reminder of the positive result we can obtain through \nfree trade agreements.\n  Throughout the world, there are about 150 different trade agreements \namong other countries. The United States is only partner to three of \nthem. For every market that is opened through country-to-country \nnegotiations, an opportunity is lost for America.\n  I urge the Senate to approve this trade promotion authority \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3543 To Amendment No. 3401\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nat this point that I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of myself \nand Senator Voinovich, an amendment to the Baucus substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself and Mr. \n     Voinovich, proposes an amendment numbered 3543 to amendment \n     No. 3401.\n       On page 228, line 21, insert after ``exports'' the \n     following: ``(including motor vehicles and vehicle parts)''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment with Senator \nVoinovich, my fellow co-chair of the Senate Auto Caucus and Senator \nStabenow. Our amendment would include in one of the listed principal \nnegotiating objectives of the United States to reduce trade barriers in \nother countries to U.S. motor vehicles and vehicle parts. Increasing \naccess for our products to markets which are closed or partially closed \nto us surely should be the objective of all of us.\n  Other countries have full access to our market for their autos and \nauto parts. The fast track provision we are considering makes it a \nprincipal negotiating objective to expand trade and reduce barriers for \ntrade in services, foreign investment, intellectual property, \nelectronic commerce, and agriculture, and other sectors. Yet the \nbiggest portion of our trade deficit is in\n\n[[Page S4692]]\n\nautos. In 2001, our automotive deficit made up over 31 percent of our \ntotal trade deficit with the world. In 2001, our automotive deficit was \n59 percent of our total trade deficit with Japan and 53 percent of our \ntotal deficit with Korea.\n  No omnibus trade bill should leave the Senate without addressing \nbarriers to our products which are the largest contributors to our \ntrade deficit. We can start by making opening foreign markets for U.S. \nautomotive products one of our principal negotiating objectives.\n  America's domestic auto industry is the largest manufacturing \nindustry in the United States. The domestic auto industry alone \ncontributes almost 4 percent to the total U.S. Gross Domestic Products. \nOur domestic auto manufacturers operate 52 manufacturing and assembly \nfacilities in 19 states around the country, and when auto parts \nmanufacturers are included, there is an automotive manufacturing \npresence in almost every state. The Big 3 automakers directly employ \nover 500,000 people in automotive-related jobs in the U.S. That number \ngrows by an additional 2 million jobs when you count automotive \nsuppliers and other related industries.\n  The auto industry is also a hi-tech manufacturing industry. It is one \nof the largest users of computers and the advanced technologies. It \nalso spends nearly $20 billion annually on research and development, \nmore than any other industrial sector in America. The U.S. auto \nindustry contributes mightily to our economic well being. Yet we \ncontinue to neglect it when it comes to insisting on fair market access \nfor exports of autos and auto parts.\n  The U.S. passenger vehicle market is the most open and competitive in \nthe world. But when we go to sell our autos and auto parts in foreign \nmarkets, we face significant trade restrictions. Some of the most \negregious practitioners of unfair trade in autos and auto parts are \nJapan and Korea. The sale of American vehicles and auto parts in Japan \nhas been blocked by protectionist measures such as government \nregulations dealing with vehicle certification, inspection, and repair. \nIn Korea, restrictions include a tax system that discriminates against \nimported vehicles by making them prohibitively expensive, \ndiscriminatory practices such as labeling foreign vehicles as ``luxury \ngoods,'' and the perception that the purchase of a foreign vehicle will \ntrigger a tax audit.\n\n  Since 1990, the U.S. automotive trade deficit with Japan has averaged \n55 percent of our total trade deficit with Japan. A 5 year market \nopening agreement in autos and auto parts that was largely a failure. \nThe U.S. automotive trade deficit with Korea has grown significantly \nsince 1995 despite two automotive market opening agreements with Korea.\n  Japan and Korea want it both ways. They want to keep a sanctuary \nautomotive home market that is protected from competition while they \nexport a significant portion of production to the United States.\n  We have been trying to open Japan's automotive markets for decades to \nno avail. In the mid-1980's we engaged in 8 years of Market Oriented \nSector Specific, MOSS, talks with Japan to try to open Japan's auto \nparts market. During that time, our auto parts deficit with Japan rose \nfrom $3.3 billion in 1985 to nearly $11 billion in 1992 despite modest \nincreases in sales by U.S. parts makers to the Japanese. The MOSS talks \nwere followed by Framework talks in autos and auto parts which led to a \n1995 U.S.-Japan Automotive Trade Agreement with the goal of increasing \nmarket access in Japan for U.S. autos and auto parts. That goal has not \nbeen achieved. Despite that fact, the Administration has allowed the \nAgreement to expire. Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan in \nautos and auto parts has gotten worse. The auto and auto parts trade \ndeficit was $32.9 billion in 1995. By the end of 2000 when the \nAgreement was allowed to expire, it was $44.2 billion, more than 60 \npercent of the overall U.S. trade deficit with Japan and 10 percent of \nthe worldwide U.S. trade deficit.\n  The U.S. government, in its annual Trade Barriers Report, \nacknowledges that it is disappointed with the access of North American-\nmade vehicles and parts to Japan.\n  When it comes to automotive trade between the United States and \nKorea, the numbers speak for themselves. South Korea has the most \nclosed market for imported cars and trucks in the developed world. \nWhile foreign vehicles account for only \\1/2\\ of one percent of its \ntotal vehicle market, Korea depends on open markets in other countries \nto absorb its auto exports. Korea exports half of all the passenger \nvehicles it produces, with many of those vehicles coming to the U.S. \nLast year, Korea imported only 7,747 vehicles from the United States \nand exported over 600,000 to our country.\n  This imbalance exists despite two separate automotive trade \nagreements between the United States and Korea which were supposed to \nopen Korea's market: the first in 1995 and the second in 1998. This \nimbalance is unfair to America and its workers and only threatens to \nget worse if we do not act immediately.\n  The amendment Senator Voinovich and I have introduced attempts to \naddress the gross inequities in market access for U.S. autos and auto \nparts among some of our major trading partners. Our amendment would \nmake market access for motor vehicles and vehicle parts a principal \nnegotiating objective of the Untied States. The underlying bill \nincludes 14 principal negotiating objectives and the Senate voted \noverwhelmingly to add textiles to that list. Since autos and auto parts \nare the largest part of our deficit, it is unacceptable that foreign \ntrade barriers that exclude U.S.-made passenger vehicles and auto parts \nfrom certain markets are allowed to exist. We must act to get rid of \nthose barriers.\n  Our amendment would make it a principal negotiating objective to \nexpand competitive market opportunities for U.S. motor vehicles and \nvehicle parts and to obtain fairer and more open conditions of trade by \nreducing or eliminating tariff and nontariff barriers.\n  The current trade situation in autos and auto parts is unfair to \nAmerica. We simply want access--to compete--no guarantees, just access. \nEvery nation in the world strives to have a successful automotive \nindustry and fights for that industry. We should do the same. The \nnearly 2.5 million men and women working in our nation's largest \nmanufacturing industry deserve nothing less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3543) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If there is no one else who seeks recognition at this \npoint----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to have recognition on another matter, on \nthe Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I may take 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, go ahead.\n  I thank my friend, Senator Grassley, for helping us to work out this \nmatter. As always, he is a gentleman and is accommodating. Again, we \nare very grateful for the effort he made to make this possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3447\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, is the regular order the Byrd amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the Hollings second-\ndegree amendment to the Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Would I be in order to speak on the Byrd underlying \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am strongly opposed to this amendment, \nfor two reasons.\n  First, the amendment would disrupt the bipartisan balance we achieved \nin the Finance Committee on Trade Promotion Authority. Republicans and \nDemocrats looked carefully at all the issues, especially the issues \nrelating to Congressional notification and consultation, and approved a \nbill that, overall, goes farther in terms of congressional oversight \nand consultation than we have ever gone in fast-rack legislation.\n  The second reason I oppose this amendment is that it would \nessentially\n\n[[Page S4693]]\n\nstrip the Finance Committee of much of its traditional authority and \njurisdiction over the trade policy oversight function.\n  According to this proposed provision, none of the proposed eight \nmembers of the Congressional Oversight Group may be members of the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n  Under this amendment, more than twenty percent of the Senate would be \nshut out from direct oversight of how trade negotiations subject to \nfast-track procedures are being conducted.\n  In that regard, this is a very radical amendment.\n  It strikes me as extremely unusual, to say the very least, that the \nFinance Committee, which wrote and passed the bipartisan trade \npromotion authority bill in the first place, would be given almost no \nrole whatever in the oversight process once trade promotion authority \nbecomes law.\n  I say almost no role, because some Finance Committee members--those \nfew who are congressional advisers for trade policy--would apparently \nhave some limited role, in that the cochairmen of the Congressional \nOversight Group are required to meet with them ``regularly''.\n  Mr. President, this is not the way that oversight of trade policy \nshould be conducted.\n  I don't believe that any member of a Senate Committee--especially the \nFinance Committee--should be automatically excluded from the entity \nthat the Senate establishes to review and monitor trade negotiations.\n  But that is exactly what this amendment does.\n  Do the proponents of this amendment mean that we can't trust Members \nof the Finance Committee to do the job the jurisdiction of their \ncommittee confers on them?\n  It appears that is exactly what this means.\n  This is not just bad policy.\n  Specifically excluding Senators from serving in any oversight \ncapacity would also set a terrible precedent.\n  The congressional oversight process that Senator Baucus and I \ndesigned in the bipartisan trade promotion authority bill is a good \none, and it should be preserved.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, hopefully, tomorrow, after a few \nrollcall votes on a few remaining amendments, we are going to have an \nopportunity to pass this bipartisan trade promotion authority act of \n2002. I would like to address the issue of the bill for a few minutes \nwhile we are waiting for final action by the Senate on how we proceed \ntomorrow.\n  This bill provides the President with the flexibility he needs to \nnegotiate strong international trade agreements on behalf of U.S. \nworkers and farmers while maintaining Congress's constitutional role \nover U.S. trade policy. It represents a thoughtful approach to \naddressing the complex relationships between international trade, \nworkers' rights, and the environment, without undermining the \nfundamental purpose and proven effectiveness of trade promotion \nauthority procedures.\n  Specifically, this bipartisan act gives the administration the \nauthority to negotiate and bring back trade agreements to Congress that \nwill eliminate and reduce trade barriers relating to manufacturing, \nservices, agriculture, intellectual property, investment, and e-\ncommerce.\n  The legislation supports eliminating subsidies that decrease market \nopportunities for U.S. agriculture or unfairly distort markets to the \ndetriment of the United States, with special emphasis on biotechnology, \nending unjustified barriers not based on sound science, and fair \ntreatment for import-sensitive agriculture.\n  The legislation preserves U.S. sovereignty while engaging new trade \nagreements that will create solid economic growth, improve efficiency \nand innovation, create better, high-paying jobs for hard-working \nAmericans that on average pay 15 percent above the average wage, and \nincreases the availability of attractively priced products into the \nU.S. market for the benefit of our consumers.\n  The legislation adds a trade negotiating objective on labor and the \nenvironment--very important provisions for many Members of this body. \nThis is done to ensure that a party to a trade agreement does not fail \nto effectively enforce its labor and environmental laws through a \nsustained or recurring course of action or inaction, recognizing a \ngovernment retains certain discretion.\n  It strengthens, under the labor and environmental provisions, the \ncapacity to promote respect for core labor standards and to protect the \nenvironment, to reduce or eliminate government practices or policies \nthat unduly threaten sustainable development, and it seeks market \naccess for U.S. environmental technologies, goods, and services.\n  The legislation adds a new negotiating objective on enforcement, \ngiving labor and environment disputes covered by the agreement parity \nwith other issues in the trade agreement.\n  It sets forth other Presidential priorities not covered by trade \npromotion authority, including greater cooperation between the World \nTrade Organization on the one hand, and the International Labor \nOrganization on the other hand, and consultative mechanisms among \nparties to trade agreements to strengthen the capacity of U.S. trading \npartners to promote respect for core labor standards and the \nenvironment, technical assistance on labor issues, and reporting on the \nchild labor laws of U.S. trading partners.\n  The legislation directs the President to take into account legitimate \nhealth, safety, essential security, and consumer interests. It directs \nthe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to preserve our ability to \nenforce vigorously U.S. trade remedy laws and avoid agreements which \nlessen the effectiveness of U.S. antidumping or countervailing duty \nlaws.\n  The legislation contains negotiating objectives on investment to \nincrease transparency for the dispute settlement process, calls for \nstandards of expropriation and compensation that are consistent with \nU.S. legal principles and practice, and eliminates frivolous claims.\n  The bill expands and improves consultations between the \nadministration and Congress before, during, and after trade \nnegotiations and particularly in the development of implementing \nlegislation.\n  The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Assistance Act provides trade \npromotion authority until June 1, 2005, with a possibility of a 2-year \nextension. I point this out because there is a misunderstanding that \nCongress is going to give all of its power to the President. We have \nthe consultation I talked about. Most importantly, whatever is agreed \nto by the President has to be passed by Congress as a law before any \nagreement can become effective. But we also do not give this power away \nto the President forever. This is the year 2002, almost June 1. So we \nare talking about the next 3 years with the possibility of a 2-year \nextension.\n  I happen to believe we ought to have standing trade negotiation \nauthority for the President, and we should not have these lapses that \nwe have had since 1994, but obviously the extent to which we give it \nfor shorter periods of time ought to satisfy more Members of this body \nthat we are not giving up our congressional power, which is a specific \ngrant in our Constitution that Congress shall regulate interstate and \nforeign commerce.\n\n  The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act also contains \nunprecedented procedures that ensure prompt, meaningful, and extensive \nconsultations with the Congress throughout the negotiating process. In \nother words, Members of this body and the other body are going to have \nample opportunity while the President is doing all this negotiating to \nhave reports given to us, feedback and, obviously, if Congress has to \npass a final product, the President, in negotiating a position for the \nUnited States, is going to have to take into consideration the views of \nMembers of Congress if the President wants to reach an agreement that \nwill eventually pass by a majority vote in both the House and Senate.\n\n[[Page S4694]]\n\n  In regard to this negotiation process and consultation therein, the \nbill establishes a congressional oversight group which is a broad-\nbased, bipartisan, and permanent institution to be accredited as though \nofficial advisers to the U.S. delegation to consult with the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative and provide advice regarding formulation of specific \nobjectives, negotiation strategies and positions, and development of \nthe final trade agreement.\n  This congressional oversight group would maximize bipartisanship and \ninput from Members from a broad range of committees comprising the \nchairman and ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, three \nadditional committee members, and also the chairman and ranking member, \nand their designees, of each committee with a jurisdiction over any law \naffected by trade agreements being negotiated.\n  The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Assistance Act also requires \ndevelopment of a written plan by the U.S. Trade Representative for \nconsulting with Congress throughout the negotiations. That plan must \ninclude provisions for regular and detailed briefings of the \ncongressional oversight group throughout the negotiations, access to \ndocuments relating to negotiations by members of the congressional \noversight group, and their designated staffs. There would be very close \ncooperation between the congressional oversight group and the U.S. \nTrade Representative at all critical periods of the negotiations, \nincluding at negotiation sites, after the agreement is concluded, \nconsultations regarding ongoing compliance and enforcement of \ncommitments under the agreement, and finally, transmittal of a report \nby the Secretary of Commerce to Congress on U.S. strategy for \ncorrecting World Trade Organization dispute settlement reports that add \nto obligations or diminish rights of the United States.\n  It also provides that the President provide Congress with a written \nnotice of intent to enter negotiations 90 days before initiating \nnegotiations, or as soon as feasible after enactment of trade promotion \nauthority; for negotiations already underway, including the intended \ndate for entering negotiations, specific U.S. objectives and statement \nof whether seeking new agreements or changes in the existing agreement; \nand that the President and the U.S. Trade Representative consult with \nCongress before initiating or continuing negotiations on agricultural \nproducts, fish and shellfish trade, textiles and apparel products.\n  Before and after negotiations begin, the President and U.S. Trade \nRepresentative must consult with Congress regarding the negotiations, \nand particularly the U.S. Trade Representative must consult with all \ncommittees with jurisdiction over laws that would affect an agreement.\n  Before and after negotiations begin, if a majority of the members of \nthe Congressional Oversight Committee request a meeting, the President \nhimself must meet with the group regarding the negotiations.\n  I have used the word ``consult'' many times. It is all reflected in \nthe legislation that Congress is very carefully guarding its \nconstitutional power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce, and \nwe are having a contract with the President of the United States, but \nthat contract is not a blank check to the President of the United \nStates. He keeps in constant touch with us as the words ``consulting'' \nand ``consultation'' and ``consult'' imply, legally binding that he do \nthat.\n  So I hope it is very clear we are not willy-nilly delegating some \npower to the President. Not at all. We are going to be a part of this \nprocess.\n  Now, people might ask why, if Congress is going to be a part of the \nprocess, are we having this contract with the President to negotiate \nfor us? It is because of the impossibility, and it ought to be very \nobvious, 535 Members of Congress not having the ability to be in Geneva \nor someplace else negotiating with 142 other countries on the issue of \nsome trade agreement. So we ask the President to do it.\n  I hope the emphasis upon consulting and Congress demanding that the \nPresident sit down at certain points during this process indicates \nthat, in fact, we are very selfishly guarding congressional \nresponsibility.\n  There is another part of notice and consultation that is required \nbefore actually entering into final trade agreements by the President, \nbefore it is actually signed in other words, because immediately after \ninitiating an agreement the U.S. Trade Representative must consult \nclosely with appropriate congressional committees, including the \ncongressional trade advisers, the congressional oversight group, and \nthe House and Senate Committees on Agriculture.\n  The President is required, at least 90 days before entering an \nagreement, to formally notify Congress of his intent to enter into an \nagreement and publish notice of such intent in the Federal Register. At \nthis time, the President must also notify the appropriate congressional \ncommittees of certain amendments proposed to be included in the \nimplementing bill and then provide the International Trade Commission \nwith details of the agreement so the ITC can prepare and submit an \nassessment of the likely impact of the agreement on the U.S. economy \nand specific industry sectors.\n  Before entering into an agreement, the President must consult with \nthe appropriate congressional committees and the congressional \noversight group regarding three matters: The nature of the agreement; \nthe extent to which the agreement meets congressional objectives as \noutlined in the bill before Congress right now; and the implementation \nof that agreement.\n  Both Houses of Congress have the ability, in the final analysis, as \nwe all know and as has been the practice for the last 25 years, to \ndisapprove an agreement by passing separate disapproval resolutions if \nthe administration fails or refuses to notify or consult with Congress \nin accordance with the bill that is before Congress right now that \nhopefully we will vote on tomorrow.\n  Another example of notice and consultation after a trade agreement is \nentered into: After the President signs it, as soon as practical after \nentering into an agreement, the President must submit a copy of the \nagreement to Congress along with statements or reasons that he had for \nentering into that agreement. The President is required, at least 60 \ndays after entering an agreement, to submit to Congress a description \nof the changes to existing laws that would be needed to comply with the \nagreement.\n\n  The President is also required to submit to Congress the final text \nof the agreement and provide an explanation of how the bill \nimplementing the agreement would change existing law, how the agreement \nmakes progress at achieving the Trade Promotion Authority Act's \nobjective, and also he must submit an implementation plan.\n  When that is all done, we then have to have notice and consultation \non an ongoing basis. The President must report to the appropriate \ncongressional committees on the mechanisms created among parties in the \nagreement to promote respect for core labor standards and to develop \nand implement sound environmental and health standards.\n  The President must also report on the required reviews of the impact \nof future trade agreements on the environment and U.S. employment. \nCongress may withdraw a trade promotion authority for failure to \nconsult. Disapproval resolutions can be introduced by any Senator and \nmay cover multiple agreements. Grounds for disapproval include failure \nto make progress in achieving the objectives that the bill has laid \nout.\n  Obviously, as I have stated before, none of this happens unless \nCongress gives approval by majority vote in both the House and the \nSenate to approve or disapprove these agreements negotiated under this \nbill that hopefully will pass tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the time until 10:30 a.m., May \n23d, tomorrow, count against the time provided under the cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4695]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/22/senate-section/article/S4688-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4688-S4695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE EXPANSION ACT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the pending question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 3527 to amendment No. 3447.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is amendment No. 3447 my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. The pending amendment is the second-degree amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will speak on the first-degree amendment.\n  Mr. President, there can be little doubt that the various agencies of \nthe executive branch are increasingly in the driver's seat on the \nimportant matter of trade. Meanwhile, the Congress and the American \npeople are merely being brought along for the ride.\n  There are many reasons for this growing inequity, not the least of \nwhich is the willingness--at times, in fact, the eagerness--of this \nbody to give us its rights and responsibilities under the Constitution. \nThe Constitution mandates to the legislative branch--the people's \nbranch--authority over foreign trade matters. It cannot, however, force \nthe institution to exercise this authority and assert itself in trade \nmatters. That requires the will of the Members. The lessons we have \nlearned from our most recent experiences with trade agreements should \nbe incentive enough for us to insist on our rights with regard to trade \nmatters. We, after all, represent communities that have lost businesses \nto other countries and families who have lost their jobs to foreign \nfirms.\n  Yet here we are, once again, considering a measure that further ties \nthe hands of the members of this institution in the area of trade. \nPerhaps even worse, we are continuing a trend of blinding ourselves to \nthe details of the trade agreements on which we must ultimately vote. \nIt is almost as if we don't want to know,\n  At the very least, we should do more to lift the veil on trade \nnegotiations so that we have some idea as to what it is this Nation is \nsigning up to when the agreements go into effect. But to do so we need \nto establish the means for Members to participate more broadly, and in \nmore detail, in important trade negotiations, as well as to carry out \nthe important oversight functions that our complex trade laws require.\n  The fast track bill now before the Senate opens that door. The bill \nestablishes the Congressional Oversight Group to serve as an official \nadviser to\n\n[[Page S4689]]\n\nthe U.S. Trade Representative on matters that include the formulation \nof specific trade objectives and negotiating strategies, the \ndevelopment of new trade agreements, and the enforcement of existing \ntrade agreements.\n  The establishment of the Congressional Oversight Group is intended to \nhelp the legislative branch play a more substantial role in trade \nnegotiations, but as laid out in this legislation it does not go quite \nfar enough.\n  As established by the bill, the Congressional Oversight Group will be \ncomprised of five Senators, each of whom must serve on the Finance \nCommittee, five Members of the House of Representatives, each of whom \nmust serve on the Ways and Means Committee, and, on an ad hoc basis, \nthe chairman and ranking members of the various committees of the House \nand Senate that would have jurisdiction over provisions in the trade \nagreement that is under negotiation. This select group, of perhaps as \nfew as 10 Members of Congress, would then be given the authority, under \nlaw, to advise the U.S. Trade Representative on important matters of \ninternational commerce. Choosing members of the Finance and Ways and \nMeans Committees was a logical move on the part of the authors of this \nprovision. These are committees with, perhaps, the greatest degree of \nexpertise in trade matters. But our trade negotiators, and the American \npeople, should have the greater benefit of the breadth of expertise \nthat can be offered by a more diverse representation of the Congress.\n  Mr. President, in some respects, the Senate has already gone over \nthis territory. We have the National Security Working Group to assist \nthe Foreign Relations Committee and the Armed Services Committee with \nreviewing important arms control agreements. The National Security \nWorking Group is not a replacement for those communities, but it is a \nuseful back channel between the legislative and executive branches \nduring the early stages of arms control negotiations, just as the \nCongressional Oversight Group is intended to do for trade negotiations. \nBut the National Security Working Group has functioned well because its \nmembership is not limited to those Senators who serve on the committees \nof jurisdiction. The National Security Working Group has 20 members, \neight of whom serve on neither the Armed Services Committee or the \nForeign Relations Committee. Indeed, one of the group's greatest \nstrengths is that it draws its membership from the whole Senate, rather \nthan just one committee.\n\n  The amendment I offer expands the Congressional Oversight Group to 22 \nmembers, selected from the membership of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives who do not serve on the Finance Committee in the Senate \nor the Ways and Means Committee in the House. Just as with the National \nSecurity Working Group, the leadership of each House of Congress will \nserve on this panel. In addition, the leadership of each House will \nselect eight additional members to complete the Congressional Oversight \nGroup. It also authorizes expenses for Senate staff, so that the group \ncan follow the negotiations of trade agreements on a full-time basis, \nnot just as the schedules of the members of the group allow.\n  The changes that I propose to the composition of the Congressional \nOversight Group as established in the fast-track bill do not in any way \ndetract from the consultations between the administration and the \ncongressional committees of jurisdiction. The Trade Act of 1974 \nestablished a process for consultation between the congressional \ncommittees of jurisdiction and the executive branch. At the beginning \nof each Congress, the President pro tempore of the Senate is directed \nto appoint, after consultation with the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, five members of that committee to work with the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative during the negotiation of trade agreements. The Speaker \nof the House is also directed to make appointments for members of the \nHouse committees of jurisdiction to serve in the same advisory role.\n  The U.S. Trade Representative is directed to keep these congressional \nadvisors ``currently informed on the trade policy of the United \nStates,'' and make these advisors aware of any proposed changes to our \ntrade policy. This is the mechanism by which the members of the \ncommittees of jurisdiction can remain informed of the progress in \nnegotiating fast-track agreements.\n  My amendment prevents the congressional Oversight Group from being a \nredundant entity, as it currently is configured in the fast-track bill, \nand expands it to include a broader group of members of Congress in \nboth Houses who are interested in trade, but do not serve on the \nFinance Committee or the Ways and Means Committee. The amendment does \nnot elevate the Congressional Oversight Group above the status of the \ncommittees of jurisdiction on trade matters. In fact, my amendment \nspecifically directs that any meetings that are open to the \nCongressional Oversight Group shall also be open to congressional \nadvisers for trade policy.\n  Because trade agreements encompass so many issues, including labor \nprotections and environmental standards, as well as adjustments to our \nown trade rules, all committees with jurisdiction should be fully \nconsulted at all stages of negotiations on a new trade agreement. But \nmany Senators who do not serve on the committees of jurisdiction also \nhave great interest in our trade laws and they can offer significant \ncontributions. These Senators should have the opportunity to receive \nsimilar consultations. The Congressional Oversight Group, as laid out \nby my amendment, would allow these Senators with an interest in trade \nmatters to be fully informed of the progress of negotiations.\n  The fast-track procedure for considering trade bills turns the \nlegislative process on its head. It forbids Senators from offering \namendments, even for the purpose of clarifying the intent of the \nagreement in question. The fast-track procedures limit the time that a \ntrade agreement could be debated, as if Senators should not be given \nthe time to learn what is really in the agreement.\n  In that case, the only Senators who would really know what a trade \nagreement does, and why it needs to be done, are those Senators who \nparticipate during the negotiation of those agreements. Right now, only \nfive Senators have been appointed to be congressional trade advisors to \nthe U.S. Trade Representative, and every one of those Senators serves \non the Committee on Finance. It is all well and good to draw upon the \nexpertise of the members of the Finance Committee, but what about the \nrest of us?\n  At what point will we, who do not serve on the Finance Committee, be \nmade aware of the progress of trade negotiations? When will those \nMembers of the Senate who are not on the committees of jurisdiction \nhave an opportunity to see that the interests of our States are \nprotected by a trade agreement? Is it when the agreement is signed, \nsealed, and delivered to Congress for an up-or-down vote? Or are we, as \nthe elected representatives of the people, entitled to have our input \non these trade agreements while there is still an opportunity to do so?\n  In an increasingly global marketplace, the ramifications of trade \nnegotiations are undoubtedly reaching into the smallest crevices of our \neconomy. The types of industries, the numbers of businesses, and every \nAmerican's everyday concerns that are being impacted by foreign trade \nare real and constantly growing. The consultation of a broader number \nof Senators on potential trade agreements will more adequately and \nappropriately address the pervasive influence of foreign trade on \nAmerica today. My amendment to change the composition of the \nCongressional Oversight Group will help end the exclusive nature of \ntrade consultations. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from West Virginia will yield for \na question.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. First, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a \ncosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the Senator from West Virginia has \noffered a very sound proposal to this so-called fast-track legislation. \nI was wondering if the Senator from West Virginia, who has been in this \nChamber a long while, knows of circumstances where other\n\n[[Page S4690]]\n\nthings have been given ``fast track'' treatment in ways that help \nordinary folks.\n  Has the Senator from West Virginia been aware of circumstances where, \nfor example, legislation that affects ordinary Americans is given fast-\ntrack authority to be considered here?\n  Mr. BYRD. No, no.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How about the disputes against unfair foreign trade \npractices that the steel industry raises or that family farmers or \ntextile manufacturers raise--do the disputes they deem they need to \nbring because they are victims of unfair trade get fast-tracked or do \nthey get slow-tracked?\n  Mr. BYRD. No, they get slow-tracked.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will agree that, while fast track \nis making new agreements and shoving them through the Congress with no \namendments, efforts to correct the problems in trade that are faced by \nso many American workers and so many businesses cannot get any action, \nlet alone slow-track; they get no movement at all. Is that not the \ncase?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is the case, precisely.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, it is ever more important that the \nSenator's amendment be approved. To the extent Congress is going to \nprovide so-called fast-track authority, we need people looking over the \nshoulders of those who are going to negotiate these trade agreements.\n  I was in a room in Montreal when the United States-Canada Free Trade \nAgreement was negotiated. It did not do much good, frankly. I went \nthere and heard what the negotiator had to tell us, but it was not part \nof the negotiations. When I got back here, I discovered that which was \nnegotiated behind the scenes in a secret agreement did not come out \nuntil 2 years later, much to the detriment of American farmers.\n  Senator Byrd is on the right track saying if fast track is going to \nhappen--and I do not support fast track--but if it is going to happen, \nin future negotiations, let's have more people looking over the \nshoulders of those who are negotiating on behalf of our country.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, I rise as a cosponsor of Senator Byrd's \namendment, and I wish to express my support for this amendment, if my \nvoice will let me do so.\n  I am very proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment. It is a very \nimportant improvement to this legislation. I particularly believe those \nwho found the Dayton-Craig amendment to be anathema should look at this \nvery closely, welcome it, and support it, as should all of my \ncolleagues.\n  It does provide, as the Senator from North Dakota just said \ncorrectly, an ongoing involvement of the Members of both the House and \nthe Senate in these negotiations. If we are going to be asked to \napprove these agreements on an expedited basis when they come to us, \nthen I think it is essential we have this opportunity to participate.\n  The Byrd amendment provides us with a group, the staff, and resources \nnecessary to make qualified judgments. That is an essential role if we \nare going to have a true partnership with the executive branch.\n  I note the Constitution of the United States, which the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia knows so well, ascribes to the legislative \nbranch the sole authority for governing trade negotiations and all \naspects of trade. It does not mention the executive branch. Certainly \nthat responsibility has been devolving to a shared relationship, but it \nis certainly not one this branch could responsibly cede nor would it \nwant to cede.\n  I also point out that given the arrangements with the World Trade \nOrganization, which is still expanding its breadth and its reach, once \nrules have been established by that body, it is my understanding they \ncan only be changed by unanimous concurrence of all participating \ncountries, which means that once this country has given up to the World \nTrade Organization any of the laws or the protections that have been \nestablished for the benefit of the American people, we cannot \nunilaterally take them back, which makes it even more important that \nthe amendment of the Senator from West Virginia be passed to give the \nCongress that oversight and chance to anticipate ahead of time what the \nconsequences are going to be of some of these decisions.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Minnesota. I \nappreciate his willingness to cosponsor the amendment, and I value his \nassociation in the matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 3448 And 3449\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia controls 48 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I speak on amendments Nos. 3448 and 3449, which I \noffered earlier.\n  Madam President, for nearly 50 years I have worked to preserve the \ninstitutional integrity of the Senate and the House. Throughout this \nlong period, I have repeatedly and consistently opposed exactly the \ntype of fast-track provisions that are contained in this bill. During \nmy decades in the Senate, I have staunchly opposed fast-track because I \nbelieve it improperly delegates to the Executive Branch unwarranted and \nexcessive power over the regulation of foreign commerce. I have to say, \nhowever, that upon reviewing this bill, I find its provisions are some \nof the most offensive to date. This bill continues the sorry trend of \ngiving the President carte blanche to determine what will be contained \nin a series of trade agreements, and--except for the provisions on \ntrade remedies exempted by the Dayton-Craig amendment--deprives the \nSenate of any opportunity to amend these agreements in order to either \nimprove their provisions or correct any deficiencies they may contain.\n  This bill impedes the ability of the Senate to enact a resolution of \ndisapproval against a trade agreement that it finds objectionable. \nAlthough, at first glance, the bill appears to permit a Senator to \nintroduce a resolution of disapproval rejecting a trade agreement that \nis brought back to the Senate by the President, the reality is that \nsuch a resolution most probably would never come to the floor of the \nSenate for a vote.\n  This is because the bill states that, once a resolution of \ndisapproval is introduced and referred to the Senate Finance Committee, \nit will not be in order for the full Senate to consider the resolution \nif it has not been reported by that committee. In other words, a \ndisapproval resolution cannot be forced to the floor through a \ndischarge of the Senate Finance Committee. The way this bill is \ncurrently written, if a resolution of disapproval is not reported out \nof the Senate Finance Committee, it might as well never have been \nintroduced. The resolution simply languishes, and languishes, and \nlanguishes, and languishes.\n  This means that, so long as the Senate Finance Committee endorses the \nPresident's agreement, the views of the rest of the Senate are \nirrelevant. Enacting fast-track in this bill not only provides the \nPresident with unfettered authority to negotiate trade agreements, it \nalso prevents the Senate from exercising its constitutional \nresponsibility to reject or modify trade agreements that are not in the \nbest interests of the American people.\n  The Constitution in Article 1, Section 8, not only provides Congress \nwith the power to ``lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and \nexcises'' and to ``regulate commerce with foreign nations,'' but it \nalso gives the Congress the authority to enact all legislation that \n``shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the \nforegoing powers.'' This authority of the Congress to enact or to \nrefuse to enact legislation\n\n[[Page S4691]]\n\napplies specifically to the trade agreements that the President seeks \nto negotiate under fast-track.\n  It is imperative that every Senator retain his or her right to \nintroduce a resolution of disapproval that can be considered in the \nlight of day by the full Senate. The rules of the Senate exist not only \nto protect the rights of its Members. In fact, it should be said that \nthe rules and procedures exist to protect the rights of the people. \nThis body is uniquely structured to provide a voice and power to the \nminority. I repeat, the minority. And I remind my colleagues in this \nChamber that a minority can be right. The rules of this body, in fact, \nprovide each individual member with leverage, and each of us has a \nstake in ensuring that these rules are respected, and that procedural \nchanges of this type are only undertaken with great care and \nthoughtfulness.\n\n  To this end, I am introducing two amendments to require that, upon \nintroduction, any resolution of disapproval--including an extension \nresolution of disapproval--will be referred not only to the Senate \nCommittee on Finance, but also to the Senate Committee on Rules and \nAdministration. After all, it is the Rules Committee that is charged \nwith making the rules and procedures that govern this institution, and \nits expertise is essential to guarantee that the commitments undertaken \nby our trading partners in the trade agreements we negotiate are \nenforceable under U.S. law.\n  Under these amendments, each of these committees will be required to \nreport the resolution of disapproval that has been referred to it \nwithin 10 days of the date of its introduction and, if either of these \ncommittees fails to report the resolution of disapproval within that \ntime, either of these committees shall automatically be discharged from \nfurther consideration of the resolution. The resolution shall then be \nplaced directly on the Senate Calendar. Once the disapproval resolution \nis placed on the Senate Calendar, any Senator may make a motion to \nproceed to consider that resolution, and the motion to consider the \nresolution shall not be debatable.\n  The language in this bill and its accompanying report prohibiting a \nresolution of disapproval from being discharged from the Finance \nCommittee constitutes a sharp distortion of the Senate's rules that \nwould dramatically impede the rights of the 79 Members of the Senate \nwho happen not to serve on the Senate Finance Committee. In other \nwords, almost four-fifths of the Senate will have no say regarding \nwhether what the President has negotiated is right or wrong.\n  If enacted as currently written, this bill would effectively cut a \nmajority of Senators out of the trade regulation process, preventing \nthem from correcting sweeping changes in trade law that could unfairly \naffect the lives of their constituents who rely on the Senate to \nprotect their interests. It is not as if Senators, in recent years, \nhave had much of a say in trade matters. They have not. And what little \nvoice they have had has been suppressed, if not silenced, on too many \noccasions by this gimmick called fast-track, a gimmick now renamed \n``trade promotion authority.'' This legislation goes beyond fast-track \nin its impairment of the Senate's prerogatives.\n  I cannot support surrendering the rights and prerogatives, the duties \nand responsibilities of the Senate to any president of any political \nparty. We in the Congress have an obligation to strike down trade \nagreements that adversely affect the American people. But it is \nimpossible for us to do so if we do not provide ourselves the \nopportunity to adequately review, debate, amend, or reject their \nprovisions as we are rightly empowered to do under the Constitution of \nthe United States. These amendments ensure that we retain the power to \nmodify or reject trade agreements that are not in the best interests of \nthe majority of the people of the United States and, in so doing, \nprotect the economic well-being of the Nation and of the people we \nrepresent.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I support giving the President trade \npromotion authority, as the bill now before the Senate would do. It is \nessential that we work with President Bush to ensure that we break down \nbarriers and promote the sale of U.S. goods and services and \nagricultural commodities in other countries.\n  Export markets are absolutely necessary to assure the profitability \nof American agriculture. America's farmers are producing more but \nexporting less.\n  Last year, exports of U.S. farm products amounted to just over $50 \nbillion. That is a decrease from 5 years ago when we reached a high of \n$60 billion in foreign exports.\n  For our country to prosper, we must have access to foreign markets. \nThese markets not only help farmers; they help create jobs in \nprocessing industries, as well as transportation.\n  Tariffs in other countries against our farm products are too high. \nThey can be reduced through aggressive negotiation by our President. \nThe tariff on U.S. agricultural products averages over 60 percent \ncompared to under 5 percent on other domestic goods. If the President \nhad the authority to negotiate international trade agreements, farm \nreceipts would go up and not down as has been our recent experience.\n  One out of every three acres planted by farmers across America is \nintended for export. But because we aren't selling all we produce, \ncommodity prices are going down, and the agricultural sector is having \na very hard time making ends meet.\n  One of my State's biggest exports is poultry. The Mississippi broiler \nindustry, which is one of the largest in the Nation, accounts for 40 \npercent of all farm receipts in my State. That industry especially \nbenefits from trade agreements that prohibit quotas and reduce tariffs.\n  As a result of breaking down trade barriers on poultry, my State's \nexports to the Philippines, for example, have risen over 600 percent. \nThis is a clear reminder of the positive result we can obtain through \nfree trade agreements.\n  Throughout the world, there are about 150 different trade agreements \namong other countries. The United States is only partner to three of \nthem. For every market that is opened through country-to-country \nnegotiations, an opportunity is lost for America.\n  I urge the Senate to approve this trade promotion authority \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3543 To Amendment No. 3401\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nat this point that I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of myself \nand Senator Voinovich, an amendment to the Baucus substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself and Mr. \n     Voinovich, proposes an amendment numbered 3543 to amendment \n     No. 3401.\n       On page 228, line 21, insert after ``exports'' the \n     following: ``(including motor vehicles and vehicle parts)''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment with Senator \nVoinovich, my fellow co-chair of the Senate Auto Caucus and Senator \nStabenow. Our amendment would include in one of the listed principal \nnegotiating objectives of the United States to reduce trade barriers in \nother countries to U.S. motor vehicles and vehicle parts. Increasing \naccess for our products to markets which are closed or partially closed \nto us surely should be the objective of all of us.\n  Other countries have full access to our market for their autos and \nauto parts. The fast track provision we are considering makes it a \nprincipal negotiating objective to expand trade and reduce barriers for \ntrade in services, foreign investment, intellectual property, \nelectronic commerce, and agriculture, and other sectors. Yet the \nbiggest portion of our trade deficit is in\n\n[[Page S4692]]\n\nautos. In 2001, our automotive deficit made up over 31 percent of our \ntotal trade deficit with the world. In 2001, our automotive deficit was \n59 percent of our total trade deficit with Japan and 53 percent of our \ntotal deficit with Korea.\n  No omnibus trade bill should leave the Senate without addressing \nbarriers to our products which are the largest contributors to our \ntrade deficit. We can start by making opening foreign markets for U.S. \nautomotive products one of our principal negotiating objectives.\n  America's domestic auto industry is the largest manufacturing \nindustry in the United States. The domestic auto industry alone \ncontributes almost 4 percent to the total U.S. Gross Domestic Products. \nOur domestic auto manufacturers operate 52 manufacturing and assembly \nfacilities in 19 states around the country, and when auto parts \nmanufacturers are included, there is an automotive manufacturing \npresence in almost every state. The Big 3 automakers directly employ \nover 500,000 people in automotive-related jobs in the U.S. That number \ngrows by an additional 2 million jobs when you count automotive \nsuppliers and other related industries.\n  The auto industry is also a hi-tech manufacturing industry. It is one \nof the largest users of computers and the advanced technologies. It \nalso spends nearly $20 billion annually on research and development, \nmore than any other industrial sector in America. The U.S. auto \nindustry contributes mightily to our economic well being. Yet we \ncontinue to neglect it when it comes to insisting on fair market access \nfor exports of autos and auto parts.\n  The U.S. passenger vehicle market is the most open and competitive in \nthe world. But when we go to sell our autos and auto parts in foreign \nmarkets, we face significant trade restrictions. Some of the most \negregious practitioners of unfair trade in autos and auto parts are \nJapan and Korea. The sale of American vehicles and auto parts in Japan \nhas been blocked by protectionist measures such as government \nregulations dealing with vehicle certification, inspection, and repair. \nIn Korea, restrictions include a tax system that discriminates against \nimported vehicles by making them prohibitively expensive, \ndiscriminatory practices such as labeling foreign vehicles as ``luxury \ngoods,'' and the perception that the purchase of a foreign vehicle will \ntrigger a tax audit.\n\n  Since 1990, the U.S. automotive trade deficit with Japan has averaged \n55 percent of our total trade deficit with Japan. A 5 year market \nopening agreement in autos and auto parts that was largely a failure. \nThe U.S. automotive trade deficit with Korea has grown significantly \nsince 1995 despite two automotive market opening agreements with Korea.\n  Japan and Korea want it both ways. They want to keep a sanctuary \nautomotive home market that is protected from competition while they \nexport a significant portion of production to the United States.\n  We have been trying to open Japan's automotive markets for decades to \nno avail. In the mid-1980's we engaged in 8 years of Market Oriented \nSector Specific, MOSS, talks with Japan to try to open Japan's auto \nparts market. During that time, our auto parts deficit with Japan rose \nfrom $3.3 billion in 1985 to nearly $11 billion in 1992 despite modest \nincreases in sales by U.S. parts makers to the Japanese. The MOSS talks \nwere followed by Framework talks in autos and auto parts which led to a \n1995 U.S.-Japan Automotive Trade Agreement with the goal of increasing \nmarket access in Japan for U.S. autos and auto parts. That goal has not \nbeen achieved. Despite that fact, the Administration has allowed the \nAgreement to expire. Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan in \nautos and auto parts has gotten worse. The auto and auto parts trade \ndeficit was $32.9 billion in 1995. By the end of 2000 when the \nAgreement was allowed to expire, it was $44.2 billion, more than 60 \npercent of the overall U.S. trade deficit with Japan and 10 percent of \nthe worldwide U.S. trade deficit.\n  The U.S. government, in its annual Trade Barriers Report, \nacknowledges that it is disappointed with the access of North American-\nmade vehicles and parts to Japan.\n  When it comes to automotive trade between the United States and \nKorea, the numbers speak for themselves. South Korea has the most \nclosed market for imported cars and trucks in the developed world. \nWhile foreign vehicles account for only \\1/2\\ of one percent of its \ntotal vehicle market, Korea depends on open markets in other countries \nto absorb its auto exports. Korea exports half of all the passenger \nvehicles it produces, with many of those vehicles coming to the U.S. \nLast year, Korea imported only 7,747 vehicles from the United States \nand exported over 600,000 to our country.\n  This imbalance exists despite two separate automotive trade \nagreements between the United States and Korea which were supposed to \nopen Korea's market: the first in 1995 and the second in 1998. This \nimbalance is unfair to America and its workers and only threatens to \nget worse if we do not act immediately.\n  The amendment Senator Voinovich and I have introduced attempts to \naddress the gross inequities in market access for U.S. autos and auto \nparts among some of our major trading partners. Our amendment would \nmake market access for motor vehicles and vehicle parts a principal \nnegotiating objective of the Untied States. The underlying bill \nincludes 14 principal negotiating objectives and the Senate voted \noverwhelmingly to add textiles to that list. Since autos and auto parts \nare the largest part of our deficit, it is unacceptable that foreign \ntrade barriers that exclude U.S.-made passenger vehicles and auto parts \nfrom certain markets are allowed to exist. We must act to get rid of \nthose barriers.\n  Our amendment would make it a principal negotiating objective to \nexpand competitive market opportunities for U.S. motor vehicles and \nvehicle parts and to obtain fairer and more open conditions of trade by \nreducing or eliminating tariff and nontariff barriers.\n  The current trade situation in autos and auto parts is unfair to \nAmerica. We simply want access--to compete--no guarantees, just access. \nEvery nation in the world strives to have a successful automotive \nindustry and fights for that industry. We should do the same. The \nnearly 2.5 million men and women working in our nation's largest \nmanufacturing industry deserve nothing less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3543) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If there is no one else who seeks recognition at this \npoint----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to have recognition on another matter, on \nthe Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I may take 2 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, go ahead.\n  I thank my friend, Senator Grassley, for helping us to work out this \nmatter. As always, he is a gentleman and is accommodating. Again, we \nare very grateful for the effort he made to make this possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3447\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, is the regular order the Byrd amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the Hollings second-\ndegree amendment to the Byrd amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Would I be in order to speak on the Byrd underlying \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am strongly opposed to this amendment, \nfor two reasons.\n  First, the amendment would disrupt the bipartisan balance we achieved \nin the Finance Committee on Trade Promotion Authority. Republicans and \nDemocrats looked carefully at all the issues, especially the issues \nrelating to Congressional notification and consultation, and approved a \nbill that, overall, goes farther in terms of congressional oversight \nand consultation than we have ever gone in fast-rack legislation.\n  The second reason I oppose this amendment is that it would \nessentially\n\n[[Page S4693]]\n\nstrip the Finance Committee of much of its traditional authority and \njurisdiction over the trade policy oversight function.\n  According to this proposed provision, none of the proposed eight \nmembers of the Congressional Oversight Group may be members of the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n  Under this amendment, more than twenty percent of the Senate would be \nshut out from direct oversight of how trade negotiations subject to \nfast-track procedures are being conducted.\n  In that regard, this is a very radical amendment.\n  It strikes me as extremely unusual, to say the very least, that the \nFinance Committee, which wrote and passed the bipartisan trade \npromotion authority bill in the first place, would be given almost no \nrole whatever in the oversight process once trade promotion authority \nbecomes law.\n  I say almost no role, because some Finance Committee members--those \nfew who are congressional advisers for trade policy--would apparently \nhave some limited role, in that the cochairmen of the Congressional \nOversight Group are required to meet with them ``regularly''.\n  Mr. President, this is not the way that oversight of trade policy \nshould be conducted.\n  I don't believe that any member of a Senate Committee--especially the \nFinance Committee--should be automatically excluded from the entity \nthat the Senate establishes to review and monitor trade negotiations.\n  But that is exactly what this amendment does.\n  Do the proponents of this amendment mean that we can't trust Members \nof the Finance Committee to do the job the jurisdiction of their \ncommittee confers on them?\n  It appears that is exactly what this means.\n  This is not just bad policy.\n  Specifically excluding Senators from serving in any oversight \ncapacity would also set a terrible precedent.\n  The congressional oversight process that Senator Baucus and I \ndesigned in the bipartisan trade promotion authority bill is a good \none, and it should be preserved.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, hopefully, tomorrow, after a few \nrollcall votes on a few remaining amendments, we are going to have an \nopportunity to pass this bipartisan trade promotion authority act of \n2002. I would like to address the issue of the bill for a few minutes \nwhile we are waiting for final action by the Senate on how we proceed \ntomorrow.\n  This bill provides the President with the flexibility he needs to \nnegotiate strong international trade agreements on behalf of U.S. \nworkers and farmers while maintaining Congress's constitutional role \nover U.S. trade policy. It represents a thoughtful approach to \naddressing the complex relationships between international trade, \nworkers' rights, and the environment, without undermining the \nfundamental purpose and proven effectiveness of trade promotion \nauthority procedures.\n  Specifically, this bipartisan act gives the administration the \nauthority to negotiate and bring back trade agreements to Congress that \nwill eliminate and reduce trade barriers relating to manufacturing, \nservices, agriculture, intellectual property, investment, and e-\ncommerce.\n  The legislation supports eliminating subsidies that decrease market \nopportunities for U.S. agriculture or unfairly distort markets to the \ndetriment of the United States, with special emphasis on biotechnology, \nending unjustified barriers not based on sound science, and fair \ntreatment for import-sensitive agriculture.\n  The legislation preserves U.S. sovereignty while engaging new trade \nagreements that will create solid economic growth, improve efficiency \nand innovation, create better, high-paying jobs for hard-working \nAmericans that on average pay 15 percent above the average wage, and \nincreases the availability of attractively priced products into the \nU.S. market for the benefit of our consumers.\n  The legislation adds a trade negotiating objective on labor and the \nenvironment--very important provisions for many Members of this body. \nThis is done to ensure that a party to a trade agreement does not fail \nto effectively enforce its labor and environmental laws through a \nsustained or recurring course of action or inaction, recognizing a \ngovernment retains certain discretion.\n  It strengthens, under the labor and environmental provisions, the \ncapacity to promote respect for core labor standards and to protect the \nenvironment, to reduce or eliminate government practices or policies \nthat unduly threaten sustainable development, and it seeks market \naccess for U.S. environmental technologies, goods, and services.\n  The legislation adds a new negotiating objective on enforcement, \ngiving labor and environment disputes covered by the agreement parity \nwith other issues in the trade agreement.\n  It sets forth other Presidential priorities not covered by trade \npromotion authority, including greater cooperation between the World \nTrade Organization on the one hand, and the International Labor \nOrganization on the other hand, and consultative mechanisms among \nparties to trade agreements to strengthen the capacity of U.S. trading \npartners to promote respect for core labor standards and the \nenvironment, technical assistance on labor issues, and reporting on the \nchild labor laws of U.S. trading partners.\n  The legislation directs the President to take into account legitimate \nhealth, safety, essential security, and consumer interests. It directs \nthe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to preserve our ability to \nenforce vigorously U.S. trade remedy laws and avoid agreements which \nlessen the effectiveness of U.S. antidumping or countervailing duty \nlaws.\n  The legislation contains negotiating objectives on investment to \nincrease transparency for the dispute settlement process, calls for \nstandards of expropriation and compensation that are consistent with \nU.S. legal principles and practice, and eliminates frivolous claims.\n  The bill expands and improves consultations between the \nadministration and Congress before, during, and after trade \nnegotiations and particularly in the development of implementing \nlegislation.\n  The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Assistance Act provides trade \npromotion authority until June 1, 2005, with a possibility of a 2-year \nextension. I point this out because there is a misunderstanding that \nCongress is going to give all of its power to the President. We have \nthe consultation I talked about. Most importantly, whatever is agreed \nto by the President has to be passed by Congress as a law before any \nagreement can become effective. But we also do not give this power away \nto the President forever. This is the year 2002, almost June 1. So we \nare talking about the next 3 years with the possibility of a 2-year \nextension.\n  I happen to believe we ought to have standing trade negotiation \nauthority for the President, and we should not have these lapses that \nwe have had since 1994, but obviously the extent to which we give it \nfor shorter periods of time ought to satisfy more Members of this body \nthat we are not giving up our congressional power, which is a specific \ngrant in our Constitution that Congress shall regulate interstate and \nforeign commerce.\n\n  The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act also contains \nunprecedented procedures that ensure prompt, meaningful, and extensive \nconsultations with the Congress throughout the negotiating process. In \nother words, Members of this body and the other body are going to have \nample opportunity while the President is doing all this negotiating to \nhave reports given to us, feedback and, obviously, if Congress has to \npass a final product, the President, in negotiating a position for the \nUnited States, is going to have to take into consideration the views of \nMembers of Congress if the President wants to reach an agreement that \nwill eventually pass by a majority vote in both the House and Senate.\n\n[[Page S4694]]\n\n  In regard to this negotiation process and consultation therein, the \nbill establishes a congressional oversight group which is a broad-\nbased, bipartisan, and permanent institution to be accredited as though \nofficial advisers to the U.S. delegation to consult with the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative and provide advice regarding formulation of specific \nobjectives, negotiation strategies and positions, and development of \nthe final trade agreement.\n  This congressional oversight group would maximize bipartisanship and \ninput from Members from a broad range of committees comprising the \nchairman and ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, three \nadditional committee members, and also the chairman and ranking member, \nand their designees, of each committee with a jurisdiction over any law \naffected by trade agreements being negotiated.\n  The Bipartisan Trade Promotion Assistance Act also requires \ndevelopment of a written plan by the U.S. Trade Representative for \nconsulting with Congress throughout the negotiations. That plan must \ninclude provisions for regular and detailed briefings of the \ncongressional oversight group throughout the negotiations, access to \ndocuments relating to negotiations by members of the congressional \noversight group, and their designated staffs. There would be very close \ncooperation between the congressional oversight group and the U.S. \nTrade Representative at all critical periods of the negotiations, \nincluding at negotiation sites, after the agreement is concluded, \nconsultations regarding ongoing compliance and enforcement of \ncommitments under the agreement, and finally, transmittal of a report \nby the Secretary of Commerce to Congress on U.S. strategy for \ncorrecting World Trade Organization dispute settlement reports that add \nto obligations or diminish rights of the United States.\n  It also provides that the President provide Congress with a written \nnotice of intent to enter negotiations 90 days before initiating \nnegotiations, or as soon as feasible after enactment of trade promotion \nauthority; for negotiations already underway, including the intended \ndate for entering negotiations, specific U.S. objectives and statement \nof whether seeking new agreements or changes in the existing agreement; \nand that the President and the U.S. Trade Representative consult with \nCongress before initiating or continuing negotiations on agricultural \nproducts, fish and shellfish trade, textiles and apparel products.\n  Before and after negotiations begin, the President and U.S. Trade \nRepresentative must consult with Congress regarding the negotiations, \nand particularly the U.S. Trade Representative must consult with all \ncommittees with jurisdiction over laws that would affect an agreement.\n  Before and after negotiations begin, if a majority of the members of \nthe Congressional Oversight Committee request a meeting, the President \nhimself must meet with the group regarding the negotiations.\n  I have used the word ``consult'' many times. It is all reflected in \nthe legislation that Congress is very carefully guarding its \nconstitutional power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce, and \nwe are having a contract with the President of the United States, but \nthat contract is not a blank check to the President of the United \nStates. He keeps in constant touch with us as the words ``consulting'' \nand ``consultation'' and ``consult'' imply, legally binding that he do \nthat.\n  So I hope it is very clear we are not willy-nilly delegating some \npower to the President. Not at all. We are going to be a part of this \nprocess.\n  Now, people might ask why, if Congress is going to be a part of the \nprocess, are we having this contract with the President to negotiate \nfor us? It is because of the impossibility, and it ought to be very \nobvious, 535 Members of Congress not having the ability to be in Geneva \nor someplace else negotiating with 142 other countries on the issue of \nsome trade agreement. So we ask the President to do it.\n  I hope the emphasis upon consulting and Congress demanding that the \nPresident sit down at certain points during this process indicates \nthat, in fact, we are very selfishly guarding congressional \nresponsibility.\n  There is another part of notice and consultation that is required \nbefore actually entering into final trade agreements by the President, \nbefore it is actually signed in other words, because immediately after \ninitiating an agreement the U.S. Trade Representative must consult \nclosely with appropriate congressional committees, including the \ncongressional trade advisers, the congressional oversight group, and \nthe House and Senate Committees on Agriculture.\n  The President is required, at least 90 days before entering an \nagreement, to formally notify Congress of his intent to enter into an \nagreement and publish notice of such intent in the Federal Register. At \nthis time, the President must also notify the appropriate congressional \ncommittees of certain amendments proposed to be included in the \nimplementing bill and then provide the International Trade Commission \nwith details of the agreement so the ITC can prepare and submit an \nassessment of the likely impact of the agreement on the U.S. economy \nand specific industry sectors.\n  Before entering into an agreement, the President must consult with \nthe appropriate congressional committees and the congressional \noversight group regarding three matters: The nature of the agreement; \nthe extent to which the agreement meets congressional objectives as \noutlined in the bill before Congress right now; and the implementation \nof that agreement.\n  Both Houses of Congress have the ability, in the final analysis, as \nwe all know and as has been the practice for the last 25 years, to \ndisapprove an agreement by passing separate disapproval resolutions if \nthe administration fails or refuses to notify or consult with Congress \nin accordance with the bill that is before Congress right now that \nhopefully we will vote on tomorrow.\n  Another example of notice and consultation after a trade agreement is \nentered into: After the President signs it, as soon as practical after \nentering into an agreement, the President must submit a copy of the \nagreement to Congress along with statements or reasons that he had for \nentering into that agreement. The President is required, at least 60 \ndays after entering an agreement, to submit to Congress a description \nof the changes to existing laws that would be needed to comply with the \nagreement.\n\n  The President is also required to submit to Congress the final text \nof the agreement and provide an explanation of how the bill \nimplementing the agreement would change existing law, how the agreement \nmakes progress at achieving the Trade Promotion Authority Act's \nobjective, and also he must submit an implementation plan.\n  When that is all done, we then have to have notice and consultation \non an ongoing basis. The President must report to the appropriate \ncongressional committees on the mechanisms created among parties in the \nagreement to promote respect for core labor standards and to develop \nand implement sound environmental and health standards.\n  The President must also report on the required reviews of the impact \nof future trade agreements on the environment and U.S. employment. \nCongress may withdraw a trade promotion authority for failure to \nconsult. Disapproval resolutions can be introduced by any Senator and \nmay cover multiple agreements. Grounds for disapproval include failure \nto make progress in achieving the objectives that the bill has laid \nout.\n  Obviously, as I have stated before, none of this happens unless \nCongress gives approval by majority vote in both the House and the \nSenate to approve or disapprove these agreements negotiated under this \nbill that hopefully will pass tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the time until 10:30 a.m., May \n23d, tomorrow, count against the time provided under the cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4695]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/22/senate-section/article/S4695-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

WOOD, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, AIR FORCE \n                          LEGISLATIVE LIAISON\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an exceptional \nofficer in the United States Air Force, an individual that a great many \nof us have come to know personally over the past few years--Brigadier \nGeneral Stephen G. Wood. General Wood, who currently serves as Deputy \nDirector of the Air Force Office of Legislative Liaison, was recently \nnominated for promotion to Major General and selected for assignment as \nCommander of the Air Warfare Center, Air Combat Command, at Nellis Air \nForce Base in Nevada. During his time in Washington, and especially \nwith regard to his work here on Capitol Hill, General Wood personified \nthe Air Force core values of integrity, selfless service and excellence \nin the many missions the Air Force performs in support of our national \nsecurity. Many Members and staff have enjoyed the opportunity to meet \nwith him on a variety of Air Force issues and came to deeply appreciate \nhis character and many talents. Today it is my privilege to recognize \nsome of General Wood's many accomplishments, and to commend the superb \nservice he provided the Air Force, the Congress and our Nation.\n  General Wood entered the Air Force through the Reserve Officer \nTraining Corps program at the University of Washington, Seattle. He \nserved in various operational and staff assignments including duty as \nan F-4D pilot, AT-38 instructor pilot, F-16 weapons instructor and \nsquadron operations officer. A command pilot, the general has more than \n3,300 flying hours in the F-4, T-33, AT-38 and F-16, including 49 \ncombat missions during Operation Desert Storm.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, General Wood's exceptional \nleadership skills were always evident to both superiors and \nsubordinates as he repeatedly proved himself in numerous select command \npositions. He served as F-16 Operations Officer and Commander of the \n10th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Hahn Air Base, Germany; and as \nSquadron Commander of the 389th Fighter Squadron at Mountain Home Air \nForce Base in Idaho. He was subsequently selected as Chief of Joint \nTraining Teams at Headquarters, U.S. Atlantic Command, in Norfolk, \nVirginia. Following this assignment, General Wood was chosen as \nCommander of the 8th Operations Group in Kunsan Air Base, South Korea; \nand later as Commander of the 35th Fighter Wing at Misawa Air Base, \nJapan.\n  General Wood is best known to us, however, because of his two Air \nForce assignments involving liaison to the Congress. Many here will \nremember that from June 1997 until November 1998, General Wood was \nassigned as Chief, House Liaison Office, of the Office of the Secretary \nof the Air Force. He excelled in this position, bringing qualities of \nintegrity and professionalism that greatly enhanced relations between \nthe Air Force and the Congress. He was selected in May 2000 to return \nas Deputy Director of Air Force Legislative Liaison for the Secretary \nof the Air Force.\n  In his many years of working with the Congress, General Wood has \nprovided a clear and credible voice for the Air Force while \nrepresenting its many programs on the Hill, consistently providing \naccurate, concise and timely information. His integrity, \nprofessionalism and expertise enabled him to develop and maintain an \nexceptional rapport between the Air Force and the Congress. The key to \nhis success, I believe, was his deep understanding of Congressional \nprocesses and priorities and his unflinching advocacy of programs \nessential to the Air Force and to our nation.\n  I am very pleased that General Wood has been nominated for his second \nstar and I am sure that the Senate will soon concur in that promotion. \nI offer my sincere congratulations to General Wood for his nomination \nand for his new assignment as Commander of the Air Warfare Center. On \nbehalf of the Congress and our great Nation, I thank General Wood and \nhis entire family for the commitment and sacrifices that they have made \nthroughout his military career. I know I speak for all of my colleagues \nin expressing my heartfelt appreciation to General Wood for a job well \ndone. He is a credit to both the Air Force and the United States. We \nwish our friend the best of luck in his new command.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/22/senate-section/article/S4695-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING DOLORES HUERTA\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, few people have done as much for \nAmerica's workers as Dolores Huerta. She is a preeminent labor and \ncivil rights leader who has worked tirelessly and skillfully to enhance \nand improve the working conditions for farm workers and their families \nfor more than 40 years. She is the heart and soul--and the muscle--of \nthe farm worker labor movement. And I join those in lauding her for all \nshe has accomplished. No injustice and no wrong is too big or too small \nfor Dolores's attention. And we are all so proud of all she does so \nwell.\n  Born in Dawson, NM, on April 10, 1930, Dolores Huerta was raised, in \nStockton, CA, in the San Joaquin Valley. Growing up, she saw first-hand \nthe poverty that local farm workers endured. She also saw the \ngenerosity that her mother showed in providing free food and housing to \nlocal farm workers.\n  Dolores earned a teaching degree from Stockton College, but she left \nthe profession because she could not stand to see her students the \nchildren of farm workers come to school hungry and without shoes. \nConvinced that she could be more helpful to their children by \norganizing farm workers, she founded the Stockton Chapter of the \nCommunity Service Organization in 1955, a Latino association to educate \nand assist these families.\n  In 1962, Dolores Huerta joined Cesar Chavez in founding the National \nFarm Workers Association which eventually became the famous United Farm \nWorkers Organizing Committee.\n  As a co-founder of UFWOC, Ms. Huerta's efforts have led to wide-\nranging reforms for farm workers and their families. For example, Ms. \nHuerta negotiated a contract which established the first health and \nbenefit plan for farm workers. In addition, her consumer boycotts \nresulted in the enactment of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act, the \nfirst United States law that granted workers to collectively bargain \nfor better working conditions. Ms. Huerta also fought hard against \ntoxic pesticides which were destructive to farm workers and the \nenvironment, and negotiated agreements to ensure that dangerous \npesticides were not used in the fields.\n  Ms. Huerta has already been recognized by many for the groundbreaking \nwork that she has done. She has received several honorary doctorate \ndegrees and was honored as one the ``100 Most Important Women of the \n20th Century.'' In addition, Ms. Huerta was recently named one of six \nWomen Sustaining the American Spirit. We here in the Senate thank Ms. \nHuerta for her passion and commitment to children, women and farm \nworker families. All workers deserve fair treatment and safe working \nconditions. The American people are better off today because of all she \nhas done, and it is a privilege to be able to offer her this tribute \nfrom the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/22/senate-section/article/S4695-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4695-S4696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the recent enactment of \nH.R. 2646, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, and to \nexplain why I made the very difficult decision to vote against it. \nFirst, I wish to express my sincere thanks to the members of the House \nand Senate Agriculture Committees and the conferees for their very hard \nwork in producing this farm bill. I have no doubt that their aim was \nthe good of America's farmers and of rural America.\n  There are a number of important provisions in the farm bill that will \nhave a positive impact on our family farms. I am pleased that \nsignificantly more funds will go to conservation programs and to help \nlivestock producers and feedlot operators to better protect the \nenvironment. I am especially proud of language included in the farm \nbill that\n\n[[Page S4696]]\n\nwill restore a modest and carefully constructed wool program for our \nsheep industry. The new wool payment is crafted to provide some \nassistance during difficult times but not so much that the wool market \nwill become distorted. I think the wool payment program is a good model \nfor providing farmers with a good safety net.\n  I wish I could say that the other crop support programs in H.R. 2646 \nwere also well-crafted, but I cannot.\n  I was a strong supporter of the previous farm bill, or the Fair Act. \nThe Fair Act attempted to free our farmers from the heavy hand of \ngovernment and restore to our farmers the benefits of the free market.\n  While I supported the Fair Act, I also recognized that the safety net \nfor our farmers still needed some strengthening. A farm safety net \nshould help farmers succeed in the free market. The alternative is to \nprotect our farmers from the free market, and we have learned from \nfailed farm programs of the past that there is not a good way to do \nthat.\n  It is unfortunate that our new farm bill appears to be heading back \ndown those same paths. Its greatest weakness is that in an attempt to \nprovide some protection for farmers it goes well beyond the mark. We \nneeded a fresh approach to supporting our farmers, but this latest farm \nbill is an unpleasant trip down memory lane. It risks turning our \nfarmers into welfare recipients, and it puts the bureaucrat back in the \nbusiness of running our nation's farms.\n  In H.R. 2646, the programs for row crops are intended to kick in when \nthere is an oversupply and prices are low. Basic economic principles \nwould indicate, and history has proven, that these counter cyclical \nprograms themselves can create an incentive for overproduction which, \nin turn, keeps prices low. Unless they are crafted very carefully, \ncounter cyclical programs lead to a spiral of dependency. As long as \nthe government money keeps flowing to the farmers, the overproduction \ndoes not bankrupt them. But it does put our farmers on the federal \ndole, and I don't believe that's where the farmers of Utah want to be.\n  One of the greatest benefits our government can provide to our \nfarmers is a world system of free and fair trade. Our Nation's farm \nproducts are the best, and consumers around the world are clamoring for \nthem. Through tremendous effort and lengthy negotiations, this and past \nadministrations have been prying open foreign markets to U.S. \nagricultural products. I believe that too many of the programs in H.R. \n2646 go beyond support for farmers and instead attempt to protect them \nfrom competition. The governments of our largest foreign markets for \nagriculture products are keenly aware of this, and with some \njustification they are alarmed by our recent shift toward \nprotectionism. I fear the effects of this shift will hurt farmers. \nDoors to foreign markets that have been opened to our farmers may now \nclose, the possibility for new markets may be quashed, and a greater \nnumber of future agricultural trade issues will be decided by the World \nTrade Organization, not by our trade negotiators.\n  Another important consideration for me in deciding to oppose H.R. \n2646, was the alarming escalation of the cost of the bill. My \nunderstanding was that it would take about $100 billion to keep the \ncurrent programs running for our farmers. On top of that, we budgeted \nan additional $73.5 billion to help meet the needs of our farmers. That \nis a big increase, but I think our farmers deserve the additional help. \nI would feel better about spending this extra money, though, if I \nbelieved that it would benefit our agricultural industry rather than \nwork against it. I would also feel better about the extra spending if \nthe original $173.5 billion had not mysteriously risen to a budget \nbusting $190 billion.\n  I know the farmers of Utah. They are prudent businessmen who simply \nwant a fair shake. They do not want to go on the government dole, they \ndo not want to close foreign markets, and they do not want to add to \nour budget deficit. Unfortunately for the farmers of Utah, the farm \nbill that has recently been signed into law does all of the above. And \nyet, all this money and all these programs do strangely little for the \nsmall farmer of Utah. A full two-thirds of all these programs will go \nto only 10 percent of our nation's largest farms. This is a \nparticularly grotesque and embarrassing aspect of H.R. 2646. If these \nlargest farms are so efficient, why do they need this level of welfare? \nWhere are the economies of scale that should make the largest farms the \nstrongest?\n  I voted on the floor of the Senate, along with 65 of my colleagues, \nto address this issue by providing certain limitations on the size of \npayments the largest farms could receive under this farm bill. Although \ntwo-thirds of the Senate agreed on these payment limitations, the final \nconference report came back to us stripped of this important provision.\n  I wish we had a farm bill to which I could have given my blessing, \nbut frankly, H.R. 2646 did not deserve my blessing. I am pleased that \nUtah's woolgrowers will receive some much needed relief, that our \nlivestock producers in general will receive important funding for \nconservation measures, and that our crop growers will gain some \ncertainty from the enactment of a farm bill, but I fear there may be a \nheavy price to pay in the long run for our agricultural industry--a \nprice that could have been avoided with a little more prudence and \nrestraint on the part of the legislators and the farm organizations who \nhelped to develop this farm bill.\n  I hope that Utah's farmers can understand why I needed to vote \nagainst this farm bill. I cherish the farmers of Utah. I consider them \nthe finest citizens our nation has. There is no group that works \nharder, that is more patriotic, or that is more morally strong than the \nfarmers of Utah. I have often stated that they are the backbone of our \nsociety, and I have always believed it to be true. I will continue to \ndo all I can to support our farmers in the way that I believe they want \nto be supported, and I think my record reflects that this is what I \nhave attempted to do over the years. I believe that the farmers I \nrepresent understand this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/22/senate-section/article/S4696-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4696-S4697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TUNA IMPORTS FROM THE PHILIPPINES\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns \nabout a provision in the Andean Trade Preferences Act, ATPA, that will \nhave serious adverse, unintended consequences on United States \ninitiatives in the Philippines and our relationship with the Philippine \ngovernment.\n  Both the House and Senate versions of the ATPA would allow canned \ntuna from the Andean region to enter the United States duty-free, while \nmaintaining the current tariff rates for all other countries. There are \nslight differences between the two versions: The House version allows \nall canned tuna imports from the Andean region to enter duty-free; the \nSenate version extends duty-free treatment to Andean tuna imports up to \na cap equal to 20 percent of the preceding calendar year's domestic \nproduction excluding production in American Samoa. For the Philippines, \nhowever, the House and Senate versions have the same effect. Philippine \ntuna is sold generically; purchasers of this tuna are the most price-\nsensitive, and they would gravitate to the cheaper, duty-free product.\n  Loss of these sales would mean, effectively, the collapse of the tuna \nmarket. The major suppliers to the U.S. canned tuna market are just six \ncountries: Thailand, 60 percent; the Philippines, 18 percent; \nIndonesia, 12 percent; Papua NG, 4 percent; Ecuador and Malaysia, 2 \npercent each. Of the six, Ecuador is the only one of the six that would \nbenefit from the proposed trade preference, to the sharp detriment of \nthe Philippines. The Philippine government estimates that the \nimplementation of the ATPA preference would affect 24,000 workers \ndirectly, and another 150,000 indirectly.\n  Moreover, it is the economy of Mindanao, where the entire tuna-\ncanning industry is located, that would be especially hard hit. It is \non this southernmost island that the poverty level is acute and \nterrorist activity is concentrated; a number of civilians have been \nkidnapped or murdered there by Abu Sayef, an extremist Islamic group, \nand two Americans are currently being held there.\n  The ramifications of this legislation will almost certainly undercut \nthe Philippine government's efforts in Mindanao. It will undercut U.S. \nefforts\n\n[[Page S4697]]\n\nas well, since the U.S. government through USAID has provided over $20 \nmillion in fiscal year 2001 and fiscal year 2002 in ESF for economic \ndevelopment in Mindanao, and the fiscal year 2003 budget request \nincludes a further $20 million; ATPA would seriously compromise those \ninvestments.\n  It will of course be argued that the ATPA provision will strengthen \nthe Andean economies and enable them better to resist terrorist \nencroachments. But our efforts to strengthen these economies should not \ncome at the cost of making anti-terrorist efforts in the Philippines \nmore difficult. Surely that is not the intent, but it could well be an \nunintentional but highly regrettable consequence of the legislation.\n  Given the likelihood of grave, harmful consequences for the \nPhilippines, I urge my colleagues to work toward a constructive \nsolution to the problem posed by the ATPA provision that would give \nduty-free entry to canned tuna from the Andean countries. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record the discussion of this \nissue which appears in today's New York Times.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the New York times via Dow Jones, May 21, 2002]\n\n\n                           quandary on trade\n\n                          (By Keith Bradsher)\n\n       General Santos City, the Philippines, May 16, 2002--How \n     should the United States set its tariffs and trade rules, \n     globally or country-by-country?\n       It is no arid academic debate to the tuna fishermen of this \n     knockabout port city on the south coast of Mindanao, nor to \n     sugar cutters in the Caribbean or garment workers in \n     Pakistan. Faraway changes in American fine print can have \n     very real, sometimes unintended consequences.\n       A move in Congress to extend trade preferences to Andean \n     nations, in part to help wean their economies off coca \n     production, could lead to the layoff of thousands of Muslim \n     workers in the tuna industry here, even as American troops \n     help the Philippine army fight Abu Sayyaf Muslim insurgents \n     in this region.\n       In Pakistan, officials have struggled to win a larger quota \n     for textile shipments to the United States as a reward for \n     Islamabad's help during the conflict in Afghanistan. And in \n     the Caribbean, the emergence of any especially pro-American \n     government brings a request for a larger quota to ship sugar \n     to the high-priced, highly protected American market.\n       By returning to the pre-1922 practice of awarding \n     preferential trade treatment to certain countries and \n     regions, often for political rather than economic reasons, \n     Washington now finds itself constantly badgered for trade \n     concessions by whatever friendly nation is in the news at any \n     given moment.\n       This is the problem that most `favored nation' status was \n     supposed to solve. When countries won that status--as nearly \n     all of America's trading partners did in recent decades--they \n     were assured that their exports would get the same tariff \n     treatment as any other, and that generally, concessions \n     awarded to one would be awarded to all.\n       After the ruinous bilateral trade competition in Europe in \n     the 1930's, the United States backed a global adoption of the \n     same approach, leading in the decades after World War II to \n     the international trade rules enshrined in the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and later to the creation of \n     the World Trade Organization.\n       `The history of trade negotiations basically was that, \n     because of the bilateral special deals that inevitably made \n     other nations unhappy, we came around to most-favored-nation \n     treatment and GATT negotiations,' said William Cline, a \n     senior economist at the Institute for International Economics \n     in Washington.\n       Up through the 1980's, most economists criticized regional \n     trade agreements as just as bad as bilateral deals. Beyond \n     making winners of some countries and losers of others, \n     regional blocs can be bad for global efficiency, by prompting \n     importers to favor a higher-cost producer within the bloc \n     over a lower-cost producer outside whose goods are still \n     subject to high tariffs and quotas.\n       Global trade agreements minimize such drawbacks, because \n     these days very few countries remain outside them. But global \n     treaties are becoming increasingly difficult to conclude. The \n     last was wrapped up in Geneva in 1993; talks meant to produce \n     the next one did not get under way until last November in \n     Doha, Qatar, and are expected to take years.\n       But the regional free trade concept has become fashionable \n     again, in great part because of the success of the European \n     Union, which hugely increased trade among its 15 members by \n     eliminating tariffs and trade barriers. It helped inspire the \n     1992 North American Free Trade Agreement--joining the United \n     States, Canada and Mexico--as well as several other regional \n     groupings.\n       One provision of the Nafta treaty helped set off the \n     dispute now roiling American efforts to retain the support of \n     the Philippines in the war on terrorism.\n       Among the tariffs to be eliminated within North America by \n     the treaty is the American duty on canned tuna imported from \n     Mexico. It will not disappear until 2008, and for the moment \n     it means little because Mexico, well north of the equatorial \n     waters where the best fishing grounds are found, has a tiny \n     tuna industry. But tuna from other countries is subject to \n     duty of up to 35 percent, creating a big incentive for Mexico \n     to build up its tuna fleet, despite the high labor and fuel \n     costs for the long journeys to where the tuna swim.\n       Several smaller Central American and Caribbean nations also \n     have small tuna fleets; three years ago, Congress agreed to \n     phase out tuna duties for them on the same timetable.\n       To the Andean nations of South America, these concessions \n     posed a serious threat--that preferential access to the \n     United States would soon make big new competitors out of \n     Mexico and Central America. The United States had lowered \n     tariffs on many products from Andean nations like Ecuador and \n     Colombia in 1991, but canned tuna was not among them. When \n     the 1991 concessions came up for renewal last year, the \n     Andean nations, supported by Starkist, demanded that they be \n     expanded to include canned tuna.\n       Ecuador has a huge tuna fishing fleet, and Colombia a \n     smaller one; both countries are eager to create jobs that do \n     not depend on narcotics trafficking. That persuaded the House \n     of Representatives to approve a bill earlier this year that \n     would immediately eliminate duty on Andean tuna.\n       A more limited bill that would phase out duty on about a \n     third of current shipments is before the Senate as part of a \n     broader trade bill. If it passes, differences between the \n     provisions would be worked out in a conference of senators \n     and representatives.\n       Now it is the Philippines' turn to feel threatened. Letting \n     Ecuador and Colombia, but not the Philippines, ship tuna to \n     the United States duty free would be both unfair and unwise, \n     officials in Manila are warning, because of the hardship it \n     would create in this poor, Muslim and sometimes rebellious \n     part of the country, where terrorists are believed to be \n     active. ``We understand you want to do this because of \n     narcotics,'' said Manuel A. Roxas II, the country's secretary \n     of trade and industry, ``but terrorism is just as \n     important.''\n       Washington has been on notice for some time that this kind \n     of chain reaction of anger and demands for relief was likely \n     to develop. An influential report by the United States Tariff \n     Commission foresaw that special deals for some countries \n     would ``lead to claims from states outside the agreement \n     which, if granted, defeat the purpose of the treaties, and \n     which, if not granted, occasion the preferring of a charge of \n     disloyalty to treaty obligations.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/22/senate-section/article/S4697-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI.

Mr President, I would like to extend my warmest \nwelcome to the newest democracy to join the family of nations. This \nweek, after a long and arduous struggle, the nation of East Timor \nofficially celebrated it independence from Indonesia.\n  This has been a long and hard fought process for the people of East \nTimor. For 300 years, they were a colony of Portugal. Then upon the end \nof colonial rule in 1975, and a brief period of independence, East \nTimor was annexed to Indonesia.\n  In August of 1999, the people of East Timor voted in favor of \nindependence from Indonesia. This historic moment regrettably set off a \ntragic wave of violence that left much of the country in devastation. \nWhile the people of East Timor have come a great distance since that \nmoment, there is still much rebuilding and healing to do.\n  In January of 2000, the United Nations International Commission of \nInquiry into East Timor concluded that the terror, destruction and \ndisplacement of people that occurred would not have been possible \nwithout the involvement of the Indonesian military during August of \n2002. During that same period, some 250,000 East Timorese fled to West \nTimor, while there are still 55,000 refuges who have not been \nrepatriated.\n  For the people of East Timor to move forward and have positive \nrelations with their Indonesian neighbors, it is vital that these \nfindings be investigated and those who are found guilty of committing \ncrimes against humanity be brought to justice. The Indonesian \ngovernment has taken an important step in this matter by establishing \nan ad hoc Human Rights Court for East Timor, however, this court has \nits own short-comings. By limiting the scope of inquires to atrocities \nalleged after the August referendum, it has effectively blocked the \nprosecution of high-level military officials who are believed to have \nmasterminded the violence. Without the ability to investigate and bring \nto justice those involved in human rights abuses throughout East \nTimor's time as part of Indonesia, those who have suffered will be \nunable to move forward in their lives.\n  While we cannot forget the injustices of the past, this week is also \na time to look forward. East Timor has the opportunity to build a \nvibrant and prosperous nation. The task of developing a thriving \ndemocracy is an ongoing process. It requires a respect for the rule of \nlaw and the ability to share differing opinions. I am confidant that \nthe people of East Timor will met these challenges as they have the \nothers before them; and they have taken a positive step by voting to \nsign the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights as their \nlegislature's first act.\n  While many of these steps the people of East Timor must take for \nthemselves, the United States and our fellow democracies will still \nplay a vital role in the hopes of East Timorese. Given the level of \ndestruction, it is important that the United States and other nations \ncontinue foreign aid in an effort to enable the East Timorese to \nprovide vital services such as education, shelter, and healthcare to \ntheir people. Also, the established democracies of the world can \nprovide valuable insight into the running of democratic institutions as \nthe government of East Timor undertakes the responsibilities of full \nsovereignty. These and other forms of aid will play a vital role in the \nability of East Timor to mature as an established nation.\n  Lastly, this momentous occasion would not have been possible without \nthe perserverance of the people of East Timor and supportive non-\ngovernmental organizations such as the East Timor Action Network, and I \ncommend them on their efforts. The people of East Timor have endured \nmuch to gain their freedom, and I wish them the best in their newfound \nindependence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/22/senate-section/article/S4698-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PARKINSON'S DISEASE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I chaired a hearing on Parkinson's \nDisease in the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee. I was profoundly touched by the victims of \nthis disease who came to testify and by the many, many victims, \nfamilies and advocates who came to Washington to put a human face on \nthis horrible disease.

I live in \n     Palo Alto, California and I am in the 4th grade at Escondido \n     School.\n       When I was a little baby my Mom found out she had \n     Parkinson's Disease. I was with my Mom, but I don't really \n     remember when the doctor told her she had a bad disease that \n     gets worse and worse and doesn't have a cure. I know that now \n     there are lots of things I can't do with my Mom and sometimes \n     I feel like I have to take care her instead of her taking \n     care of me.\n       I learned that Parkinson's Disease is when your brain \n     doesn't produce enough dopamine. Dopamine is important \n     because it tells your body how to move. My Mom's body tremors \n     and she can't write things down or if she does no on can read \n     it, not even her. She gets disabled to walk so she rides my \n     scooter around the house (I'm not allowed to ride in the \n     house though). And sometimes she can't even walk until her \n     medicine starts working so my Dad and I get things for her. \n     She takes tons of pills every day but the medicine or the \n     disease causes more problems for her so my Mom tries new \n     medicines and different things a lot to try to get better.\n       Our whole family works hard to help find a cure for \n     Parkinson's. My mom talks about Parkinson's to the newspapers \n     or on the news whenever she can and sometimes my name or \n     picture is shown too! We had a charity art show at our house \n     and Uncle Dan's art raised a lot of money. I even sold a \n     painting and all the money went to Parkinson's research. My \n     mom said that if researchers got enough money from Congress \n     and from regular people that scientists could find a cure in \n     5 or 10 years. That would be good because I won't be a grown-\n     up yet and my Mom will get better and we could go iceskating \n     together.\n       But now we have a big problem. I heard President Bush say \n     that all cloning research has to stop. My Mom was really \n     upset because she said the President and some people in \n     Congress want to stop researchers from finding a cure for \n     Parkinson's and lots of other diseases that make millions of \n     people sick. I don't get it.\n       One part of the Pledge of Allegiance says ``Liberty and \n     Justice for all''. I don't think the government is giving us \n     much liberty or justice--at all!\n       People are scared of the kind of cloning that would make \n     new people (reproductive cloning). But what's so scary about \n     finding a cure for my Mom? That kind of cloning is called \n     therapeutic cloning and doesn't make people or kittens or \n     anything like that--it would just help my Mom's brain work \n     again like it is supposed to.\n       I think that the people who make the laws should make rules \n     so scientists won't do bad things with research. But can't \n     they still be allowed to do the good research? My mom said \n     the Brownback bill that is being voted on Congress soon \n     wouldn't allow scientists to do the good kind of research \n     that would help her. She also said that this law wants to put \n     people like her in jail if they try to get cured. That's just \n     dumb! My Mom isn't doing anything wrong by just trying to get \n     well.\n       I thought I might want to be a scientist when I grow up but \n     I don't think so any more. I just want to find a cure for my \n     Mom. I guess I'll become the President of the United States \n     so that I can make good laws that help people and cure \n     diseases. I'll let scientists do their work and make all \n     kinds of new discoveries.\n       I know that this isn't the most important thing for \n     everyone. But I think that if someone in your family was sick \n     and you were worried, that you would do everything you could \n     to help them get better. You wouldn't make laws so that a \n     cure would not be found and you wouldn't put them in jail.\n       Please help find a cure for my Mom and everyone else that \n     needs one instead of making it harder. I'm doing as much as I \n     can do to help my Mom and other people too (when I'm not in \n     school or doing sports or playing violin, but Mommy says that \n     helps her too). This is really important to a lot of people. \n     Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/22/senate-section/article/S4698-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4698-S4699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DIANE CALLAWAY\n\n Mr. BIDEN.

Mr. President, today, I rise to recognize the \nlegacy of a true Kansan, Floyd Boldridge. Mr. Boldridge was a life-long \nfarmer and family man. During his life, he was loved by not only his \nfamily but by the community of Atchison, Kansas as well. During his \nfuneral, La Rochelle Young, of my staff read a tribute to her uncle, \nFloyd Boldridge. As we prepare to honor our loved ones during the \nupcoming Memorial Day holiday, I think it is a fitting tribute to Mr. \nBoldridge to enter his tribute into the record of the United States \nSenate. I join with La Rochelle and Mr. Boldridge's ten children, \nGloria Wallingford, Virginia Carol Harvey, Shirley Gooch, Betty King, \nThelma Hibler, Leonard Boldridge, Dennis Boldridge, Brenda Nettles, \nAnnette Boldridge and Eric Harvey.\n  I ask that Mr. Boldridge's tribute be printed in the Record.\n  The tribute follows:\n\n                     The Legacy of Floyd Boldridge\n\n           (By La Rochelle Murray, Niece of Floyd Boldridge)\n\n       January 31, 2000\n       A legacy of love, of family, of commitment and of integrity \n     can be said of the man who many called father, grandfather, \n     uncle, cousin, brother, friend, bull and baby boy. Floyd \n     Boldridge was the youngest of six rambunctious boys. And as \n     the ``baby'' of the family, he was loved, protected and \n     cherished in many ways. In fact, one of the brothers' \n     favorite past times was bouncing ``baby boy'' on the bed and \n     then lovingly watch him bounce off onto the floor. Perhaps, \n     this is where Uncle Floyd developed his sparkling \n     personality, his infectious laughter that could penetrate any \n     person or situation, and the indescribable bond between his \n     brothers and his fierce commitment to his family and friends.\n       As a young man, Uncle Floyd grew up in a spiritual family \n     that not only took pride in the teachings of Christ, honesty \n     and hard work but also took extreme pride in the Boldridge \n     name as well. This was shown throughout Uncle Floyd's life. \n     Like most large families, each son possessed a special gift--\n     one that was different from the other brothers. However, \n     instead of dwelling on the others' gift, each brother \n     nurtured and cultivated his gift in order to combine their \n     gifts with one another and sustain themselves.\n       During an interview, Uncle Floyd was once asked about his \n     thoughts concerning The Great Depression. His response was \n     simplistic yet profound. He said that he did not recall \n     feeling the effects of the depression because he and his \n     brothers never wanted for anything. They pooled their \n     resources together, which allowed them to be self-sufficient \n     and continued living comfortably during one of the darkest \n     times in our nation's history. This lesson and the many other \n     lessons that he learned from his brothers was what sculpted \n     him into the energetic, fiercely loyal, loving man that his \n     children--and all of us because to Uncle Floyd, we were all \n     his family--remember today.\n       During the early years of Uncle Floyd's life, his passion \n     and zeal for life was transferred to his ever-growing family. \n     Everyone who knew Uncle Floyd knew that he was very proud of \n     his children. His love for his family surpassed everything in \n     his life and will continue to live on in the lives of his \n     children and grandchildren. There were many facets to Uncle \n     Floyd's life but none compared to the love of his children.\n       For example, when his daughter, Tammy, brought her husband, \n     Don, to meet her father for the first time, Uncle Floyd \n     positioned himself so that his five foot seven inch frame was \n     on a hill and Don, who is six feet three inches tall, was on \n     a flat portion of land. Once this was achieved, Don was eye \n     level with Uncle Floyd. It wasn't until later that Don \n     realized what had happened because he was so intimidated by \n     Tammy's father.\n       Uncle Floyd also had a passion for peace and happiness \n     between everyone. He was never one to cause conflict or allow \n     conflict to be in his presence. He had a vivacious \n     personality that allowed him to realize that life was a \n     series of challenges and having a negative or defeatist \n     attitude would only make one's life miserable. Instead, he \n     choose to look to God first for understanding and then \n     actively engage in positive actions.\n       Although Uncle Floyd was a peaceful and loving man, he was \n     also known for his enormous strength, which earned him the \n     nickname ``Bull.'' And like Sampson, everyone who tried to \n     overpower him received an often surprising and sometimes \n     painful result. For example, one of my Uncle Floyd's nephews, \n     Marvin, decided to test his uncle's strength at work. Marvin \n     made the bad decision to grab Uncle Floyd's arms. Not only \n     did Marvin say that grabbing Uncle Floyd was like grabbing a \n     hunk of steel, but remembers being turned upside down in the \n     process. All Marvin recalls of that moment was his father \n     yelling, ``Don't kill him Bull!!''\n       My father, Walter D. Murray, also remembers his first \n     introduction to Uncle Floyd. He had heard many stories \n     regarding Uncle Floyd's strength and though that he would \n     show him what strength really was. So, when he shook Uncle \n     Floyd's hand, he squeezed with all of his strength and found \n     that not only did Uncle Floyd match his strength but \n     surpassed his strength so much so that after almost falling \n     to his knees, he had to ask Uncle Floyd to release his hand.\n       Indeed Uncle Floyd loved life and lived his life to the \n     fullest and in doing so blessed our lives immeasurably. So \n     what can be said of his legacy? Uncle Floyd left us with a \n     profound legacy of love for God, his Son, Jesus Christ and \n     the Holy Spirit, peace among ourselves and love for our \n     fellow human. Like Christ, Uncle Floyd believed in treating \n     others as we would treat ourselves. That is why he cherished \n     his trips to the Holy Land. Uncle Floyd loved to share every \n     aspect of his trips to the Holy Land including Jerusalem and \n     Bethlehem. It was on one of these trips that he turned to his \n     daughter, Betty, and said, ``I am seeing with these eyes what \n     my father read to me from the Bible many years ago.''\n       Uncle Floyd was a steadfast, deeply religious man who loved \n     Christ and the Church. In fact many nights, Uncle Floyd could \n     be found in the kitchen of Campbell Chapel African Methodist \n     Episcopal Church, where he was a life-long faithful member, \n     cooking his famous cabbage or my personal favorite, fried \n     corn. And many of Uncle Floyd's friends will remember the \n     dinners he would fix after a hunting trip or even if they \n     just chose to drop in and visit him at his home.\n       Uncle Floyd also left us with the legacy of the Port \n     William Bridge. Uncle Floyd, along with his many friends, \n     worked tirelessly on achieving the dedication of this \n     historic bridge. Uncle Floyd knew the importance of \n     remembering the past in order to bridge a pathway to the \n     future. That is the reason I brought my fiance, Adrian K. \n     Young, Jr., to meet Uncle Floyd in order to gain his \n     approval. And Eric remembers when he was about to embark on \n     his career as a professional soccer player that uncle Floyd \n     said to him, ``You've now got your foot in the door--don't \n     let that door close.'' Eric now uses this premise when he is \n     coaching his soccer team.\n       So we thank you Uncle Floyd for your gift of laughter, your \n     loving manner in which you made everyone especially your \n     children feel loved and appreciated, your dynamic and often \n     times animated personality, and your legacy of love and \n     peace. We will always love you and forever cherish the time \n     we spent with you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/22/senate-section/article/S4699-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DEATH OF STEVEN PATRICK LOVATO\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nHadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America as they celebrate \ntheir 90th anniversary. Hadassah is a non-profit volunteer women's \norganization dedicated to health care, education, and advocacy. \nOriginally created to bring modern health care to the sick and \nsuffering inhabitants of Palestine, Hadassah has grown into a thriving \ninternational organization actively engaged in issues that affect the \nhealth and livelihood of Jewish people throughout the United States and \nIsrael.\n  Founded in 1912, Hadassah retains the passion and timeless values of \nits founder, Henrietta Szold, Jewish scholar and activist, who was \ndedicated to Judaism, Zionism, and the American ideal.\n  In Israel, the Hadassah Medical Organization, HMO, runs two \nhospitals, five schools, outpatient clinics, research facilities, and a \ncommunity health center. With support from over 300,000 Hadassah \nmembers worldwide, HMO offers expert treatment and tender care to more \nthan half a million people in Israel each year.\n  In the United States, Hadassah enhances the quality of American and \nJewish life through its education and Zionist youth programs. It \npromotes health awareness and provides personal enrichment and growth \nfor its members.\n  In a year long celebration, Hadassah will commemorate its 90 years of \nservice. To mark this occasion, I would like to applaud Hadassah and \nits members for their efforts to improve the lives of all the people \nthey serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/22/senate-section/article/S4700-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/22/senate-section/article/S4700-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/22/senate-section/article/S4700-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:35 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 486.

A bill to prohibit the use of taxpayer funds to advocate a \nposition that is inconsistent with existing Supreme Court precedent \nwith respect to the Second amendment; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprohibit the use of taxpayer funds to advocate a position on the \nmeaning of the Second Amendment that is inconsistent with existing \nSupreme Court precedent, as expressed in the Supreme Court case of \nUnited States v. Miller.\n  This legislation responds to the Bush Administration's recent filing \nof two unprecedented briefs to the United States Supreme Court, which \nargued that the Second Amendment establishes an individual right to \npossess firearms. In taking this position, the Justice Department \ndirectly contradicted the well-established precedents of the Supreme \nCourt, as expressed in the seminal case of United States v. Miller. In \nthat 1939 case, the Supreme Court found that the Second Amendment did \nnot establish a private right of individuals to possess firearms, but \nrather was intended to ensure the effectiveness of groups of citizen-\nsoldiers known at the time as the Militia.\n  The Court in United States v. Miller explained the historical \nbackground to the Second Amendment and issued its ruling clearly and \nunambiguously. That ruling has never been reversed, and the Court has \nfollowed it in every subsequent related case. Similarly, the precedent \nin United States v. Miller has been followed by every Justice \nDepartment over the past several decades, including the Justice \nDepartments of Presidents Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and George H.W. \nBush.\n  The meaning of the Second Amendment should not be a partisan issue. \nIn fact, it should not be a political issue. It is a legal and \nconstitutional issue. And the law on this question has been clearly \nestablished by the highest court in the land in case after case for a \nperiod of many decades.\n  Unfortunately, instead of following the law, as Attorney General \npromised to do during his confirmation hearing, the Bush Administration \nand the Justice Department have used their authority to file briefs as \na means of pursuing a partisan political agenda that flies in the face \nof established Supreme Court precedents. This is wrong. And, in my \nview, it is a misuse of taxpayer dollars.\n  Congress should not have to pass a law to ensure that the Executive \nBranch follows the Constitution, as clearly interpreted by the Supreme \nCourt. Unfortunately, in light of the Bush's Administration's latest \nactions, Congress must step in. After all, Congress's ultimate power is \nthe power of the purse. And we have a responsibility to use that power, \nwhen necessary, to ensure that the Executive Branch complies with \nconstitutional law.\n  This responsibility flows from Congress's obligation to preserve, \nprotect and defend the Constitution. It also flows from our obligation \nto ensure that taxpayer dollars are not misused. The American people \nshould not be forced to pay taxes to support an unreasonable \ninterpretation of the Second Amendment that is not only inconsistent \nwith constitutional law, but that threatens to undermine legislation \nneeded to reduce gun violence and to save lives.\n  In 1998, more than 30,000 Americans died from firearm-related deaths. \nThat is almost as many as the number of Americans who died in the \nentire Korean War. In my view, there is much that Congress needs to do \nto reduce these deaths, including enacting reasonable gun safety \nlegislation. Yet if the Bush Administration prevails in its effort to \nradically revise the Second Amendment, such laws could well be \nundermined. The end result would be more death and more families losing \nloved ones to the scourge of gun violence.\n  In fact, I would note that one week after the Bush Administration \nfiled their briefs, lawyers for accused American Taliban terrorist John \nWalker Lindh used the Administration's arguments to urge dismissal of \nthe gun charge filed against him. Now, I hope and trust that the courts \nwill quickly reject this line of argument. But why would the Bush \nAdministration want to strengthen the position of criminals and alleged \nterrorists like John Walker Lindh in the first place?\n  I have asked the Congressional Research Service whether there are any \nconstitutional precedents that would bar the Congress from adopting \nthis legislation, and the answer was ``no.'' I also would note that \nthere is precedent for Congress prohibiting the use of taxpayer dollars \nto advocate positions with which Congress disagrees. For example, \nCongress for many years prohibited the Justice Department from using \nappropriated money to overturn certain rules under our antitrust laws. \nThis responded to the filing of a brief in the Supreme Court by the \nJustice Department urging a revision of its precedents on resale price \nmaintenance, and the legislation effectively blocked the Department \nfrom filing similar briefs.\n  In conclusion, we should not allow taxpayer dollars to be used to \nmisrepresent the meaning of the Second Amendment on behalf of a \npartisan, political agenda. We should defend the Constitution against \nsuch ideological attacks. We should protect taxpayers from being forced \nto subsidize ideological gambits. And we should ensure that the \nConstitution is not misused to undermine gun safety legislation that \ncould save the lives of many innocent Americans.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the bill, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record, \nalong with some related materials about this matter.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2539\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FUNDS.\n\n       No funds appropriated to the Department of Justice or any \n     other agency may be used to file any brief or to otherwise \n     advocate before any judicial or administrative body any \n     position with respect to the meaning of the Second Amendment \n     to the Constitution that is inconsistent with existing \n     Supreme Court precedent, as expressed in United States v. \n     Miller (307 U.S. 174 (1939)).\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 12, 2002]\n\n                A Faulty Rethinking of the 2nd Amendment\n\n                            (By Jack Rakove)\n\n       Stanford, CA.--The Bush administration has found a \n     constitutional right it wants to expand. Attorney General \n     John D. Ashcroft attracted only mild interest a year ago when \n     he told the National Rifle Association, ``The text and \n     original intent of the Second Amendment clearly protect the \n     right of individuals to keep and bear firearms.''\n       Now, briefs just filed by Solicitor General Theodore Olson \n     in two cases currently being appealed to the Supreme Court \n     indicate that Mr. Ashcroft's personnel opinion has become \n     that of the United States government. This posture represents \n     an astonishing challenge to the long-settled doctrine that \n     the right to bear arms protected by the Second Amendment is \n     closely tied to membership in the militia. It is no secret \n     that controversy about the meaning of the amendment has \n     escalated in recent years. As evidence grew that a \n     significant portion of the American electorate favored the \n     regulation of firearms, the N.R.A. and its allies insisted \n     ever more vehemently that the private right to possess arms \n     is a constitutional absolute. This opinion, once seen as \n     marginal, has become an article of faith on the right, and \n     Republican politicians have in turn had to acknowledge its \n     force.\n       The two cases under appeal do not offer an ideal test of \n     the administration's new views. One concerns a man charged \n     with violating a federal statute prohibiting individuals \n     under domestic violence restraining orders from carrying \n     guns; the other involves a man convicted of owning machine \n     guns, which is illegal under federal law. In both cases, the \n     defendants cite the Second Amendment as protecting their \n     right to have the firearms. The unsavory facts may explain \n     why Mr. Olson is using these cases as vehicles to announce \n     the administration's constitutional position while urging the \n     Supreme Court not to accept the appeals.\n       The court last examined this issue in 1939 in United States \n     v. Miller. There it held that\n\n[[Page S4706]]\n\n     the Second Amendment was designed to ensure the effectiveness \n     of the militia, not to guarantee a private right to possess \n     firearms. The Miller case, though it did not fully explore \n     the entire constitutional history, has guided the \n     government's position on firearm issues for the past six \n     decades.\n       If the court were to take up the two cases on appeal, it is \n     far from clear that the Justice Department's new position \n     would prevail. The plain text of the Second Amendment--``A \n     well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a \n     free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms \n     shall not be infringed''--does not support the unequivocal \n     view that Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Olson have put forth. The \n     amendment refers to the right of the people, rather than the \n     individual person of the Fifth Amendment. And the phrase \n     ``keep and bear arms'' is, as most commentators note, a \n     military reference.\n       Nor do the debates surrounding the adoption of the \n     amendment support the idea that the framers were thinking of \n     an individual right to own arms. The relevant proposals \n     offered by the state ratification conventions of 1787-88 all \n     dealt with the need to preserve the militia as an alternative \n     to a standing army. The only recorded discussion of the \n     amendment in the House of Representatives concerned whether \n     religious dissenters should be compelled to serve in the \n     militia. And in 1789, the Senate deleted one clause \n     explicitly defining the militia as ``composed of the body of \n     the people.'' In excising this phrase, the Senate gave \n     ``militia'' a narrower meaning than it otherwise had, thereby \n     making the Ashcroft interpretation harder to sustain.\n       Advocates of the individual right respond to these \n     objections in three ways.\n       They argue, first that when Americans used the word \n     militia, they ordinarily meant the entire adult male \n     population capable of bearing arms. But Article I of the \n     Constitution defines the militia as an institution under the \n     joint regulation of the national and state governments, and \n     the debates of 1787-89 do not demonstrate that the framers \n     believed that the militia should forever by synonymous with \n     the entire population.\n       A second argument revolves around the definition of ``the \n     people.'' Those on the N.R.A. side believe ``the people'' \n     means ``all persons.'' But in Article I we also read that the \n     people will elect the House of Representatives--and the \n     determination of who can vote will be left to state law, in \n     just the way that militia service would remain subject to \n     Congressional and state regulation.\n       The third argument addresses the critical phrase deleted in \n     the Senate. Rather than concede that the Senate knew what it \n     was doing, these commentators contend that the deletion was \n     more a matter of careless editing.\n       This argument is faulty because legal interpretation \n     generally assumes that lawmakers act with clear purpose. More \n     important, the Senate that made this critical deletion was \n     dominated by Federalists who were skeptical of the milita's \n     performance during the Revolutionary War and opposed to the \n     idea that the future of American defense lay with the militia \n     rather than a regular army. They had sound reasons not to \n     commit the national government to supporting a mass militia, \n     and thus to prefer a phrasing implying that the militia need \n     not embrace the entire adult male population if Congress had \n     good reason to require otherwise. The evidence of text and \n     history makes it very hard to argue for an expansive \n     individual right to keep arms.\n       There is one striking curiosity to the Bush \n     administration's advancing its position at this time. \n     Advocates of the individual-right interpretation typically \n     argue that an armed populace is the best defense against the \n     tyranny of our own government. And yet the Bush \n     administration seems quite willing to compromise essential \n     civil liberties in the name of security. It is sobering to \n     think that the constitutional right the administration values \n     so highly is the right to bear arms, that peculiar product of \n     an obsolete debate over the danger of standing armies--and \n     this at a time when our standing army is the most powerful \n     the world has known.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 10, 2002]\n\n                            Guns and Justice\n\n       The U.S. Solicitor General has a duty to defend acts of \n     Congress before the Supreme Court. This week, Solicitor \n     General Ted Olson--and by extension his bosses, Attorney \n     General John Ashcroft and President Bush--took a position \n     regarding guns that will undermine that mission.\n       Historically, the Justice Department has adopted a narrow \n     reading of the Constitution's Second Amendment, which states \n     that ``a well regulated militia being necessary to the \n     security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and \n     bear arms shall not be infringed.'' Along with nearly all \n     courts in the past century, it has read that as protecting \n     only the public's collective right to bear arms in the \n     context of militia service. Now the administration has \n     reversed this view. In a pair of appeals, Mr. Olson contends \n     that ``the Second Amendment more broadly protects the rights \n     of individuals, including persons who are not members of any \n     militia . . . to possess and bear their own firearms.'' Mr. \n     Ashcroft insists the department remains prepared to defend \n     all federal gun laws. Having given away its strongest \n     argument, however, it will be doing so with its hands tied \n     behind its back.\n       Laws will now be defended not as presumptively valid but as \n     narrow exceptions to a broad constitutional right--one \n     subject, as Mr. Olson put it, only to ``reasonable \n     restrictions designed to prevent possession by unfit persons \n     or to restrict the possession of types of firearms that are \n     particularly suited to criminal misuse.'' This may sound like \n     a common-sense balancing act. But where exactly does the \n     Second Amendment, if it guarantees individual rights, permit \n     ``reasonable restrictions''? And where does its protection \n     exempt firearms that might be well suited for crime?\n       Mr. Ashcroft has compared the gun ownership right with the \n     First Amendment's protection of speech--which can be limited \n     only in a fashion narrowly tailored to accomplish compelling \n     state interests. If that's the model, most federal gun laws \n     would sooner or later fall. After all, it would not be \n     constitutional to subject someone to a background check \n     before permitting him to worship or to make a political \n     speech. If gun ownership is truly a parallel right, why would \n     the Brady background check be constitutional?\n       The Justice Department traditionally errs on the other \n     side--arguing for constitutional interpretations that \n     increase congressional flexibility and law enforcement policy \n     options. The great weight of judicial precedent holds that \n     there is no fundamental individual right to own a gun. \n     Staking out a contrary position may help ingratiate the Bush \n     administration to the gun lobby. But it greatly disserves the \n     interests of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 14, 2002]\n\n                   An Ominous Reversal on Gun Rights\n\n       Using a footnote in a set of Supreme Court briefs, Attorney \n     General John Ashcroft announced a radical shift last week in \n     six decades of government policy toward the rights of \n     Americans to own guns. Burying the change in fine print \n     cannot disguise the ominous implications for law enforcement \n     or Mr. Ashcroft's betrayal of his public duty.\n       The footnote declares that, contrary to longstanding and \n     bipartisan interpretation of the Second Amendment, the \n     Constitution ``broadly protects the rights of individuals'' \n     to own firearms. This view and the accompanying legal \n     standard Mr. Ashcroft has suggested--equating gun ownership \n     with core free speech rights--could make it extremely \n     difficult for the government to regulate firearms, as it has \n     done for decades. That position comports with Mr. Ashcroft's \n     long-held personal opinion, which he expressed a year ago in \n     a letter to his close allies at the National Rifle \n     Association. But it is a position at odds with both history \n     and the Constitution's text. As the Supreme Court correctly \n     concluded in a 1939 decision that remains the key legal \n     precedent on the subject, the Second Amendment protects only \n     those rights that have ``some reasonable relationship to the \n     preservation of efficiency of a well-regulated militia.'' By \n     not viewing the amendment as a basic, individual right, this \n     decision left room for broad gun ownership regulation. The \n     footnote is also at odds with Mr. Ashcroft's pledge at his \n     confirmation hearing that his personal ideology would not \n     drive Justice Department legal policies.\n       It is hard to take seriously Mr. Ashcroft's assertion that \n     the Bush administration remains committed to the vigorous \n     defense and enforcement of all federal gun laws. Mr. \n     Ashcroft, after all, is an official whose devotion to the gun \n     lobby extends to granting its request to immediately destroy \n     records of gun purchases amassed in the process of conducting \n     Brady law background checks even though they might be useful \n     for tracking weapons purchases by suspected terrorists.\n       The immediate effect of the Bush Justice Department's \n     expansive reading of the Second Amendment is to undermine law \n     enforcement by calling into question valuable state and \n     federal gun restrictions on the books, and by handing \n     dangerous criminals a potent new weapon for challenging their \n     convictions. What it all adds up to is a gift to pro-gun \n     extremists, and a shabby deal for everyone else.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 2540. A bill to amend the definition of low-income families for \npurposes of the United States Housing Act of 1937; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise to bring the Senate's \nattention to a matter that is slowing Los Alamos County, NM, in its \nefforts to fully recover from the Cerro Grande Fire of May 10, 2000.\n  It is an amazing irony to me that Los Alamos National Laboratory, in \nrecent years facing declines in personnel, is again in the national \nnews for its ability to help with counter-terrorism on many fronts. \nAlong with this national attention and the needs of our Homeland \nSecurity Agency for advanced scientific means to detect and deter \nnuclear and biological attacks, LANL is now in the process of filling \nabout 1,000 new positions.\n  The irony is that the Cerro Grande fire severely reduced available \nhousing in Los Alamos two years before our Nation turns once again to \nLos Alamos for its scientific talents. A major deterrent to new hires \nis the lack of housing\n\n[[Page S4707]]\n\nchoices in Los Alamos. The housing market is even tighter because of \nthe loss of about 400 housing units through the devastating Cerro \nGrande Fire. Los Alamos has a population of about 18,000 people.\n  While we have Federal programs to help low and moderate income \nAmericans find good housing, in Los Alamos these programs are \nineffective due to the current practice of averaging Los Alamos County \nand Santa Fe County incomes into one Metropolitan Statistical Area, \nMSA. This is harmful to Los Alamos residents, where the median income \nis about $82,000 because the Federal programs use the MSA median income \nof about $65,000 to determine participation. Eighty percent of median \nincome is a standard measure.\n  Santa Fe's median income of about $40,000 thus becomes a significant \nfactor for a Los Alamos teacher, fireman, or policeman seeking \nsubsidized Federal assistance. Their incomes in Los Alamos are deemed \nto be too high to qualify for housing because 80 percent of $65,000 is \nused as the maximum allowed for assistance. Thus, $52,000 becomes the \neffective ceiling for assistance, when the actual 80 percent ceiling \nfigure for Los Alamos incomes is about $65,000. This makes a huge \ndifference in a high-priced and competitive market. The result is that \ndevelopers are discouraged from applying for tax credits and other \nassistance programs because their applicants do not qualify to live in \ntheir new or remodeled housing projects.\n  The Los Alamos County Manager reports that not a single County \nemployee is eligible for housing created by the Low Income Housing Tax \nCredits. He, like many residents and the LANL recruiting effort, remain \nconcerned that the limited housing supply has raised rents and sales \nprices. Los Alamos County is also landlocked by Federal government land \nownership.\n  There is a desperate need for affordable housing at a time when, once \nagain, our nation is calling upon LANL for helping to meet its internal \nand international security needs.\n  This situation also exists around the New York City area, where \nWestchester County incomes unfairly raise the metropolitan average to \nthe detriment of the metropolitan housing market. In that case, \nCongress agreed to separate Westchester County to ease the housing \nmarket situation. All I am asking in my bill is to accomplish the same \ngoal by allowing Los Alamos County to stand on its own in terms of HUD \nmedian income requirements. My bill does not simultaneously lower the \nSanta Fe County income to its actual median, but, rather, allows Santa \nFe County to continue to use the higher median, because the Santa Fe \nhousing market is also very unusual, and the two-county average helps \nmake more Santa Fe residents eligible for Federal assistance on many \nfronts.\n  I appreciate my colleagues attention to this matter, and I know the \nresidents of Los Alamos County will be grateful for this assistance to \nallow more of them to make use of available HUD and other affordable \nhousing assistance programs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2540\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LOW-INCOME FAMILIES DEFINITION.\n\n       Section 3(b)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 \n     (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(2)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``and for Los Alamos County in the State \n     of New Mexico,'' after ``State of New York,'';\n       (2) by inserting ``, Los Alamos,'' after ``does not include \n     Westchester'';\n       (3) by inserting ``; Los Alamos,'' after ``portion included \n     Westchester''; and\n       (4) by inserting before the period at the end the \n     following: ``; and Los Alamos County, New Mexico, in the \n     Santa Fe metropolitan area''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. \n                               Grassley):\n\n  S. 2541. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to establish \npenalties for aggravated identity theft, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Identity Theft \nPenalty Enhancement Act of 2002 along with my colleagues Senators Kyl, \nSessions, and Grassley.\n  This bill is the culmination of efforts by the Department of Justice \nto craft legislation that will crack down on the most serious identity \nthefts in the Nation, and I am pleased to be working with the Justice \nDepartment on this legislation. In fact, Attorney General Ashcroft and \nI announced this bill together earlier this month.\n  This legislation will make it easier for prosecutors to target those \nidentity thieves who, as is so often the case, steal an identity for \nthe purpose of committing one or more other crimes.\n  Many serious crimes, even including terrorism, are aided by stolen \nidentifies.\n  For instance, According to a January article in the Baltimore Sun, \n``six of the 19 hijackers from September 11 were using Social Security \nnumbers illegally. Another man linked to al-Qaida, Lofti Raissi, a 27-\nyear old Algerian pilot from London who is believed to have trained \nfour of the suicide hijackers, was identified in British court papers \nas having used the Social Security number of Dorothy Hansen, a retired \nfactory worker from Jersey City, NJ, who died in 1991.''\n  Attorney General Ashcroft last week cited the example of an Algerian \nnational now facing charges of identity theft who allegedly stole the \nidentifies of 21 members of a health club in Cambridge, MA. The \nAlgerian national then transferred those stolen identities to one of \nthe individuals convicted in the failed plot to bomb Los Angeles \nInternational Airport in 1999.\n  In another case, Michelle Brown of Los Angeles had her Social \nSecurity number stolen in 1999, and it was used to charge $50,000 in \nher name, including a $32,000 truck, a $5,000 liposuction operation and \na year-long residential lease. Even worse, while assuming Michelle's \nname, the perpetrator also became the object of an arrest warrant for \ndrug smuggling in Texas.\n  In another case recently announced by the Justice Department, Joseph \nKalady of Chicago was charged just last week with trying to fake his \nown death using the identity of another. Kalady, who was awaiting trial \non charges of counterfeiting birth certificates, Social Security cards \nand driver's licenses last December, allegedly suffocated a homeless \nman and sought to have him cremated under Mr. Kalady's identity in \norder to fake his own death and avoid prosecution.\n\n  The stories go on and on, and it is those stories that make the \nlegislation we introduce today so vital.\n  Let me just outline what this bill would do.\n  First, the bill would create a separate crime of ``aggravated \nidentity theft'' for any person who uses the identity of another person \nto commit certain serious, federal crimes.\n  Specifically, the legislation would provide for an additional two-\nyear penalty for any individual convicted of committing one of the \nfollowing serious Federal crimes while using the identity of another \nperson: stealing another's identity in order to illegally obtain \ncitizenship in the United States; stealing another's identity to obtain \na passport or visa; using another's identity to remain in the United \nStates illegally after a visa has expired or an individual has been \nordered to depart this country; stealing an individual's identity to \ncommit bank, wire or mail fraud, or to steal from employee pension \nfunds; and other serious federal crimes, all of them felonies.\n  Furthermore, the legislation would provide for an additional five \nyear penalty for any individual that uses the stolen identity of \nanother person to commit any one of the enumerated Federal terrorism \ncrimes found in 18 U.S.C. 2332b(g)(5)(B). These crime include: the \ndestruction of aircraft; the assassination or kidnapping of high level \nFederal officials; bombings; hostage taking; providing material support \nto terrorism organizations; and other terrorist crimes.\n  Aggravated Identity Theft is a separate crime, not just a sentencing \nenhancement. And the two-year and five-year penalties for aggravated \nidentity theft must be served consecutively to the sentence for the \nunderlying crime.\n  This bill also strengthens the ability of law enforcement to go after \nidentity thieves and to provide their case.\n\n[[Page S4708]]\n\n  First, the bill adds the word ``possesses'' to current law, in order \nto allow law enforcement to target individuals who possess the identity \ndocuments of another person with the intent to commit a crime. Current \nFederal law prohibits the transfer or use of false identity documents, \nbut does not specifically ban the possession of hose documents with the \nintent to commit a crime. So if law enforcement discovers a stash of \nidentity documents with the clear intent to use those documents to \ncommit other crimes, the person who possesses those documents will now \nbe subject to prosecution.\n  Second, the legislation amends current law to make it clear that if a \nperson uses a false identity ``in connection with'' another Federal \ncrime, and the intent of the underlying Federal crime is proven, then \nthe intent to use the false identity to commitment that crime need not \nbe separately proved. This simply makes the job of the prosecutor \neasier when an individual is convicted of a Federal crime and use a \nfalse identity in collection with that Crime.\n  This legislation also increases the maximum penalty for identity \ntheft under current law from three years to five years.\n  And finally, the legislation we introduce today will clarify that the \ncurrent 25-year maximum sentence for identity theft in facilitation of \ninternational terrorism also applies to identity theft in facilitation \nof domestic terrorism as well.\n  Identity theft is a crime on the rise in America, and it is a crime \nwith severe consequences not only for the individual victims of the \nidentity theft, but for every consumer and every financial institution \nas well.\n  Fraud losses at financial institutions are running well over one \nbillion dollars annually. VISA alone reported identity theft related \nfraud losses of more than $114 million in 2000, a 43 percent increase \nin just four years.\n  And for victims, the losses can be staggering. The average loss from \none identity theft now ranges about $18,000. Just imagine, somebody \ntakes a credit card receipt out of a trash-can, makes a few calls, and \nbefore you know it you've lost $18,000.\n  And even though an individual victim may not be forced to pay in the \nend, the credit card companies, financial institutions and other \nbusinesses absorb the loss and pass it on to all consumers, the time \nand effort required to regain your identity can be quite debilitating. \nIn fact, on average it takes a full year and a half to regain one's \nidentity once stolen. In many instances, it can take many more years \nthan that.\n  Additionally, some victims are even subject to criminal investigation \nor even arrest because a criminal has taken their identity and used it \nto commit a crime. In fact, the FTC tells us that they have received \n1,300 complaints from victims alleging that they have been subject to \ninvestigation, arrest or even conviction as a result of their identity \nbeing stolen.\n  Identity theft comes in many forms and can be perpetrated in many \nways, and that is why I have worked for many years now with Senator Kyl \nand others to put some safeguards into the law that might better \nprevent the fraud from occurring in the first place, and to crack down \non identity thieves.\n  And other legislation I have introduced would put into place certain \nprocedural safeguards to protect credit card numbers, personal \ninformation, and other key data from potential identity thieves.\n  The legislation we introduce today is meant to beef up the law in \nterms of what happens after an identity theft takes place. In seriously \nenhancing the penalties for identity thieves who commit other Federal \ncrimes, we mean to send a strong signal to all those who would commit \nthis increasingly popular crime that the relatively free ride they have \nexperienced in recent years is over. No longer will prosecutors decline \nto take identity theft seriously. No longer will identity thieves get \noff with just a slap on the wrist, if they are prosecuted at all. Under \nthis legislation, penalties will be severe, prosecution will be more \nlikely, and cases against identity thieves will be easier to prove.\n  Every day in this country serious criminals and criminal \norganizations are stealing and falsifying identities with the purpose \nof doing serious harm to common citizens, government officials, or even \nour Nation itself. It is time we did something about it, and this bill \nis an important step in that process.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2541\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish a medicare demonstration project under which incentive \npayments are provided in certain areas in order to stabilize, maintain, \nor increase access to primary care services for individuals enrolled \nunder part B of such title; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare \nIncentive Access Act of 2002. I am pleased that Congressman Rick Larsen \nwill introduce companion legislation in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n  As my colleagues may be hearing, Medicare beneficiaries across the \ncountry are reporting increasing difficulty finding a physician willing \nto accept their Medicare coverage. In fact, according to the American \nMedical Association, nearly 30 percent of family physicians nationwide \nare not accepting new Medicare patients, and 57 percent of Washington \nState physicians are limiting the number or dropping all Medicare \npatients from their practices.\n  There is no doubt that we need to reform Medicare, and I am \nparticularly concerned with the Medicare physician fee schedule issued \nby the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS. Although CMS \ninsists that physician payment rates will increase more than the \ngeneral rate of inflation, I am extremely concerned that any additional \nphysician payment reductions may dramatically affect the quality of \ncare offered to beneficiaries and further exacerbate the access \nproblems so many of our constituents are now facing.\n  Unfortunately, there seems to be a prevailing idea that government \nprograms should automatically pay less than private insurers for the \nsame quality care. I am especially concerned that providers serving a \ndisproportionate number of Medicare and Medicaid patients are facing \nunsustainable fee reductions.\n  In its March 2002 report, the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee, \nMedPAC, the independent Federal body that advises Congress on Medicare \npayment issues, weighed in on the current Medicare reimbursement rate \ndebate. MedPAC observes that ``provider entry and exit data provide \ninformation regarding adequacy of the current level of payments.''\n  Keeping in mind that MedPAC's goal is to ensure that Medicare's \npayment rates cover the costs that efficient providers would incur in \nbeneficiaries' care, it is especially important that MedPAC asserts \nthat ``evidence of widespread access or quality problems for \nbeneficiaries may indicate that Medicare's payment rates are too low.'' \nIn fact, MedPAC surveyed physicians nationwide, and found that 45 \npercent said that reimbursement levels for their Medicare fee-for-\nservice patients are a very serious problem.\n  Every day I hear from my constituents that they are facing increasing \ndifficulty in getting primary care services, and from physicians who \ncan no longer afford to take on new Medicare patients.\n  One woman in Steilacoom, WA, contacted me about her son, a \nquadriplegic, who was recently informed that the doctor who has been \ntreating him for a number of years will no longer be able to take \nMedicare patients.\n  Another woman from Lynden, WA, told me that her doctor is leaving his \npractice due to low Medicare reimbursements, her 89-year-old father has \nalso been going to this same doctor and now the family cannot find a \nlocal doctor to take him.\n  When another constituent from Tacoma had to move into the city she \nhad to call numerous physicians before she found one who would take a \nnew Medicare patient.\n  One physician in Bellingham wrote me to say that one of his favorite \npatients will no longer see her family practitioner because she has \nMedicare. This doctor writes ``when our seniors feel bad and ashamed \nabout going in to see their physicians because their insurance'' \ncoverage is Medicare, I think that reflects very poorly on Medicare, \nour government, our government, that runs the program, and, to some \nextent, the caregivers who feel it is a financial burden to take care \nof our seniors. I couldn't agree more.\n  In fact, according to the Washington State Department of Health, in \nClallam and Kittitas counties in my home State, only 20 percent of \nprimary care physicians reported that they would take new Medicare \npatients. Yet, at the same time, most practices are accepting new \npatients with private employer-sponsored insurance. This suggests that \ngeneral physician shortages are not the major cause underlying the fact \nthat so many physician practices are closing or closed to Medicare \npatients.\n  I understand that there are basic fairness issues involved in the \nnational debate over Medicare reimbursements. I am not pretending that \nthe Senate will comprehensively address geographic differences or \npayment inequities this session. But I do believe we can look at more \ntargeted, limited solutions to address the Medicare reimbursement and \naccess issues on a demonstration level.\n  We already have a public health program in place, the primary care \nhealth professional shortage area designation, HPSA, to determine \nwhether an area has a critical shortage of physicians available to \nserve the people living there. In fact, this is the measurement used in \nplacing National Health Service Corps doctors in underserved areas.\n  A HPSA can be a distinct geographic area, such as a county, or a \nspecific population group within the area, such as the low-income. \nHowever, in many shortage locations, access to care is a problem for \nonly part of the population. For example, while most residents in a \ncity may have adequate access to care, the elderly or poor may not. And \nwhile population HPSA designations measure access problems for Medicaid \nand low-income patients, migrant workers, and the homeless, there is no \ndesignation that specifically identifies or addresses Medicare-related \ndemographics. My bill changes that.\n  The bill I am introducing today, the Medicare Incentive Access Act, \nwill create a new Medicare Health Professional Shortage Area, HPSA, \nthrough a three-year, five-state HHS/Medicare demonstration project. \nPrimary care doctors in an area designated as a Medicare HPSA will \nreceive an automatic 40 percent bonus on all of their Medicare \nbillings.\n  I believe it is vitally important that the federal government \nsystematically examine different provider incentive programs in order \nto stabilize, maintain, and increase quality, efficient primary care \nservices for Medicare beneficiaries. I want this demonstration program \nto examine how we can specifically preserve beneficiary access to \nprimary care providers. The demonstration project will also examine \nwhat level of incentive is necessary to prevent future access problems.\n  I want to point out that while current law prohibits multiple HPSA \ndesignations, the demonstration project will not affect current HPSA \ndesignations needed for other programs, such as Community Health \nCenters. In addition, physicians in states participating in the \nMedicare HPSA demonstration project will not be able also to receive \npayments under the Medicare Incentive Payment program, which bases its \nten percent bonus on geographic shortage areas. As I mentioned earlier, \ngeographic shortage areas actually have nothing to do with measuring \nMedicare-related access issues.\n  There is an abundance of excellent research currently underway at the \nsix Federal rural health research centers on all Medicare provider \nreimbursement issues. These research centers are already set up for \ndemonstration analyses like the one required under my bill. I sincerely \nappreciate the help Gary Hart, Ph.D. has provided me in developing this \nproposal and discussing other, more comprehensive, means by which to \nlook at different Medicare payment and access issues. Dr. Hart is the \ndirector of the WWAMI Rural Health Research Center at the University of \nWashington, which is largely focusing on rural physician payments.\n  I also want to thank Vince Schueler and Laura Olexa of the Office of \nCommunity and Rural Health and the Washington Department of Health, for \nproviding invaluable assistance in understanding rural health problems, \nthe\n\n[[Page S4710]]\n\nFederal HPSA designation, and access barriers for Medicare \nbeneficiaries, especially in rural areas of the State. After we began \ndiscussing this problem, they went out of their way to do additional \nsurveys in rural counties to measure the most current access to primary \ncare physicians for both Medicaid and Medicare patients.\n  Finally, I want to thank the Washington State Medical Association and \nLen Eddinger for their advice and assistance on this issue. I am \ndelighted that the WSMA has endorsed this legislation, and I ask \nunanimous consent that its letter of support be added in the record at \nthe end of my statement.\n  The fact of the matter is that there is a crisis at hand regarding \nMedicare benefits, and Medicare payments, and as a country, we simply \nhave not invested as we should in health care.\n  I sincerely believe that all individuals should have access to \nquality and affordable medical care including the ability to visit \ndoctors whom they trust. It will do the country little good to provide \nguaranteed health care for the elderly and disabled if physicians are \nunwilling to work with Medicare patients because of inadequate payment \npolicies.\n  I believe the bill I am introducing today, the Medicare Incentive \nAct, is a good approach to examining these very important issues. I \nencourage my colleagues to take a look at this bill, and to join me in \ncosponsoring it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                         Washington State Medical Association,\n\n                                                     May 13, 2002.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: On behalf of the 8,800 members of \n     the Washington State Medical Association (WSMA), please \n     accept my sincere thanks for all the work you are doing to \n     improve the Medicare program.\n       The financial condition of the health care delivery system \n     in Washington state is as poor as I have seen in my nearly 25 \n     years of practice. As I travel the state and speak with my \n     colleagues, it has become clear that something dramatic and \n     sustainable must be done to ensure the long viability of \n     Medicare and Medicaid.\n       At our May Executive Committee meeting, we had an \n     opportunity to discuss the draft of your proposed legislation \n     to develop demonstration projects to enhance physician \n     reimbursement within established Medicare Health Professional \n     Shortage Areas. We view the approach as extremely creative \n     and well worth the time and effort of investigation. Our hope \n     is that successful implementation of this scenario will lead \n     to incentives across the entire physician community.\n       Senator, there is no doubt that declining reimbursements in \n     the Medicare and Medicaid programs are putting enormous \n     stress on medical practices and causing physicians to limit \n     patients who are eligible for these programs. We look forward \n     to working with you and your staff to alleviate this pressing \n     social problem.\n       Please let us know what we can do to help by contacting Len \n     Eddinger, WSMA's Director of Public Policy, in the Olympia \n     office of the WSMA at (360) 352-4848 or be email: \n     len@wsma.org.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Samuel W. Cullison, MD,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Levin (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 2544. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nauthorize the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to \nmake grants for remediation of sediment contamination in areas of \nconcern, to authorize assistance for research an development of \ninnovative technologies for such remediation, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the General Accounting Office has recently \ncompleted a study on the cleanup of Contaminated Areas in the Great \nLakes. While it is no surprise to those of us who live in the Great \nLakes region, GAO found that there has been ``slow progress of cleanup \nefforts''.\n  For those of you who live outside the Great Lakes region, Areas of \nConcern are sites in the Great Lakes that do not meet the water quality \ngoals established by the United States and Canada in the Great Lakes \nWater Quality Agreement. The primary reason that these areas fail to \nmeet water quality goals is the result of contaminated sediments, a \nresult of the industrialization of the mid-west. In order to meet the \nwater quality goals, the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement binds us \nto an identified cleanup process focused around Remdial Action Plans, \nRAPs.\n  RAPs define the environmental problem, evaluate remedial measures, \nand identify a process for moving forward with cleanup. The RAP process \nrelies on State and public involvement, and RAPs need the financial \nsupport of the Federal Government.\n  The GAO reports that the RAP process is often disregarded by the \nstates and EPA. The progress that is being made to cleanup the Areas of \nConcern is being made not under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement \nbut under other laws such as Superfund. EPA has failed to provide \noversight responsibility for RAPs and does not provide nearly enough \nfinancial resources for RAPs. In addition to these problems associated \nwith EPA, there is no way to implement RAPs because there is no pot of \nmoney to do so and no established procedure to follow.\n  There are 13 areas of concern in the State of Michigan which result \nin fish advisories, degradation of fish and wildlife populations, taste \nand odor problems with drinking water, beach closures, and bird and \nanimal deformities or reproductive problems. These environmental \nproblems are too grave considering the fact that the Great Lakes holds \none-fifth of the world's freshwater, supplies drinking water to 33 \nmillion people, and provides a $2 billion fishery.\n  So today, with my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, I am \nintroducing the Great Lakes Legacy Act to authorize $50 million per \nyear in grants to States to cleanup Areas of Concern and implement \nRAPs. This legislation will also require EPA to report to Congress \nwithin 1 year on how it plans to provide the oversight needed to make \nsure that the Areas of Concern will meet water quality goals.\n  The problem of contaminated sediments in the Great Lakes has been \nknown for decades, and I hope that my colleagues will support this \nlegislation to hopefully cleanup Areas of Concern.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a very important \nenvironmental issue, not just to my home State of Ohio, but to our \nentire Nation, and that issue is the protection of our Great Lakes. \nThese lakes are a natural treasure that hold one-fifth of the world's \nfreshwater, produce $2 billion per year in fish, and provide drinking \nwater to 33 million people.\n  Yesterday, the GAO released a report on the progress of cleanup in \npolluted Areas of Concern. These Areas of Concern, or AOCs, are sites \nin the Great Lakes that do not meet water quality goals. Many years \nago, the United States and Canada identified 44 AOCs in the Great Lakes \nand agreed to a cleanup process.\n  In my home State of Ohio, there are four AOCs, the Maumee River, the \nAshtabula River, the Black River, and the Cuyahoga River. These areas \nsuffer fish and wildlife consumption restrictions, fish and wildlife \nreproductive problems and deformities, algal blooms, restrictions on \ndrinking water consumption, and beach closings. These environmental \nproblems need to be addressed as quickly as possible.\n  Unfortunately, cleanup has been very slow. The GAO report found that \nthe Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has failed to take oversight \nresponsibility, Federal funding has declined steadily over the years, \nand States have abandoned the cleanup process.\n  These results are disturbing to say the least. This is why Senator \nLevin and I, as Co-Chairs of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, are \nintroducing a bill today that would authorize $50 million per year in \ngrants to States for the cleanup of Areas of Concern. Cleanup work \nincludes monitoring and evaluating sites, remediating sediment, and \npreventing further contamination. This legislation would authorize the \nEPA to conduct research and development of innovative approaches, \ntechnologies, and techniques for the remediation of sediment in the \nGreat Lakes and would authorize the Great Lakes National Program Office \nto carry out a public information grant program to provide information \nabout the contaminated sediments, as well as activities to clean-up the \nsite. Finally, as the GAO report recommends, our bill would require the \nEPA to submit a report to\n\n[[Page S4711]]\n\nCongress on the actions, time periods, and resources that are necessary \nfor the EPA to oversee the Remedial Action Plans at Areas of Concern.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and honor an \ninternational commitment to protect a truly great natural resource. We \nmust honor our commitment to future generations and do all we can to \nprotect the Lakes for our children and grandchildren. We owe it to \nthem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Hagel, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Murkowski, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 2545. A bill to extend and improve United States programs on the \nproliferation of nuclear materials, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a new bill, the \nNuclear Nonproliferation Act of 2002. Senators Biden, Lugar, Landrieu, \nHagel, Murkowski and Bingaman--the junior Senator from my State--join \nme in cosponsoring this important piece of legislation.\n  The end of the Soviet Union in 1991 started a chain of events, which \nin the long term can lead to vastly improved global stability. Concerns \nabout global confrontations were greatly reduced after that event.\n  But with that event, the Soviet system of guards, guns, and a highly \nregimented society that had effectively controlled their weapons of \nmass destruction, along with the materials and expertise to create \nthem, was significantly weakened. Even today, with Russia's economy \nwell on the road to recovery, there's still plenty of room for concerns \nabout the security of these Russian assets.\n  The tragic events of September 11 brought the United States into the \nworld of international terrorism, a world from which we had been very \nsheltered. Even with the successes of the subsequent war on terrorism, \nthere's still ample reason for concern that the forces of Al Qaeda and \nother international terrorists are seeking other avenues to disrupt \npeaceful societies around the world.\n  In some sense, the events of September 11 set a new gruesome standard \nagainst which terrorists may measure their future successes. There \nshould be no question that these groups would use weapons of mass \ndestruction if they could acquire them and deliver them here or to \ncountless other international locations.\n  One of our strongest allies in the current war on terrorism has been \nthe Russian Federation. Assistance from the Russians and other states \nof the former Soviet Union has been vital in many aspects of the \nconflict in Afghanistan.\n  President Putin and President Bush have forged a strong working \nrelationship, and the current summit meeting is another measure of \ninterest in increased cooperation. As this new bill seeks to strengthen \nour nonproliferation programs, it provides many options for actions to \nbe conducted through joint partnerships between the Russian Federation \nand the United States that build on this increased cooperative spirit.\n  The Nunn-Lugar program of 1991 and the Nunn-Lugar Domenici \nlegislation of 1996 provided vital support for cooperative programs to \nreduce the risks that weapons of mass destruction might become \navailable to terrorists. They established a framework for cooperative \nprogress that has served our nation and the world very well. But \ndespite their successes, there remain many actions that should be taken \nto further reduce these threats.\n  The report by Howard Baker and Lloyd Cutler is one of the most \ncomprehensive calls for increased attention to these risks. That \nreport, which was written well before September 11, and many others \nhave suggested additional actions that could and should be taken beyond \nthe two original bills.\n  One of the most important realizations from September 11 concerns the \nglobal reach of the forces of terrorism. It's now clear that our \nnuclear nonproliferation programs should extend far beyond the states \nof the former Soviet Union.\n  This new bill expands and strengthens many of the programs \nestablished earlier, to further reduce threats to global peace. It \nexpands the scope of several programs to world-wide coverage. It \nfocuses on threats of a nuclear or radiological type, which fall within \nthe expertise of the National Nuclear Security Administration of the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  It expands programs to include the safety and security of nuclear \nfacilities and radioactive materials around the world, wherever \ncountries are willing to enter into cooperative arrangements for threat \nreduction. It recognizes that devices that disperse radioactive \nmaterials, so-called ``dirty bombs,'' can represent a real threat to \nmodern societies.\n  Dirty bombs could be used as weapons of mass terror, property \ncontamination, and economic disaster. We need better detection systems \nfor the presence of dirty bombs that are appropriate to the wide range \nof delivery systems for such a weapon, from trucks to boats to \ncontainers. And we need to be far better prepared to deal with the \nconsequences of such an attack.\n  The new legislation includes provisions to accelerate and expand \nexisting programs for disposition of fissile materials. These \nmaterials, of course, represent not only a concern with dirty bombs, \nbut also the even larger threat of use in crude nuclear weapons.\n  It includes a program that should help accelerate the conversion of \nhighly enriched uranium into forms unusable for weapons. It addresses \none of the major concerns associated with this material, that both the \nUnited States in the Atoms for Peace program as well as the Soviet \nUnion, provided highly enriched uranium to many countries as fuel for \nresearch reactors. That fuel represents a proliferation risk today.\n  It authorizes new programs for global management of nuclear \nmaterials, in cooperation with other nations and with the International \nAtomic Energy Agency. It recognizes that modern societies use \nradioactive materials as essential tools in many ways, and offers \nassistance in providing new controls on the most dangerous of these \nmaterials.\n  It suggests that many of the program elements involve international \ncooperation with the Russian Federation and with other nations. In \nfact, it recognizes that the global nature of the current threats \nrequires such cooperation, and provides authorizations for the \nSecretary of Energy and Secretary of State to offer significant help to \nother nations. In many cases, we cannot accomplish these programs \nwithout such cooperation.\n  This new bill includes provisions extending the first responder \ntraining programs, originally created under Nunn-Lugar-Domenici. These \nprograms have already made real contributions. In fact, the training \nprovided under this program in New York City helped mitigate the \ncatastrophe there on September 11. That program was authorized for only \n5 years in the original legislation. This bill extends that \nauthorization for another 10 years for first responder preparation in \nvarious communities and cities of America.\n  The new bill requires annual reports demonstrating that all our \nnonproliferation programs are well coordinated and integrated. \nCountless reports have called for improved coordination of all federal \nnonproliferation programs. The original call for this coordination in \nthe Nunn-Lugar-Domenici legislation was completely ignored by the \nClinton administration.\n  The report requires an annual statement of the extent of coordination \nbetween federally funded and private activities. That is very \nimportant, because of the important work being done by private \norganizations, like the Nuclear Threat Initiative, that are providing \ncritical assistance toward similar nonproliferation goals.\n  With this new bill, our programs to counter threats of nuclear and \nradiological terrorism will be significantly strengthened and risks to \nthe United States and our international partners can be greatly \nreduced.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2545\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear Nonproliferation Act \n     of 2002''.\n\n[[Page S4712]]\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Whereas the focus on the security of radioactive \n     materials before the events of September 11, 2001, was on \n     fissile materials, it is now widely recognized that the \n     United States must expand its concerns to the safety and \n     security of nuclear facilities, and the radioactive materials \n     in use or stored at such facilities, that may be attractive \n     to terrorists for use in radiological dispersal devices as \n     well as in crude nuclear weapons. Such materials include all \n     radioactive materials in the nuclear fuel cycle (such as \n     nuclear waste and spent fuel) as well as industrial and \n     medical radiation sources. Steps must be taken not only to \n     prevent the acquisition of such materials by terrorists, but \n     also to rapidly mitigate the consequences of the use of such \n     devices and weapons on public health and safety, facilities, \n     and the economy.\n       (2) The technical activities of United States efforts to \n     combat radiological terrorism should be centered in the \n     National Nuclear Security Administration because it has the \n     nuclear expertise and specialized facilities and activities \n     needed to develop new and improved protection and consequence \n     mitigation systems and technologies. New technologies and \n     systems should be developed by the Administration in \n     partnership with other agencies and first responders that \n     also have the operational responsibility to deal with the \n     threat of radiological terrorism.\n       (3) Fissile materials are a special class of materials that \n     present a range of threats, from utilization in improvised \n     nuclear devices to incorporation in radiological dispersal \n     devices. The Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act \n     of 1996 (title XIV of Public Law 104-201; 50 U.S.C. 2301 et \n     seq.) focused on cooperative programs with the former Soviet \n     Union to control such materials. It is critical that these \n     efforts continue and that efforts commence to develop a \n     sustainable system by which improvements in such efforts are \n     retained far into the future. Development of such a \n     sustainable system must occur in partnership with the Russian \n     Federation and the other states of the former Soviet Union.\n       (4) The Russian Federation and the other states of the \n     former Soviet Union are not the only locations of fissile \n     materials around the world. Cooperative programs to control \n     potential threats from any of such materials should be \n     expanded to other international partners. Programs, \n     coordinated with the International Atomic Energy Agency and \n     other international partners, should be initiated to optimize \n     control of such materials.\n       (5) The Agreement Between the Government of the United \n     States of America and the Government of the Russian \n     Federation Concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched \n     Uranium Extracted from Nuclear Weapons, signed at Washington \n     on February 18, 1993 (the so-called ``HEU deal''), represents \n     an effective approach to reducing the stocks of the Russian \n     Federation of highly enriched uranium (HEU). However, such \n     stocks are much larger than contemplated in the Agreement, \n     and many other nations also possess quantities of highly \n     enriched uranium. Global stability would be enhanced by \n     modification of all available highly enriched uranium into \n     forms not suitable for weapons. Efforts toward such \n     modification of highly enriched uranium should include \n     expansion of programs to deal with research reactors fueled \n     by highly enriched uranium, which were provided by the United \n     States under the Atoms for Peace program and the Atomic \n     Energy Act of 1954 and similarly encouraged by the former \n     Soviet Union.\n       (6) Expansion of commercial nuclear power around the world \n     will lead to increasing global stocks of reactor grade \n     plutonium and fission products in spent fuel. If improperly \n     controlled, such materials can contribute to proliferation \n     and represent health and environmental risks. The \n     international safeguards on such materials established \n     through the International Atomic Energy Agency must be \n     strengthened to deal with such concerns. The National Nuclear \n     Security Administration is the appropriate Federal agent for \n     dealing with technical matters relating to the safeguard and \n     management of nuclear materials. The United States, in \n     cooperation with the Russian Federation and the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency, should lead the international community \n     in developing proliferation-resistant nuclear energy \n     technologies and strengthened international safeguards that \n     facilitate global management of all nuclear materials.\n       (7) Safety and security at nuclear facilities are \n     inextricably linked. Damage to such facilities by sabotage or \n     accident, or the theft or diversion of nuclear materials at \n     such facilities, will have substantial adverse consequences \n     worldwide. It is in the United States national interest to \n     assist countries that cannot afford proper safety and \n     security for their nuclear plants, facilities, and materials \n     in providing proper safety and security for such plants, \n     facilities, and materials, and in developing the sustainable \n     safety and security cultures that are required for the safe \n     and secure use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The \n     National Nuclear Security Administration is the appropriate \n     Federal agent for dealing with the technical aspects of \n     providing for international nuclear safety that must be \n     coordinated with safeguards of nuclear materials.\n       (8) The United States has provided sealed sources of \n     nuclear materials to many countries through the Atoms for \n     Peace program and the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. These \n     sources remain property of the United States. A recent report \n     of the Inspector General of the Department of Energy, \n     entitled ``Accounting for Sealed Sources of Nuclear Material \n     Provided to Foreign Countries'', noted that a total of 2-3 \n     kilograms of plutonium were in sources provided to 33 nations \n     and that the Department can not account fully for these \n     sources. Many of these sources are small enough to present \n     little risk, but a careful review of sources and recipients \n     could identify concerns requiring special attention. In \n     addition, the former Soviet Union supplied sealed sources of \n     nuclear materials for research and industrial purposes, \n     including some to other countries. These sources contain a \n     variety of radioactive materials and are often uncontrolled, \n     missing, or stolen. The problem of dangerous radiation \n     sources is international, and a solution to the problem will \n     require substantial cooperation between the United States, \n     the Russian Federation, and other countries of the former \n     Soviet Union, as well as international organizations such as \n     the International Atomic Energy Agency. The International \n     Nuclear Safety and Cooperation program and the Materials \n     Protection, Control, and Accounting program of the National \n     Nuclear Security Administration address such matters. However \n     those programs need to be strengthened.\n       (9) Authorization for domestic testing of preparedness for \n     emergencies involving nuclear, radiological, chemical, and \n     biological weapons provided by section 1415 of the Defense \n     Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996 (50 U.S.C. \n     2315) has expired. These tests have been invaluable in \n     preparing first responders for a range of potential threats \n     and should be continued.\n       (10) Coordination of all Federal nonproliferation programs \n     should be improved to maximize efficiency and effectiveness \n     of programs in multiple agencies. Congress needs a \n     comprehensive annual report detailing the nonproliferation \n     policies, strategies, and budgets of the Federal Government. \n     Cooperation among Federal and private non-proliferation \n     programs is critical to maximize the benefits of such \n     programs.\n       (11) The United States response to terrorism must be as \n     rapid as possible. In carrying out their antiterrorism \n     activities, the departments and agencies of the Federal \n     Government, and State and local governments, need rapid \n     access to the specialized expertise and facilities at the \n     national laboratories and sites of the Department of Energy. \n     Multiple agency sponsorship of these important national \n     assets would help achieve this objective.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, the world is a dangerous place, and the \nUnited States is not immune to those dangers. In just the last few \ndays, we have heard warnings that suicide bombers will mount attacks in \nthe United States and that terrorist groups will inevitably obtain \nweapons of mass destruction from rogue states.\n  My own greatest concern is that rogue states or terrorist groups may \nobtain nuclear weapons, or the means to produce them, from the former \nSoviet Union, where less-than-adequate security and under-employed \nweapons scientists coexist with the world's largest stockpile of excess \nfissile material. We know that both rogues and terrorists are \nattempting to exploit the instability in that region in order to gain \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  Some Russians have been caught stealing radioactive, or even fissile, \nmaterial. And witnesses at two Foreign Relations Committee hearings \nwarned that even modestly capable terrorists could convert stolen \nhighly enriched uranium into enormously destructive improvised nuclear \ndevices.\n  But I do not share the view that proliferation of nuclear weapons is \ninevitable. The United States has had real successes in nuclear \nnonproliferation and there is every reason to think that we can build \non that record.\n  Thanks to the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, the \ncountries of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine gave up their nuclear \nweapons.\n  Thanks to the Materials Protection, Control and Accounting program, \nmany Russian facilities have improved their security for fissile \nmateriel.\n  Thanks to our fissile material disposition programs, the United \nStates and Russia will each demilitarize 34 metric tons of excess \nplutonium, and Russia will downblended 500 metric tons of high-enriched \nuranium into low-enriched fuel for nuclear power reactors.\n  Thanks to several U.S. programs, thousands of under-employed weapons \nscientists in the former Soviet Union have obtained at least part-time \nemployment in new, socially useful endeavors.\n  These programs point the way to how we can speed up the day when \nrogue states and terrorists will find the doors closed to them when \nthey seek dangerous materials or technology from the former Soviet \nUnion. The administration told many months to review these programs \nlast year, but that review led it to the absolutely correct conclusions \nthat the programs are vital to our national security and that nearly \nall of them should be expanded. The problem now is that we are still \nnot doing nearly enough. The President's budget request for fiscal year \n2003 would maintain our nonproliferation assistance programs, but not \nsignificantly increase them.\n  The Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 2002 takes important steps to \nexpand these programs, and I am proud to co-sponsor this legislation. \nSenator Domenici to be both commended and supported for drafting this \nbill. I am also delighted to be joined by Senators Lugar and Hagel from \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, Senators Landrieu and Bingaman from \nthe Armed Services Committee, and Senator Murkowski, who has paid \nparticular attention to Russian nuclear problems.\n  The Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 2002 will lead to greater levels \nof effort--and, I believe, greater levels of achievement--in several \nareas. For example, it authorizes $40 million for a new research, \ndevelopment, and demonstration program to help respond to nuclear or \nradiological terrorism. Some of these funds would also help other \nnations to better regulate the protection and control of radiological \nsources, to prevent any diversion to terrorists. Some of the funds will \ngo to new technologies to detect radioactive and fissile materials \nbeing smuggled into the United States. And some will support work with \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency to improve international \nsafeguards for nuclear materials and operations.\n  It authorizes up to $300 million to accelerate and expand current \nprograms to blend down highly enriched uranium (HEU) into reactorgrade \nmaterial which cannot explode and to dispose of plutonium in Russia. \nThis provision also allows for HEU purchases from other countries.\n  It authorizes $20 million for work with the international community \nto develop options for a global program for international safeguards, \nnuclear safety and proliferation-resistant nuclear technologies. This \nincludes efforts to improve sabotage protection for nuclear power \nplants and other nuclear facilities overseas.\n  These are sensible proposals, and very sensibly priced when one \nconsiders the magnitude of the threat that they address. Former Senator \nHoward Baker and former White House Counsel Lloyd Cutler called on us \nlast year to devote at least $3,000,000,000 dollars a year to this \neffort. Even with last year's congressionally-mandated budget increases \nand even with this fine bill, we will achieve less than two-thirds of \nthat objective.\n  But these are important steps, ones that have been vetted with \nexperts inside and outside our government. They\n\n[[Page S4716]]\n\ndeserve the support of all of us, and they will help build a safer \nworld for our children and grandchildren.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 2546. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to establish a \nprogram for Federal flight deck officers, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ndisappointment in the decision announced yesterday by the Department of \nTransportation against allowing airline pilots to carry firearms during \nthe performance of their duties. Today I am introducing legislation \nwhich would overturn that decision and require the Transportation \nSecurity Administration to establish a program to permit pilots to \ndefend their aircraft against acts of criminal violence or air piracy. \nThis legislation will provide a critical last line of defense to secure \ncommercial aircraft.\n  This bill I am introducing today is identical to a bill in the House \nof Representatives, H.R. 4635, introduced by Mr. Young of Alaska and \nMr. Mica of Florida. The legislation requires the Under Secretary of \nTransportation for Security to establish a program not later than 90 \ndays after the date of enactment to deputize qualified volunteer pilots \nas Federal law enforcement officers to defend the cockpits of \ncommercial aircraft in flight against acts of criminal violence or air \npiracy. Pilots who are deputized will be known as ``Federal Flight Deck \nOfficers'' and will be authorized to carry a firearm and use force, \nincluding deadly force, against an individual in defense of an \naircraft.\n  Under the bill, a qualified pilot is a pilot that is employed by an \nair carrier, has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Under \nSecretary fitness to be a Federal Flight Deck Officer, and has been the \nsubject of an employment investigation, including a criminal history \nrecord check.\n  Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment, the Under \nSecretary shall deputize 500 qualified pilots who are former military \nor law enforcement personnel. Not later than 24 months after the date \nof enactment, the Under Secretary shall deputize any qualified pilot. \nThe Federal Government will provide training, supervision and equipment \nat no expense to the pilot or air carrier. Pilots participating in this \nprogram will not be eligible to receive compensation for services. The \nlegislation protects volunteer pilots and their employers against \nliability from damages resulting from participation in the program.\n  The Department of Transportation has taken important steps to improve \nthe security of our airports and protect the flying public. However, \nSeptember 11 demonstrated our enemies will stop at nothing to inflict \nharm on Americans and destroy our way of life. Our response must be \nequally as determined and resolute. We must not take half measures or \nengage in wishful thinking. We must not refrain from utilizing every \ntool we possess. We must enable those who pilot commercial passenger \naircraft to defend against any threat and protect the safety of their \naircraft and passengers. And finally, we must do so without further \ndelay. I hope the Senate responds quickly to this important matter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2546\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for fair payments under the Medicare hospital outpatient \ndepartment prospective payment system; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Snowe to \nintroduce legislation entitled the ``Medicare Hospital Outpatient \nDepartment Fair Payment Act of 2002'' to improve Medicare payments for \nhospital outpatient department services.\n  According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPAC, in \nits report to Congress this past March. ``We estimate that the \naggregate Medicare margin for outpatient services\n\n[[Page S4717]]\n\nwill be -16.3 percent in 2002. Unfortunately, while the Medicare \noutpatient prospective payment system, or OPPS, was created to give \nproviders incentives to deliver quality outpatient care and services in \nan efficient manner, OPPS reimbursement rates have been set at a level \nsubstantially below what is costs hospitals to care for Medicare \npatients. That is an unsustainable burden for our Nation's hospitals.\n  This problem is especially acute in rural areas. According to the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission's June 2001 report entitled \n``Report to Congress: Medicare in Rural America,'' outpatient costs \nrepresent 21.8 percent of total Medicare costs in rural hospitals \ncompared to 16.1 percent in urban hospitals. As MedPAC concludes, \n``Given their greater reliance on Medicare and on outpatient services \nwithin Medicare, rural hospitals have more at stake than their urban \ncounterparts in the move to the outpatient PPS.''\n  In addition, Medicare's payment policy of paying less than cost \ncreates inappropriate incentives for providers to provide services in \nthe setting that receives the most favorable payment rather than the \none best suited for the patient. Medicare policy should seek, as best \nas possible, to pay appropriate amounts to ensure access to care for \nMedicare beneficiaries in appropriate settings, whether in inpatient \nhospitals, outpatient care, ambulatory surgical centers, or physician \noffices.\n  To provide just one example, the following are the current payment \nrates for mammography in either a outpatient hospital setting of a \nphysician's office: for unilateral diagnostic mammography, the OPPS \npayment is $30.54 compared to $38.01 in a physician's office; for \nbilateral diagnostic mammography, the OPPS payment is again $30.54 \ncompared to an even higher $46.06 in a physician's office; for \nunilateral digital mammography, OPPS payment just increased to $75.00 \ncompared to $71.31 in a physician's office; and finally, for bilateral \ndigital mammography, the OPPS payment is $75.00 compared to $88.33 in a \nphysician's office.\n  Why does Medicare pay between 24 percent to 54 percent more for a \ndiagnostic mammography in a physician's office than in an outpatient \nhospital setting? Such disparities are unjustified and they are even \nworse for other Medicare services.\n  To address these problems, the ``Medicare Hospital Outpatient Fair \nPayment Act of 2002'' would: increase extremely underfunded emergency \nroom and clinic ambulatory payment classifications, or APC, payment \nrates in the OPPS system by 10 percent and require an increase in \noverall outpatient department payments to be adjusted to 90 percent of \noverall costs, from the current 84 percent; and improve and extend \ntransitional corridor or ``hold harmless'' payments to rural hospitals, \ncancer hospitals, and children's hospitals, and extend the transitional \npayments to designated eye and ear speciality hospitals.\n  The first provision would increase funding overall through the \noutpatient hospital system from 84 percent of cost to 90 percent of \ncost, still 10 percent less than the hospitals spend in delivering \nnecessary outpatient care, with special focus and priority on payments \nfor emergency room and clinic payments, prevention services, cancer \nservices, and to reduce the disparity between payments in outpatient \nand alternative settings.\n  The extension of the transitional corridors or hold harmless payments \nto rural, cancer, and children's hospitals addresses the particular \nproblems those hospitals are facing with the OPPS system and adds \ndesignated eye and ear speciality hospitals. With regard to rural \nhospitals, MedPAC recommended that due to the higher unit costs and a \ngreater percentage of care delivered in rural outpatient settings in \nits June 2001 report entitled ``Report to the Congress: Medicare in \nRural America,'' that the data ``supports the need for the existing \nhold-harmless policy'' for rural hospitals.\n  Without the transitional corridor payments to rural hospitals, rural \nhospitals would be expected to be significant losers, according to \nMedPAC data. As MedPAC states, ``Small rural hospitals were protected \nto more negatively affected, with those under 50 beds, about 50 percent \nof rural hospitals, losing 8.5 percent and those with 50-99 beds losing \n2.7 percent.'' Even with the transitional corridor and hold-harmless \npayments, rural hospitals are still projected to have negative margins \nof 13.7 percent with respect to outpatient care.\n  The legislation also addresses problems created by the Balanced \nBudget Refinement Act of 1999, or BBRA, which established temporary \nadditional Medicare payments, or transitional pass-through payments, \nfor certain innovative medical devices, drugs, and biologics. By \nestablishing the pass-through payments, Congress ensured Medicare \nbeneficiaries would have access to the latest medical technologies. \nThese pass-through payments were capped at 2.5 percent of total \noutpatient payments prior to 2004, and the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, or CMS, is required by law to make a proportional \nreduction for all pass-through payments if that cap is exceeded.\n  In March 2002, CMS announced a reduction in pass-through payments of \n63.6 percent. This reduction means that a pass-through payment of \n$1,000 is reduced to just $364. Again, hospitals cannot continue to \nprovide needed services to beneficiaries with reductions of such a \nmagnitude.\n  To prevent an event greater reduction in pass-through payments, CMS \n``folded-in'' a significant portion of costs of these new technologies \ninto the base APCs. However, because the law requires that these \nchanges are made in a budget-neutral manner, this resulted in a \nsubstantial reduction in payments for standard outpatient services that \ndo not rely upon high-tech medical devices. In 2002, incorporating 75 \npercent of device costs into the APCs led to a budget-neutrality \nadjustment of -7.2 percent, causing the substantial reduction in the \nOPPS fee schedule amounts.\n  As MedPAC notes, ``If pass-through items are overused and overpaid, \nAPCs that include these technologies will be relatively overpaid while \nAPCs that do not will be underpaid. This process also will have \ninappropriate distributional effects among hospitals if some hospitals \nprovide more services that use pass-through technologies than others.'' \nFor example, rural hospitals tend to provide a greater proportion of \nmore basic Services, emergency care services, and fewer services that \nrequire advanced technology, according to MedPAC. These are the \nservices particularly hard hit by the budget neutrality provision, and \nyet, they are certainly not any less expensive than they were last \nyear.\n  To address these problems with Medicare's pass-through payment \nsystem, the bill would: limit the pro-rata reduction in pass-through to \n20 percent; and limit the budget neutrality adjustment to no more than \n2.0 percent annually.\n  For New Mexico, the importance of this legislation cannot be \noverstated. In 2000, New Mexico had over 3.1 million outpatient visits \nby Medicare beneficiaries for important health concerns. This includes \nessential services such as diagnostic tests, clinic visits, emergency \ncare treatment, chemotherapy, and surgery. In addition, according to \nestimates from the American Hospital Association, the impact of this \nlegislation to New Mexico hospitals would be an increase in Medicare \npayments between $48 and $59 million over the next five years.\n  For an industry attemtping to survive cuts to payments from the \nprivate sector, Medicare and Medicaid, while also dealing with the \nNation's highest percentage of uninsured patients in the country. This \nlegislation is both timely and necessary. It is unjustifiable for \nMedicare to continue to pay just 84 percent of the cost of care of \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  The bottom line is that this bipartisan legislation will ensure our \nnation's hospitals a more rationale, fair, and equitable payment system \nfor services delivered to Medicare beneficiaries in an outpatient \nsetting.\n  I ask unanimous consent for the text of the bill and a copy of a \nletter to support from AHA to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2457\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S4718]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of our nearly 5,000 \n     hospital, health care system, network and other health care \n     provider members, the American Hospital Association is \n     writing to express our strong support for the Medicare \n     Hospital Outpatient Fair Payment Act of 2002 that you have \n     introduced with Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME). We believe this \n     bill is an essential component to ensuring that America's \n     Medicare patients receive emergency care and outpatient \n     services, and have equal access to the newest medical \n     technologies.\n       As hospital care continues to shift to the outpatient \n     setting, it is imperative that Congress begins to address the \n     complex operational issues and payment inequities created by \n     the outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS). While the \n     OPPS was created to give providers incentives to deliver \n     quality care in an efficient manner, outpatient payment rates \n     were set at a level substantially below the costs hospitals \n     incur caring for Medicare patients. Medicare currently pays \n     hospitals only 84 cents for every dollar of outpatient care \n     provided.\n       Your comprehensive legislation would address problems in \n     the OPPS by extending and enhancing provisions that ensure \n     patient care is not disrupted as hospitals transition into \n     OPPS. We applaud your leadership on this important issue and \n     support swift enactment of this legislation. We look forward \n     to working with you further on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rick Pollack,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague and \ngood friend Senator Bingaman to introduce the Medicare Hospital \nOutpatient Fair Payment Act of 2002. We are introducing this bill \nbecause of the critical importance of outpatient health care services \nand the devastating impact that the substantial reduction in Medicare \npayments for outpatient services will have on the delivery of care. Our \nlegislation will increase payment rates for outpatient care to adequate \nlevels to ensure appropriate access to outpatient care for our Nation's \nseniors. In addition, since the implementation of the new outpatient \nprospective payment system in August 2000, it has become evident that \nchanges are needed, and this legislation proposes important reforms \nthat will make the system work better for Medicare and for our Nation's \nseniors.\n  Our Nation's seniors rely upon outpatient care delivered through the \nMedicare program. This is the result of trends in medical care that \nwill continue to place a greater emphasis on\n\n[[Page S4720]]\n\nthe outpatient setting. According to Medpac, the number of outpatient \nvisits increased 73 percent during the 1990s and nearly 5 percent in \n2001 alone. New technologies and advances in medicine have made it \npossible for more and more care to be provided on an outpatient basis, \nwhich eliminates the need for an overnight hospital stay. This reduces \nthe cost of care and gets the patient home sooner where recovery can \nbegin. This trend will continue and underscores the importance of \nhaving an appropriate Medicare payment system for outpatient care.\n\n  Without these vitally needed changes in the Medicare outpatient \npayment system, our medical care infrastructure will suffer and patient \ncare will be harmed. This March, the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission, Medpac, estimated that the aggregate margin for outpatient \nservices would be minus 16.3 percent in 2002.\n  Congress created temporary additional payments, or transitional \n``pass-through'' payments, for certain innovative medical devices, \ndrugs and biologicals in the Balanced Budget Refinement Act, BBRA, of \n1999. By establishing the pass-through pool, Congress ensured Medicare \nbeneficiaries would have access to the latest medical technologies. \nThese pass-through payments were capped at 2.5 percent of total \noutpatient payments prior to 2004, and the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services, CMS, is required by law to make a proportional \nreduction for all pass-through payments if that cap is exceeded. In \nMarch 2002, CMS announced a dramatic reduction in pass-through payments \nof 63.6 percent.\n  CMS took steps to avoid even greater reductions in the pass through \npayments by incorporating 75 percent of the device costs into the base \nambulatory payment classifications, APC, amounts. Due to a \nCongressionally-mandated requirement, CMS was required to make this \nadjustment on a budget neutral basis, with no recognition for the \nimpact of this shift in payment. As a result, Medicare payments were \nshifted from low-tech services to high-tech services. In addition, \nincorporating 75 percent of device costs into the APCs led to a budget-\nneutrality adjustment of minus 7.2 percent, causing a substantial \nreduction in the OPPS fee schedule amounts for 2002.\n  These shifts in payments that resulted from actions Congress took in \nthe BBRA are greater than intended when it was first enacted. It is \nclear that corrections to the system are needed. Ironically, if these \nproblems with outpatient payments are not corrected, hospitals will be \nforced to admit patients into the hospital for treatment that could \nhave been provided more efficiently on an outpatient basis.\n  To address these problems, we are introducing the Medicare Hospital \nOutpatient Fair Payment Act of 2002. This comprehensive legislation \nwould address problems within the current Medicare hospital outpatient \npayment system. Specifically, it would address the problems outlined \nhere by; increasing extremely underfunded emergency room and clinic \nambulatory payment classifications, APC, rates by 10 percent and \nrequiring an increase in overall outpatient payments to 90 percent of \noverall costs, still 10 percent less than hospitals spend in delivering \nnecessary outpatient care, but an improvement on the current payment of \njust 84 percent of costs; limiting the pro rata reduction in pass-\nthrough payments to 20 percent; and limiting the budget neutrality \nadjustment to no more than 2.0 percent.\n  Furthermore, the bill improves and extends transitional corridor \npayments to rural hospitals, cancer hospitals, and children's \nhospitals, and extends the provision to designated eye and ear \nspecialty hospitals.\n  We believe these changes are necessary if we are to preserve the \nquality of care in the outpatient setting that seniors deserve. Our \nNation's seniors rely upon the health care services provided in the \noutpatient setting and we invite our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to join us in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 2548. A bill to amend the temporary assistance to needy families \nprogram under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act to improve \nthe provision of education and job training under that program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Education \nWorks Act.\n  In 1996, legislation was passed which made major changes to our \nwelfare laws. Since then, we know that the welfare rolls in most States \nhave dramatically decreased. But reforming welfare is not just about \nreducing welfare rolls; welfare reform must ultimately be about helping \npoor individuals achieve self-sufficiency. While many have left welfare \nfor work during the past several years, too many have been left behind \nbecause they don't have a high school degree, have little or no work \nhistory, have health problems, are in abusive relationships, or are \ndealing with other circumstances that make it difficult to work. In \naddition, those who have secured work are working at low wages with \nlimited benefits. These parents experience little earning growth over \ntime, because there are limited opportunities for mobility for those \nwith low skill levels. As we move forward with the reauthorization \nprocess, we must do more to support state efforts to help these people \nfind work and to ensure that all individuals leaving welfare are moving \nto employment that will provide long-term financial independence. The \nEducation Works Act will do just that.\n  We know that the welfare programs that have been most successful in \nhelping parents work and earn more over the long run are those that \nhave focused on employment but made substantial use of education and \ntraining, together with job search and other employment services. In \naddition, studies find that helping low-income parents increase their \nskills pays off in the labor market, particularly through participation \nin vocational training and postsecondary education and training.\n  Yet, less than one percent of Federal TANF funds were spent on \neducation and training in 2000 and only five percent of TANF recipients \nparticipated in these activities in the same year. This is due in large \npart to the fact that the '96 law discouraged States from allowing \nwelfare recipients to participate in education and training programs. \nSpecifically, the law limits the extent to which education activities \ncount toward Federal work participation requirements, effectively \nrestricting how long individuals can participate in training and \ncapping how many individuals can receive these services.\n  The Education Works Act would change this by: clarifying that States \nhave the flexibility to allow participation in postsecondary, \nvocational English as a Second Language, and basic adult education \nprograms by TANF recipients as part of the TANF work requirements; \ngiving States the flexibility to determine how long each participant \nmay participate in education and training activities while receiving \nbenefits; giving States the flexibility to provide childcare and \ntransportation supports, but not cash benefits, to parents and not toll \nthe 5 year time limit for these individuals if they are participating \nin a full-time education program that will lead to work and long-term \nindependence; and eliminating the 30 percent cap on the number of TANF \nrecipients that can participate in education and training programs in \nfulfillment of their work requirements\n  These are not radical changes. They do not discourage work, but \nrather enable it.\n  It is important to note that of the 21 States that have operated \nunder TANF waivers since 1996, 18 of them had waivers of the \nrequirements we are talking about here. Delaware, Indiana, Montana, \nTennesee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Oregon to name a few. The other 32 \nStates should be given the same flexibility.\n  In my home State, we have recognized the important role that \neducation and training, including postsecondary education, can play in \nhelping some welfare recipients to improve their skills so that they \ncan get off welfare and stay off welfare. In our State, we already have \nan ``Education Works'' program in place. But this program is limited to \nonly 400 participants statewide, because the limitations in the TANF \nprogram make it impossible to use Federal TANF funds to implement it. \nThis just doesn't make sense to me. We should give states the \nflexibility they need to implement the\n\n[[Page S4721]]\n\ntypes of programs that they believe work best. We should hold them \naccountable for decreasing caseloads over time and, more importantly, \ndemonstrating that those leaving welfare are economically self-\nsufficient, but we should let them decide how to reach those goals. The \nEducation Works Act would allow them to do just that. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2548\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to give States the option to create a program that allows \nindividuals receiving temporary assistance to needy families to obtain \npost-secondary or longer duration vocational education; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pathways to \nSelf-Sufficiency Act of 2002. I am pleased to be joined in introducing \nthis important legislation by my colleagues Senators Baucus and \nBingaman.\n  This legislation is based upon the highly esteemed Maine program \ncalled Parents as Scholars. This program, which uses State Maintenance \nof Effort, (MOE), dollars to pay TANF-like benefits to those \nparticipating in post-secondary education, is a proven success in my \nState and is a wonderful foundation for a national effort.\n  We all agree that the 1996 welfare reform effort changed the face of \nthis Nation's welfare system to focus it on work. To that end, I \nbelieve that this legislation bolsters the emphasis on ``work first.'' \nLike many of my colleagues, I agree that the shift in the focus from \nwelfare to work was the right decision, and that work should be the top \npriority. However, for those TANF recipients who cannot find a good job \nthat will put them on the road toward financial independence, education \nmight well be the key to a successful future of self-sufficiency.\n  As we have seen in Maine that education has played a significant role \nin breaking the cycle of welfare and giving parents the skills \nnecessary to find better paying jobs. And we all know that higher wages \nare the light at the end of the tunnel of public assistance.\n  The Pathways to Self-Sufficiency Act of 2002 provides State with the \noption to allow individuals receiving Federal TANF assistance to obtain \npost-secondary or vocational education. This legislation would give \nStates the ability to use Federal TANF dollars to give those who are \nparticipating in vocational or post-secondary education the same \nassistance as they would receive if they were working.\n  We all know that supports like income supplements, child care \nsubsidies, and transportation assistance among others, are essential to \na TANF recipient's ability to make a successful transition to work. The \nsame is true for those engaged in longer term educational endeavors. \nThis assistance is especially necessary for those who are undertaking \nthe challenge and the financial responsibility of post-secondary \neducation, in the hopes of increasing their earning potential and \nemployability. The goal of this program is to give participants the \ntools necessary to succeed into the future so that they can become, and \nremain, self-sufficient.\n  Choosing to go to college requires motivation, and graduating from \ncollege requires a great deal of commitment and work, even for someone \nwho isn't raising children and sustaining a family. These are \nsignificant challenges, and that's even before taking into \nconsideration the cost associated with obtaining a bachelor's degree, \nwith a four year program at the University of Maine currently costing \nalmost $25,000. This legislation would provide those TANF recipients \nwho have the ability and the will to go to college the assistance they \nneed to sustain their families while they get a degree.\n  The value of promoting access to education in this manner to get \npeople off public assistance is proven by the success of Maine's \nParents as Scholars, PaS, program. Maine's PaS graduates earn a median \nwage of $11.71 per hour after graduation up from a median of $8.00 per \nhour prior to entering college. When compared to the $7.50 median \nhourly wage of welfare leavers in Maine who have not received a post-\nsecondary degree, PaS graduates are earning, on average, $160 more per \nweek. That translates into more than $8,000 per year--a significant \ndifference.\n  Furthermore, the median grade point average for PaS participants \nwhile in college was 3.4 percent, and a full 90 percent of PaS \nparticipants' GPA was over 3.0. These parents are giving their all to \npull their families out of the cycle of welfare.\n  Recognizing that work is a priority under TANF, and building upon the \nsuccessful Maine model, the Pathways to Self-Sufficiency Act requires \nthat participants in post-secondary and vocational education also \nparticipate in work. During the first two years of their participation \nin these education programs, students must participate in a combination \nof class time, study time, employment or work experience for at least \n24 hours per week, the same hourly requirement that the President \nproposes in his welfare reauthorization proposal.\n  During the second two years, for those enrolled in a four year \nprogram, the participant must work at least 15 hours in addition to \nclass and study time, or engage in a combination of activities, \nincluding class and study\n\n[[Page S4726]]\n\ntime, work or work experience, and training, for an average of 30 hours \nper week. And all the while, participants must maintain satisfactory \nacademic progress as defined by their academic institution.\n  The bottom line is that if we expect parents to move from welfare to \nwork and stay in the work force, we must give them the tools to find \ngood jobs. For some people that means job training, for others that \ncould mean dealing with a barrier like substance abuse or domestic \nviolence, and for others, that might mean access to education that will \nsecure them a good job and that will get them off and keep them off of \nwelfare.\n  The experience of several Parents as Scholars graduates were recently \ncaptured in a publication published by the Maine Equal Justice \nPartners, and their experiences are testament to the fact that this \nprogram is a critically important step in moving towards self-\nsufficiency. In this report one PaS graduate said of her experience, \n``If it weren't for `Parents as Scholars' I would never have been able \nto attend college, afford child care, or put food on the table. Today, \nI would most likely be stuck in a low-wage job I hated, barely getting \nby . . . I can now give my children the future they deserve.''\n  Another said, ``By earning my Bachelor's degree, I have become self \nsufficient. I was a waitress previously and would never have been able \nto support my daughter and I on the tips that I earned. I would \nencourage anyone to better their education if possible.''\n  These are but a few comments from those who have benefited from \naccess to post-secondary education. And, while these women have been \nable to attend college and pursue good jobs thanks to the good will and \nthe support of the people of Maine, PaS has strained the State's \nbudget. Giving States the option to use Federal dollars to support \nthese participants will make a tremendous difference in their ability \nto sustain these programs which have proven results. In Maine, nearly \n90 percent of working graduates have left TANF permanently, and isn't \nthat our ultimate goal?\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to include this \nlegislation in the upcoming welfare reauthorization. It is a critical \npiece of the effort to move people from welfare to work permanently and \nit has been missing from the Federal program for too long.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 2553. A bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to \nprovide equitable treatment of Alaska Native Vietnam Veterans, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will finally bring closure to the concerns of many Alaska Native \nveterans who served their country during the Vietnam war.\n  When the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, ANCSA, was signed into \nlaw by President Nixon in 1971, many Alaska Natives were serving in our \nmilitary. Because of their service, many were unable to apply for \nNative land allotments under the Native Allotment Act, a program that \nwas ended with the enactment of ANCSA. Alaska Natives who did not serve \nduring the Vietnam conflict were able to apply for lands under the \nNative Allotment Act but those who did serve had little chance to apply \nunder the circumstances.\n  I think everyone here will agree that allowing these veterans the \nsame advantages as those who did not serve in the military during the \nVietnam conflict is only fair. The main problem is that when we first \naddressed this inequity in 1998, the terms we set were so restrictive \nthat presently only 60 out of a possible 1,110 veterans who could \nqualify even have the chance of receiving an allotment. That is a \npaltry 5 percent of all that could have otherwise qualified. This is \nsimply not acceptable. My legislation addresses the restrictive terms \nwe unknowingly set in the 1998 amendment in three ways: First, my \nlegislation will expand the military service dates of the program so \nthat they coincide with the official dates of the Vietnam conflict. We \nought not to complicate matters by using any dates other than those \nthat the Veteran's Administration has officially determined are within \nthe Vietnam conflict era. Those dates are August 5, 1964 through May 7, \n1975.\n  Secondly, my legislation will replace the current use and occupancy \nrequirements with a simplified approval process, just like the one \nestablished under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. \nBy adopting the same legislative approval process that other allotment \nprograms used, this legislation will avoid the lengthy delays, costly \nadjudications and burdensome requirements that Alaska Native veterans \nare currently facing. If we do not correct this particular problem now, \nmany Alaska Native veterans will die before they ever have their \napplications approved. We cannot allow this to happen to them.\n  Finally, my legislation will extend the application deadline and \nexpand the available land choices so that the Alaska Native veterans \nwho could qualify for allotments will have the time and allotment \noptions they need in order to participate.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in making these simple, common \nsense changes so that this group of veterans can secure the land \nallotments they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/22/senate-section/article/S4726-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 116--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \n                          REGARDING DYSPRAXIA\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Breaux) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                            S.

United States wheat producers \n     have experienced a steep decline in farm income, have \n     increasing carryover stock, and face increasing indebtedness.\n       (c) Response to Unfair Trade Practices by Canadian Wheat \n     Board.--Since the United States Trade Representative made a \n     positive finding that the practices of the Canadian Wheat \n     Board involved subsidies, protected domestic market, and \n     special benefits and privileges that disadvantage United \n     States wheat farmers and infringe on the integrity of a \n     competitive trading system, it is the sense of the Congress \n     that United States Trade Representative should pursue \n     multiple avenues to seek relief for U.S. wheat farmers from \n     the wheat trading practices of the Government of Canada and \n     the Canadian Wheat Board, including through:\n       (1) a thorough examination of a possible dispute settlement \n     case against the Canadian Wheat Board in the World Trade \n     Organization; (2) working with the North Dakota Wheat \n     Commission and the U.S. wheat industry to examine the \n     possibility of action under title VII of the Tariff Act of \n     1930 with respect to countervailing and antidumping duties \n     against Canadian wheat; (3) in the newly launched round of \n     the World Trade Organization, pursuing permanent reform of \n     the Canadian Wheat Board through the development of new \n     disciplines and rules on state trading enterprises that \n     export agricultural goods which include--\n       (A) ending exclusive export rights to ensure private sector \n     competition in markets controlled by single desk exporters;\n       (B) eliminating the use of government funds or guarantees \n     to support or ensure the financial viability of single desk \n     exporters; and\n       (C) establishing WTO requirements for notifying acquisition \n     costs, export pricing, and other sales information for single \n     desk exporters; and\n       (4) working with the U.S. wheat industry to identify \n     specific impediments to U.S. wheat entering Canada and \n     presenting these to the Canadians so as to ensure the \n     possibility of fair, two-way trade.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 3532.

Mr. President. I am very pleased to support final \npassage of H.R. 327, the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, \nwith an amendment in the nature of a substitute proposed by Senator \nVoinovich and me and Senators Bond, Bunning, Carnahan, Carper, Cleland, \nCollins, Conrad, Dayton, Jeffords, Kerry, Leahy, Lincoln, Miller, and \nThompson.\n  America's small businesses are a critical part of the nation's \neconomy and a key driver of new job growth. Small businesses face \nparticular challenges in complying with government information-\ncollection requirements. H.R. 327 contains several provisions to help \nsmall businesses in this area. This bill aids small businesses in \nunderstanding and complying with Federal information-collection \nrequirements, mandates a study of how to streamline information-\ncollection requirements for small businesses and how to strengthen the \ndissemination of information by the Federal Government, and directs \nthat certain data be compiled about enforcement activities involving \nsmall entities.\n  Last year, Senator Voinovich introduced S. 1271, which is a companion \nbill to H.R. 327, on behalf of himself and Senators Lincoln and Leahy. \nThe bill now has 13 additional cosponsors: Senators Bond, Bunning, \nCarnahan, Carper, Cleland, Collins, Conrad, Dayton, Jeffords, Kerry, \nLieberman, Miller, and Thompson. The Governmental Affairs Committee \nreported out S. 1271 on November 14, 2001, and the Senate passed the \nbill by unanimous consent on December 17, 2001. The House had earlier \npassed H.R. 327, and, following Senate action on S. 1271, I worked with \nMembers of the Senate and the House--primarily, Senator Voinovich and \nRepresentatives Burton, Waxman, Ose, and Tierney--to try and resolve \ndifferences between the House and Senate bills. These discussions were \nsuccessful, resulting in a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on consensus \nlegislation, and Senator Voinovich and I and other Senators are \noffering this consensus legislation as an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute to H.R. 327 for final passage by the Senate.\n  I thank Senator Voinovich and his staff for their leadership and hard \nwork on this legislation in the Senate, and also Representatives \nBurton, Waxman, Ose, and Tierney and their staffs for their leadership \nand hard work in the House and for working with us to reach consensus \non this valuable legislation to help small businesses.\n  Senator Voinovich and I have prepared a section-by-section \ndescription of this consensus amendment, including a summary of the \npurposes and legislative history of this legislation, and I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\nH.R. 327--Consensus Amendment, Purposes and Summary, Section-by-Section \n                  Description, and Legislative History\n\n\n                        i. purposes and summary\n\n       H.R. 327, as amended, helps small businesses.

The legislation includes the \n     following provisions to help small businesses:\n       The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will annually \n     publish in the Federal Register and make available on the \n     Internet a list of the compliance assistance resources \n     available to small businesses.\n       Each agency will establish a single point of contact within \n     the agency to serve as liaison with small business concerns \n     with respect to the collection of information and the control \n     of paperwork.\n       Each agency will make efforts to further reduce the \n     information collection burden for very small business \n     concerns with fewer than 25 employees.\n       An interagency task force will be convened to study \n     measures to streamline information collection requirements \n     for small businesses and to strengthen dissemination of \n     information by the Federal Government. Among other things, \n     the task force will identify ways to integrate the collection \n     of information from small businesses across agencies and \n     programs, will make recommendations for electronic reporting \n     and dissemination of information, and will recommend a plan \n     for an interactive government website to help small \n     businesses understand which federal information-collection \n     requirements apply to its business.\n       Each agency will submit an initial report and final report \n     on the number of enforcement actions in which civil penalties \n     were assessed, the number of such actions against small \n     entities, the number of such actions in which civil penalties \n     were reduced or waived, and the amount of such reductions and \n     waivers. Requiring this information will facilitate \n     congressional oversight.\n\n\n     ii. section-by-section description of the consensus amendment\n\n                         Section 1. Short title\n\n       Section 1 of the bill provides that the Act may be cited as \n     the ``Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002.''\n\n     Section 2. Facilitation of compliance with federal paperwork \n                              requirements\n\n       Publication of list of compliance-assistance resources. \n     Subsection (a) of section 2 of the bill adds a new paragraph \n     to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), at 44 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3504(c)(6). The new paragraph (6), read together with \n     existing subsection (c), requires that, with respect to the \n     collection of information and the control of paperwork, the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will \n     publish in the Federal Register and make available on the \n     Internet a list of compliance assistance resources available \n     to small businesses. The Director is instructed to do this in \n     consultation with the Small Business Administration. The \n     applicable definition of ``collection of information'' in the \n     PRA, at 44 U.S.C. Sec. 3502(3), includes an agency's \n     questions and recordkeeping requirements posted to, or \n     imposed upon, 10 or more persons to obtain information or \n     require its disclosure. The purpose of this subsection of the \n     bill is to provide small businesses a resource to help them \n     quickly and efficiently find the compliance assistance they \n     need.\n       Agency point of contact. Subsection (b) of section 2 of the \n     bill adds a new subsection to the PRA, at 44 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3506(i), requiring that, with respect to the collection \n     of information and the control of paperwork, each agency must \n     establish one point of contact to act as liaison between the \n     agency and small business concerns. The applicable definition \n     of ``agency,'' as set forth in the PRA at 44 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3502(1), includes generally any department, Government \n     corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch, \n     including independent regulatory agencies. The bill also \n     makes applicable the definition of ``small business concern'' \n     in the Small Business Act, at 15 U.S.C. Sec. 632. The purpose \n     of this subsection of the bill is to establish the place in \n     each agency that small businesses can contact when they need \n     help with respect to information collection or the control of \n     paperwork.\n       Further efforts to reduce paperwork for very small \n     enterprises. Subsection (c) of section 2 of the amendment \n     adds a new paragraph to the PRA, at 44 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3506(c)(4), requiring that, in addition to the \n     requirements of the PRA regarding the reduction of \n     information collection burdens for small business concerns \n     generally, each agency must make efforts to further reduce \n     the information collection burden for small business concerns \n     with fewer than 25 employees.\n\n Section 3. Establishment of task force on information collection and \n                             dissemination\n\n       Section 3(a) of the bill adds a new section to the PRA, at \n     44 U.S.C. Sec. 3520, entitled ``Establishment of task force \n     on information collection and dissemination.''\n\n[[Page S4735]]\n\n       Establishment of task force and statement of purposes. \n     Subsection (a) of new 44 U.S.C. Sec. 3520 establishes a task \n     force to study the feasibility of streamlining requirements \n     with respect to small business concerns regarding collection \n     of information and strengthening dissemination of \n     information.\n       Selection of task force members. Subsection (b) of new 44 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3520 provides for the selection of individuals to \n     serve on the task force. The Director of OMB will determine \n     the number of representatives to be designated by each of the \n     several departments and agencies listed in the bill (subject \n     to the minimum requirements stated in the bill), and will \n     also name two additional agencies that will designate \n     representatives on the task force. The heads of those \n     departments and agencies will select individuals to serve as \n     members of the task force. The Director also will select a \n     representative of the Director, who will convene and chair \n     the task force.\n       Task force assignments. Paragraphs (1) through (6) of \n     subsection (c) of new 44 U.S.C. Sec. 3520 direct the task \n     force to do the following:\n       Paragraph (1)--Identify ways to integrate information \n     collection and examine whether, and to what extent, it would \n     be feasible and desirable to require agencies to consolidate \n     requirements regarding collections of information within and \n     across agencies (without negatively impacting the \n     effectiveness of underlying laws and regulations) in order to \n     enable each small business concern to submit required \n     information--(A) to one point of contact in the agency, (B) \n     in a single format, such as an electronic reporting system, \n     or (C) with synchronized reporting for submissions having the \n     same frequency, such as by allowing all quarterly reports to \n     be submitted on the same date each quarter, allowing all \n     annual reports to be submitted on the same date each year, \n     etc.\n       Paragraph (2)--Examine whether, and to what extent, it \n     would be feasible and beneficial to small businesses to the \n     Director to publish a list of all collections of information \n     applicable to small business concerns organized by North \n     American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code, by \n     industrial sector description, or in another manner by which \n     small business concerns can more easily identify applicable \n     requirements.\n       Paragraph (3)--Examine the savings and develop \n     recommendations for implementing--(A) electronic submissions \n     to the Federal Government, and (B) interactive reporting \n     systems providing immediate feedback to the submitter to \n     assure that data being submitted are appropriate.\n       Paragraph (4)--Make recommendations to improve the \n     electronic dissemination of information collected under \n     Federal requirements.\n       Paragraph (5)--Recommend a plan for the development of an \n     interactive Internet-based system to allow each small \n     business to better understand which Federal information- \n     collection requirements (and where possible, other Federal \n     regulatory requirements) are applicable, and to more easily \n     comply with those requirements.\n       Paragraph (6)--In carrying out its responsibilities, \n     consider opportunities for the coordination of Federal and \n     State reporting requirements, and for the coordination among \n     the points of contact established pursuant to the bill to \n     enable agencies, e.g., to provide contact information at \n     other agencies.\n       Notice-and-comment procedure for task force. Subsection (d) \n     of new 44 U.S.C. Sec. 3520 requires the task force, by \n     publication in the Federal Register, to provide notice and an \n     opportunity for comment on each report in draft form, and to \n     make provision in each report for the inclusion of any \n     separate views of task force members and a summary of \n     significant public comments.\n       Task force reports. Subsections (e) and (f) of new 44 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3520 require the task force to submit its first \n     report not later than one year after enactment of the bill \n     and its second report not later than two years after \n     enactment of the bill. The first report will be of the task \n     force's findings under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of \n     subsection (c) of new 44 U.S.C. Sec. 3520, and the second \n     report will be of the task force's findings under paragraphs \n     (4) and (5) of subsection (c) of new 44 U.S.C. Sec. 3520. \n     (Those paragraphs (1) through (5) are summarized above.) The \n     task force shall submit both its first and second reports to \n     the Director of OMB, to certain committees of Congress \n     identified in the bill, and to the Small Business and \n     Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman designated under \n     15 U.S.C. Sec. 657(b).\n       Termination of task force. Subsection (g) of new 44 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 3520 provides that the task force shall terminate upon \n     completion of its work.\n       Definition of ``small business concern.'' Subsection (h) of \n     new 44 U.S.C. Sec. 3520 makes applicable the definition of \n     ``small business concern'' in the Small Business Act, 15 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 632.\n\n               Section 4. Regulatory enforcement reports\n\n       Section 4 of the bill requires that each agency shall \n     submit an initial report and a final report on each of the \n     following:\n       (A) The number of enforcement actions in which a civil \n     penalty is assessed.\n       (B) The number of enforcement actions in which a civil \n     penalty is assessed against a small entity.\n       (C) The number of enforcement actions described under items \n     (A) and (B), above, in which the civil penalty is reduced or \n     waived.\n       (D) The total monetary amount of the reductions or waivers \n     referred to under item (C), above.\n       Each report shall include the definitions, selected at the \n     discretion of the agency submitting the report, of the terms \n     ``enforcement actions,'' ``reduction or waiver,'' and ``small \n     entity'' as used in the report. This provision, recognizing \n     that agencies have different policies governing their \n     enforcement activities and different ways of tracking these \n     activities, seeks to avoid placing undue reporting burdens on \n     agencies.\n       The initial report shall include information with respect \n     to the 1-year period beginning on October 1, 2002, and shall \n     be submitted not later than December 31, 2003. The final \n     report shall include information with respect to the 1-year \n     period beginning on October 1, 2003, and shall be submitted \n     not later than December 31, 2004. Each agency shall submit \n     the initial report and the final report to certain committees \n     of Congress identified in the bill and to the Small Business \n     and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman designated \n     under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 657(b).\n       For purposes of this section, the term ``agency'' has the \n     meaning under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 551, which is the definition \n     under the Administrative Procedures Act, and agencies as so \n     defined are required to submit the reports under this \n     section.\n\n\n                        iii. legislative history\n\n       H.R. 327 was introduced by Rep. Dan Burton on January 31, \n     2001, and was referred to the Committee on Government Reform \n     and to the Committee on Small Business. The bill now has 11 \n     cosponsors. At the Government Reform Committee, the bill was \n     further referred to the Subcommittee on Energy Policy, \n     Natural Resources and Regulatory Affairs.\n       On March 15, 2001, H.R. 327 was brought before the \n     Committee of the Whole House and then before the House. A \n     managers' amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed \n     to by voice vote, and then H.R. 327, as so amended, was \n     passed by a unanimous vote of 416 to 0. On that same day, \n     H.R. 327 was received in the Senate and referred to the \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n       A companion bill in the Senate, S. 1271, was introduced on \n     July 30, 2001, by Senator Voinovich, for himself and Senators \n     Lincoln and Leahy, and was referred to the Governmental \n     Affairs Committee. The bill now has 13 additional cosponsors: \n     Senators Bond, Bunning, Carnahan, Carper, Cleland, Collins, \n     Conrad, Dayton, Jeffords, Kerry, Lieberman, Miller, and \n     Thompson.\n       S. 1271 was considered by the Governmental Affairs \n     Committee at its business meeting on November 14, 2001, where \n     Senator Voinovich offered an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute, which included suggestions made by Senator \n     Lieberman and others. The Committee adopted the amendment by \n     voice vote and ordered the bill, as amended, favorably \n     reported by voice vote.\n       On December 17, 2001, the Senate by unanimous consent \n     agreed to a technical amendment to S. 1271 offered on behalf \n     of Senator Lieberman and an additional amendment offered on \n     behalf of Senator Kerry, and passed S. 1271 as so amended.\n       This Consensus Amendment is based primarily on the \n     provisions of H.R. 327, as it passed the House, and the \n     provisions of S. 1271, as it passed the Senate. Bipartisan, \n     bicameral discussions among interested Members of the House \n     and Senate--principally, Representatives Burton, Waxman, Ose, \n     and Tierney and Senators Lieberman and Voinovich--yielded \n     this consensus proposal.\n       Principal differences between the Consensus Amendment and \n     the two earlier bills, S. 1271 and H.R. 327, include:\n       The Consensus Amendment requires that the Director of OMB \n     publish annually a list of compliance assistance resources \n     available to small businesses. This requirement was in S. \n     1271 but not in H.R. 327.\n       The Consensus Amendment, like H.R. 327, spells out a more \n     detailed and extensive agenda for the task force than S. 1271 \n     in the areas of electronic submission and dissemination of \n     information. Also like H.R. 327, the Consensus Amendment \n     requires the task force to issue two reports, one year after \n     enactment and two years after enactment, whereas S. 1271 \n     required only a single report one year after enactment.\n       The Consensus Amendment, like S. 1271, instructs the task \n     force to examine the feasibility and helpfulness of \n     publishing an annual list by the Director of OMB of \n     information-collection requirements applicable to small \n     business concerns, organized by North American Industrial \n     Classification or another useful system. H.R. 327 instead \n     included a requirement that the Director annually publish \n     such a list.\n       The Consensus Amendment provides that the task force will \n     examine whether agencies should be required to allow small \n     businesses to synchronize reporting for submissions having \n     the same frequency, e.g., by filing quarterly reports on the \n     same date each quarter. S. 1271 included no corresponding \n     provision. H.R. 327, on the other hand, provided that the \n     task force would examine whether agencies should be required \n     to allow submissions ``on the same date.'' The Consensus \n     Amendment provision is derived from H.R. 327, but is \n     limited to submissions having the same frequency, to \n     clarify that the provision does not include changing the \n     frequency of periodic reports, e.g., by converting a \n     quarterly report into an annual report so that information \n     for the entire year could be filed ``on the same date'' as \n     another annual report.\n\n[[Page S4736]]\n\n       The Consensus Amendment requires the task force to publish \n     notice and to provide an opportunity for comment on each \n     report in draft form, and to make provision in each report \n     for the inclusion of any separate views of task force members \n     and a summary of significant public comments. This provision \n     is found in neither S. 1271 nor H.R. 327.\n       Like S. 1271, the Consensus Amendment includes a section \n     requiring agencies to submit reports providing data about \n     enforcement and penalty actions against both small entities \n     and all entities. H.R. 327 contains no such provision. The \n     section in the Consensus Amendment is based on S. 1271, but \n     with modifications to clarify the agencies' reporting \n     obligations and to avoid unnecessary burden on agencies. \n     Whereas the reports under S. 1271 would have been due one \n     year after enactment and every two years thereafter, the \n     Consensus Amendment provides lead time by establishing the \n     first due date on December 31, 2003, and requires one further \n     report due one year later. Also, the Consensus Amendment \n     specifies the one-year reporting period to be covered by each \n     report, and states explicitly that each agency has discretion \n     in defining certain terms as used in the agency's reports.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate has \npassed H.R. 327, the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002.\n  As my colleagues know, small businesses are the backbone of our \neconomy and significantly important to the fiscal health of the United \nStates. Small businesses constitute more than 90 percent of this \nnation's employers, employ 53 percent of the private workforce, and \ncreate approximately 74 percent of this country's new jobs.\n  While on the whole, America's small business owners are successful, \nthe numerous federal paperwork requirements that they must face, I \nbelieve, have had a negative impact on further entrepreneurial growth \nin the United States. There is little doubt that America's small \nbusiness owners could be even more successful if they were able to \ndevote more time and resources to their businesses instead of mountains \nof federal paperwork. That is why I introduced S. 1271, the Senate \ncompanion to H.R. 327, on July 30, 2001. I was pleased when the Senate \npassed S. 1271 on December 17, 2001.\n  This ``good government'' legislation continues the efforts on the \npart of Congress to streamline and reduce paperwork burdens on small \nbusinesses and help increase the productivity of American business. The \nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) has estimated that the federal \npaperwork burden is 7.2 billion hours annually, at a cost of some $190 \nbillion per year. Small business owners are particularly hurt by \nregulatory and paperwork burdens. The Small Business Administration \n(SBA) estimates that the costs to small businesses are a staggering \n$5,100 per employee. While many of these requirements are important and \nnecessary, the high costs of understanding them and complying with them \ncan sometimes prevent small businesses from being able to expand or \neven stay afloat. In some cases, this burden can deter entrepreneurs \nfrom opening in the first place.\n  The Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002 will help improve the \nability of small business owners to understand and comply with federal \nregulations and paperwork mandates through the following helpful \nprovisions:\n  A requirement for the Office of Management and Budget to annually \npublish in the Federal Register and on the Internet a list of the \ncompliance assistance resources available to small businesses;\n  A requirement for each federal agency to establish a single point of \ncontact to help small business owners fill out forms and comply with \nfederal regulations;\n  A requirement for each federal agency to make further efforts to \nreduce paperwork for small businesses with fewer than 25 employees;\n  The establishment of an interagency task force to develop an \ninteractive government web-site to help each small business owner \nunderstand which federal paperwork requirements and regulations apply \nto his or her business;\n  An amendment to the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness \nAct (SBREFA) to require that each agency provide information on the \nnumber of enforcement actions in which civil penalties are assessed, \nthe number of such actions against small entities, the number of such \nactions in which civil penalties are reduced or waived, and the \nmonetary amount of each reduction or waiver.\n  I am pleased that the Senate has taken action in considering this \nimportant legislation, and I am also pleased that the bill enjoys \nbipartisan support. I would particularly like to thank Senator Blache \nLincoln for joining me in introducing this bill. I would also thank \nSenators Lieberman and Thompson for cosponsoring this legislation and \nfor their strong leadership in advancing it through the Governmental \nAffairs Committee and the Senate. I would like to thank all of the \nother cosponsors of S. 1271, Senators Bond, Bunning, Carnahan, Carper, \nCleland, Conrad, Dayton, Jeffords, Kerry, Leahy, and Miller for their \nstrong support.\n  I would also recognize Representatives Dan Burton and Doug Ose and \ntheir staffs for their strong leadership in crafting, introducing and \npassing this measure in the House. I would like to thank Representative \nHenry Waxman and  John Tierney and all the members of the House of \nRepresentatives who supported this bipartisan effort.\n  The Bush Administration is to be commended for their support of this \nbill and I appreciate the valuable recommendations of the Office of \nManagement and Budget that will make this bill more effective in \nhelping our Nation's small business owners. It is my hope that the \nHouse of Representatives will pass this final version of this measure \nshortly and that we will have a final bill for the President's \nsignature very soon.\n  The many business groups who have lent their support and helped us \ncraft a solid bill are also deserving of mention, particularly: the \nNational Federation of Independent Businesses; the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce; the American Farm Bureau Federation; the Cleveland Growth \nAssociation; the Associated Builders and Contractors; the National \nAssociation of Convenience Stores; the American Feed Industry \nAssociation; the National Association of Manufacturers; the National \nTooling and Machining Association; National Small Business United; the \nNational Restaurant Association; the National Pest Management \nAssociation; the Academy of General Dentistry; the American Road and \nTransportation Builders Association; the Small Business Coalition for \nRegulatory Relief; the Small Business Legislative Council; the Small \nBusiness Survival Committee; the Agricultural Retailer Association; the \nAssociated General Contractors; the Automotive Parts and Service \nAlliance; the Food Marketing Institute; the National Automobile Dealers \nAssociation; the National Business Association; the National Roofing \nContractors Association; the Society of American Florists and the North \nAmerican Equipment Dealers Association.\n  Finally, I would like to thank David Gray, a former employee of my \nSubcommittee staff, for all of his hard work on this legislation.\n  Once again, I am pleased that the Senate has acted to provide relief \nto small business owners. This bill will help save time and money and \nwill allow small business owners the ability to better understand and \ncomply with federal regulations and paperwork requirements. It is good \nfor the country and good for our economy, and I thank my colleagues for \ntheir support in passing this bill today.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, every once in a while this body passes \nlegislation that just makes good common sense. Today is such an \noccasion. I am pleased that the Senate will vote today on the \nconference report on the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act, a bill \nthat Senator Voinovich and I first introduced in July of 1999.\n  I want to thank my good friend Senator Voinovich for his leadership \non this issue. His staff members and former staff members, David Gray, \nKathleen Braun, and Kristine Simmons, put in countless hours meeting \nwith members of the business community, firefighters and the \nenvironmental community to achieve the balance that is represented here \ntoday. I also want to thank Senator Lieberman, without whose help we \ncould not be here today. Senator Lieberman, as Chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, steered this legislation to its final \nform, and Larry Novey of his staff was invaluable. Kelly Rucker Bingel \nof my staff worked on this bill from its inception in 1999, and I thank \nher for her efforts.\n\n[[Page S4737]]\n\n  Since I began public service as a member of the House of \nRepresentatives in January of 1993, I have looked for opportunities to \nease the regulatory burden on small businesses. They are the backbone \nof our economy in Arkansas.\n  As I said when we first introduced this bill in 1999, the federal \ngovernment should be a help to small businesses, not a hindrance. We \nshould always seek to ensure that federal policies don't place undue \nburdens on small business owners and tie their hands in red tape.\n  Small businesses are hit hardest by federal regulations. According to \na recent study conducted for the Small Business Administration, ``firms \nemploying fewer than 20 employees face an annual regulatory burden of \n$6,975 per employee, a burden nearly 60 percent above that facing a \nfirm employing over 500 employees.'' This does not even take into \naccount state and local government paperwork.\n  I have been told that federal paperwork burdens rank just behind \ntaxes and the cost of health care as the top problems facing members of \nthe National Federation of Independent Businesses.\n  This bill establishes a single point-of-contact for small businesses \nin each federal agency that governs small businesses. Second, it \nrequires the OMB Director to annually publish in the Federal Register \nand on the Internet a list of compliance assistance resources available \nto small businesses. Third, it establishes a task force to determine \nhow to streamline paperwork requirements for small businesses. It \ndirects the task force to look at creating a single reporting format \nfor all agencies that could be filed simultaneously and electronically. \nIt is our hope that these steps will make it easier for businesses to \naccess information and will allow policymakers to more easily identify \nand eliminate duplicative regulations.\n  The original version of this bill, S. 1378, from the 106th Congress, \nsuspended civil fines on small businesses for first-time paperwork \nviolations if they corrected their error. Our thought behind suspending \nfines for first-time violators was that a majority of small business \nowners who neglect to file a certain form are simply overwhelmed with \npaperwork and don't realize their error. We thought that small business \nowners should be given a chance to correct the problem before they were \nslapped with a fine. I am disappointed that this final version does not \ninclude the fine suspension, but as I often tell my constituents, we \ncan't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. So I am delighted to \nsee final passage of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/22/senate-section/article/S4737-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     APPRECIATION TO SENATOR DAYTON\n\n  Mr. REID.
