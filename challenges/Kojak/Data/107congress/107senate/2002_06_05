Madam President, this is the time of year when our \nchildren across the country are getting out of school. It is also the \ntime of year when many of our great teachers are leaving the classroom \nfor the last time and retiring. I rise today to honor a very special \neducator from my home State of Ohio, Lorna Palagyi. Lorna is retiring \nthis month after 25 years of dedication to Ohio students.\n\n  When I think about her commitment to education, I am reminded of \nsomething Oliver Wendell Holmes once said:\n\n       The main part of intellectual education is not the \n     acquisition of facts but rather learning how to make facts \n     live.\n\n  For a quarter of a century now, Lorna Palagyi has been doing just \nthat--making facts come alive for the\n\n[[Page S4992]]\n\nelementary school children in Madison, OH. She is a graduate of Kent \nState University. She has taught grades 3 through 7 and tutored \nstudents afterschool, served as a mentor for teachers just starting, \nand helped secure funds for several school projects; one in particular \nthat allowed her students to make a large colored map of the United \nStates on their playground.\n  Not only has she been very dedicated to her children at school, but \nshe has also been a terrific mother to her children at home. The mother \nof three children--one of whom happens to be my legislative director, \nPaul Palagyi--Lorna once said the main reason she taught was to help \nher kids through college. But I also suspect the reason she taught was \nbecause she loved to teach and she loved the students.\n  She is certainly dedicated to her family and maintains that she \nsimply could not have done it, could not have taught as long as she \nhas, without the love and support of her husband, Jim. We should all be \ntruly proud of Lorna for her commitment, her dedication to quality \neducation. As my own high school principal, Mr. John Malone, said many \nyears ago when I was in high school: There really are only two things \nthat matter in education: One is a student who wants to learn; the \nother is a good teacher. Lorna is certainly more than just a good \nteacher.\n  Over the next decade we will need, it is estimated, at least 2.5 \nmillion new teachers. That is an unbelievable figure. That represents a \nreal challenge but also an opportunity for this great Nation of ours to \nget more teachers like Lorna into our school systems, into the \nclassrooms, teaching our young people. That is certainly how we will \nprepare our children for their great future.\n  Today, we thank Lorna and we also thank teachers throughout our \ncountry for the great work they do every day for our children. We say \nto Lorna, you are a shining example of exactly the kind of teachers we \nneed educating our children. Enjoy your retirement. You certainly \nearned it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, yesterday we spent a great deal of time \ndoing nothing. We spent most all the day in a quorum call.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, this time \nis under the control of the Republican leader or his designee. Is the \nSenator seeking unanimous consent at this time?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we were in a quorum call. This is the time \nfor Republicans. There is no Republican here, so when they show up I \nwill be happy to sit down. Until they get here, I will use their time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we spent most all of yesterday doing \nnothing. Senator Daschle came on the floor late in the day and filed a \npetition for cloture because he recognized they were going to slow-walk \nthis legislation on the supplemental appropriations bill, and then \nreferred specifically to what one of the Republican Senators said \nyesterday, that they were going to slow down the train.\n  Today's publication of the Congressional Quarterly Monitor suggests \nthey are doing what the majority leader said: Senate Republicans say \nthey will not hesitate to slow-walk legislation important to Democrats, \nwhile aggressively pushing their own agenda.\n  The problem is, at this stage I don't know what ``their'' agenda is. \nWe have tried to move forward on legislation that is important to their \nPresident; namely, this legislation dealing with the supplemental. The \nsupplemental appropriations bill is very important, as we discussed on \na number of occasions yesterday. This legislation is entitled: \n``Supplemental Appropriation Act for Further Recovery From and Response \nto Terrorist Acts in the United States.'' If that is not important, I \ndon't know what is. They are slow-walking that. They are slowing down \nthe train.\n  We read further in the article that a GOP leadership aide said the \namendments to this hate crimes bill and this legislation now before us, \nthat Senator Daschle has not seen fit to bring up, include defense \nauthorization, a terrorism insurance proposal, and cloning.\n  Madam President, as we all know, there was an arrangement to bring up \ncloning. The majority leader agreed to do that. Of course, Republicans \nwould not let us because they were slow-walking the legislation we had \nbefore the break.\n  I spoke to the Senator from Kansas yesterday about cloning. Senator \nBrownback feels very strongly about it. He has indicated he would show \nus his proposal. That is something we want to do. We have offered a \nnumber of unanimous consent requests that we can move forward on, \nterrorism insurance. We, the majority, have tried every way possible to \nbring terrorism insurance before this body. The people who say they \nwant it cannot take yes for an answer. The Republicans simply do not \nwant this brought up. Some do not believe there is a need for it.\n  Anyplace in New York, go to people in Illinois, or people in Nevada, \nall over this country, business communities certainly believe there is \na need for terrorism insurance. We want to do that.\n\n  I am very disappointed we are now in a predicament that we cannot \nmove forward on the supplemental appropriations bill the President \nbelieves is important; we can't move forward on prescription drug \nbenefits, which he says is important, although looking at the proposals \nwe have had from the White House, they are a prescription drug benefit \nin name only. There doesn't seem to be much interest in that.\n  The things we need to do are very important to the people of this \ncountry. It is something as simple sounding as minimum wage. But for \nyears we have not been able to increase the minimum wage for the people \nwho need it. This is important, not to young people who are flipping \nhamburgers at McDonald's but to people raising families. Madam \nPresident, 60 percent of those drawing the minimum wage are women, and \nfor 40 percent, that is the only money they get for themselves and \ntheir families. We need to do this.\n  Instead of going to these issues, we are having everything slow-\nwalked. I do not understand the reason for that. It seems to me for the \ngood of the country we should move forward.\n  This is a closely divided Senate. There is plenty of blame to go \naround if things do not go forward, if we do not make progress. But \nthere is lots of credit to go around if we are able to accomplish \nthings. I hope my friends will decide to move forward with legislation, \nallow us to legislate rather than hesitate, which we have been doing \nfor the last several weeks.\n  The legislation before us is so important. We have talked about it on \na number of occasions, how important it is for the troops we have in \nthe field. It is important for creating homeland security--something as \nsimple as $200 million for security for nuclear facilities. The \nPresiding Officer and Senator Lieberman and I have thought it important \nto do something to beef up security at our nuclear reactor sites. We \nneed to do that because we have rules now at one site for a certain \ndegree of security but at another site there is another degree of \nsecurity. Even having been given 6 months' notice that there would be a \nsurprise exercise to show how ready they were for an attack, even given \n6 months for this so-called surprise, over 50 percent of the reactor \nsites failed in this security issue.\n  There will be a hearing before the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee beginning in a half hour to deal with security of nuclear \nreactor sites.\n  There are things that need to be done to protect our homeland. I hope \nwe can get to that. I hope the effort to slow-walk, slow down the \ntrain, stops immediately.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S4993]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bond pertaining to the introduction of S. 2579 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, over the period of these past weeks I \nhave tried, with other of our colleagues, to bring attention to what is \nhappening across the country in terms of the funding of education.\n  Many of us took pride in supporting the No Child Left Behind Act. Yet \nwe are finding increasing information showing that more and more \nchildren across the Nation are being left behind. We are finding that \ndaily in the reports.\n  In a little while this morning, I and others will be offering an \namendment to try to address some of the special needs in the summer \nprograms which are so important to children, in providing supplementary \nservices to these children.\n  But I will focus on the overall issue we are facing of funding \neducation, and, in particular, with regard to the availability of \nhigher education for children from working families and from middle-\nincome families and low-income families, and the availability and \naccessibility of the Pell grant program to help fund their education.\n  As we have all seen, there have been increasing reductions in support \neven in the areas of higher education.\n  First, I want to talk about the effect of the Bush budget on the \noverall investment in children and in teachers.\n  This chart shows the overall education program. The proposal was for \na 3.5-percent increase last year. We got it up to 20 percent last year. \nThat was really as a result of working together. That is what we all \nwanted to do, to work together with our colleagues and work with the \nadministration. But working together is a two-way street. Part of it is \nreform but also investing in education. That is what we were able to do \nlast year. Yet, this year, we see the administration proposal is only a \n2.8-percent increase, which is completely unsatisfactory. It does not \neven meet the cost of living.\n  Of course, there are increasing numbers of children who are eligible \nfor particularly the title I programs. So we will be, as we move \nthrough the appropriations battle, trying to meet our responsibilities \nto these children.\n  I will bring to the attention of the Members of the Senate what \nhappened just yesterday in New York City. Madam President, 100,000 \nteachers and students in New York City gathered to protest the drastic \nschool budget cuts. There are $358 million in cuts proposed by the \nmayor. One-hundred thousand students and teachers crammed eight blocks \noutside City Hall to protest the drastic school budget cuts proposed by \nthe mayor.\n  Parents want their children educated. They want the Federal \nGovernment to work with the States and local communities to get the job \ndone. If they see they are not getting it done in one area, there ought \nto be support for it in another area. They are tired of excuses.\n  We had the great national debate in terms of K through 12 just this \nlast year. We made some commitments. We have some sense of expectation \nabout what we are asking young people to do. We have some important \naccountability. But if we are going to ask the children to be \naccountable, we ought to be accountable. That is the key issue. If we \nare asking the young children who are going to school every single day \nto be accountable for the work they are to do, it is not too much to \nask whether we are going to be accountable to make sure they are going \nto have the kind of support they need.\n\n  What is happening now is we are failing to do that. Although money \ndoes not answer all of the problems, it is a clear indication of a \nnation's priorities. When you see that we have a virtual abandonment of \nthe commitment in terms of investing in children, and leaving millions \nof children behind because of budget considerations, it is not \nsatisfactory.\n  We are, over the period of the remaining time in the Congress, going \nto be raising this issue. We are putting our friends and colleagues on \nnotice that we are going to insist on accountability in the Senate.\n  Now, I want to mention an item in the supplemental which is very \nimportant, and that is the $1 billion for the Pell shortfall. We are \ngrateful to the appropriators for ensuring that that $1 billion of \nshortfall was included in the supplemental. That is enormously \nimportant.\n  But as we are looking at the shortfall, we have to look at where we \nhave been and what we are looking forward to. If you look at where we \nhave been in terms of the funding of the Pell grants over the period of \nthe recent years, you can look back from 1993 to the year 2001, and the \naverage increase was $167.\n  During the Democratic administration, they raised the Pell grants \nfrom $2,300 to $3,750. That is an increase of $1,450.\n  Last year, it was requested that it be raised by $100. The Congress \nraised that to $250. Look what the administration has requested for \nthis year: zero; virtually zero in their budget in terms of the Pell \ngrants. This is at a time when you have 640,000 more children living in \npoverty, and hundreds of thousands of those children are going to be \neligible for the program, which means there is going to be a further \nwithering away of the Pell grant program. That is fundamentally wrong.\n  If we are talking about trying to improve K through 12--and we intend \nto do so--then we are going to have to have better qualified children \nwho will have an interest in going on to college. Some of those young \npeople will not come from wealthy families. There ought to be a system \nthat is available to them, where if they are of limited income they can \nget the Pell grants, they can get some loans, they can get a work study \nprogram, they can work during the course of the summer, and they can \nput together a package so they can go to a fine public or private \nuniversity.\n  It was the intention of this Congress over a long period of time to \nsay to the young people of this Nation that college was going to be \navailable and affordable. It goes back to the 1860s and the Morrill \nAct, when we had the land-grant colleges. It was repeated at the time \nof the GI bill in the post-World War II period. It was repeated in the \nearly 1960s, when we had grants and loans. At that time, the grants \nwere about 75 percent, the loans 25 percent, and the system worked.\n  But we have seen since that time increasing numbers of young people \nfrom working families, who have the skills, the talent, and the \nintellect to be able to go on to college, are denied that opportunity \nbecause the Pell grant just does not provide the resources and support. \nThat is enormously important.\n\n  We have seen where the administration has failed to fight for \nincreased funding for K through 12. We are saying that the \nadministration is failing to fight for those young people who want to \ngo to our colleges. This, we believe, is absolutely wrong. We are going \nto go to battle and fight for that.\n  Let me just review, very quickly, the recent experience on Pell \ngrants.\n  In fiscal year 1996, the House Republicans cut President Clinton's \nrequest for a $2,600 maximum Pell grant by $180, to $2,420. Congress \nlater enacted a $2,470 maximum award. So even though it was cut during \nthe negotiations, in the final negotiations, the macro-negotiations \nwith the administration, they were able to get a very modest increase.\n  In 1997, the House Republicans again cut President Clinton's request \nfor a\n\n[[Page S4994]]\n\n$2,700 maximum Pell grant by $200, to $2,500. Due to the pressure, \nagain, from the President, the House Democrats enacted a $2,700 maximum \naward.\n  In 1998, a bipartisan year, President Clinton proposed and Congress \nenacted a $3,000 maximum Pell grant.\n  In 1999, fiscal year 2000, the House Republicans proposed a token \nincrease over the Clinton request for Pell grants by $50 in 1999 and \n$25 in the year 2000.\n  In 2001, President Clinton proposed a $3,500 maximum Pell grant, \nwhich was recommended by House Republicans. Led by House Democrats, \nhowever, the maximum Pell grant was later increased to $3,750, \nproviding a $450 increase over the previous year and the largest \nincrease in more than 25 years.\n  Again, in 2002, President Bush proposed a $100 increase for the \nmaximum Pell, the smallest increase in 7 years. The President proposed \nthe smallest increase--this is last year--in 7 years. With a bipartisan \neffort, Congress enacted a $250 increase, raising the maximum level to \n$4,000. And because of anticipated enrollment increases, the budget \nfell short and would have resulted in an actual cut in the Pell grant. \nIn fiscal year 2003, President Bush proposes to freeze the maximum Pell \ngrant at $4,000. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimated \nthat this will result in a cut of the maximum award to $3,900.\n  When we are talking about trying to give a helping hand to young \npeople of talent, ability, and intellectual capability to go to the \nfine schools and colleges of this country after they have gone through \nthe high schools, many of these young people need the kind of financial \npackage which includes some grants, some loans, work study, and other \nprograms. For those in this body who don't understand what a difference \n$100 can make, if you increase fees by $100 or $200 in most community \ncolleges, you will find a reduction in the number of applications of 5 \nor 10 percent; $200 to $300 will reflect a reduction of young people \nbeing willing to commit to that kind of indebtedness. That is what this \nis about.\n  We have tried to show, and we are going to address, the issue of the \nsummer funding programs later on when we have the supplemental. We have \nbeen trying to show in the past weeks the failure to invest in K \nthrough 12.\n  We thank the appropriators for the increase of $1 billion they have \nprovided to make sure the Pell grant is not going to fall behind. But \nas we are thankful to the appropriators for not falling further behind, \nwe are mindful that this administration has requested absolutely zero \nin this budget. They are proposing $600 billion in tax cuts that will \naffect the wealthiest individuals and zero in terms of education for \nPell grants that offer educational opportunities. Those are the choices \nbeing made.\n  We on this side of the aisle find that that is an intolerable and \nunfair choice for millions of hard-working families and their children \nwho have the ability. They don't get the grant unless they are able to \nbe accepted into the schools and colleges. We are demanding excellence \nof those children who go from K through 12. Then when they want to \ncontinue their education, what happens? We have an administration that \nsays: Zero.\n  We want to give the American people the assurance that those of us on \nthis side are going to work with our colleagues and others who are \ninterested, but we will not stand for this kind of indifference in \nterms of support for young people to attend schools and colleges with \nPell grants.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was listening to his speech off the floor. Back home in \nIllinois, we have just gone through a bruising budget battle at the \nState level. As a result of that battle, they have increased tuition at \ncolleges and universities, meaning that families, particularly working \nfamilies that already are trying to save so their kids can go to \ncollege, are facing even higher indebtedness for their children going \nto college, greater cost in tuitions and fees. And if I understand the \nSenator from Massachusetts, on the Federal side of the equation where \nwe help students with Pell grants, for example, the Bush administration \nis proposing cuts in terms of the Pell grants.\n\n  What I would like to ask the Senator from Massachusetts is, isn't \nthis coming at the families in both directions: On the one hand, the \nStates raising the tuitions and costs; on the other hand, the amount of \nmoney available through the Bush budget for families across America is \nbeing reduced? This seems as if it will create really an incredible \nhardship on a lot of these families. Is that the point the Senator is \naddressing?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct. First of all, the general \nestimate at this time is that the budget deficits for States across the \ncountry is somewhere between $48 and $50 billion. The general rule of \nthumb is about a third of that is education cuts. That is being \nreflected in higher fees or tuition. In my State, it is higher fees. \nThat just means the fees will go directly to that particular school. If \nit were tuition, it would go into the State education funds.\n  As far as the student is concerned and the families, they are still \npaying it out of their pocket. It is an increase in taxes. It is an \nincrease in taxes effectively. It is money they will have to pay so \nthat this administration can give tax breaks to the wealthiest \nindividuals. We are interested in its impact in terms of education.\n  What we are seeing is that there is an increasing number of young \npeople of talent, ability, desire, individuals who can contribute to \nthis Nation, to make it a stronger Nation, who can add to the economy, \nadd to the essence of the elements of a democracy, who are being \neffectively shut out. The best estimate we have is that there will be \n100,000 young people with this budget who would otherwise be eligible \nwho will be excluded if we do nothing at all.\n  I don't see how that reflects what the administration has suggested; \nthat is, education is their most important priority.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will continue to yield, if I could follow \nup, we know that he and others, Democrats and Republicans, worked with \nthe President for this education plan, Leave No Child Behind. One of \nthe cornerstones of that plan was making certain we had quality \nteachers in the classroom.\n  Frankly, we are fighting a battle that is pretty tough. With more \nteachers retiring, with the demands on teachers increasing, with the \nnumber of teachers who are lured away to other private sector jobs \nincreasing, we find ourselves struggling to maintain teacher quality.\n  I ask the Senator from Massachusetts, how much easier is it going to \nbe to recruit the next generation of teachers when we are making the \ncost of college education higher? How much easier will it be if those \nyoung students graduating from college have a greater college debt as \nthey come out of school to make the choice to go teach where we want \nthem to teach, K through 12, high school, where we need their skills? \nHow can we maintain teacher quality at a time when the Bush \nadministration's budget is cutting back assistance to colleges, thereby \nincreasing the debt for some students and discouraging others from \npursuing higher education?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to answer the question in two ways:\n  First, to underline the point being made by the Senator from \nIllinois, if it is going to cost more to go, if the children are going \nto borrow more and it will cost more, it will be a disincentive to \nthose who want to have additional degrees in teaching. We want a well-\nqualified teacher in every classroom. This will be a financial \ndisincentive for them to get their degrees, and it will be a \ndisincentive for nurses to continue their education in order to become \nbetter nurse specialists, as it will in terms of child care, to try to \nstrengthen those individuals who are trying to get some degrees to \nincrease their ability to deal with the Nation's children. In those \nthree areas, this will be a further disincentive.\n\n  Second, as the Senator will see from this particular chart I have \nbefore me, the administration's budget does nothing to improve teacher \nquality and reduce class sizes. We had final appropriations of $742 \nmillion last year. The proposed budget is zero for this year. These \nfunds can be used in terms of recruitment, in terms of developing a \nmentoring system which has been so successful, as we found in the \nhearings. In terms of retention, it gives flexibility to local \ncommunities. They need\n\n[[Page S4995]]\n\nthese additional funds to provide financial help for salaries in local \ncommunities.\n  We have given maximum flexibility to communities to ensure that we \nhave a well-qualified teacher in every classroom. We want to provide \nthe incentive to help local communities. We can't do the whole job, but \nwe are committed to trying to do our part.\n  The Senator raises the issue of where we are in the budget for this \nyear in terms of recruitment and maintaining professional development \nfor teachers who want to upgrade their skills. We find that in this \nadministration's budget it is effectively zero over the previous year. \nI am troubled by both of these factors when we say we are serious about \nenhancing education.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me ask the Senator from Massachusetts this question. \nHe was the negotiator, the one who put together this legislation with \nPresident Bush and the White House. Aren't we also imposing some \nobligations on school districts across America to have more teachers \ncertified in certain subjects so that they will teach math and science, \nfor example, computer skills, because they also have the skills and \ntraining to do it? Aren't we saying to school districts in the next few \nyears, we want you to have more and more certified teachers, qualified \nteachers, standing in the classrooms?\n  I hear that when I get back to Chicago in the State of Illinois. They \nsay: That is a good goal. We want to meet that goal. But understand \nthat takes an investment in teacher education and training; that takes \nresources for the school district to attract these good teachers and \nkeep them. Aren't we, in the Bush bill, Leave No Child Behind, creating \na goal of more certified teachers in the classroom and then in the Bush \nbudget not putting in the money to achieve that goal?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  There are many important parts of this No Child Left Behind. But for \nme the point of having a well-qualified teacher in front of every child \nin this country and doing that over a 4-year period--we gave the \npriorities to the areas where we had the neediest children, where you \nhave the highest numbers of teachers who have not gotten their degrees. \nYou have to admire these people anyway; they are teaching in difficult \ncircumstances, and the best information we have is many of them want to \ncontinue teaching in these underserved areas if they will have an \nopportunity to get a degree and enhance their education.\n  But does the Senator know that there will be 18,000 fewer teachers \nwho will be trained this year over last year because we have failed to \nprovide the resources? I ask the Senator what possible sense that makes \nas well.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Massachusetts that we can't \nhave it both ways. We cannot establish standards and say to school \ndistricts across America that we want you to have accountability and \ntesting and the very best teachers in the classroom, we want you to \nprove you can educate our young people so they can produce for the 21st \ncentury, and then have the President send us a budget that doesn't \nprovide the resources.\n  We had the press conferences. Everybody was patting one another on \nthe back and smiling and saying we were all committed to education. Now \ncomes the sorry part of the picture, when the budget itself is not \npresenting the resources the school districts need. As I see it, over \nthe past several years we have made dramatic increases in education, \nincreasing our commitment as a nation to better schools and better \nstudents. Now we seem to have taken a dramatic step behind. I might \nadd, the Senator from Massachusetts understands, as I do, that to do \nthis is terrible, but to do it in order to generate another tax cut for \nthe wealthiest people in America makes no sense at all in terms of \ninvesting for our future.\n  I ask the Senator, haven't we had a long run here of increases in \nspending for education that is now, in the Bush budget, being broken?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, the Senator is absolutely correct. If you take the \npast years of expenditures, the increases, we show that from 1997 to \n2001, in terms of education, it went up 13 percent. In 2002, total \neducation is 16 percent. If you look at the budget request by the \nadministration--I draw this to the attention of my colleagues. Look at \nthe budget projections over the future. From 2003 to 2010, it is \nvirtually zero. It is the cost of living, which in this bill the \nrequest is not--but it is not any increase whatsoever in terms of \nchildren. As a result, we are going to find out the number of children \nwho are going to be left behind.\n  These are the facts. You are going to find out all the way out to \n2007 that you are still going to have--current projections--over 6.5 \nmillion children left behind. If we had funded the legislation--No \nChild Left Behind--which the President signed, we have gone from 6.3 \nmillion down to 3.9 million over that period of time. If we are going \nto say we are not going to leave any children behind, we ought to have \nthis number zero. This is the best we could do in terms of the \nlegislation. This is what the rhetoric is. This is what the reality is. \nThat is what is happening in this country not only in funding this \nlegislation but in school budgets.\n  I would like to inquire of my colleague and friend, does he not find \nin Illinois that parents want their children to be able to go to a good \nschool and learn? They are less interested about what the funding \nstream is going to be from the local, State, or Federal. Obviously, we \nhave a responsibility to meet our obligations as to States and local \ncommunities. The parents want to be sure children are----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. REED). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Now we are putting it at risk--both the kinds of reforms \nwe have gotten out here and in terms of the assurances to those parents \nthat we are going to do our business. Doesn't the Senator agree with \nme?\n  We heard so much about accountability, that we ought to be \naccountable, as well as these children in local schools, and by doing \nthat meet our responsibilities in investing in the children.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator is correct. At this time, parents \nsending their children to school are less concerned about the sources \nof the money going into the schools. They want to make certain that the \nchildren coming out of the school are well educated.\n  Here we have a President who really did some historic things. He made \nan announcement that there was going to be a Federal commitment to \neducation. His political party had said in years gone by they wanted to \neliminate the Federal commitment to education. He said: I am going to \ntake a different course. We are going to make a Federal commitment to \nschools and education and funding. We applauded him, and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts did. We voted with him and gave him a bipartisan, \nstrong vote. We said we will stand with you because every level of \ngovernment should make a commitment to this most basic issue in \nAmerica: educating our children.\n  And now comes the first budget. The promise of the Federal commitment \nto education is disappearing before our eyes. So for the parents in \nIllinois, and in Massachusetts, and in Wisconsin, who are concerned \nabout the quality of schools, they have to feel they have been misled \nby a President who said he wanted to make this commitment but then \npresents a budget that does not.\n  We have to make the difference here in Congress. We have to put in \nthe resources, and I think this Democratic Senate has to lead the way.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Our time is expiring, but we are going to take time \nevery week to go over these figures and give a report to the American \npeople and our colleagues on what is happening in real terms. We are \ngiving the assurances that we are going to fight in these remaining \nweeks and months to make sure we are going to invest in the children. \nWe are very hopeful we will get the support of our colleagues in doing \nso.\n  I thank the Senator and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S4995-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4995-S4996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before Senator Kennedy moves forward and we \ndispense with amendment No. 3570, I extend my appreciation to my \ncounterpart, the Republican whip, who has worked this very hard. It has \nbeen extremely difficult to get to where we are today, but we are \nmoving forward. It could not have been accomplished without the help of \nmy friend from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3583 Withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Kennedy \namendment No. 3583 is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3570\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Reid amendment \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3570) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3608\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the amendment is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself, \n     Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Reid, Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Reed, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3608.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n             (Purpose: To provide emergency school funding)\n\n       On page 89, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 807. EMERGENCY SUMMER SCHOOL FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings; Purpose.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (A) Under the amendments made by the No Child Left Behind \n     Act of 2001, students and schools rightly are held \n     accountable for meeting challenging State academic content \n     and student academic achievement standards in mathematics, \n     reading or language arts, and science.\n       (B) Summer programs and activities supported under the 21st \n     Century Community Learning Centers program are critical to \n     providing supplemental academic services and academic \n     enrichment activities designed to help students meet local \n     and State academic standards.\n       (C) Summer programs and activities supported under the 21st \n     Century Community Learning Centers program help children and \n     the children's families in the areas of youth development, \n     drug and violence prevention, and character education.\n       (D) During the summer of 2002, school districts throughout \n     the Nation will confront more than $150,000,000 in cuts to \n     summer school programs, eliminating services and academic \n     support to more than 150,000 struggling children.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to provide \n     opportunities for communities to provide summertime \n     activities in community learning centers that--\n       (A) provide opportunities for academic enrichment, \n     including providing tutorial services to help students, \n     particularly students who attend low-performing schools, to \n     meet State and local student academic achievement standards \n     in core academic subjects, such as reading and mathematics; \n     and\n       (B) offer students an array of additional services, \n     programs, and activities, such as youth development \n     activities, drug and violence prevention programs, counseling \n     programs, art, music, and recreation programs, technology \n     education programs, and character education programs, that \n     are designed to reinforce and complement the regular academic \n     program of participating students.\n       (b) Funding for Summer School Programs.--\n       (1) In general.--That, in addition to amounts otherwise \n     available to carry out section 4205(a) of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7175(a)), \n     $150,000,000 shall be available to carry out activities \n     described in section 4205(a) of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7175(a)) during the 2002 \n     summer recess period.\n       (2) Awarding of grants.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding section 4202 of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     7172), the Secretary of Education shall award grants with \n     funds made available under paragraph (1) on a competitive \n     basis to eligible entities serving communities whose local \n     educational agencies are not able to meet fully the \n     communities' need for summer school programs.\n       (B) Priority.--In awarding grants under subparagraph (A), \n     the Secretary of Education shall give priority to an eligible \n     entity that is a local educational agency or who serves a \n     community whose local educational agency--\n       (i) serves high concentrations or numbers of low-income \n     children;\n       (ii) before June 6, 2002, announced that the local \n     educational agency is canceling or reducing summer school \n     services in 2002; or\n       (iii) is located in a State whose State educational agency, \n     before June 6, 2002, announced that the State educational \n     agency is canceling or reducing summer school funding for \n     2002.\n       (3) Application and obligation.--\n       (A) Application.--Notwithstanding sections 4203 and 4204 of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     7173 and 7174), an eligible entity that desires a grant under \n     this section shall submit an application to the Secretary of \n     Education at such time and in such manner as the Secretary of \n     Education may require.\n       (B) Obligation.--Not later than 4 weeks after the date of \n     enactment of this section, the Secretary of Education shall \n     obligate funds made available under this section.\n       (4) Definition of eligible entity.--In this section, the \n     term ``eligible entity'' has the meaning given the term in \n     section 4201 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 7171).\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand, we have an hour's time \nlimit to be divided equally. I will make some very brief opening \ncomments and then yield to my colleague and cosponsor, Senator Smith \nfrom Oregon.\n  I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mrs. \nBoxer, Senator Dodd, Senator Reid, Senator Murray, and Senator Durbin.\n  Very briefly, this amendment provides $150 million in emergency \nfunding for fiscal year 2002 to communities to provide students who \nhave fallen behind in their schoolwork the opportunity to catch up with \ntheir peers. The second area of education is to award emergency grants \nto communities that have unmet needs for the summer school programs. \nPriority in funding will be given to communities that have had to \neliminate or cut back their summer school programs due to local and \nState budget reductions and have high poverty rates. Funding is to be \nprovided on a one-time basis to ensure there are safe learning \nopportunities this summer for the neediest children.\n  The bill before us provides urgently needed resources to fight \nagainst terrorism, and this is vitally important to the Nation. But \njust as we must address needs on the war front, we must also turn to \nurgent priorities at home. There is no greater priority than ensuring a \ngood education for our children. Good schools are critical to the \nNation's future, and they are critical\n\n[[Page S4998]]\n\nto our national security and national defense.\n  We want our service men and women to be well trained, well led, and \nwith the latest in terms of technology. In order to be able to do that \nand perform to secure our Nation, they have to be able to have a good \neducation.\n  We have learned in recent days that schools across the country are \ncutting back on their summer school programs, creating an emergency for \nour schools, for our parents, and for schoolchildren. I know the \nSenator from Oregon has a schedule to keep, so I will yield to him and \nthen I will come back and give the Members an idea about what is \nhappening with the cuts in summer school programs and the value of the \nsummer school programs, reaching the conclusion of all who were \ninvolved in the No Child Left Behind Act, if we are going to ask our \nchildren to perform, we have to make sure they are given the kind of \nsupport they need.\n  The 300,000 children who are going to have their summer school \neliminated will not graduate from their schools without this kind of \nassistance because they are the ones who are involved in this program, \nand then we will be faced with what their futures will be without \ncompleting their education.\n  In our education program, we put a strong requirement on the students \nto perform, on schools to support those efforts, on teachers to be \nqualified, and also we have a part as well to make sure those children \nare not going to be left behind.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for \nyielding this time to me. I am pleased to join him in this amendment he \nhas offered in the spirit of no child being left behind. It is obvious \nto anyone that the effect of the recession in many of the States, my \nown included, is that education is suffering devastating cuts and these \nare manifest particularly as to programs such as summer school.\n  Specifically, in my State, Portland, has eliminated summer school \nentirely for elementary school. It has cut its middle and high school \nprograms in half, leaving more than 1,000 students unserved. Similar \ncuts are being made in Eugene, Beaverton, Salem, and in other schools \nacross my State. These cuts are being made in States across the country \nas well, and preliminary reports indicate that as many as 300,000 \nstudents nationwide will not benefit from summer school this year.\n  I emphasize that this amendment is for any school that has unmet \nsummer school needs. In Oregon, it means reversing summer school cuts, \nbut in other States it may mean expanding their limited programs to \nreach more low-income and underserved students. If we do not step in \nand help our schools now, thousands of students across Oregon and \nacross the country will not get the extra attention they need this \nsummer. Those are thousands of students who will suffer next year if we \ndo not act to help them today. Let's give our school districts the \nresources they need to help students who need it most. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this effort.\n  It is my experience as a father, that summer school is a very \nvaluable tool in the home to motivate better academic performance by \nthe children. Just the threat to one's children that if they do not \nbuckle down now, they will be going to summer school, I have observed \ndoes create some degree of terror and dread and better performance.\n  I hate to see this eliminated because my children have shared with me \nlater that it was a good experience and highly motivational to go to \nsummer school. As a Senator, I can, with great enthusiasm, support what \nSenator Kennedy has offered because we have, with the very best of \nintentions, tried to get our economy moving with the stimulus package, \nwith which we tried to backfill the impact of State budgets. That was \ntaken out in a conference committee, against my objections, but it was \ndone, and we passed it.\n  This has created shortfalls in States. This is being manifest not \nonly in health care programs and other cutbacks, but in education \nprograms. It seems to me we have a role because we helped create a \nshort-term deficit so we would have a long-term surplus, that we can, \nwith this package today, help in a critical area by restoring summer \nschool funding.\n  I have seen it work as a dad. I think we need it to work as Senators, \nand I urge my colleagues to join Senator Kennedy and myself in passing \nthis very needed amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 additional minutes.\n  Once again, I give this information to our colleagues about the value \nof the summer school programs and give some examples of the studies \nthat have been done and what the results have been. The most recent \nreview of educational research shows that summer school programs make a \ndifference for students. A recent review of 39 studies shows that the \nacademic test scores declined over summer school vacation. The 13 more \nrecent studies show summer school loss is equal to 1 month of learning \nat grade level. In addition, summer break was more detrimental to math \ncomputation and spelling, and the neediest students lost the most. \nMiddle-class students gained during the summer on grade level reading \ntests while high-poverty students lost ground.\n  Our efforts with the ESEA are to target the neediest students. \nResearch indicates quite clearly what happens to them without any \nsummer school, but listen to what happens to them with it. The Chicago \npublic schools initiated the summer school program in 1996 to help \nchildren who had fallen behind catch up. Eighty-three percent of the \n9,700 Chicago third graders required to attend summer school last year \nhad met their grade level criteria by the end of the summer. That is \nabsolutely extraordinary progress. Seventy-five percent of sixth \ngraders and 71 percent of eighth graders made the grade by the end of \nthe summer. Without summer school, these students would not have been \npromoted to the next grade.\n  Listen to what has happened in Ohio. Ohio test scores for fourth \ngraders show that children in summer school and afterschool programs \nexceeded the statewide percentages of students meeting proficiency \nstandards in every subject area tested: Writing, reading, mathematics, \ncitizenship, and science. Sixth graders exceeded the statewide \npercentages of students meeting proficiency standards in four of the \nfive areas: writing, reading, mathematics, and citizenship. School \nabsences and tardiness were reduced for participating students.\n\n  Look at Fulton County schools in Georgia, operating a summer \naccelerated learning experience that provides full-day summer school \nfor 1st through 12th grade, including the breakfast and lunch for all \nstudents in the community, as well as participating students. In 1999, \nthey provided half-day programs with only 3,000 student participants; \nin 2000, they expanded to full day and attracted twice as many \nstudents; in 2001, they had 10,000 students. This year, they predicted \n11,000 students. The district tested students at the beginning and end \nof the summer and found great improvement.\n  The value of the summer school programs has been defined for students \nacross this country.\n  Against that, we have the schools that are canceling the programs. I \nrefer to an excellent story in the Gannette News Service regarding what \nis happening to summer schools across the country. It points out that \nsummer schools have been a lifeline for students who struggle to meet \nhigher academic standards and face repeating grades. In No Child Left \nBehind, we have tried to eliminate social promotion. Children have to \nmeasure up. Great numbers of children now are required to take summer \nschool in order to be able to meet the academic challenges we have \nincluded in the program.\n  Now we see the canceling of the programs. This is very modest, \ncosting about $1,000. It varies in different parts of the country but \nis basically about $1,000 for the summer program per student. What is \nhappening is, 39 States have made midyear budget cuts during the fiscal \nyear. A May analysis by the National Association of State Budget \nOffices shows they are cutting students from kindergarten through high \nschool in the summer. Expectations are rising, but the funds are not. \nSomething has to break. The programs that could\n\n[[Page S4999]]\n\nbe singled out, such as summer school, are getting the ax, according to \nMichael Griffith, policy analyst with the Denver Education Commission.\n  Across the country, budget cuts imperil summer classes. In \nWashington, DC, educators slice student enrollment at the District 5-\nweek summer program by 50 percent--a reduction in Washington, DC, by 50 \npercent of summer school programs that children otherwise are required \nto take in order to try to meet the standards.\n  In Indiana, more than $470 million in budget cuts forced education to \ncut 15 percent of the money for the summer school programs. As a \nresult, some school districts are limiting class to key academic \nstudies such as reading and math.\n  In South Carolina, districts have trimmed or eliminated summer school \nprograms. ``You cannot cut textbooks; that money was spent the first \nday of school,'' said a spokesman for the South Carolina Department of \nEducation, Jim Foster. One of the few things left to cut--something not \ndone yet--is summer school.\n  I will mention some of the reductions. In Florida, in Dade County, \n19,000 students are cut out of summer school programs; in Hillsborough \nCounty, FL, 36,000 students have lost the summer school program; in \nBroward County, 40,000 students have lost summer programs; in my State, \nMassachusetts: Worcester County, MA, 6,000; more than 25,000 in the \nState of Michigan. Even in smaller communities, in South Carolina, in \nLaurens County, $100,000 for 280 students is eliminated. In Marion \nCounty, SC, $50,000 was eliminated, and 200 students, needy in terms of \neducation requirements, see their program eliminated.\n\n  In Wisconsin, $60,000 in Mequon; 1,200 students. This is over 300,000 \nstudents according to the latest information.\n  This is an emergency. We have in the program provided the Secretary \nobligate the funds within 4 weeks or sooner. If we are able to get it, \nthere is every expectation that the appropriators will move this \nconference rapidly. The differences are minimal. There are some \ndifferences with the House, not great. They will move it rapidly, I \nexpect in a matter of days, and we will get the final outcome with the \ninclusion of this amendment. All that has to happen, from our \nconversations with school superintendents, school boards across the \ncountry, if the Secretary obligates the money, they will have the \nresources and they can reinstate these summer programs.\n  The Department at the present time has on file $150 million in \nworthy, highly regarded 21st century summer school and afterschool \napplications--already ranked and already peer-reviewed, on the \nSecretary's desk. He could approve $150 million worth of those this \nafternoon. They have been peer-reviewed and ranked. All that needs to \nbe done is to give greater targeting to the needy students. We give \ndiscretion to the Secretary to be able to do that. That would be \nmanageable.\n  The Department can promise the funds to those districts placing a \npriority on those canceling the summer school programs or so the \ndistricts can borrow money to resume the summer programs, and the \nDepartment can then reimburse.\n  States contemplate more summer school cuts right now. My own State is \nconsidering a $40 million additional cut. This is a barebones amendment \nto deal with an emergency. If we do not do this, these summer school \nprograms are headed for the chop block. We made a commitment to the \nstudents that we would not leave them behind. The school districts now \nare saying to the students: Look, you have to make the grade in these \nschools, in terms of the tests, and you have to stay and do the work \nover the course of the summer and raise your grades because we are \neliminating social promotion from these States and these local \ncommunities. So the students are prepared to go. And now we are saying \nthe resources will not be there.\n  This is an emergency. It does relate to our security in a very \nimportant way in terms of the education of our children. It seems to me \nthe Senate should be willing to accept this amendment.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Twelve and a half minutes.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very grateful to have 6 minutes to \ntry to put into words my strongest support for this very important \namendment which has been put forward by our leader on education, \nSenator Kennedy, with the strong endorsement of Senator Gordon Smith, \nmaking it a very bipartisan amendment.\n  There is some confusion about what an emergency supplemental bill is. \nI have been in the Congress--hard to believe it--20 years, 10 in the \nHouse and 10 in the Senate, and we take up emergency supplementals all \nthe time because there are unmet needs and we need to act.\n  Senator Kennedy is pointing out a crucial unmet need. I was very \ndelighted when he asked me to speak because I have worked hard with \nhim, with the Presiding Officer, and others on afterschool programs for \nour children.\n  The funding will go into the afterschool programs. We all think of \nafterschool programs as occurring at the end of the day when kids could \ngo home to empty houses, and so on. That is the usual way to think of \nit. But Senator Kennedy is doing something interesting. What he is \nbasically saying is afterschool ends and for some kids there is no \nsummer school. That is afterschool in the broadest sense. So I support \nthese funds going through the 21st Century Learning Centers.\n  When President Bush speaks about education, he talks about leaving no \nchild behind. As a mother, as a grandmother, as a Senator from the \nlargest State in the Union, I know that when you leave a child home \nalone in the summertime, you are really giving a new meaning to ``left \nbehind.'' We know during the regular school year what happens. The FBI \nhas shown us the crime rate going dramatically upward after school \nhours. We know what happens when a child has all day to sit alone at \nhome, without having the chance to have activities funneled into \nsomething positive, without having the chance to hone their skills for \nthe rest of the year.\n  As Senator Kennedy has stated so eloquently many times, we are \nputting much more of a burden on our youngsters to step up to the plate \nand achieve high standards. I support that. But at the same time, to \ndeprive them of summer school this summer just as we are putting all \nthese standards in place is a cruel hypocrisy. If we do not support \nthis amendment, I think we are doing something very cruel indeed to \nthose children.\n  This amendment will benefit every single State in the Union. The way \nit is worded, it will go to States that have a shortfall, but it will \nalso go to areas where there is an unmet need. In my home State of \nCalifornia, summer school is a very high priority. But even with that, \nand even with the fact that in our State you cannot cut it back, in \nterms of State funds, we have a tremendous unmet need. Many of our \nchildren are left behind; 6,000 California students who are eligible \nfor summer school will go without.\n  So I say to Senator Kennedy: Thank you very much on behalf of those \n6,000 children. This is not some theoretical debate. This is a real \nemergency for many of our families who do not have the wherewithal, who \ndo not have the ability to ensure their children are protected from \nbeing alone after the school year is over. I believe with this \namendment we will be making a very strong statement.\n  Again, it is important for colleagues to recognize that this is an \nemergency supplemental. Yes, it has much in it that deals with homeland \nsecurity, and I support every dollar for that. But, again, as Senator \nKennedy has stated, and as former President Dwight Eisenhower stated--\nbecause he was the first one to call attention to this--if we do not \neducate our children, we are taking a national security risk.\n  It is not a stretch in my mind to say that for kids home alone who \nshould have an effective summer school program, that is, in fact, an \nemergency. That is, in fact, something we must address in this bill. It \nis an emergency.\n  Again, I believe the definition of afterschool certainly should apply \nto this situation. After school is over, what happens to our children? \nMany of them will be fortunate, they will have summer school; their \nenergies will be channeled; their talents will be invigorated. They \nwill do better in the\n\n[[Page S5000]]\n\nschool year following. But many of them are left behind.\n  If our President means what he says--and I know in his heart he means \nit--he ought to support this.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his leadership on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time now remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On the other side, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take 2 minutes. I mentioned \nearlier the impact on some of the counties. I want to point out this is \nnot just large communities or small communities, it is in all \ncommunities. I will use, for example, what some cuts mean to children. \nJust for the minute or two, I will use some of the counties in the \nState of Florida, but these are replicated in other communities.\n  In Hillsborough, around Tampa, a $6.2 million cut, which is the \nentire program canceled for 36,000 students not served; Lee County, \n$1.3 million cut, all summer school services have been cut, except for \nthose for the IDEA students. That is 2,500 high school students will \nnot be served.\n  In Leon County, they have $1 million for their summer school program. \nThey have now decided not to serve any of the 3,600 they intended to \nserve.\n  In Manatee County, $1.4 million was cut from their summer program \nleaving just $275,000, so that entire program is canceled, except for \nthe students who need only one credit to graduate.\n  This is being replicated in rural areas, urban areas, all across the \ncountry--300,000 children were depending upon summer school in order to \nmeet their obligations to try to meet the rigors of academic challenges \nin school. If we do not provide the resources here in this legislation \nin a timely way, those programs will be canceled and those children are \nin very serious risk of not being able to move to another grade or to \ngraduate. I think that falls into the definition of an emergency.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3608, As Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the modification that Senator Smith \nand I described be made at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the modification?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The modification of an emergency designation.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no objection to the Senator being able to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3608), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. EMERGENCY SUMMER SCHOOL FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings; Purpose.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (A) Under the amendments made by the No Child Left Behind \n     Act of 2001, students and schools rightly are held \n     accountable for meeting challenging State academic content \n     and student academic achievement standards in mathematics, \n     reading or language arts, and science.\n       (B) Summer programs and activities supported under the 21st \n     Century Community Learning Centers program are critical to \n     providing supplemental academic services and academic \n     enrichment activities designed to help students meet local \n     and State academic standards.\n       (C) Summer programs and activities supported under the 21st \n     Century Community Learning Centers program help children and \n     the children's families in the areas of youth development, \n     drug and violence prevention, and character education.\n       (D) During the summer of 2002, school districts throughout \n     the Nation will confront more than $200,000,000 in cuts to \n     summer school programs, eliminating services and academic \n     support to more than 150,000 struggling children.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to provide \n     opportunities for communities to provide summertime \n     activities in community learning centers that--\n       (A) provide opportunities for academic enrichment, \n     including providing tutorial services to help students, \n     particularly students who attend low-performing schools, to \n     meet State and local student academic achievement standards \n     in core academic subjects, such as reading and mathematics; \n     and\n       (B) offer students an array of additional services, \n     programs, and activities, such as youth development \n     activities, drug and violence prevention programs, counseling \n     programs, art, music, and recreation programs, technology \n     education programs, and character education programs, that \n     are designed to reinforce and complement the regular academic \n     program of participating students.\n       (b) Funding for Summer School Programs.--\n       (1) In general.--Provided that, in addition to amounts \n     otherwise available to carry out section 4205(a) of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     7175(a)), $150,000,000 shall be available to carry out \n     activities described in section 4205(a) of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7175(a)) during \n     the 2002 summer recess period.\n       (2) Awarding of grants.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding section 4202 of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     7172), the Secretary of Education shall award grants with \n     funds made available under paragraph (1) on a competitive \n     basis to eligible entities serving communities whose local \n     educational agencies are not able to meet fully the \n     communities' need for summer school programs.\n       (B) Priority.--In awarding grants under subparagraph (A), \n     the Secretary of Education shall give priority to an eligible \n     entity that is a local educational agency or who serves a \n     community whose local educational agency--\n       (i) serves high concentrations or numbers of low-income \n     children;\n       (ii) before June 6, 2002, announced that the local \n     educational agency is canceling or reducing summer school \n     services in 2002; or\n       (iii) is located in a State whose State educational agency, \n     before June 6, 2002, announced that the State educational \n     agency is canceling or reducing summer school funding for \n     2002.\n       (3) Application and obligation.--\n       (A) Application.--Notwithstanding sections 4203 and 4204 of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     7173 and 7174), an eligible entity that desires a grant under \n     this section shall submit an application to the Secretary of \n     Education at such time and in such manner as the Secretary of \n     Education may require.\n       (B) Obligation.--Not later than 4 weeks after the date of \n     enactment of this section, the Secretary of Education shall \n     obligate funds made available under this section.\n       (4) Definition of eligible entity.--In this section, the \n     term ``eligible entity'' has the meaning given the term in \n     section 4201 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 7171).\n       (5) Emergency designation.--The entire amount necessary to \n     carry out this section is designated by Congress as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as \n     amended.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, regrettably, I must oppose the amendment \noffered by my friend from Massachusetts. I do not like to oppose this \namendment. I would be very supportive of this amendment were it under \ndifferent circumstances and not being offered to this bill. The \namendment would provide $150 million in emergency funding for fiscal \nyear 2002 to support community summer school programs.\n  Last December, Congress approved and the President signed the Labor-\nHHS Education Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002. That act \ncontains significant resources for the summer school program. \nCurrently, the Federal Government provides $1 billion in funding for \nthe 21st Century Afterschool Program. In fiscal year 2002, the funding \nincreased by $150 million.\n  Senator Kennedy makes a very strong case for this program, and I \ncertainly agree with him in the concept, but I cannot support this \namendment as it is being offered to this supplemental bill.\n  This supplemental appropriations bill is focused on providing the \nresources necessary to support the war on terrorism and to secure our \nhomeland.\n  In the supplemental bill, we funded the President's request for $14 \nbillion for the Department of Defense. We have provided $8.3 billion \nfor homeland defense programs.\n  I believe it is essential that the Senate move forward quickly in \napproving this bill so that Federal agencies and State and local \ngovernments have the resources they need now--not later--to prevent, to \ndetect, and to respond to potential terrorist attacks. Funding homeland \ndefense must be our highest priority.\n  Sadly, in the Statement of Administration Policy, delivered to the \nSenate yesterday, I believe it was, the President's senior advisers \nindicated they would recommend that he veto this\n\n[[Page S5001]]\n\nbill because it contains what the administration characterizes as \n``lower priority, nonemergency programs.''\n  It is not clear which of our homeland defense programs the \nadministration was referring to in their statement. Was it the funding \nto train and equip firefighters? Was it the funding to enhance law \nenforcement? Was it the funding to enhance port security? Was it the \nfunding for airport security? Was it the security funding that the \nDepartment of Energy believes is essential to prevent terrorists from \ngetting their hands on nuclear material but that OMB turned down?\n  Regardless, we are facing a veto threat because the advisers to the \nPresident at least, apparently, believe we have too much funding in the \nbill for homeland defense and other programs.\n  I believe the President and his advisers are fundamentally wrong when \nit comes to homeland defense.\n  The Vice President has said we can expect another terrorist attack--\nthat it is almost certain. When might that happen--tomorrow, or next \nweek, or next year? Yet the administration opposes critical homeland \ndefense programs that our recent Appropriations Committee hearings \ndemonstrated were necessary to fill in the cracks in the security of \nour homeland.\n  Having said all of this, I do not believe we should add fuel to the \nfire by adding funding to this bill for a program that was well funded \nin the Labor-HHS Education Act. Was it because the summer school \nprograms used more funds? Senator Kennedy and other Senators make a \ngood case that it could be. But it is not an emergency.\n  I regret having to oppose this amendment. I think I can say without \nany feeling that anyone can question my statement that I have been as \ngreat a supporter of education as any Senator in this Chamber. I have \nsupported education all through the years. I support summer school \nprograms. But I don't support adding $150 million to this bill when the \nthreats of veto downtown indicate we would simply be adding fuel to the \nfire.\n  This is a tough bill. It has been very difficult to bring it thus \nfar. We conducted hearings which were extremely substantive. We had \ngood witnesses. We had witnesses from all over the country--Governors, \nmayors, and people who are at the local level, firefighters, policemen, \nand health officials. We had former Senator Sam Nunn and former Senator \nWarren Rudman come before the committee. We had seven Federal \nDepartment heads. We went into matters very thoroughly on this \ncommittee. We were concerned about homeland defense. We wanted to \nprovide the moneys that could be used in a protective way and in a way \nthat would make our people safe. These moneys are for schoolchildren--\nfor the safety of schoolchildren, for safety in schools, and for the \nsafety of the children and their parents in their homes.\n\n  I just do not want to do anything that would give the administration \nany assistance in arguing that we are going beyond what we should do in \nthis particular bill. We are having a hard enough time with the \nadministration as it is. The Homeland Defense Director, Mr. Ridge, \nwould not come before the committee. The President would not let him \ncome before the committee. So we had to make do with what we could. We \nhad very good hearings even though he did not appear before the \ncommittee.\n  So we are doing the best we can to protect the people of this country \nin the face of imminent threats, if we are to pay any attention to what \nthe administration has said about threats.\n  I hope we will not add this amendment to this bill. It would be \ndifficult enough in conference to carry the bill as it is written.\n  We think what is in the bill, generally speaking, has been the \nproduct of our hearings. The hearings have been studied assiduously by \nthe staff of both sides. And Senator Stevens and I have labored hard to \nbring this bill thus far. I don't want to see this bill vetoed. I hope \nwe can convince the President not to veto it. But I think we ought to \nbe very careful not to be adding amendments on this floor that will \nmake it easier for the administration to make its case.\n  I shall yield the floor at this point. I yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of our \ncommittee.\n  I regret that I must take the position we have to take on this \namendment. It provides emergency funding for communities that have \nsummer school programs. But as we look at it, the priority is given to \ncommunities that have had to eliminate or cut back on programs due to \nState or local budget reductions.\n  We increased the money in the budget for 2002 by $150 million above \nthe 2001 budget in this area. Having increased it $150 million, the \nState and local governments reduced their effort. And now the Senator \nwishes us to make up the reduction brought about by local and State \nreductions which they took because we had provided Federal money to \nassist them in the area. It is a never ending cycle if we do that.\n  But beyond that, I call attention to the fact that we are already in \nJune. There is no way in God's heaven we are going to get this bill to \nthe President before July. The normal processes of releasing money \nwould not get the money to them before September, when the school year \nhas started. This is no way to treat our emergency bill that is before \nus now to deal with emergencies of homeland defense, emergencies in \ndefense, and other emergencies. There are emergencies. The Oklahoma \nbridge is an emergency. But this is not an emergency. They are not \nneeded on an emergency basis. They cannot be spent this summer.\n  I am compelled to oppose the amendment because of the circumstance we \nface.\n  I want to tell the Senate that this is the test. Everybody comes to \nus saying, you two big spenders are going to spend all the money around \nthe place.\n  The Senator from West Virginia and I have the job of trying to urge \nthe Senate to get this bill to conference. As I said yesterday, I would \nlike to see just a motion to go to third reading and take the bill we \nbrought out of committee to conference, and bring the bill back by \nTuesday so it might even get to the President before July 4. But under \nthe procedure we are now following, I seriously doubt this bill will be \non the President's desk before the July 4 recess, which is a travesty.\n\n  This amendment adds to that delay because, I can assure you, the \nHouse will not accept this amendment. It is going to be opposed by the \nPresident and add to the bundle of sticks already there that brought \nabout this threat of a veto.\n  So I want to ask the Senate to support the leadership of our \ncommittee and refuse to accept this amendment because it is not an \nemergency, to vote against this concept of waiving the point of order \nthat the Senator from West Virginia is compelled to make. He, as I do, \nbelieves very much in children. We believe in providing the money that \nis necessary.\n  I am alarmed at the process that is underway whereby as we increase \nFederal spending, the State and local entities decrease theirs, so \nthere is no net benefit to the beneficiaries we are trying to assist by \nbringing some additional Federal money into the areas previously \noccupied totally by State and local funds.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is an emergency. If we do not \nprovide the resources to these States, we are going to see an increased \nnumber of children who are not going to get the help they need.\n  I will point out, before we get all excited about this being an \nemergency, there are a number of items that are included as emergencies \nin this supplemental: National Park Service construction at $18 \nmillion; fire claims for New Mexico for $80 million. I am going to \nsupport that and vote for it. But let's not leave the impression this \nis only for homeland security. I will not go into the several hundred \nmillion dollars for additional items in the bill.\n  If we are going to take care of the fire claims in the Southwest and \nprovide funding for the National Park Service, I think we ought to \nprovide money for children to go to school in the summer. That is an \nemergency, too. I hope that we would do that.\n\n[[Page S5002]]\n\n  The principal money that was increased last year starts in July and \nis for the next fiscal year. These schools and many of the school \ndistricts did not understand the emergency. But the requirements we put \non the schools were not only for the poor children, they were for every \nchild in this country. We ought to be concerned about the emergency \nthat every child in this country is facing when they are being knocked \noff assistance to meet certain standards which our bill last year \nrequired them to meet. That is why this is an emergency and why I think \nit is important.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia controls 16\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time does the opposition have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I know it is easy to point to a bill that is \na $31 billion bill. We increased that bill yesterday by $393 million. \nSo it is $31,393,000,000.\n  Now, it is easy to look at that, easy to pick at little items--pick, \npick--but I think that if those items are considered and studied and \nall the facts are known, they are justified. They are justified.\n  We do the best we can with a big bill. I do not take a back seat to \nanybody in support for the people of this country: the education of our \nchildren, young people, and adults.\n  Last year, the President requested $44.5 billion for discretionary \neducation programs. This level was woefully inadequate. Through \nnegotiations with the White House, I was able to reach agreement on a \nceiling for discretionary spending that was high enough to provide a \n$4.4 billion increase for our Nation's education programs.\n  Following that agreement with the White House, I provided, as \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, an allocation to the Labor-\nHHS Education Subcommittee that was large enough for Chairman Harkin to \napprove a $4.4 billion increase over the President's request and $6.7 \nbillion, or 16 percent, above the prior fiscal year.\n  So if you are looking for ``Mr. Education'' around here, I will stay \nin the ring; I will fight for that as hard as anybody else. I got my \neducation the hard way. I started out in a two-room schoolhouse in \nsouthern West Virginia. I graduated in 1934 in a class of 28 persons. I \nwas the valedictorian. If there had been 29 persons, I might not have \nbeen valedictorian. But it was 16 years after I completed high school \nbefore I was able to start college.\n\n  So don't talk to me about education. You are looking at somebody who \ntypifies the effort to study and to learn and the effort to help others \nto learn.\n  I went to school 10 years at night in this city to get my law degree, \nnot that I ever expected to be a lawyer, but I wanted to learn. I am \nstill learning.\n  I chose this past Sunday to travel miles into the mountains of West \nVirginia to address a commencement. I had several commencement \ninvitations from West Virginia high schools and colleges. I chose one. \nI chose to address the commencement at a high school in Pickens, WV, \nnear Helvetia, a little town that was founded by Swiss immigrants in \nthe early 1800s.\n  How many students were in that whole school? Thirty-seven from \nkindergarten through the senior class. How many students were in the \nsenior class? Three--not 300; two young men and one young woman.\n  Why did I choose them? I wanted to go to that little school to let \nthose little people back there in the hills, who might feel that they \nare off the beaten path, that somebody was interested, somebody was \npaying attention to them.\n  That little school has won several of the Statewide academic awards. \nThey don't go in big for athletics--I don't, either--they concentrate \non academics, and they won several awards. A little school with one \nten-thousandths of the whole school population in West Virginia has won \n11 percent of the academic awards in that State.\n  So I am for education. I want to help our young people. Years ago, I \nfought for summer jobs for young people in this District of Columbia so \nthey could work and, hopefully, stay out of trouble.\n  So I can shout as loud as anybody, and I can believe what I am saying \nas conscientiously as can anybody else. I am doing what I can for \neducation. Education is one of my priorities; it always has been. But \nthis is a different bill. We are talking about the safety of young \npeople who attend schools at Pickens, Sophia, or here in Washington, \nDC. We are talking about the safety of people.\n  This administration tells us that we might see a repeat of what \nhappened on September 11; it is almost certain.\n  This bill needs to pass. We need to get it to conference. We need to \nget it to the President. And I hope that the President will not veto \nit. It is a worthwhile bill--not that the amendment that the \ndistinguished Senator is proposing is not worthwhile. I support that \namendment but not on this bill--not on this bill.\n  I have a job to do here, and it is to try to get the bill through.\n  How many minutes remain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes remain.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the chair, and I yield the floor for now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Gregg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the chairman of the committee. I rise in \nopposition to this amendment which is obviously well intentioned but \nunfortunately is not affordable at this time, and certainly not on this \nbill. It is inconsistent with some of what we have already done in the \narea of summer school education.\n  First, the reason it is inconsistent is that there is no way this \nbill is going to pass in time for this money to get out for the summer \nschool activities. As a practical matter, although it would be a nice \nvote and obviously would be politically attractive, its impact on \nsummer school will be negligible, if any at all, because the money \nsimply will not get there.\n  Secondly, it is important to remember that in the ESEA bill, we have \ngiven the authority to local school districts to spend title I money \nfor the purposes of summer school, which makes a great deal of sense, \nand the President has increased funding for title I by $1.6 billion \nlast year and asked for another $1 billion this year. Those are \nsignificant dollar increases.\n  If a local school district desires, it can use those moneys for the \npurpose of extending the school year or aggressively promoting summer \nschool. The money is in place, already appropriated. As a practical \nmatter, it is following a path which we set under ESEA, which was the \nbill we passed, No Child Left Behind, and is part of that entire \npackage.\n  Although this additional money is certainly well intentioned, I don't \nsee it having much effect because it is not going to get to the schools \nby this summer because the money will not be available in that \ntimeframe.\n  Secondly, we have already funded these programs through the dramatic \nincrease in title I which has come about as a result of the President's \nleadership.\n  For that reason, I oppose the amendment. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will yield the remaining time to \nmyself.\n  While taking care of the war front, we also must take care of the \nhome front. Summer school is an emergency for 300,000 schoolchildren \nwho may not graduate without this amendment. It is just as deserving as \nother emergency items in this bill. There are other emergency items: \nNational Park Service construction, $18 million; Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, department management, $7 million; Forest Service capital \nimprovements, $4 million; fire claims, $80 million. These are all under\n\n[[Page S5003]]\n\nthe emergency provisions. I believe $150 million for summer school \nprograms for children is as deserving as those programs.\n  In the end, this is about families, it is about children, it is about \nwho we are as a nation. Can we protect our interests abroad and also \nhelp our children here at home?\n  I know a point of order will be made. I hope we would add this as an \namendment to meeting emergency requirements such as those other items I \nindicated have been included. Children, summer school programs, ought \nto be included as well.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time, \nor I will withhold the time depending on the opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  Mr. President, the supplemental also contains $1 billion for the Pell \ngrant shortfall. That is a key education program. I want the record to \nshow that the bill is certainly not devoid of moneys that are to be \nspent in the interest of education.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts like some of my time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I think we have had a good \ndiscussion. I am prepared to yield back the time. I am very grateful to \nthe Senator. We are prepared to yield back the time and move ahead. I \nwould retain that time if others were going to speak, but I am prepared \nto move to the vote on what will probably be a point of order. If the \nSenator cares to, I will yield back my time, if those in opposition \nwill yield back their time.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time does the Senator from Massachusetts have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. That would be a good tradeoff.\n  I consider the Senator from Massachusetts to be not only a fine \nSenator, but he is my friend. He is very interested in fostering \neducation and providing good legislation and good funding. If he wants \nanother 3 minutes, I will be glad to yield him 3 minutes of my time. I \nam ready to make a point of order, but I don't want to do it without \ngiving the Senator or any other Senator who wishes to speak time on his \nbehalf.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I mentioned, we are prepared to move ahead with the \nresolution. I will yield back my 30 seconds. I understand when all time \nhas expired, then a point of order will be made. We will let the Senate \nmake a decision. I thank the Senator very much for extending me the \ntime. We have had other Senators who have spoken. I think we are \nprepared to move ahead.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. Mr. President, I am constrained to recall a \nlittle poem which I think the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nwill like. I like it very much. I think we are both interested in the \nsame cause, the education of our young people.\n  As a Senator who has great-grandchildren, I certainly hope for the \nbest for these great-grandchildren and the great-grandchildren of all \nother great-grandparents in the country.\n  I guess I will close my opposition to this amendment with this brief \nrecapitulation of verse:\n\n     I took a piece of plastic clay\n     And idly fashioned it one day--\n     And as my fingers pressed it, still\n     It moved and yielded to my will.\n\n     I came again when days were past\n     The bit of clay was hard at last.\n     The form I gave it, still it bore,\n     And I could change that form no more!\n\n     I took a piece of living clay,\n     And gently fashioned it day by day,\n     And molded with my power and art\n     A young child's soft and yielding heart.\n\n     I came again when years were gone:\n     It was a man I looked upon.\n     He still that early impress bore,\n     And I could fashion it never more.\n\n  I think that pretty well sums up my feeling toward our young people, \nour children, the education of our young people. Now is the time, the \nformative period in their youth when we can shape and mold them to our \nwill. Now is the best time for the learning process, while they are \nyoung and they don't have the other cares that they will have later.\n  I compliment the distinguished Senator for his offering of this \namendment. I oppose it with apologies. But I can't help it. This bill \nis not the bill on which we should attach this amendment, however \nworthy the amendment.\n  With those apologies, I will make the point of order. I yield back my \ntime.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if I may have 30 seconds, I thank my \nfriend from West Virginia. He can make a speech in favor of education, \nname every one of his elementary and secondary schoolteachers, give all \nof their background, and convince this body of the importance of \nfunding. I am looking forward to standing with him, hopefully shoulder \nto shoulder, as we move on into these appropriations to try to do what \nneeds to be done for the children of this country. I always enjoy the \nchance of working with him. My time has expired, I understand.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. I assure him we will be standing \nshoulder to shoulder in many instances.\n  Mr. President, section 205 of H. Con. Res 290, the fiscal year 2001 \nconcurrent resolution on the budget, created a point of order against \nan emergency designation on nondefense spending. The amendment contains \nnondefense spending with an emergency designation.\n  Pursuant to section 205 of H. Con. Res 290, the fiscal year 2001 \nconcurrent resolution on the budget, I make a point of order against \nthe emergency designation contained in the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to waive section 205 of H. Con. \nRes 290, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2001 \nfor purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: The ``yea'' vote \nwill be interpreted as waiving the Budget Act for the purpose of this \namendment, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A ``yea'' vote is in favor of waiving the \nBudget Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.

Budget evasion point of order.''.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator \nFeingold, Senator Chafee, Senator Kerry, Senator Voinovich, and Senator \nMcCain.\n  Essentially, this amendment does two things. It reinstitutes the caps \nand it reinstitutes the pay-go language. It puts back in place \nbudgetary discipline as we move through this process of appropriations \nbills.\n  Recently, we have seen the budget discipline within the Congress has \neroded rather dramatically. We have seen the Agriculture bill and the \ntrade adjustment bill both adding massive new entitlement programs. We \nknow as we look down the road we will have very significant costs in \nthe area of fighting terrorism and in the area of natural defense. It \nis absolutely critical in this context that we start to put some budget \ndiscipline in place.\n  We are facing, regrettably, a deficit, something we hoped would not \nhappen, but it has happened as a result of the economic slowdown and as \na result of the effects of terrorism. The deficit is growing rather \nradically, unfortunately. Our job as legislators is to make sure we do \nnot aggravate that deficit by not being fiscally responsible as we \nbring forward appropriations bills and other bills which might have \nentitlement spending included.\n  Unfortunately, the disciplining mechanism which actually exists out \nthere, or has existed for the last 5 or 6 years, is about to lapse; \nthat is, the ability to have a fixed number beyond which if we are \ngoing to spend we have to have a supermajority to do that. That is \ncalled caps.\n  The second budget discipline, which is pay-go, essentially says if \nyou are going to add a new entitlement program or you are going to cut \ntaxes during a period, especially of deficits, you must offset that \nevent so that it becomes a budget-neutral event that also lapses.\n  This language which Senator Feingold and I have put together and \nwhich failed on a very close vote in the Budget Committee, a tie vote, \nin fact--it would have passed with one more vote--reinstitutes the same \ntraditional approach--so 5-year caps, 5-year pay-go, and, as a result, \nput in place some discipline.\n  There are some subtleties to our bill about which I want to be open. \nSome people have looked at them and said they are interested in them \nand some said they are concerned about them. One is the way we enforce \nthis mechanism by saying the bill which exceeds the caps allocated to \nit by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the 302(b) \nallocation, that if a bill exceeds that cap, that bill is subject to a \npoint of order on specific parts of that bill, depending on what part \nof that bill is unable to be sustained with 60 votes. So it becomes a \ntargeted approach of trying to bring that bill back into proper \nperspective as far as appropriations and the budget are concerned.\n  Second, the basis for the cap is the Democratic budget proposal as it \npassed the committee. So the numbers are for the 5 years. Those were \nthe gross numbers. Those numbers are higher than those of the President \nthis year by $9 billion, but over the 5-year period they are actually \nabout the same as the President's number. In fact, I think they are \nwithin a couple of billion dollars of each other. As a practical \nmatter, there is a path toward maintaining fiscal responsibility.\n  If we do not do this, if we do not put back in place caps and pay-go \nmechanisms, we will have no budget discipline in this Congress, and, as \na result, we will dramatically aggravate the deficit which, of course, \nimpacts a lot of important issues, but especially impacts Social \nSecurity.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will support this effort. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I rise today to join with my colleague from New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg, as well as my colleagues Senators Chafee, \nKerry, Voinovich, and McCain to offer this amendment, which I believe \nis a commonsense budget process amendment, the Budget Enforcement Act \nof 2002.\n  Let me especially thank the Senator from New Hampshire, who has been \na terrific leader on this issue. As he said, we made a real effort in \nthe Budget Committee, had an excellent debate with the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and only lost on a 9-to-9 vote. We were hoping \nfor a good result today, but we are both devoted to returning some \nbudget rules because we both believe this is one of the main reasons we \nwere able to have some success in the 1990s in bringing the budget \nunder control and actually getting to the point where we had a surplus \nfor a brief period of time.\n  In the 1990s, we took fiscally responsible actions that led to \nbalancing the budget in 1999 and 2000, without using Social Security, \nwhich was a tremendous achievement. Last year, the Government returned \nto the bad habit of using the Social Security surplus to fund other \nGovernment activities. I believe we have to put an end to that \npractice. The Government will not have these Social Security surpluses \nto use forever. In the next decade, the baby boom generation will begin \nto retire in large numbers. Starting in 2016, Social Security will \nstart redeeming the bonds that it holds, and the non-Social Security \ngovernment will have to start paying for those bonds from non-Social \nSecurity surpluses.\n  The bottom line is that, starting in 2016, the Government will have \nto show restraint in the non-Social Security budget so we can pay the \nSocial Security benefits that Americans have already earned or will \nhave already earned by that time.\n  That is why we cannot continue to enact either tax cuts or spending \nmeasures that push the Government further into deficit. Before we enter \nnew obligations, we need to make sure we have the resources to make our \nNation's commitment to our seniors under Social Security. I believe we \nneed to return to the priority of protecting the Social Security trust \nfund. We should, as President Bush said in a March 2001 radio address, \n``keep the promise of Social Security and keep the Government from \nraiding the Social Security surplus.''\n  Yes, September 11 changes priorities and how the Government spends \nmoney, but September 11 does not change the oncoming requirements of \nSocial Security. As an economist has said: Demographics is destiny; we \ncan either prepare for that destiny or we can fail. To get the \nGovernment out of the business of using Social Security surpluses to \nfund other Government spending, we need to strengthen our budget \nprocess. That is what this amendment does and that is why we urge our \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The history of budget process changes teaches that realistic budget \nenforcement mechanisms work. The\n\n[[Page S5006]]\n\nBudget Enforcement Act of 1990, enacted with bipartisan support, with a \nDemocratic Congress and a Republican President, deserves much credit \nfor helping to keep the Government on that path to reduce and \neventually eliminate the deficit.\n  A central feature of the 1990 act was the creation of caps on \nappropriated spending. Of course, in recent years, Congress has blown \nthrough those caps, when those caps were at unrealistic levels, and \nwhen the Government was running surpluses. But in most years of their \nhistory, appropriations caps helped to constrain the politically \nunderstandable appetite to spend without limit.\n  Congress has repeatedly endorsed the idea of spending caps. Congress \nrenewed and extended the caps in the budget process laws of 1993 and \n1997. And six of the last eight budget resolutions have set enforceable \nspending caps. If budget numbers are to have any meaning--if they are \nnot to be just wishes and prayers--then we need to have enforcement.\n  Our amendment would reinstate and extend the caps on discretionary \nspending, and would do so at a realistic baseline. It would simply set \nthose levels at those in the budget resolution reported by the Budget \nCommittee on March 22. And our amendment maintains, without change, the \nseparate subcaps created in the Violent Crime Act of 1994 and the \nTransportation Equity Act of 1998.\n  Like the 1990 budget law that it extends, our amendment would apply \nbudget enforcement to entitlements and taxes. It would extend the pay-\nas-you-go enforcement mechanism. All parts of the budget would thus be \ntreated fairly.\n  Our amendment would also improve the points of order that enforce the \ncaps and pay-as-you-go enforcement. It would allow Senators to raise a \npoint of order against specific provisions that cause the caps or pay-\nas-you-go discipline to be violated. This part of the amendment will \nwork very much like the important Byrd rule that governs the \nreconciliation process, which is of course named after the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  Under our amendment, if a piece of legislation violates the caps or \npay-as-you-go discipline, any Senator could raise a point of order and \nforce a vote on any individual provision that contributes to the budget \nviolation. If the point of order is not waived, then the provision \nwould be stricken from the legislation.\n\n  The amendment would also shut back-door ways around the caps and pay-\nas-you-go enforcement, by requiring 60 votes to change the caps, alter \nthe balances of the pay-as-you-go scorecard, or direct scorekeeping.\n  Our amendment would limit the exceptions to the point of order \nagainst emergency designations in the fiscal year 2001 budget \nresolution, so that all emergencies would be treated alike. Our \namendment would thus treat emergencies as they were treated in the text \nof that budget resolution when the Senate passed it on April 7, 2000, \nrather than in the watered-down form it had when it came back from \nconference with the House of Representatives.\n  Finally, our amendment would extend for 5 years the requirement for \n60 votes to waive existing points of order that enforce the \nCongressional Budget Act. The 60-vote requirement that gives these \npoints of order teeth expires on September 30 this year under current \nlaw.\n  This is sensible budget process reform, in keeping with the best, \nmost effective budget process enforcement that we have enacted in the \npast. It would make a significant contribution toward ending the \npractice of using the Social Security surplus to fund other government \nactivities. That is something that we simply must do, for our seniors, \nand for those in coming generations who will otherwise be stuck with \nthe bill. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the \namendment be printed in the Record. \n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Gregg-Feingold-Chafee-Kerry Amendment--Budget Enforcement Act of 2002\n\n       Appropriations Caps--The amendment would reinstate and \n     extend for 5 years the caps on discretionary spending, keyed \n     to the levels in the budget resolution reported by the Budget \n     Committee. Points of order and the threat of across-the-board \n     cuts would continue to provide enforcement.\n       Pay-as-You-Go Entitlements and Taxes--The amendment would \n     reinstate and extend the pay-as-you-go discipline that \n     controls entitlement spending and tax law changes. Points of \n     order and the threat of across-the-board cuts would continue \n     to provide enforcement.\n       Point of Order Against Specific Provisions that Violate the \n     Caps or Pay-as-You-Go--If legislation violated the caps or \n     pay-as-you-go enforcement, the amendment would allow any \n     Senator to raise a point of order against (and thus force a \n     vote on) any individual provision that contributed to the \n     budget violation. If the Senate did not waive the point of \n     order, then the provision would be stricken from the \n     legislation. This point of order would work just like the \n     Byrd Rule against extraneous matter in reconciliation \n     legislation.\n       Guarding Against Budget Evasions--The amendment would shut \n     back-door ways around the caps and pay-as-you-go enforcement, \n     by requiring 60 votes to change the discretionary caps, alter \n     the balances of the pay-as-you-go scorecard, or direct \n     scorekeeping.\n       Extending Existing Points of Order--The amendment would \n     extend for 5 years the requirement for 60 votes to waive \n     existing points of order that enforce the Congressional \n     Budget Act. The 60-vote requirement that gives these points \n     of order teeth expires on September 30 this year under \n     current law.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nwill be charged proportionately against the Senators who control time.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. \nChafee.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I rise today in support of the amendment \nsponsored by Senators Gregg, Feingold, Kerry, Voinovich, McCain, and \nmyself.\n  This is a commonsense amendment that extends existing appropriations \ncaps and pay-as-you-go rules for another 5 years. In addition, the \namendment strengthens some budget enforcement mechanisms.\n  The Senators that have spoken before me have done an admirable job of \nexplaining the provisions in the bill. I want to stress the necessity \nof fiscal discipline.\n  Every day constituents and experts talk to me about spending programs \nthat are vitally important to them, asking me to support increased \nspending. Just as often I hear from people who want to do away with \nsome tax, or lower a tax. They all have excellent arguments, and there \nis much merit to the initiatives they would like me to support. The \nproblem is that if I were to support each of them, I would be \nsupporting an agenda of cutting taxes and increasing spending. Such an \nagenda would directly result in deficit spending, which would increase \nthe already enormous Federal debt.\n  In good conscience, I cannot support such an agenda. Therefore, often \nI must tell visitors that I cannot be supportive of their cherished \ninitiative. As all in this body know, telling constituents that you do \nnot support their project is a difficult job, especially when the \nreason that I give them is that ``The money just isn't there.'' Because \nthey respond by saying, ``The money always seems to be there.''\n  The problem is that they are right. In a time of war, and deficits, \nwe have approved new tax cuts, which I opposed. We are contemplating \npermanently extending other tax cuts, which I will oppose. As if that \nwere not enough, we also have added a raft of new spending--including \nthe farm bill and the stimulus--which I opposed. There is no end in \nsight.\n  We have gone from record surpluses straight back to deficits. We \napproved a massive tax cut last year, which limits the amount of money \navailable. We know that the war on terrorism will be very costly. We \nknow we are facing unprecedented demographic changes that will result \nin staggering costs to sustain Social Security and Medicare. Added to \nall that, we have a $6 trillion debt, which costs $200 billion in \ninterest payments each year. And we practice no restraint. We continue \nto spend money, deepening the hole we are in.\n  This amendment is a step towards reestablishing fiscal discipline in \nthis body. It alone will not ensure the return of balanced budgets--but \nit is a step in the right direction. Therefore, I\n\n[[Page S5007]]\n\nurge all my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 8 minutes; \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, 9.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask the Chair to advise me when I have \nconsumed 10 minutes.\n  Madam President, the amendment offered by our colleagues is well \nintentioned. In fact, I share many of the goals they have enunciated \ntoday. We have an enormously serious problem with the fiscal condition \nof the country. This chart shows that we are now headed for a return to \nan era of deficits that is going to continue long into the future. This \nchart goes back to 1992, back to the time when we were deep in deficit. \nMany of us know the extraordinary efforts that were required to lift us \nout of deficit, back into surplus, which we enjoyed for just a few \nshort years.\n  Last year, a series of decisions were made on a massive tax cut. \nThen, of course, the attack on the country occurred that led to \nincreased spending for defense and homeland security. At the same time, \nthere was an economic slowdown. We experienced those three events--the \nmassive tax cut, the attack on this country that led to increased \nspending, and, of course, the economic slowdown. Those three, led by \nthe tax cut--the tax cut was the biggest contributor to returning to \ndeficit--has plunged us back into deficit by very large amounts that \nare going to continue the rest of the decade. That is the circumstance \nwe face.\n  The proposal by our colleagues has a very serious set of problems \nattached to it. They have gone to what is an enforcement mechanism that \nwe have seen in the past. If you liked Gramm-Rudman, you will love \nGregg-Feingold because they have returned to the notion of enforcement \nbased on projections; not what actually happens but based on \nprojections of what will happen.\n  This is a fatal flaw. In fact, it could undermine the very budget \ndiscipline they are seeking to support. Have we forgotten what happened \nunder Gramm-Rudman? Have we forgotten the endless game playing and \ngimmicks that resulted from Gramm-Rudman?\n  Have we forgotten the rosy scenario? Let us go back to 1990 and look \nat what could happen under the proposal of our colleagues to now again \nrely on forecasts and projections rather than real results.\n  Back in 1990, OMB told us at the beginning of the year that we were \ngoing to have a $100 billion deficit. They were right on track with the \ndeficit reduction plan that was in place. That is what they said.\n  What actually occurred? It wasn't a $100 billion deficit. It was a \n$221 billion deficit.\n  All projections, all false; all that lead to a circumstance under the \nproposal from the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from \nWisconsin that could lead a Congress to have more tax cuts, more \nspending, based on a projection that everything was OK. Later in the \nyear, when reality sets in, their answer is to only deal with half of \nthe equation that leads to budget deficits. Budget deficits are a \nresult of an imbalance between spending and revenue. Their only answer \nis on the spending side of the equation. That is, I think, a mistake.\n  Let us look at what it took to get us back into balance. Back in the \n1980s--here is the blue line, the revenue line, and the red line is the \nspending line. We can see for a very long period that spending exceeded \nrevenues, and by large amounts. The result was a quadrupling of the \ndebt of the United States.\n  What happened in 1993? We passed a plan to cut spending and to raise \nrevenue. It was that combination that led us back to fiscal \nresponsibility, that led us back to balance, that eliminated deficits, \nand that reduced debt.\n  Have we forgotten that worked?\n  I hope very much that we don't go down this slippery slope of a whole \nnew enforcement mechanism based on projections rather than real \nresults. That way leads to real trouble.\n  In addition to those problems, our friends who are coming before us \nwith this amendment--well intentioned as it is--I think do \nunderestimate the uncertainty of our time.\n  When this headline appeared on September 12, everything changed. This \nheadline says, ``U.S. Attacked.''\n  We all remember that somber day when there were two strikes at the \nWorld Trade Center and passenger airliners turned into flying bombs, \nand what happened shortly thereafter with the attack on the Pentagon. \nThat changed everything. We are now in a period of extraordinary \nuncertainty.\n  Here are recent headlines that talk about uncertainty. This is the \nVice President of the United States warning of future attacks:\n\n       Possibility of another al-Qaida strike ``almost certain,'' \n     the Vice President says.\n\n  In this circumstance, we should not be tying the hands of the \nCongress and the administration for the next 5 years. None of us are \nwise enough to know what demands may be made on this country. None of \nus can know what is in the next 24 hours, much less the next 5 years.\n  We ought to be ready to respond to any attack and any strike against \nthis country. We ought not to be in a fiscal straitjacket that makes a \nresponse more difficult.\n  It is not just the Vice President of the United States. This is the \nhead of the FBI: ``Warns of Suicide Bombs.''\n\n       Calls U.S. attacks akin to those on Israel inevitable.\n\n  Our friends who are sponsoring this amendment will say we have a way \naround that for defense spending. We only have a simple majority vote \nfor additional defense spending.\n  Those are not typical defense expenditures that are being used to \nrespond to terrorist attacks. Defense is part of it, but another part \nis called ``homeland security.'' Homeland security funding is not off \nin the defense budget. It is in the budget of the FBI, it is in the \nbudget of the INS, it is in the budget of the FAA, it is in the budget \nof the Transportation Department, and it is in the budget of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to respond to attacks and to \nbioterrorism. The money needed to defend this Nation is not just in the \ndefense budget.\n  Have we forgotten the response of this Congress to the attacks of \nSeptember 11? Was it just defense spending that we increased? \nAbsolutely not. We also responded with money for homeland security \nbecause we understood a terrorist threat to this country could not be \njust defended in the traditional way.\n  The uncertainty goes to other areas as well. This is a headline of \nTuesday of this week in USA Today:\n\n       Nuclear Clash Would Batter World Financial Markets.\n\n  They are talking about what would happen if a nuclear exchange \noccurred between India and Pakistan. They alert us to the fact that it \nwould batter world financial markets.\n\n       Nuclear war would spark a sell-off and send world stock \n     markets tumbling.\n\n  This is a period of uncertainty, and we ought not to be tying the \nhands of the Congress being able to respond.\n  The uncertainty is not just on the spending side of the equation. It \nis also on the revenue side of the equation.\n  This is a headline of April 26 in the Los Angeles Times:\n\n       Lower Tax Receipts Could Double the United States Budget \n     Deficit . . .\n\n  In this year alone.\n  I agree with that analysis. I think we are headed for a budget \ndeficit this year of perhaps $160 billion and next year an even larger \nbudget deficit.\n  That is why enforcement provisions are critically important. But they \nhave to be enforcement provisions that will actually work and not make \nthe situation worse.\n  I wish to announce my intention now to offer the budget enforcement \nprovisions that have worked, and to do so after the disposition of this \namendment.\n  Let me add one other observation about the amendment that is being \noffered.\n  The Gregg-Feingold proposal extends the statutory pay-as-you-go \nenforcement procedures for 5 years, but it substantially amends the \ncurrent pay-go\n\n[[Page S5008]]\n\nlaw to allow direct spending increases or tax cuts to be enacted \nwithout being paid for if the Office of Management and Budget projects \nthat there will be a surplus without Social Security.\n  That is the Achilles' heel of this amendment. It is based on \nprojections and not real results.\n  We have been down that road before. It was a disaster for fiscal \nresponsibility. Let us not repeat it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise in support of the Gregg-Feingold-\nKerry amendment. I believe there is no perfect solution. There is no \nperfect answer to the problem we face. Perhaps some may argue that the \ncaps for the first year are too high. Perhaps if I had written this \namendment I might have made them lower. The fact is, without this \namendment, there is no fiscal discipline. There is no fiscal discipline \nthat can be imposed on a process which has lurched out of control.\n\n  To state the obvious, we have gone from estimates of $50 or $60 \nbillion surpluses at the beginning of this year, to somewhere around \n$100 billion, $150 billion deficits, and we have not even passed the \nfirst appropriations bill. And if this emergency supplemental, which is \n$4 billion higher than the President's, is any indicator, we are going \nto be in a sea of red ink.\n  I think it is a bipartisan effort. It extends discretionary spending \ncaps and the pay-go requirement for entitlement expansions and tax \ncuts.\n  These mechanisms have helped to impose fiscal discipline since they \nwere first enacted in 1990, but they obviously expire this year. It \nwould be ironic and irresponsible to let the caps and the pay-go expire \njust when the budget is punching back into deficit.\n  There are a lot of organizations around the country. One that I \nrespect, and I know my colleague from New Hampshire respects, is the \nConcord Coalition.\n  The Concord Coalition is chaired by former U.S. Senators Warren \nRudman and Bob Kerrey. They serve as the Concord Coalition's cochairs. \nAnd former Secretary of Commerce Pete Peterson serves as president.\n  They issued some grades. They are a fiscal responsibility \norganization. And the Concord Coalition just released this report on \nfiscal responsibility:\n  Overall: Progress toward short, medium, and long-term fiscal \nresponsibility, D;\n  Short-Term: Enacting measures that maintain fiscal responsibility, \nC-;\n  Medium-Term: Enacting measures that are fiscally responsible over the \nnext 10 years, D-;\n  Long-Term: Enacting measures that deal with the entitlement financing \ngap and ensure fiscal sustainability, D-.\n  They begin their report by saying:\n\n       Crocodile tears are flowing over the return of budget \n     deficits--now likely to exceed $100 billion this year and \n     next. Nearly everyone says they want the dip back into red \n     ink to be brief. But almost no one is willing to give up \n     anything to ensure that result. Indeed, the attitude seems to \n     be: if deficits are back, let's make the most of them and \n     blame someone else for the result.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The bottom line--obscured but not altered by the events of \n     2001--is that our nation's greatest fiscal challenge remains \n     the need to finance the huge unfunded retirement benefits and \n     health care costs of a permanently older population.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this release be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Concord Coalition, June 2002]\n\n        The Concord Coalition's Report on Fiscal Responsibility\n\n\n     Deficits are back, and the budget bazaar is open for business\n\n       It is now clear that the appropriate loosening of fiscal \n     policy undertaken in response to the mild recession and \n     devastating terrorist attacks of 2001 is turning into a \n     headlong retreat from long-term fiscal responsibility. \n     Crocodile tears are flowing over the return of budget \n     deficits--now likely to exceed $100 billion this year and \n     next. Nearly everyone says they want the dip back into red \n     ink to be brief. But almost no one is willing to give up \n     anything to ensure that result. Indeed, the attitude seems to \n     be: if deficits are back, let's make the most of them and \n     blame someone else for the result.\n       Tax cut advocates, defense hawks, farmers, educators, \n     health care providers and beneficiaries, transportation \n     planners, and veterans groups all insist that deficits are no \n     reason to scale back their claims on a surplus that no longer \n     exists. Each interest group has a grassroots constituency and \n     an army of lobbyists. And each is prepared to threaten \n     political retribution if every dime of its wish list is not \n     funded. This may be an attractive short-term political \n     strategy, but it's a terrible long-term fiscal policy.\n       The bottom line--obscured but not altered by the events of \n     2001--is that our nation's greatest fiscal challenge remains \n     the need to finance the huge unfunded retirement benefits and \n     health care costs of a permanently older population. The Baby \n     Boomers' retirement costs will begin to impact the budget in \n     just six years, and there is no plan for dealing with them \n     other than to run up the debt. Surpluses would help by either \n     reducing the debt, which provides needed savings and fiscal \n     flexibility, or by providing resources to help pay the \n     transition costs of Social Security and Medicare reform. \n     Deficits can be acceptable as a short-term fiscal stimulus, \n     but returning to chronic deficit spending would make the \n     long-term challenge far more difficult.\n       Washington policymakers should focus on regaining budget \n     surpluses as soon as is practicable. Instead, the recent \n     breakdown in fiscal discipline, the refusal to acknowledge \n     many likely expenses, and the wavering commitment to any \n     particular goal--be it a unified balanced budget or balance \n     excluding Social Security--signal that a prolonged period of \n     deficits far in excess of official projections is probable. \n     The question now being tested is whether the political will \n     exist to reverse this trend. The preliminary answer is a \n     decided: no.\n\n\n                 The Fiscal Responsibility Report Care\n\n       The Concord Coalition has graded Washington's performance \n     on fiscal policy in three key time frames: the short-term \n     (next 1-2 years), the medium-term (next 10 years), and the \n     long-term (beyond the next 10 years). Each category is graded \n     on a scale of A to F, with A signifying great improvement, \n     and F signifying great harm. There is a necessary overlap in \n     the consequences of policy decisions throughout the time \n     frames.\n\n                           Category and Grade\n\n       Overall: Progress toward fiscal responsibility: D.\n       Short-Term: Enacting measures that maintain fiscal \n     responsibility over the next 1-2 years: C-.\n       Medium-Term: Enacting measures that are fiscally \n     responsible over the next 10 years: D.\n       Long-Term: Enacting measures that deal with the entitlement \n     financing gap and ensure fiscal sustainability: D-.\n\n\n                          SHORT-TERM GRADE: C-\n\n       For reasons largely beyond the control of policymakers, the \n     short-term outlook has gone from projected surpluses in \n     excess of $300 billion to probable deficits in excess of $100 \n     billion. (See table on Page 4.) Fiscal policy decisions in \n     the current environment are more difficult than usual because \n     actions to stimulate the economy and beef-up security, while \n     legitimate in the short-term, create the risk of higher \n     deficits in the long-term.\n       Given the circumstances, the test of fiscal responsibility \n     is not whether the budget falls into deficit for a year or \n     two but whether actions that subtract from the bottom line \n     are carefully designed to meet legitimate immediate needs \n     while minimizing costs in later years.\n       Even using this lenient standard, policymakers rate a \n     polite C minus for the short-term. The ``economic stimulus'' \n     bill enacted in March came to the rescue of an economy that \n     was already recovering on its own. And even if a stimulus was \n     justified as insurance, there was no need to extend the \n     bill's costly accelerated depreciation provision for three \n     years--well beyond any immediate need. Moreover, the \n     assumption that the depreciation break will be allowed to \n     ``sunset'' in September of 2004--two months before Election \n     Day--is absurd. This provision will likely become a permanent \n     new tax break at a cost of around $200 billion over the next \n     decade.\n       As for spending, President Bush acknowledged in his Budget \n     Message that the government ``will have new bills to pay.'' \n     Paying these bills is not fiscally irresponsible. What is \n     fiscally irresponsible is refusing to make trade-offs or \n     using the current crisis atmosphere as a smoke screen for a \n     generalized spending spree. Particularly susceptible to \n     unscrutinized growth are the defense budget and the new \n     loosely defined category of homeland security. Unfortunately, \n     the President's budget proposed very few trade-offs and \n     Congress has shown no inclination to accept any of them.\n       The appropriations process is just getting started so it \n     cannot be said that the short-term situation has turned into \n     a fiscal rout. But the signs are not promising. Congress has \n     failed to adopt a budget resolution, failed to agree on FY \n     2002 supplemental spending, failed to extend expiring budget \n     enforcement mechanisms, and failed to deal with the statutory \n     debt limit in a timely or straightforward manner. Finally, \n     the specter of ``rosy scenario'' is back, with the \n     Administration (OMB) and the House using baseline projections \n     that are more optimistic than CBO numbers by $35 billion in \n     2003 and $180 billion over the next five years. If these \n     issues are not resolved quickly the result\n\n[[Page S5009]]\n\n     could be a huge year-end omnibus appropriations bill--in \n     other words, fiscal chaos.\n\n\n                          MEDIUM-TERM GRADE: D\n\n       More harmful than the return of budget deficits in the \n     short-term is the fact that President Bush and Congress have \n     done very little to prevent deficits from extending well into \n     the decade. The rapid disappearance of the projected $3.1 \n     trillion 10-year non-Social Security surplus should be a \n     yellow light of caution for policymakers advocating further \n     tax cuts and new entitlements. But their response has been to \n     step on the gas. The Concord Coalition gives Washington \n     policymakers a medium-term grade of D.\n       The new farm bill, if graded alone, would surely warrant an \n     F. The bill increases spending by $86 billion over 10 years \n     and reverses the attempt under the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act \n     to get away from Depression-era farm subsidies that distort \n     markets, burden taxpayers, and harm the environment. Instead, \n     subsidies are extended for major crops while new ones are \n     created. The farm bill is a textbook case of an entitlement \n     that survives because it is politically attractive, not \n     because it is good policy.\n       Much more expensive than the farm bill are various \n     proposals to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and \n     delay or cancel scheduled reductions in provider payments. \n     Last year, Congress set aside $314 billion in a reserve fund \n     for Medicare expansion. This year, despite a drop of nearly \n     $4 trillion in projected surpluses, the House budget \n     resolution and the Senate Budget Committee plan (not yet \n     considered on the floor) increase Medicare set asides to $350 \n     billion and $500 billion respectively.\n       Adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, without \n     comprehensive cost-saving reform, would not only pressure the \n     budget in the medium-term but would make the program's long-\n     term funding gap even wider. None of the respective plans \n     conditions new money on such reform. Moreover, other \n     entitlement expansions have been proposed. Overall, the \n     Senate Budget Committee plan allows for an increase in \n     entitlement spending of nearly $670 billion.\n       The series of escalating tax cuts enacted last year is also \n     poised to drain the budget over the medium-term by $1.6 \n     trillion. The phased-in nature of these tax cuts, and the \n     ``sunset'' provision that cancels them all in 2010, give \n     policymakers a valuable opportunity to reprioritize in view \n     of new circumstances by permanently extending some of the tax \n     cuts and delaying the effect of others until a non-Social \n     Security surplus is achieved again. Unfortunately, the \n     Administration and the House leadership have been pushing to \n     lock in the entire package of tax cuts at a cost of nearly \n     $400 billion over 10 years. They have also proposed new tax \n     cuts even as they call for higher spending on defense, \n     homeland security, and Medicare. It is a recipe for sustained \n     deficits.\n       Such imprudence is compounded by attempts to obscure the \n     full budgetary effects of fiscal decisions. This year saw the \n     return to five-year budget plans by the Administration and \n     the House. By itself, this development is not problematic. \n     However, last year's tax plan was based on highly uncertain \n     10-year projections, and its huge costs come at the end of \n     the 10 years. The shift now to a shorter budget window seems \n     designed mainly to disguise those costs.\n       Finally, the medium-term outlook is threatened by the \n     absence of any mechanism, procedural or rhetorical, for \n     defining and enforcing a fiscal policy goal. Both parties' \n     pronouncements about the inviolability of the Social Security \n     surplus are long forgotten. While the respective budget plans \n     of the Administration, House, and Senate Budget Committee all \n     contemplate the return of surpluses no later than 2005, none \n     of them would produce a non-Social Security surplus before \n     2012. Meanwhile, the discretionary spending caps and the \n     PAYGO rules of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act expire this year. \n     Without any markers for discipline, politicians have little \n     incentive to scale back budget busting promises. Instead, \n     they have shown a troubling comfort with using the Social \n     Security surplus to either offset tax cuts or expand other \n     government programs--new entitlements have even popped up in \n     the trade and defense authorization bills.\n\n\n                          LONG-TERM GRADE: D -\n\n       Rampant denial is the best way to describe Washington's \n     response to the long-term fiscal challenge. While much has \n     changed in the past year, two things remain depressingly \n     consistent--the unsustainable path of long-term fiscal policy \n     and the unwillingness of most political leaders to do \n     anything about it. Concord's grade for the long-term is a D \n     minus.\n       While President Bush campaigned on the need for Social \n     Security reform, he has not followed through with a specific \n     proposal. At his request, the commission he appointed last \n     year did not produce a recommendation but instead came back \n     with three illustrative models for adding personal accounts \n     to the system. Two of the plans contained explicit provisions \n     to improve the fiscal sustainability of the program, which \n     personal accounts alone do not. Even though these provisions \n     were designed to avoid any impact on current beneficiaries, \n     political leaders of both parties reacted with horror, and \n     the Administration has kept the commission's report firmly \n     planted on the shelf.\n       Social Security has been reactivated as the third rail of \n     American politics--touch it and die. Without any plan of \n     their own, many Democrats have restored to scare tactics by \n     accusing Republicans of having a ``secret plan to privatize \n     Social Security.'' For their part, many Republicans \n     implausibly insist that personal accounts can be added to the \n     current system without costing anyone anything.\n       Neither party is discussing the tough choices that are \n     needed to make the program sustainable over the long-term. \n     Instead, they are jockeying for short-term political \n     advantage by offering free lunch solutions that rely on such \n     diversions as an imaginary ``lockbox'' or meaningless benefit \n     guarantee certificates. Regardless of the long-term \n     challenge, the House even voted 418-0 for a small benefit \n     expansion.\n       The demographic and fiscal challenges go well beyond Social \n     Security. Medicare poses an even more difficult challenge. \n     Together, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are expected \n     to double as a share of the economy by 2030.\n       It will take a combination of fiscal discipline and cost \n     saving reform to put Social Security and Medicare on a \n     sustainable path for all generations. Washington policymakers \n     are not pursuing either strategy. They are pursuing The Do \n     Nothing Plan, which ultimately leads to crushing debt, \n     burdensome taxes or broken promises.\n\n\n                            OVERALL GRADE: D\n\n       Good policy and political expediency are often at odds, but \n     so far in 2002, politics is trouncing policy. Surpluses ``as \n     far as the eye can see'' have vanished, yet policymakers \n     remain intent on delivering more government spending--\n     including entitlement expansions--and more tax cuts. With the \n     midterm elections looming, no particular fiscal goal in \n     place, and no procedural mechanisms to rein in spending, \n     Congress is reverting to its old ``spend and borrow'' habit. \n     Worse, the debate on how to finance the unfunded retirement \n     costs of the coming demographic transformation has \n     dramatically degenerated from an already low level.\n       Congress and the Administration can still re-establish \n     fiscal discipline this year. But they cannot do so unless \n     they confront the hard choices. Deficits are back and it is \n     time to close the budget bazaar.\n\n             THE MYSTERY OF THE DISAPPEARING FY 2002 SURPLUS\n                        [In billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJanuary 2001 CBO Baseline Unified Surplus Projection...........      313\nChanges:\n  Tax act w/interest...........................................      -42\n  New Spending w/interest......................................      -49\n  Economic and Technical w/interest............................     -242\n                                                                --------\n      Total Change.............................................     -333\n                                                                ========\nJanuary 2002 CBO Baseline Unified Deficit Projection...........      -21\n  Re-estimate in CBO Baseline since January 2002...............      +26\n  Economic Stimulus Package (P.L. 107-147).....................      -51\n  Farm Bill Outlays: (P.L. 107-171)............................       -2\n  Supplemental Outlays: (H.R. 4775)\\1\\.........................       -8\n  Lower Than Expected Tax Receipts.............................      -75\n  Debt Service.................................................       -2\n                                                                --------\n      Total Change.............................................     -112\n                                                                ========\nTentative FY 2002 Unified Deficit..............................     -133\nTentative On-Budget Deficit....................................     -290\nTentative Off-Budget Surplus...................................      157\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The Senate Appropriations Committee version of the bill, S. 2551, is\n  slightly higher.\n \nNote: Numbers may not add due to rounding.\n\n\n                              FISCAL FACTS\n                          [Dollars in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCBO March Baseline: Fiscal Years 2003-2012:\n  Projected Unified Surplus..................................     $2,380\n    On-Budget Deficit........................................       -102\n    Off-Budget Surplus.......................................     $2,483\n  Percentage of Surplus in First Five Years..................        21%\n  Percentage of Surplus in Last Five Years...................        79%\n  Percentage of Surplus in Last Two Years....................        47%\nDiscretionary Spending:\n  Average Annual Growth Rate Assumed in CBO Baseline.........       2.6%\n  Average Annual Growth Rate 1998-2002.......................       7.6%\n  Decrease in Surplus if Spending Continues to Grow at 7.6%..    -$2,719\n  Decrease in Surplus if Spending Grows at the Rate of GDP       -$1,442\n   (5.3%)....................................................\nChange in Projected Surplus Over the Next 10 Years Since\n January 2001:\n  Causes of Reduction in Surplus (As a Percentage of\n   Decrease):\n    Tax Cuts.................................................        42%\n    Economic and Technical Changes...........................        40%\n    Increased Spending.......................................        18%\nNational Debt:\\2\\\n  Gross Debt.................................................     $6,019\n  Increase over the past year................................       $363\n  Debt Held by Public........................................     $3,433\n  Increase over the past year................................       $157\n  Intergovernmental Debt.....................................     $2,585\n  Increase over the past year................................       $206\n  Net Interest on National Debt in FY 2001...................       $206\n  Net Interest as a Percentage of the Budget in FY 2001......        11%\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Includes costs of increased debt service.\n\\2\\ As of May 31, 2002: Note: The gross debt figure of $6.019 trillion\n  exceeds the statutory debt limit of $5.950 trillion because a small\n  portion of the gross debt is not subject to the debt limit.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. This amendment by Senator Gregg and Senator Feingold is \nan effort to at least pose some kind of fiscal brakes, caps, that have \nworked fairly well in the past--not perfectly. But I also worry that \nwithout the enactment of this amendment, we may find ourselves \ncontinuing this hemorrhaging of spending, which is really quite almost \nunprecedented in the time that I have had in Congress.\n  In the name of the war on terrorism, we are now endangering the \nfinancial future of this Nation, and every spending issue seems to be \nsomehow related to the war on terrorism. And clearly it is not.\n\n[[Page S5010]]\n\n  I congratulate the sponsors of this amendment. I look forward to \nvoting for it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. I am \ndelighted to have his support on this important amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield 4 minutes of my time to the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, who is a cosponsor of the amendment \nas well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Gregg-\nFeingold amendment.\n  I realize that some of my colleagues will say that this is not the \nright time or place to consider budget process reforms. I strongly \ndisagree. In fact, I wonder if my colleagues realize how bad the budget \nsituation has become.\n  According to the most recent calculations from the Senate Budget \nCommittee, the budget outlook has swung dramatically in the past year. \nLast year, CBO predicted a $313 billion surplus for fiscal year 2002. \nNow, instead of a surplus, we face a tremendous deficit. We will borrow \nand spend the entire $163 billion Social Security surplus and on top of \nthat we are going to have to borrow an additional $137 billion from the \nprivate markets. To sum it up, we are going to borrow $300 billion in \nthe 2002 budget.\n  This is new debt, on top of the staggering $6 trillion debt we \nalready owe. The budget outlook for fiscal year 2003 is just as bad. \nThe way things look now, we will borrow and spend the entire $179 \nbillion Social Security surplus projected for next year. And on top of \nthat we will have to borrow at least another $100 billion to fund the \nGovernment next year.\n  Some people might think a surge in economic growth is going to bail \nus out of our budget problems. It won't. These skyrocketing deficit \nfigures are based on CBO's assumption that the economy will grow by 5.4 \npercent next year. If that does not happen, the 2003 budget deficit is \neven going to be worse. My point is: these deficits will not go away on \ntheir own. We must prioritize. We must make hard choices. \nUnfortunately, our record on making hard choices is not encouraging. \nJust look at the farm bill. It speaks volumes about the lack of fiscal \ndiscipline in this body. We need to put our foot down and recognize the \nobvious. In order to be fiscally responsible we have to live within our \nmeans and we must rein in spending.\n  That is why I am cosponsoring this amendment. The amendment won't \nsolve all our budget problems. As everyone in this Chamber knows, we \nregularly circumvent budget rules, and I have no doubt that we will \npush in some instances to do the same thing this time. Nonetheless, we \nneed to do something. This amendment marks an important first step to \nregain control. I am working with my friend from Wisconsin and other \nSenators on other legislation to improve the budget process. And we \nhope to introduce that legislation soon. But in the mean time, this \namendment would help keep the national debt in check. We cannot wait. \nWe have to act now. We have a moral obligation to our children and \ngrandchildren. Remember, at the end of the day, it is their future we \nare mortgaging away.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this very important \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, momentarily I am going to yield time to \nmy colleague on the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Domenici. Before I \ndo that, I want to respond quickly to something the Senator from \nArizona said.\n  I am in agreement with virtually everything the Senator from Arizona \nsaid. I am going to be offering the budget disciplines that are \nexpiring at the end of September after this amendment. I think it is \nabsolutely critical, as the Senator from Arizona indicated, that we \ncontinue those budget disciplines. It would be a profound mistake in \nthis country to let those lapse.\n  But I say to my colleagues, the amendment being offered by the \nSenator from New Hampshire, the Senator from Wisconsin, and others, I \nbelieve, has enormous loopholes in it, such that would actually make \nour circumstance worse rather than make them better.\n  Madam President, I hope my colleagues are listening. Under the \ncurrent pay-go law, if mandatory spending or tax cuts would increase \nthe deficit, it triggers a sequester at the end of the year. Under this \namendment, it would allow projected surpluses--hear me; projected \nsurpluses--to be used to pay for additional spending and more tax cuts, \nwithout triggering a sequester.\n  Are colleagues listening? They are talking about fiscal discipline, \nand they are backing an amendment that would impose fiscal discipline \nbased on projections? We tried that before. It did not work because \nwhat we got were gimmicks and rosy projections.\n  My colleagues are well intended. I am absolutely on their side with \nrespect to the fundamental question of fiscal discipline. But this \namendment, I believe, opens a major loophole because it is based on \nprojections rather than real results.\n  How much time does the Senator from New Mexico want?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is the Senator short on time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico, and \nthen I would be happy to engage the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I hope I do not use that much time.\n  In the end, after I am through analyzing it, I am not going to vote \nwith the proponents. I am going to vote against the waiver that is \nbefore us and return us to the position we were in before this \namendment, if it had passed.\n  First, I want to, nonetheless, congratulate Senator Gregg and Senator \nFeingold on their amendment. I think I understand why they have offered \nthis amendment on this supplemental bill.\n  The amendment was offered in the Senate Budget Committee back in \nMarch, and it failed by a tie vote. But it probably would not have \nmattered if it had been added to the Senate Budget Committee reported \nresolution because, of course, the Senate has not yet considered a \nbudget resolution, and it certainly has not considered that one.\n  This brings us to my second point. The failure to adopt in the Senate \na budget resolution, let alone a conference on a budget with the House, \nhas put the Congress in a unique position of not having a budget for \nthe first time in 27 years. The one time we did not achieve a \nconference agreement between the House and Senate, in 1998, we \nnevertheless did add a so-called deeming resolution in the Senate so \nthat the process could proceed based on a Senate-passed budget \nresolution in that year. We are now seeing the problems of not having \nany blueprint. Whether it is good or medium or not so good, we are not \ngoing to have any blueprint, and I fear as we proceed through the \nsummer and the fall that the problems will only increase, not decrease.\n  I don't think I am overstating it when I say the budget process in \nCongress is hanging by a thread. There are some here who might say \n``good riddance,'' but with no budget resolution, no spending limits, \nno way to set priorities, not even some indication that we are \ninterested in fiscal discipline, those who would do away with the \nbudget process will live to regret the direction in which we seem to be \nheaded and what it will yield.\n  That is why, absent a good and agreed-upon budget for next year, \nparticularly as it relates to the level of appropriations I have been \npressing for, at a minimum, a fiscal year 2003 spending cap, extension \nof expiring Budget Act enforcement provisions, including certain points \nof order, and other provisions that will maintain some discipline \nthroughout the year, that is the way of supporting a major portion of \nthe amendment you plan to offer if this one does not pass. That does \nnot mean I approve of all of them, but they are among the provisions I \nthink we must have if we are going to have any kind of enforcement.\n  I have been working with the chairman of the Budget Committee, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, and our \nleadership to develop an amendment that would provide for this needed \ndiscipline. At this time, it is unclear that\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\nwe will be able to offer this amendment or if it would have the 60 \nvotes needed to waive the Budget Act in order that it be raised because \nit, too, would require a hearing before the Budget Committee and a \nreport to escape the 60-vote requirement.\n  This brings me to the Gregg-Feingold amendment. Absent an \nalternative, I support their amendment in order to lay down a marker to \nestablish some discipline absent a budget resolution in place. But at \nthis time I cannot support a waiver of the Budget Act.\n  There are parts of their amendment with which I disagree. I am not \nsure we need 5-year spending caps if we are not going to have a budget \nresolution. I don't agree with the procedure that is being recommended \nin the amendment to remove provisions from an appropriations bill in a \nrifleshot manner. But, in general, except for the 5-year spending caps \nand the individual appropriations procedures, their proposal captures \nthe major provisions of extending the pay-go provisions and the Budget \nAct points of order that expire this year.\n  Again, I prefer to continue to work on an alternative 1-year cap \nproposal, and that is why I will not vote in favor of the Budget Act \nwaiver that is required for this amendment. But if an alternative is \nnot found, then the problems and the chaos I portend for this summer \nare certain to prevail in this Chamber. Maybe we still have a little \ntime to correct it before it ends up as what I have just predicted.\n  I thank those who have spent a lot of time trying to figure out what \nto do. It is difficult. In conclusion, the reason I will not vote for \nthis is that there is $36.8 billion more in spending than the \nPresident's total appropriations, $26 billion less in Defense \nappropriations, and $63 billion more in other mandatory spending.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senator for graciously yielding me 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee. I agree with every word he said. We have a budget process \nthat is hanging by a thread. That is exactly right. We desperately need \nto put in place the budget disciplines that can allow us to keep the \nspending from spinning out of control as we go into the budget process.\n  The amendment by the Senators from Wisconsin and New Hampshire, which \nis completely well intended, will not accomplish the result they seek. \nI believe that is the case because it is dependent upon OMB projections \nof surpluses. We tried that. It didn't work. Why didn't it work? \nBecause what occurred was a rosy scenario.\n  I put up the chart for 1990. They said the deficit was right on \ntarget. It was going to be reduced to $100 billion. It wasn't reduced \nto $100 billion. It was $221 billion. Let's not have a massive loophole \nlike that put back into the budget law of the Congress.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, the amendment before us, the Gregg-\nFeingold-Chafee-Kerry Budget Enforcement Act of 2002, is critical to \nrestoring a sense of fiscal responsibility to the congressional budget \nprocess. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The amendment reinstates and extends for 5 years the caps on \ndiscretionary spending, keyed to the levels in the Senate Budget \nCommittee-passed budget resolution. The caps are scheduled to expire at \nthe end of fiscal year 2002. The amendment also reinstates and extends \nfor 5 years the pay-as-you-go rules for tax cuts and entitlement \nchanges. The pay-as-you-go rule would apply to legislation which \nincreases the non-Social Security budget deficit. The rule would not \napply when the budget is running a surplus outside of Social Security. \nSixty-vote points of order and the threat of sequestration would \ncontinue to provide enforcement for both the discretionary caps and \npay-as-you-go violations.\n  To guard against budget evasions, the amendment would shut back-door \nways around the caps and pay-as-you-go enforcement by requiring 60 \nvotes to change the discretionary caps, alter the balances of the pay-\nas-you-go scorecard, or direct scorekeeping. All emergency designations \nwould require 60 votes.\n  I was one of the first cosponsors of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \ndeficit reduction legislation in the late 1980s. I understand the \nimportance of fiscal responsibility and budget discipline. The \ndiscretionary caps and PAYGO rules have helped impose a sense of fiscal \ndiscipline since they were first enacted in 1990. Budget enforcement \nmechanisms played a key role in stemming the tide of runaway deficit \nspending. As individuals such as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin have recognized, \nthe benefits of spending and fiscal restraint are enormous. The \nremarkable turn-around in the Federal budget during the 1990s \ncontributed to a virtuous cycle of lower inflation, lower interest \nrates, and higher economic growth.\n  Unfortunately, the budget enforcement mechanisms are scheduled to \nexpire this year. As the Concord Coalition has noted, it would be \nparticular ironic and careless to let the caps and PAYGO rules expire \njust when the budget is plunging back into deficit. Our bipartisan \namendment would prevent that from happening. It will also encourage a \ndiscussion of the tough choices that must be made, regardless of \nprocedural mechanisms, to restore fiscal responsibility.\n  As quickly as surpluses appeared, they have disappeared. We must not \nallow ourselves to return to the previous days of cutting taxes, \nincreasing spending, consuming the Social Security surplus, and running \nup debt. Beginning in 10 years when the Baby Boomers retire, Congress \nwill face huge unfunded retirement and health care costs. Congress and \nthe President lack a strategy for dealing with these liabilities or for \nreturning to budget balance. Our amendment represents a crucial step \nfor reversing a rapidly deteriorating budget outlook. Formal budgetary \nrestraints are needed to balance the competing claims on the Federal \nbudget.\n  Some opponents express concern that the amendment would place overly \nrestrictive limitations on appropriations. Others outright suggest that \nthe legislation will result in domestic appropriations cuts. In \nreality, the legislation fully funds the appropriations levels \nrequested in the Senate Budget Committee-passed budget resolution. The \namendment exceeds the spending levels requested by the President, allow \nfor more spending on education, health care and other priorities. For \nfiscal year 2003, the bill would allow $768 billion in discretionary \nspending. This is a figure commonly cited in current budget \nnegotiations, and considerably higher than the House budget level of \n$759 billion. If this should prove insufficient, Congress can either \nraise the caps or declare the spending as emergency spending to avoid \nenforcement consequences.\n  Finally, some opponents criticize the amendment's pay-as-you-go \nentitlements/tax rule because it allows spending or tax cuts when the \ngovernment is running a surplus outside of Social Security. This \nexception is important because it will facilitate the funding of \nnational priorities when the Federal Government is not facing major \nbudgetary deficits. In addition, it allows for a more flexible response \nto the budget situation. It recognizes that the will for strict pay-as-\nyou-go enforcement may not exist when government is running a \nsubstantial surplus.\n  Overall, the Gregg-Feingold-Chafee-Kerry Budget Enforcement Act of \n2002 is an important safeguard against run-away deficit spending. It \nwill provide an important super-majority obstacle against fiscally \nirresponsible tax cuts. It is flexible enough to allow spending on \ncritical national investments regardless of the budget situation, \nprovided there is sufficient support. Perhaps most importantly, it will \nforce a national dialogue on priorities and reestablish deficit \nreduction as a strategic goal. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I cannot support the Gregg amendment \nregarding caps on annual appropriations and modifying the so-called \n``pay-as-you-go'' provisions controlling entitlement spending and the \ncosts of tax cut legislation. The Gregg amendment, while well-\nintentioned, bases budget enforcement mechanisms on unreliable budget \nprojections by the Office of Management and Budget. If there were\n\n[[Page S5012]]\n\nan OMB projection upon which tax cuts were based, and then the \nprojections proved overly optimistic as is often the case, Medicare and \nother critically important program cuts would be automatically \ntriggered to pay for those tax cuts.\n  I will support an alternative budget enforcement mechanism amendment \nwhich will be offered by Senator Conrad, the Chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee which will extend rules controlling annual \nappropriations, entitlement spending, and the costs of tax cuts. The \nConrad amendment would extend procedures which proved successful since \ntheir adoption in 1990 in eliminating deficits.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise to offer support for the Gregg/\nFeingold amendment and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of that \namendment. Fundamentally, the amendment would make two changes. First, \nit would extend discretionary spending caps for five years, and second, \nit would make legislation that fails to pay for itself with appropriate \noffsets subject to points of order and mandatory enforcement \nmechanisms.\n  Although I appreciate the assurances that an alternative scheme for \nbudget enforcement will be offered if this amendment is defeated, I \nremain concerned that the vote on this amendment will provide the only \nopportunity to ensure real fiscal discipline after the current \nprotections expire later this year.\n  The spending levels provided for in this amendment are more than \ngenerous. In fact, I would prefer to see the caps keyed to the spending \nlevels in the President's budget, rather than to those set forth in the \nbudget resolution reported by the Senate Budget Committee in March. But \nthat is not the choice before us. The choice before us is whether there \nwill be any limits at all on spending and whether there will be any \nenforcement mechanisms to restrain spending.\n  If we head into this year's appropriations process without any such \ntools, we will set the stage for a monumental dereliction of duty. The \nsky will be the limit in terms of spending. Any notion of priorities in \nwartime will be cast aside. All of the rhetoric about ensuring that \nSocial Security Trust Fund surplus revenues be held sacrosanct will be \nrendered hollow. This amendment provides a means, however imperfect, of \nkeeping us focused on trade-offs and priorities. Accordingly, I urge \nthe waiver of the Budget Act and the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the present status of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire controls 4 \nminutes; the Senator from Wisconsin, 6 minutes; the Senator from North \nDakota, 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, let me respond quickly to the comments \nmade relative to the technical aspects of the amendment. First, I am \nimpressed that it has received such adulation but so little support. \nThe Senator from New Mexico, whom I immensely respect, said it is a \nwonderful idea except for a couple little points but he thinks it might \nbe a good marker. The Senator from North Dakota appears to be saying \nessentially the same thing with a little more intensity. I am glad we \nhave put something out here that appears to be pretty close to what we \nneed.\n  Why do we need it? We need it because without any budget disciplines \nin place, we will be in serious trouble as we move down the road, as \nwas highlighted by a number of speakers. We need to have something in \nplace that we can look to at least to give us some guidance, some \nsignposts.\n  On the issue of pay-go, obviously you don't need pay-go if you are in \nsurplus. It makes no sense to have pay-go if you are in surplus. In \nfact, we have shown that every time we have been in surplus, with the \nlast appropriations bill coming out across the floor, we have basically \nput a hold on or stopped the application of pay-go.\n  This bill makes it very clear. The language says:\n\n       There shall be no sequestration under this section for any \n     fiscal year in which a surplus exists.\n\n  It is very specific. There must be a surplus in order for pay-go to \nbe withdrawn. But if there is not a surplus, clearly pay-go exists, and \nit is available.\n  How do you find out if there is a surplus? You have to have \nscorekeeping, and that is the way we work around here. We have \nscorekeeping for lots of spending.\n  Rosy scenarios, I seriously doubt it. In fact, I suspect just the \nopposite is going to be the case for the next few years. That is a bit \nof a straw dog. Nobody is projecting any surpluses. I point to the \nchart of the Senator from North Dakota. He is not projecting any \nsurpluses out there. Nobody else is for the foreseeable future. It is \nimportant we have pay-go in place during this period of that red ink.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I would like to respond to some of the \narguments of the chairman of the Budget Committee as well.\n  The chairman argues that what Senator Gregg and I are proposing is \nnew and radical. In large part what we are doing is merely extending \nthe Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. Let me tell my colleagues what \nwould be radical: If we go through this process without any budget \nrules at all. Based on my 10 years here, that would be radical and \ndangerous and harmful to Social Security and to the future of our \nbudget. As far as I am concerned, we are on the precipice of going back \nto the bad old 1980s in terms of the budget process. This is a good-\nfaith, bipartisan effort to try to keep some rules in place.\n  The chairman speaks, fairly, of course, with great knowledge about \nthe new deficits and the new problems we face, especially in the last \ncouple of years, especially since 9-11.\n  Let me remind everyone that we used the chairman's numbers, not pre-\n9-11 numbers, but his post-9-11 numbers, with regard to his 5-year \nscenario. That is what this is based on. It is based on our knowledge \nabout the tragedy and difficulties that occurred.\n  I find it hard to understand when the chairman argues for flexibility \nthat somehow Senator Gregg and I don't recognize the need for \nflexibility. He, too, apparently, if we don't prevail, intends to offer \ncaps. He intends to offer limits. The fact is that the chairman \nacknowledges that even in difficult times such as these, there have to \nbe rules and there have to be limits.\n  There is nothing irresponsible about proposing limits even in \ndifficult times, such as a war against terrorism. In fact, I argue that \nthe worst that can happen, at a time when we are fighting terrorism and \nother crises in the world, is to have no rules at all. Then it is more \nlikely that legislation such as the farm bill will pass with unlimited \namounts of inappropriate action and provisions. Some of the provisions \nin the energy bill and some in this bill are more likely to happen with \nno rules at all.\n  For the sake of our national security, for the sake of the fiscal \nintegrity of our country, at this time it is more important than at any \nother time that we have some rules and procedures so the American \npublic can know we are wisely using their tax dollars to proceed with \nthis war against terrorism, and to protect them, and that we are not \nusing it for pork projects at home.\n  The chairman complains that our amendment would not have budget \nenforcement at times when we are running a surplus without counting \nSocial Security. Yet his idea guarantees us no discipline at all. I \nwish him well if we end up going with his amendment and considering \nthat, but, obviously, I hope ours prevails. There is no guarantee. \nDefeating this amendment would leave us with no enforcement at all if \nthese current rules expired in September, as they are expected to do. \nHe says we only have constraints on spending. We followed the same \nconstraints on taxes as they exist in current law. Taxes and \nentitlements are constrained in our amendment, as well as by the pay-\nas-you-go procedure.\n  He also seeks to argue that somehow we are doing something different \nor something radically inappropriate with regard to the OMB. The \namendment gives the OMB the job of calculating whether we have complied \nwith the caps or the pay-as-you-go discipline. But this is exactly as \nit has been since 1987. Nothing is new about this provision.\n  When Congress first enacted the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill in 1985, \nit\n\n[[Page S5013]]\n\ngave the job of calculating compliance to the Comptroller General, head \nof the General Accounting Office. But the Supreme Court ruled, in 1986 \nin the case of Bowsher v. Synar, that Congress could not \nconstitutionally give that power to anybody outside of the executive \nbranch of Government. That is why we do it. That is why Congress gave \nthe job of calculating compliance to the OMB in the rewriting of the \nbudget laws and continued that process in the 1990 Budget Enforcement \nAct. This argument doesn't hold water. Our amendment merely continues \nthe same rule for the OMB.\n  As to the chairman's argument that we erred by not requiring pay-as-\nyou-go enforcement in times of budget surplus, we disagree as a matter \nof policy. We believe that when the Government is taking in more tax \nrevenues than it needs to fund existing programs, even after putting \nall Social Security surpluses aside, then it is altogether appropriate \nfor Congress to consider fiscal choices, such as updating Medicare to \ninclude a prescription drug benefit. Do we want a 60-vote requirement \nin times of surplus to provide the American people with a prescription \ndrug benefit? I hope not. If you are listening to your constituents, \nthey desperately need this. So that doesn't seem to be appropriate.\n\n  Finally, I think this is a critical test on this vote. Are we serious \nabout protecting Social Security, even in these difficult times? Are we \ngoing to go forward with no rules and continue down the road we are \nheading in--the road of a $100 billion deficit already? Especially \nafter 9-11, the American people have a right to know that we are being \nespecially careful with their dollars, that we can track it, and that \nthey can follow the caps and the rules and enforcement procedures to \nsee if we are doing their bidding and if we are truly putting our \npriorities straight--with the war on terrorism at the top, but also \nguaranteeing the safety and security of Social Security, which is very \ndear to them.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, let me respond to the Senator from \nWisconsin. The alternative is not their proposal versus no rules. That \nis not the alternative. I will offer an amendment that will extend the \nsupermajority enforcement of budget points of order that extends the \nBudget Enforcement Act provisions--all of them--and that restores the \nSenate pay-go rules--in fact, toughens them. That is the alternative: \nserious budget discipline versus the proposal before us by Senators who \nare absolutely well intentioned. They have the diagnosis right, which \nis that we have deficit and debt problems, but their solution takes us \nback to a provision that did not work in the past and will not work in \nthe future.\n  Have we forgotten 1990? When you base budget discipline and \nenforcement on projections, you are basing your discipline on \nquicksand. What could be more evident? In 1990, the Office of \nManagement and Budget told us we were meeting our deficit projections, \nthat the deficit was only going to be $100 billion. It turned out to be \n$221 billion because the whole budget discipline process was based on \nprojections.\n  That is what this budget proposal does. It won't work. It didn't work \nthen; it won't work now. It is absolutely misleading and will take us \ndown a road not to budget deficits, through budget deficit elimination, \nnot to reduce debt, but to more gimmicks, more game playing, more rosy \nscenarios.\n  After this amendment I will offer an amendment that has real budget \ndiscipline.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, what is the status on the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 2 minutes. \nThe Senator from North Dakota has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator allow us to close since it is our \namendment? I will yield our last 2 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator has used his time, and I am going to use \nmine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Washington 1 minute 45 \nseconds.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Gregg-\nFeingold amendment. The premise underlying this amendment--and its \nextension of the budget enforcement procedures--is that we as a body \nmust be fiscally responsible.\n  We have real responsibilities and real priorities on which we have to \nmake decisions, but we also must have fiscal discipline. In order to \naccomplish this it is important for us to have a framework by which \nthis body can make these fiscal decisions.\n  This amendment helps us at a time when we have seen a surplus of $5.6 \ntrillion over ten years disappear and turn into a $2.7 trillion \ndeficit. And we know that the current deficit is a result of last \nyear's tax cut, the recession, and the tragic events of September 11, \n2001.\n  Having spent time in the private sector, I can tell you this: No \nprivate sector organization thinks it can spend its way out of \nproblems; nor can we as a country.\n  I believe one of the most important actions we can take for the \nnation's future economic stability, is to pay down the national debt. \nAccording to Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, \npaying down the national debt lowers interest rates and keeps the \ncapital markets and investment going. In January, he told the Senate \nBudget Committee that one of the reasons long-term rates have not come \ndown is the sharp decrease in the surplus and the diminishing prospects \nfor paying down the debt.\n  Our total budget must be crafted within the need to maintain fiscal \ndiscipline, and stimulate economic growth through continued federal \ninvestment in education and job training, while also protecting the \nenvironment. Furthermore, we need to invest in our nation's economic \nfuture by making a commitment to public research and development in \nscience and technology--maintaining our status as a global leader.\n  It is a balance. We need to make these investments, but within a \nframework that ensures we don't spend beyond our means. If we want our \neconomy to be strong, if we want revenues, and if we want to make the \nright decisions, we need to keep paying down the debt.\n  We must have fiscal discipline in budget and appropriations process. \nWe cannot focus solely on the individual items and programs in our \nbudget, but must look at the whole picture. The budget enforcement \nprocedures help us do this, and help us keep a reign on our spending. \nThese procedures worked successfully as we struggled to get out of \ndeficit spending in the 1990s, and they will work as we struggle to get \nout of the current recession and deficit financing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I hope people are listening and paying \nvery close attention. There is a lot at stake in the series of votes \nthat are going to occur. The Senators have made the case that we are \nback in an era of budget deficits. I say to them, I warned our \ncolleagues that is where we were headed. I did not do it this year. I \ndid it last year. And I begged our colleagues not to go down the road \nthat was taken. I warned them that we would be back to raiding Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and every other trust fund in sight, but they cast \nall caution aside and went down that road.\n  Today there is a fundamental question of whether or not we are going \nto have budget disciplines in place as we go through this year's \nappropriations process. I will offer an amendment that extends those \nbudget disciplines. Every colleague is going to have a chance to be \nrecorded as to whether or not they want budget discipline.\n  The amendment before us has very serious defects. It is not the \nbudget disciplines that worked in the nineties that helped us get back \non track. It is not those. It is a new scheme, and it is a scheme that \nhas an enormous loophole. The loophole is that discipline is based on \nprojections of what is going to happen.\n  Have we learned nothing? Last year, we were told there was going to \nbe $5.6 trillion available in surplus over the next decade. That was a \nprojection. Do you know what it is now? Nothing. Zero. The money is all \ngone. Let's not base budget discipline on projections.\n\n[[Page S5014]]\n\n  Does the Senator from New Mexico seek time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, I would like 2 or 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I thank the Senator. I failed to call \nhim chairman. He has been chairman for 6 more months. In any event, we \nwish the Senator well next year in whatever capacity.\n  I wish to discuss not so much the amendment because I have explained \nwhy I do not think we should waive the Budget Act. We have to do better \nin trying to put discipline into what is currently a totally \nundisciplined situation with reference to goals and priorities.\n  Appropriations will have no responsibilities on the various bills. \nThere will be no total dollar number that flows. This amendment will \nnot help that.\n  I close my few remarks talking about, once again, the mistake we are \nmaking--and we are making it for whatever reason--in not passing a \nbudget resolution. I am not filled with acrimony, but I do believe that \nin the over 27 years of serving, I felt a responsibility to get a \nbudget, and actually we could have gotten a corner after an extremely \ntough year 3 years ago and said: Let's not do it. The Senator from New \nHampshire could have been with me trying to keep discipline in this \nprocess. We could have said: Let's not do a budget resolution. It did \nsome good. Some people are saying it did not.\n  I would personally look at the area of entitlements and how many had \ncaps which precluded passage of more than we spent. It is the same on \nappropriations. Obviously, there is friction against those two \ninstitutions, but we did some good.\n  We happened to budget based upon an extremely powerful American \neconomy which was with us for 10 years, and we got clipped in the 11th \nand 12th year when the economy did not stay strong. That is all that \nhappened.\n\n  If we could have kept the budget resolution, it would have forced it \nor would have done something better, and we would probably be right \nback to moving close to a balanced budget in the next 5 years. I am not \nsure we are going to get there without something like a budget \nresolution, something to shoot with each year.\n  That is why I am saying we ought to do better than the Gregg \namendment. He is on the right track. Maybe we can include him and his \ncosponsor with a group of us trying to do a little bit better.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, would you alert us as to the time \nsituation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 50 seconds. \nThe Senator from New Hampshire has 15 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, in conclusion, I agree absolutely with \nwhat motivates the sponsors of this amendment. We need budget \ndisciplines. I will offer those as a package, all of the budget \ndisciplines--every one; in fact, a strengthened pay-go provision--after \nwe dispose of the amendment that is before us.\n  Madam President, I say to my colleagues, I believe the amendment \nbefore us has a giant loophole, unintended I am sure, but it is based \non projections, not real results. We have seen what happens with that \nkind of budget approach.\n  I go back again to 1990 when we had a similar scheme in place based \non projections from the Office of Management and Budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from North Dakota has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, does the Senator from New Hampshire \nstill have time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen seconds.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin and \nmy other cosponsors for offering this amendment. This amendment is \ngoing to be our best opportunity to put in place long-term, effective \nbudget enforcement mechanisms. There are no significant loopholes in \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I raise a point of order that the \npending amendment violates section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable section of \nthat act for the consideration of the pending Gregg-Feingold amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I wonder if Senators will permit me to \nspeak for 30 seconds on another matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I am sending an amendment to the desk. \nIf I can have the attention of Senator Conrad, I am sending a copy of \nthe amendment he is going to propose following the disposition of this \namendment, if we defeat it, so Senators can look at it and we can get \nrid of some delays. They can study it during the next 30 minutes or so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is the Senator filing the amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am sending it to the desk so anybody who wants to may \nlook at it. If the Senator has concerns, I will not do it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be constrained to object because I am told Senator \nByrd would object if he were here. But I am very hopeful we can \naccomplish that same purpose momentarily.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not want to argue, but I am not sending an \namendment to be operative. I can put in a letter. If I want somebody to \nlook at a proposed bill, why would anyone object?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No one will object to that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am sure they cannot if they wanted to. It is not \nintended as anything other than for Senators to look at. If they are \ninterested in how we might fix this situation, they might look at what \nis being recommended by the chairman.\n  I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nTorricelli) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 49, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 133 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--49\n\n     Allard\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Voinovich\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Carnahan\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n\n[[Page S5015]]\n\n\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Helms\n     Torricelli\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, this amendment is to provide the fiscal \ndiscipline that I think we all seek, at least the framework for it.\n  This amendment extends the supermajority enforcement of budget points \nof order. It extends the Senate's 60-vote Budget Act points of order \nfor 5 years. These points of order, including points of order that \nprotect Social Security----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield without losing the floor?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I would like to say--the Republican whip is on the floor \nand the Republican leader--when this amendment is completed, we will go \nback to the procedure we have always followed. If there appears to be \nno disagreement, we will have a Democratic amendment and Republican \namendment and go back and forth.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield, I appreciate that because \nthere is some angst on our side. People thought we were in line to do \nan amendment. I appreciate your accommodation with the recognition, and \nwe will have an amendment ready when we conclude this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. The last two amendments have been offered by both Democrats \nand Republicans, but this is offered by a Democrat, so we will go to a \nRepublican. The leaders have agreed on that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, when we debated the last amendment, the \npoint was made, and the point was made correctly, that the various \nbudget disciplines are going to expire on September 30 of this \nyear. That could allow budget discipline to go right out the window.\n\n  What I am offering today is a continuation of the budget disciplines \nthat have worked--the budget disciplines that allowed us to move from \ndeficit to surplus. It is critically important that those budget \ndisciplines be extended. I think there is strong support in this body \nfor that proposition.\n  As I have indicated, these points of order, including points of order \nthat protect Social Security, limit total spending and total tax cuts, \nenforce discretionary spending limits, and committee and subcommittee \nspending allocations are scheduled to expire on September 30.\n  The Senate has had Budget Act points of order that require 60 votes \nto waive since 1985. But unless action is taken starting October 1, it \nwill only take 51 votes to waive most Budget Act points of order. Only \n51 votes would be required to raid Social Security, or to exceed \ndiscretionary spending limits, or to increase total spending above \nagreed upon levels, or to cut taxes below agreed upon levels, or to \nexceed committee spending allocations.\n  Without the extension of these 60-vote points of order, it will \nbecome much more difficult to enforce budget discipline in the Senate. \nSenators who favor spending, or tax cuts, or exceed agreed upon budget \nlimits would not be deterred by the need to convince 60 of their \ncolleagues that the limits should not apply to their proposals.\n  In addition, the amendment I am offering extends Budget Enforcement \nAct provisions. The amendment extends for 5 years the Budget \nEnforcement Act procedures that limit discretionary spending and \nrequires increases in mandatory spending or tax cuts to be offset. The \ndiscretionary spending limits are scheduled to expire on September 30 \nof this year. The pay-as-you-go procedures that control mandatory \nspending and tax cuts will cease to apply to newly enacted legislation \nafter September 30, although pay-as-you-go sequestrations will continue \nto apply to legislation enacted before that date.\n  Under the amendment, the pay-as-you-go enforcement will expire \nearlier than scheduled if an actual non-Social Security surplus is \nreported before fiscal year 2007. Although it has not been evident for \nthe past several years, the discretionary cap and pay-as-you-go \nenforcement actions of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 have proved \nto be very effective tools for budget enforcement.\n\n[[Page S5016]]\n\n  Let us put up the chart that shows the long-term budget surplus \nstandards we face.\n  Here is the long-term relationship between spending and revenues. \nThis goes back to 1980. The red line is the spending of the Federal \nGovernment. The blue line is the revenue. We had this very significant \ngap between the two--spending exceeding revenue--back in the 1980s, and \nthat led to a quadrupling of the national debt.\n  In 1993, we passed historic legislation that cut spending and raised \nrevenue to eliminate this gap between spending and revenue--to \neliminate deficits and to begin to allow us to pay down debt. We did \nthat. The lines cross. Spending went below the revenue line. And in \n1997 we passed additional legislation that led to budget surpluses. The \nrevenue line was above the spending level.\n  That has all changed. Now we are back to deficits. After making all \nthat progress, after moving out of deficits into surplus, after the \nfiscal mistakes of last year, the President proposed a massive tax cut \nwith a major defense buildup and said we could have it all, said we \ncould have all of the spending and all of the tax cuts, and that we \nwould still have surpluses. He was wrong by a country mile. Instead of \nsurpluses as far as the eye can see, we have deficits as far as the eye \ncan see. The question is, Are we going to reinstitute the budget \ndiscipline to provide the framework for the appropriations process?\n\n  From the time the budget disciplines were enacted through 1998, they \nhelped to control spending, limit tax cuts, and played an important \nrole in the dramatic turnaround in our budget circumstance.\n  That is what this chart shows. We lifted this country out of deficits \nand put it in surplus. Then, unwisely, last year, a whole new fiscal \npolicy was put in place. That policy has plunged us back into deficits \nas far as the eye can see. We are going to be facing red ink throughout \nthe entire next decade.\n  Without these tools which expire on September 30, it is unlikely the \nbudget would have gone from a record total deficit of $290 billion in \n1992 to a surplus in 1998. After 1998, these enforcement tools fell \nvictim to the unrealistic, low discretionary caps that were set in the \n1997 Balanced Budget Act.\n  It is the reason I opposed the last amendment. It was going to repeat \nthe mistakes of the past, put in unrealistic numbers in light of the \nattack on this country, and base budget enforcement on projections \nrather than real results.\n  These budget enforcement provisions are based on actual results, not \nprojections, and don't leave us vulnerable to the office of Management \nand Budget going back to the rosy scenario days in which they told us \nthere were surpluses even when that was highly unlikely.\n  We are back in deficit now and for the foreseeable future. We should \nextend and enforce the Budget Enforcement Act procedures, not let them \nexpire and either give up on fiscal discipline or pretend there are \nsome other procedures that might work better than these proven \nprocedures.\n  In addition, my amendment extends the Senate pay-as-you-go rule. The \namendment extends through 2007 the Senate pay-as-you-go point of order \nthat prohibits surpluses from being used to pay for new mandatory \nspending or tax cuts.\n  Let me repeat that because I think it is critically important.\n  The pay-go provision will protect us from using Social Security money \nfor other tax cuts or other spending. We must have this discipline put \nin place or else we risk losing control of the entire spending process.\n  I hope my colleagues will think very carefully about the circumstance \nwe face. We have put in here the framework for budget caps. We have not \nput in the number for this year. We have negotiations going on right \nnow to determine whether or not we can agree now on a number for this \nyear. As you know, we are very close. After weeks of discussion, we \nwere very close yesterday to agreeing on a number. Perhaps this can \ngive us an opportunity to achieve an agreement. Even if we don't today \nreach agreement on what the budget numbers should be for this year, it \nis critically important that we put in place the budget enforcement \nframework. We cannot let that lapse. Even if we don't agree on a cap \nnumber for spending today, we can agree on the budget enforcement \nframework. We can then settle on a number if not today, sometime in the \nnear future so that these disciplines have something to apply to.\n\n  It is critically important that this budget enforcement mechanism not \nbe allowed to lapse. That would be a serious mistake given the fiscal \ncondition of the country. Literally, for weeks we have engaged in good-\nfaith negotiations with people on the other side of the aisle.\n  I thank Senator Domenici, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, \nand his staff. They have played a very constructive role in these \ndiscussions. That can be said of the chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee as well. Senator Byrd, the chairman, and \nSenator Stevens, the ranking member, have worked for many days to try \nto agree to a set of provisions that would allow us to provide a budget \nframework and to also provide for a continuation of these budget \ndisciplines.\n  Unfortunately, those talks hit a bump in the road yesterday. We have \na chance now to get back on track. We have an opportunity now to extend \nthese budget discipline provisions. We have an opportunity now to agree \non a budget limit, an appropriations limit for this year.\n  I do not know if we can agree on that in the next few hours, but \nperhaps we can. It would allow us, then, to go into the appropriations \nprocess with not only the budget disciplines intact but with an \nagreement on what total appropriations will be for this year. That \nwould be a very positive development. We would then have a budget for \nthe year, and we would have the budget disciplines so that we could, \nwith greater confidence, ensure we stay within the limits agreed to.\n  At the very least, we ought to put in place those budget disciplines. \nWe ought to put in place that framework. We ought to be ready for when \nthe negotiations achieve a result and we are able to agree on a number. \nWe can do that today, at a minimum. It would be even better if we could \nagree to an amount as well. But at the very least, let's send a signal \nthat we are not going to have chaos in the budget process.\n  Senator Domenici, the distinguished ranking member, has served on the \nBudget Committee for a long time. He has been chairman and ranking \nmember. He warned us: Look, we are in uncharted waters; this is \ndangerous ground; we should have a budget in place.\n  This is an opportunity to have a budget framework so that disciplines \nthat are set to expire on September 30 continue. This is also an \nopportunity to agree on a budget amount.\n  I very much hope that people who are discussing this issue at this \nmoment think very carefully about what is at stake. I hope they will \nthink very carefully about what we need to consider.\n  If we allow these budget disciplines to lapse, and we go into the \nappropriations process without an agreed-upon budget amount, it does \nnot take much imagination to think of what could occur. We could have \nspending spin out of control. I do not think anybody wants that to \nhappen. Think of the implications. Think of the signal that would send \nto the financial markets of this country. Think of what that could mean \nto the economy of this country.\n  We have already seen that the equity markets are extremely \nvulnerable. We have already seen the stock market go down 200 points in \na day. If the markets got the sense that we were not going to take \nserious action on the budget deficits that now confront the country, \nthat could further destabilize equity markets and put us in an even \nmore vulnerable position.\n\n  (Mr. CARPER assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  I don't often like to expose my ignorance of certain issues on the \nfloor of the Senate, but I preface my question with the assumption that \nI am not an expert on the budget, as is the Senator from North Dakota. \nI don't know the nuances and the ins and outs of the budget process, \nnor have I ever quite understood the different categories and what \nfalls in and what falls out of it.\n  Would the Senator explain to me, according to the amendment proposed \nby\n\n[[Page S5017]]\n\nthe Senator from North Dakota, as I read it, there is no budget number \nassociated with the Senator's amendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is absolutely correct. We are awaiting \nadditional discussions that are going on right now, that the Senator \nmay be aware of, to see if we could reach agreement on that critical \ncomponent. Obviously, that would be a very important part of this \npackage.\n  I say to the Senator, there are really two parts to this. One is the \nbudget number for this year. The other is the budget enforcement \nmechanisms. Both of them are necessary. Neither is sufficient. They are \nboth necessary.\n  Even though we do not have yet an agreed-upon number, the reason I am \noffering this amendment is that at least we would then have the \nframework and discipline when a number is agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for a further question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do not quite understand. Since there is no number, then \nenforcement would basically be meaningless because you do not have a \nnumber to enforce.\n  Why wouldn't we wait until we had an agreed-upon number and then \npresent the amendment as such? Because it seems to me, if you pass \nthis, it may do more damage than good, because then the conferees, who \nare appropriators, well known for their sense of fiscal discipline, \nwould be the ones who would decide what the cap is.\n  My question to the Senator from North Dakota is, without an agreement \non what the cap would be, we are now putting in rules that are \nbasically unenforceable because there is nothing to enforce. Why \nwouldn't we wait and see if there was some agreement on the overall \nbudget number instead of proposing that at this time? That is my \nquestion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator asks a very good question. There are really \ntwo pieces to this puzzle. We need a number for this year. We also need \nthe budget disciplines reinstated because they expire on September 30. \nThis may be one of our best opportunities, I say to the Senator, to \nreinstate those budget disciplines.\n  We may also have an opportunity to have the number agreed to today. \nThat would be a full package. That would be a very desirable outcome, I \nsay to the Senator. But at the very least, I think we want to get the \nbudget disciplines put in place.\n  Let's say we do not agree. Let's say we are not able to reach \nagreement on a number for this year. Does that mean we have lost all \nopportunity? No. Because, I say to the Senator, then certain of the \nnumbers that were in last year's budget resolution serve as a basis for \nthe disciplines that we would now be extending. In other words, even if \nwe did not reach agreement, at least we would have the structure of \nbudget disciplines that could agree to certain spending levels that \ncome from the budget resolution of last year.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator for his courtesy in allowing me to \nquestion him and for his responses. I am still not quite clear why we \nwould pass an amendment without something to enforce. But I certainly \nappreciate the courtesy of the Senator from North Dakota, and again I \napplaud his knowledge of the intricacies of a very complicated process \nwhich I have been unable to master in the years I have been in \nCongress. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me say to the Senator, for example, even if we were \nnot able to agree on a discretionary spending amount for this year, if \nwe have these budget disciplines in place, they would apply to the \nmandatory numbers from last year's budget. As the Senator knows, we \nhave two pots of money. We have mandatory spending, and we have \ndiscretionary spending.\n  In the best of all worlds, what many of us would like to achieve is a \ndiscretionary limit agreed to for this year--in effect, a budget for \nthis year. But we also have mandatory spending, and, in fact, mandatory \nspending is a bigger part of Federal spending than is discretionary. \nEven if we are not able to agree on a discretionary limit, if we have \nthis budget discipline framework in place, we would have a way of \ndisciplining mandatory spending.\n  In the best of all worlds, we get a discretionary spending limit, and \nwe have these budget disciplines that apply on both sides of the \nequation, mandatory spending and discretionary spending. But at the \nvery least, if we passed these budget disciplines, if we extend them, \nwe have some way of disciplining mandatory spending. That is the \nbiggest part of Federal spending.\n  It would also be very useful and important and certainly my goal to \nhave a discretionary spending limit as well.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder, does the Senator still control the time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I still control the floor. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would ask for about 3 or 4 minutes, and I will yield \nback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wanted to have a few moments with the \nchairman and Senator Gramm and others who are interested, building off \nyour current amendment, which is pending--and I thank you for the \naccommodations that you have made to it--one which is very important to \nour side, very important to everyone, as we have come to know it, with \nthe understanding that you know these enforcement provisions are not, \nfor the most part, found in the Budget Act. These enforcement \nprovisions were designed principally by a huge conference that was \npresided over by former White House OMB Director Darman--remember him--\nand Senator Robert Byrd--you know him--and a few other people. We were \nabout 2 weeks out there at Andrews Air Force Base when we tried to \nnegotiate a budget.\n  It fell apart in terms of numbers, most interestingly. Some people \ndidn't get treated well politically, and others did. Those who know \nhave said the most important thing we did in 1990 or 1991 were the \nenforcement provisions. We were doing something rather significant. It \nturned out the tax part didn't work out as well for the President as it \nshould have, but these enforcement provisions survived.\n  The principal author of those was Senator Robert Byrd, because we \nwere giving, in a sense, many things he wanted, and in exchange he was \ntrying to make sure that if they didn't do their job, something could \nhappen to them, including his committee.\n  Today the distinguished Senator, on an appropriations bill, is trying \nto see if we can save some of those. I want to say, I have looked at \nthem. I think the language I have used for the last 2 or 3 minutes \nmeans that I like them. In particular, they have been changed a little \nbit. I like them. I think we would have changed them a little bit, \nwhether we were down here or not, from 1990 because a couple of the \nprovisions don't work too well.\n  I regret that I can't seem to get a consensus on what else ought to \nbelong in this. I think it is good, but it is half a measure because we \nought to have some numbers in it. We ought to have some numbers for \ndefense and some numbers for the rest of Government. Clearly, without \nany question, we don't need 5-year numbers at this point in the \nprocess.\n  The process is questionable mostly because of the number assumptions, \nnot these enforcement provisions, speaking in the past.\n  But adults are going to sit down and arrive at this total; if not \nhere, in a vote. If not tomorrow morning in a vote, they will go to a \nmeeting someplace, and they are going to vote on how much we are going \nto allow for expenditures. We could go back to the day I arrived in the \nSenate, with Senator Nunn, Senator Helms, and others. We never knew \nwhat we spent until all the bills were added up. Nobody bothered to \ngive you any interim reports on six committees that reported and six \nbills. We were new. We said: How can you run a government where nobody \nknows until you are finished and by then you have already spent it all?\n  About 6 months later, the Budget Act was born on a premise that \nSenators Johnson and Domenici, heads of the freshman class, sent out a \nletter saying: Next year we will vote against all the measures \ntogether, 13 of us, if we don't have some process that tells us the \npieces before we start. That was the beginning. So it has some pretty \ngood history.\n\n[[Page S5018]]\n\n  I have been there and enforced it a lot of times. You know about 35 \npercent of the votes of the Senate are points of order, and most of \nthose points of order are 60-vote points of order, which is the only \neffective means this Congress has found to make it difficult to spend \nmoney. That is the only one. Because when it is controversial and you \nare seeking something with a lot of money, it is not easy to get 60 \nvotes. So you ought to have that around here next year, too, and the \nyear after; right?\n\n  The question is, how are you going to have it if you don't adopt it? \nThen to what are you going to make it applicable? I would have hoped \nthat we could have gotten together beyond what is proposed and that we \nwould go ahead and put the numbers in and get it done and then take a \nlook, with our leadership, at where we go next. We still have a lot of \namendments, but at least we could conceivably be through with this \npart.\n  I am trying as best I can in my few comments to put a little life \ninto this debate; otherwise, who wants to talk about budgets. I do \nbecause when you live them, it is interesting to talk about them. How \ndid you get this thing done?\n  Even the issue raised here, if we don't get one, we will deem one. I \nkept wondering, if that is the case, why in the world didn't we deem \nthem when they were all so darned difficult? It is because when you \nfinally go to look and see, what is that, it ain't so. We deemed a \nbudget resolution that the Senate had adopted. That is what we deemed \ndone.\n  Incidentally, we deemed a budget resolution that had been done by the \nSenate but wasn't getting adopted, and so we said, rather than let this \nwhole year go with nothing, we will have a deeming resolution. And what \ndo we deem up against? A budget resolution. So even when we were in \nfoxholes shooting at each other because we couldn't agree on anything, \nclearly we chose to get something that said the Budget Act is being \nenforced.\n  As to the numbers I am giving you and others who want to be part of \nthis, if they do, I am more than willing to come back and talk about \nthem and see if we can put them together. Our leader will have them \nvery shortly, and we will see where we go.\n  I thank you very much for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me, first, thank the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, the ranking member of the Budget Committee. I \nthink he has done something very constructive because it kind of leads \nus to the point of all the decisions that need to be made. The Senator \nfrom New Mexico is saying, yes, we need the budget enforcement \nmechanism and framework. We also need a budget. We need a budget. The \nSenator from New Mexico has come forward with numbers that are very \nclose numbers that I could agree to, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I had them there because they are close to what the \nSenator has agreed to before.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is exactly right. The Senator basically has the \nPresident's number, which the President proposed for outlays--not the \nPresident's policy, I am quick to acknowledge. Really, the significant \ndifference--there is not a difference on the budget authority number. \nIt is the President's number. We have said all along that we could \nagree to the President's number for spending this year. We would not \nagree to this so-called accruals policy that would say that retirement \nfunding of Federal employees is somehow discretionary rather than \nmandatory spending. It doesn't seem to us that that is realistic. When \nyou have Federal employees, you have costs for their retirement. That \nhas always been mandatory spending because, obviously, it is required. \nIt is not discretionary. But the overall President's number is one to \nwhich I would agree. It is in the budget resolution that passed the \nSenate Budget Committee.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has provided a number for outlays that is \nvery close to a number to which I could agree. He has also provided a \ndefense firewall. Well, I think the realistic outcome in the Senate is \nthat if we had a vote, there would be a commitment to spend that amount \nof money for defense. I think that would probably be the overwhelming \nvote.\n  I say to my colleagues, the Senator from New Mexico has come forward \nwith the other part of the package. We have the budget discipline \nframework and he has now provided the numbers, provided a budget for \nthis year that is very close to the numbers we have discussed for days.\n  I hope my colleagues will think about the need to get a budget and \nbudget discipline in place for this year. We can do it now.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3765 to Amendment No. 3764\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. SANTORUM] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3765 to amendment No. 3764.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To adopt the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n   year 2003 reported by the Committee on the Budget for the Senate)\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       Sec.   . The provisions of S. Con. Res. 100 (107th \n     Congress) as reported by the Committee on the Budget and \n     placed on the calendar is adopted by the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives as the concurrent resolution on the budget \n     for fiscal year 2003 in accordance with section 301 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, what I have sent up is the Democrat \nbudget that was passed out of the Senate Budget Committee.\n  We heard the chairman lecture the Senate that we need to have budget \ndiscipline and we need a budget. Yet for the first time in the history \nof the Senate, since the Budget Enforcement Act was put in place in \n1974, we have no budget. We have not even been offered a budget.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee, whose responsibility it is to \nbring a budget to the floor, has not brought a budget to the floor. \nThis is the same chairman of the Budget Committee who, back in 1998, \nafter we passed a budget but it had not gotten a conference report, \nsaid:\n\n       The budget resolution was due by April 15--\n\n  He said this in October.\n\n       The President plays no role in the budget resolution. That \n     is the responsibility of this Senate and of the House of \n     Representatives. These bodies have failed in their \n     responsibilities.\n\n  He made that comment after we passed a budget here, but we were not \nable to agree between the House and Senate. In this case, the Senate \nhas not even brought up the issue. We are in a situation where we are \nnow, after a few years of surplus, heading into a deficit and we have \nno budget discipline in place. We have not even had a debate on the \nfloor of the Senate as to the future of the budget of the United States \nof America.\n  Every single family in America has to budget. It is our \nresponsibility--in fact, it is an obligation under the law that we pass \na budget. But the chairman and the majority party in the Senate have \nrefused to consider the budget, refused to bring this resolution to the \nfloor.\n  We have seen all these amendments back and forth about why we are \ngoing to create psuedobudgets and deeming resolutions and sort of \npsuedobudget enforcement, skimming around the issues of the budget, \nwithout being serious with the public as to what the budget really is. \nThat is disingenuous on the part of the Senate. We should have a full \nand fair debate on a budget and see whether we can get a compromise.\n  Last year we had a divided Senate. We did something historic, and I \ngive credit to the chairman and ranking member for putting together a \nbipartisan budget for the first time in a long\n\n[[Page S5019]]\n\ntime that actually passed the Senate. It was tough. I am sure if you \nask the Senator from New Mexico, he would say it was one of the hardest \nthings he ever did. He had a 50-50 Senate. It was not easy to craft a \nbudget that could get votes on both sides of the aisle. It is hard when \nit is divided. It was a difficult task, but it was one that the \nRepublican majority and Senator Domenici took on because we knew it was \nimportant for the future of the country to have fiscal discipline, to \nhave a budget in place, so enforcement mechanisms could be put into \nplace, so we could put some sort of caps on discretionary spending and \nhave enforcement mechanisms for taxes and mandatory programs. It is an \nimportant framework to governing this country. It is not even a \ndiscussion that we have had.\n  We are almost 2 months past the time we were supposed to have this \nbudget, and this is the first day I can remember we even have had this \ndiscussion, much less had the bill before us. So I thought it was \nimportant, since we are having this sort of kabuki dance here about \nbudgets, that we actually put a budget on the floor. So that is what is \non the floor now. We have on the floor the budget passed out of the \nSenate Budget Committee. If we adopt it, if the majority can get the \nvotes to adopt their budget, then we can have a budget resolution on \nthe floor and we can go through the process of amending the budget \nresolution, coming up with what is important for this country, which is \nsetting forth the framework of operating the Government of the United \nStates. It is our responsibility.\n\n  The President has sent a budget. He sent up a budget that was very \nspecific. The House has passed a budget. It was hard to do with the \nvery narrow majority over there, but they were able to pass a budget. \nThe fact that we had not even brought a budget up, almost 2 months \nafter the date which it was due to be here, is something we should not \nbe proud of. We set a precedent that is not a good one. It is a \nprecedent that says we are going to leave things to chance in the \nSenate at a time when the appetite for spending is always very high.\n  What does this budget do? Well, it does several things. The President \nlaid out in his budget three priorities: national security, increasing \ndefense spending so we can address not only the threats that we have \nhad for many years, which are sort of the conventional threats that we \nhave had to deal with--we were potentially going to be involved in some \nsort of conflict with a large deployment of our troops, which is what \nour military has been geared to fight. We have a lot of equipment and \ntrained men and women who are there to do that. But as you know from \nrecent events--and even before recent events--the military was going \nthrough a transformation process--now accelerated because of these \nasymmetric threats to America. Not only do we have to maintain the \nexisting force, but we have to deal with another security threat on \nAmericans here and in the world at large. So in this environment, in a \nwar against terrorism, faced with different threats, we need to \ndramatically increase defense spending. It is not really that dramatic; \nit is less than 10 percent in spending. They fund the President's \npriorities, as far as defense, for the next 2 years. After that, it \ndoes not. In fact, it reduces defense spending back basically to the \nrate of inflation, or below, but it dramatically increases and \ncontinues to allow the increase in domestic spending.\n  At the same time, it takes even more money that was due for tax \nreductions by making the President's tax cuts permanent and puts that \nmoney back and, of course, spends that money, too--not on defense \nspending but on domestic spending--in a time of war, a time of \nreshaping our military to protect this country. It reshapes the budget \ninto more porkbarrel projects for Members of Congress. That is what \nthis budget does. It takes money out of your pockets and puts it--\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator makes an assertion about the Senate Budget \nCommittee that is flatly untrue.\n  The budget I offered that passed the Senate Budget Committee fully \nfunded defense for 2003 and 2004. After that, it increased defense by \nthe rate of inflation and set all of the additional defense spending \naside that the President has requested in a defense reserve account. \nEvery penny of that money that is not needed for defense goes to debt \nreduction. The Senator has said it goes to porkbarrel projects. That is \nabsolutely false. Every penny of that money--every penny--either goes \nfor defense or it goes for debt reduction.\n  When the Senator makes statements, I hope the Senator will at least \nbe constrained by the facts.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reclaiming my time, I suggest that given the way this \nbody operates and the Congress has operated over the past several years \nsince I have been in Congress, we have not seen very many reserve \naccounts set aside for debt reduction that are not raided continually \nfor spending in Washington, DC.\n  The Senator can say that money is set aside, and that is a nice \nlittle accounting mechanism, but the fact is we will spend that money \nand then some increases--whether it is supplemental appropriations \nwithout caps, since we do not have caps now, we would be flying through \nthat money and we would be blowing through caps as we have in the past.\n  Second, I did say the tax dollars would not be given to the American \npublic. They would be back in the budget and, yes, they would be used \nto increase spending in Washington, DC.\n  The fact is, it does not fund the President's priorities or the \nNation's priorities with respect to national security, No. 1.\n  No. 2, it does take money that was targeted hopefully for the pockets \nof the American taxpayers and brings it back to Washington to be spent.\n  No. 3, and I quote the Washington Post headline, ``Senate Democrats \nTap Social Security in Budget Plan.'' I hear over and over how these \nhorrible Republicans want to raid Social Security and raid the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  The budget we have before us, in the words of those who use this \nlingo, ``raids the Social Security trust fund.'' It is horrible to \nsuggest that, but it does. It does not fund the Nation's priorities \nwith national security. It does increase spending in Washington, DC, \nfor more and more domestic spending programs. It does raise taxes vis-\na-vis the President's budget, and it does raid the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n  Given what this budget does, I can understand why it might be \ndifficult or why many Members, the leader, and the chairman of the \nBudget Committee did not want to bring this bill to the floor because \nsuch a budget would be very difficult to pass because it does not \nplease very many Members on either side of the aisle.\n  There was no attempt in the process to try to form a bipartisan \nbudget. Every effort by Senator Domenici and the budget Republicans was \nthwarted by the majority. So there was no attempt to build a bipartisan \nbudget. Faced with very difficult fiscal realities, including raiding \nthe Social Security trust fund, which this budget does, it is very \ndifficult to get votes on a bipartisan basis when we have a very \nclosely divided Senate.\n  I am not saying this would not be a very difficult political task--it \nwould be--but it is one the Senate is required to do. This is a debate \nthat we should have. This is a debate that has been denied to the \nSenate, has been denied to the American public, and, as a result we are \ngoing into waters very much uncharted, uncertain waters when it \ncomes to setting spending priorities over the next few months through \nthe appropriations process and whatever other bills that may be coming \nthrough that require expenditure of funds.\n\n  I understand there are attempts being made to create mechanisms to do \nother things that are sort of quasibudget in nature. That is all well \nand good. But the fact is, the chairman of the Budget Committee and the \nmajority leader had a responsibility and obligation under the act to \nbring a bill before the Senate and debate a budget, and they have \nabdicated their responsibility. They have abdicated their \nresponsibility to the Senate and to the American public.\n  I am going to give them an opportunity. We have waited 2 months. Many \non our side were suggesting: Why don't we offer this on April 15? \nBecause many of us thought: Let's see if we can work out something; \nlet's see if we can, in fact, get some bipartisan resolution; maybe the \nchairman of the Budget Committee will bring forth a budget\n\n[[Page S5020]]\n\nresolution. Senator Daschle continually in his dugout said: We will get \nto that budget resolution; we will get to it; we will get to it.\n  I was willing to hold off longer. Now there are all these phony \nbudget talks going on in this Chamber where we are going to do all \nthese machinations to look like we are doing a budget. I thought: I am \nwilling to put off while people have good-faith negotiations to get \nsomething done. But when we come out to the Chamber in the context of a \nsupplemental and start playing games like we are doing a budget, let's \ncall a spade a spade. Let's do a budget. You have not done a budget. \nLet's do a budget. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania must have \nmissed what has been going on. He has not been party to any of these \ndiscussions, any of these talks, but people on his side of the aisle \nhave been, including the ranking member of the Budget Committee and the \nRepublican leader. We have even involved the White House in an attempt \nto get a budget for this year.\n  The fact is, the Senate passed a budget resolution through the Budget \nCommittee, a budget that is a 10-year budget as required under the law. \nThe President presented a 10-year budget, and we will give our \ncolleagues a chance to vote on that budget as well, just as we did in \nthe Budget Committee.\n  Interestingly enough, some Republicans did not support that budget. \nWe will see if they want to support that budget on the floor.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania talks about raiding Social Security. \nThe President's budget really raids Social Security. We will give the \nSenator from Pennsylvania the opportunity to vote on that budget and \nsee if he wants to raid it by $500 billion more. That is what the \nPresident's budget does.\n  How are we in this deficit situation? Is it because we have not \nconsidered a budget resolution on the floor of the Senate? The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania knows the answer to that question. We are in deficit \nfor as far as the eye can see before a budget has been considered for \nfiscal year 2003, and I remind the Senator that the new fiscal year \ndoes not start until October 1. We have time to get a budget in place \nfor this year.\n  The Senator perhaps has forgotten that the Senate has been involved \nin the election reform bill, the energy bill, the trade bill--all of \nthese the administration requested us to take up. Now we are on the \nsupplemental bill which the President also asked us to take up and \ndispose of. So the budget kept getting pushed back.\n  On the fundamental question of how we got in this circumstance where \nwe see deficits as far as the eye can see, the facts are very clear. \nThe Senator from Pennsylvania and his colleagues bear substantial \nresponsibility. They are the ones who put a budget in place last year \nthat plunged us back into deficits. We opposed it.\n  It was the Senator from Pennsylvania and his colleagues who said we \ncan have it all, who said we can have a massive tax cut, we can have a \nmajor defense buildup, that we can have maximum paydown of the Federal \ndebt. That is what they told us last year. And now they are here, after \nsaying they were going to have maximum paydown of the Federal debt, \nasking for the second biggest increase in the debt in the history of \nthe country.\n  This is their fiscal policy that is in place. It is their fiscal \npolicy that has put us back into deficit. It is their fiscal policy \nthat has put this country back into accumulating debt at a record rate.\n  No budget has yet been acted upon for the year 2003. It is their \nbudget, the budget they passed last year, that they offered in both \nChambers of the Congress, that they passed that has put us in this deep \nditch. That is the fact.\n  Last year, we were told there would be nearly $6 trillion of \nsurpluses over the next decade.\n  In fact, the President's Office of Management and Budget told us \nthere was going to be $5.6 trillion of surpluses over the next 10 \nyears. Now we are told maybe $400 billion, and that is before the \nrevenue shortfall of this filing season.\n  The fact is the money is all gone. Where did it go? More than 40 \npercent went to the tax cut that the Senator from Pennsylvania and his \ncolleagues pushed through this Congress. Twenty percent of the \ndisappearance of the surplus went from increased expenditures as a \nresult of the attacks on this country, 20 percent, and every Republican \nsupported those expenditures.\n  Twenty percent of the disappearance of the surplus happened because \nof the economic slowdown. About 20 percent occurred as a result of \nunderestimations of the cost of Medicare and Medicaid. That is where \nthe money went.\n  So if the Senator from Pennsylvania is wondering how the money \ndisappeared and who is responsible, he can look in the mirror because \nit was his fiscal policy, his budget, his plan, his promises that put \nus back into deficit and back into debt. That is where we are.\n  I warned against that fiscal policy. I warned that it would put us in \ndanger of raiding Social Security and raiding Medicare and every other \ntrust fund in sight. But, oh, no, the Senator from Pennsylvania and his \ncolleagues said: We know better. There is going to be even more money \nthan has been projected. That is what they said then, and now we reap \nthe whirlwind and the devastation of deficits and debt as far as the \neye can see.\n  We have an opportunity to get a budget framework in place. We have an \nopportunity to put in place the budget disciplines that are necessary \nto prevent spending from spinning out of control, but this kind of ad \nhominem attack is not going to solve those problems.\n  We presented a 10-year budget. I am proud of that budget. The budget \nI presented, that passed through the Budget Committee, did the \nfollowing: No. 1, fully funded the President's defense request for 2003 \nand 2004, and for the years beyond put the money in a reserve account \nso that every penny would be available for the defense of this country \nif needed. But in those future years, where none of us can say with \ncertainty what might be required for defense, to the extent any of that \nmoney is not needed for that purpose, it goes to reducing the debt of \nAmerica. That is a good policy. It is one we ought to adopt.\n  In the budget I have offered our colleagues, we fully fund all of the \nmoney the President has requested for homeland security because we \nbelieve everybody in this Chamber understands our first obligation is \nto defend this Nation.\n  The budget I have offered also has greater debt reduction than the \nPresident has offered in his budget, $500 billion more in debt \nreduction than what the President proposed, if the defense reserve fund \nis not needed for defense. If it is all required for defense, we still \nare paying down the debt by $230 billion more than the President's \nproposal.\n  On the other key issues before us, the budget I offered my colleagues \nsaid there would be no additional tax cuts unless they are paid for \nbecause we are now in deficit. It contains no tax increases, and it \nalso has no delay of the scheduled tax cuts.\n  The budget I offered also attempts to address the priorities of the \nAmerican people because it rejects certain of the cuts the President \nproposed. The President proposed cutting the highway construction \nprogram in this country by 27 percent. The President's budget proposes \na $9 billion cut in highway and bridge construction funding. I do not \nthink that is the priority of the American people.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Since the Senator has presented the budget I offered, I \nwould like to complete the description of that and then I would be \nhappy to yield.\n  I do not think it is wise to reduce the highway and bridge \nconstruction budget of the United States by 27 percent. No. 1, it would \ncost over 350,000 jobs in America. No. 2, it would reduce the \nefficiency of the transportation system in our country. What sense \nwould that make?\n  It does not end there. The other major difference in the priorities \nof my budget from the President's budget is in education. Everybody \nsays education is their priority, but the President's budget actually \ncut his signature education proposal, No Child Left Behind. The \nPresident, with great fanfare, went across the country drawing\n\n[[Page S5021]]\n\nattention to the No Child Left Behind Act, but in the first budget he \nproposed, he cut the funding for No Child Left Behind.\n  I also, in my budget, kept the Federal promise that was made long ago \nto the States with Disabilities Act funding for education. Educators \nall across America told us this was the single highest priority. It is \nthe one thing that would help school districts across America the most, \nif the Federal Government would keep its commitment to fund 40 percent \nof the costs of the Disabilities Act. That is a promise we have not \nkept. Under the budget I have proposed, we would keep it.\n  We have some additional funding for education, some additional \nfunding for law enforcement as well. The President cut dramatically the \nfunding for the COPS Program. What sense does that make, when we face a \nterrorist threat, to cut cops on the street? This is a program that has \nput tens of thousands of policemen on the streets of America. So we \nrestored that cut.\n  We also dealt with some of the other priorities of the Nation. In \naddition to education, in addition to law enforcement, we dealt with \nthe health care needs of America.\n  The President had about $250 billion set aside for a prescription \ndrug benefit and to expand health care coverage. The House in their \nbudget resolution set aside $350 billion for a prescription drug \nbenefit and for adjustments to providers. They did not pick up the \nPresident's proposal for expanding health care coverage.\n  In the budget I have proposed, we have a $500 billion reserve fund \nfor health care, for prescription drugs, for the President's proposal \non expanding health care, and for the third category of adjusting for \nproviders, the Medicare cuts that are in place that endanger the health \ncare of the people of the country because there are additional cuts to \nhospitals, additional cuts to doctors that go beyond what was \nanticipated when the 1997 Deficit Reduction Act was put in place.\n  Some have asked, how can it be that there are fewer cuts than the \nPresident proposed but on the other hand there is more debt reduction? \nHow can that be? The way we achieved that result was not to adopt the \nPresident's proposal of additional tax reductions on top of the \nstimulus package that has already been put in place this year, and on \ntop of the massive tax cut that was put in place last year that extends \nover the next 10 years. We say, yes, there can be additional tax cuts, \nabsolutely, but they have to be paid for.\n  I think that is a pretty reasonable budget. Those are principles that \nought to be adopted. Those are things that make sense.\n  I want to review how we got in the circumstance we are in today. It \nwas not the fact that we have not yet adopted a budget for 2003 that \nput us into deficit.\n\n  I conclude by saying we got in this soup because of the fiscal policy \nput in place last year by the Senator from Pennsylvania and his \ncolleagues. They are the ones who told the American people: You can \nhave it all; it all adds up, massive tax cut, major increases in \nspending. They will have maximum paydown of the Federal debt, they will \ndo all these things based on a 10-year forecast that even the people \nwho made the forecast warned was uncertain. But they bought it hook, \nline, and sinker, and they sold it to the American people.\n  What is the result? Before we have a budget for fiscal year 2003, \nmassive deficit is the result, deficit not just for this year but next \nyear and the next year and the next year and the next year, because \nthat party that claims to be the party of fiscal responsibility put us \nright back into the soup of deficits, debt, and decline. Their plan did \nnot add up. Now we have an opportunity and an obligation to try to \nagree on a budget for this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to make sure everyone understands \nwhat it is we are debating on the Senate floor.\n  The President made a request of the Senate to pass an emergency \nappropriation that would directly respond to the terrorist attacks in \nthe United States. He asked for more money for defense. He asked for \nmore money for homeland security. He asked for more money for New York. \nThat is the pending legislation.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said this bill is \non a slow train to nowhere. Mr. President, it is disconcerting, at \nbest, that on an issue of this import--dealing with troops overseas \nwhile the nation is on high alert after being told repeatedly in the \nlast 3 weeks about the inevitability of a further attack--somebody has \nunconscionably come to the floor and slow-trained this important bill, \nslow-walked it, stopped it, brought it to a grinding halt. But that is \nexactly what is happening.\n  We need to get this legislation passed. There ought to be a good \ndebate about budget. We have been trying to do that. We will have one. \nBut to offer a budget resolution on the amendment that is currently \npending is inexcusable. It is politics. It has everything to do with \nslowing this bill down to a screeching halt and ignoring the plea of \nthe President of the United States to enact this legislation as quickly \nas we can. That is what we are doing.\n  Members of his party have said: We don't care what the President is \nrequesting, we are going to slow-walk this, we are going to put this on \na slow train, and we are not going to pass this legislation this week. \nWe will vote against cloture tomorrow. We are actually going to \ncontinue to filibuster a bill the President has requested to deal with \nhomeland defense, to deal with aid to New York, and to deal with the \ndefense needs of this country. That is inexcusable.\n  I move to table the second-degree amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman), \nthe Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller), and the Senator from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Torricelli) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 96, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 134 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--96\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Bingaman\n     Helms\n     Rockefeller\n     Torricelli\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to reflect for a moment on the \nevents of today and say to my colleagues, we\n\n[[Page S5022]]\n\nhave to find a way to break the gridlock. The bill that is before us is \nfor defense, for homeland security, for dealing with the tragedy of the \nattack on New York, and to deal with some other urgent needs, including \nthe shortfall in Pell grants and VA medical care.\n  The bill before us is a $31 billion bill. Fourteen billion dollars is \nfor defense, money requested by the President to respond to the \ncontinuing terrorist threat to this country; $8.3 billion is for \nhomeland security, again funds requested by the President to respond to \nthe continuing threat against our Nation; $5.5 billion is to respond to \nthe needs of New York after the attack of September 11; $1.9 billion is \nfor foreign security assistance to strengthen our embassies against \nterrorist attacks; $1 billion to deal with the shortfall in Pell \ngrants; $400 million for VA medical care. That is the bill that is \nbefore us. Those are requests of the President of the United States.\n  I want to make clear that what is at stake is spending items \nrequested by the President of the United States to respond to the \nthreats against our country and the devastation that occurred as a \nresult of those attacks. I think it also must be said that we need to \nhave a budget put in place for this year. It is needed. Now we are \nbeing told by some on the other side, they will block any attempt to \nhave a vote on a budget framework for this year.\n  There are others on both sides who want to work together to achieve \nthat result. There are others on both sides who believe it is important \nto have a budget put in place for this year, to have the budget \ndisciplines extended for this year. I hoped we could do that before we \nconclude work on this supplemental. This is one of the best \nalternatives, one of the best options we will have to put in place a \nbudget framework for this year.\n  I might say that people on both sides of the aisle have worked very \nhard to do that, are very close to an agreement to do that, but we have \nto have an opportunity to vote before cloture is invoked or that effort \nwill fall.\n  That is the hard reality. We have an opportunity to put in place a \nbudget for this year, to extend the budget disciplines for this year, \nand to provide some order to this process. That is in the interest of \nall of us. That is in the interest of the Nation. I would hope very \nmuch that tomorrow we would have the opportunity to vote on that on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask the Senator, who is the chair of our Budget \nCommittee, about issues that are in that budget which I think are so \ncritical for all of us, and I share with the Senator his frustration \nabout the lack of willingness or ability to move ahead in order to pass \nthis supplemental and to be able to pass the budget. One of the \nimportant provisions that we have worked on together relates to the \nquestion of prescription drugs and putting forward a comprehensive \nMedicare prescription drug benefit that I know the Presiding Officer \nhas been deeply involved in leading and advocating as well.\n  Would the Senator not agree that it is critically important that we \nbe able to move ahead with this budget so we can address the issue of \nMedicare prescription drugs and be able to address the spiraling costs \nof medications, affecting every part of our economy and that our budget \nresolution, in fact, puts in place the ability to do that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like nothing better than to have the opportunity \nto have a full plan. At this moment, what is at stake is having any \nplan just for this year. That is clearly in the Nation's interests. It \nis in the interest of an orderly appropriations process to have a \nbudget for this year and to have the various budget disciplines put in \nplace for this year. That is now what is at risk, much less having a \nlonger term plan. What is at risk at this moment is having any plan. \nThat is what is at risk.\n  There are some Members who do not want any plan, some Members who \nwant chaos. They think somehow they benefit by not having a discipline \nin this entire process. That is regrettable, I say to my colleague, who \nis a very valuable member of the Senate Budget Committee. We voted out \na resolution, a blueprint on how to proceed, one that was fiscally \nresponsible, that had substantially more debt paydown than the \nPresident proposed, one that has no tax increases, one that has no \ndelay of the scheduled tax cuts, one that provides everything the \nPresident requested for the defense of this Nation, both in terms of \nthe defense budget and the budget for homeland security. We did that.\n  We are asking for at least the opportunity to vote on one year of \nthat plan so we meet the defense needs, so we meet the needs for \nhomeland security, so we get this supplemental budget in place that the \nPresident has requested, so that, yes, we have the budget disciplines \ncontinue past September 30 when they expire. We do not want to see a \ncircumstance where spending spins out of control. Just be here in \nOctober with no budget disciplines available and see what real chaos \ncan be.\n  I say to my colleagues, I know there are people who have strong \nfeelings on all of these issues. I do, as well. We ought to let the \nSenate work its will. We ought to have a chance to vote. That is how we \ndetermine outcomes here.\n  I have been told there are some who have the idea of preventing the \nSenate from voting. They do not want a chance to vote because they \nthink they would lose, although there is a 60-vote requirement. They \nare right. They would lose. We would then have the opportunity to have \nnot only a budget for this year and also the budget disciplines \ncontinue, that is very much in the public interest.\n  I hope some of my colleagues overnight will think about the \nconsequences of the failure to act. I thank the Senator from Michigan \nfor her contributions on the Budget Committee.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I commend the Senator from North Dakota for his ongoing \nleadership on the Budget Committee. These are challenging times. He has \nforecast for over a year great concerns about an evaporating surplus \nand what could happen with a downturn and other pressures on the \nbudget. He has continued to advocate fiscal discipline. I join the \nSenator in that and in setting the right priorities for the country, \nthe right priorities for our families.\n\n\n                         assistance for israel\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to discuss the \namendment of the Senator from Kentucky, the ranking minority member of \nthe Foreign Operations Subcommittee, Senator McConnell, concerning \nassistance for Israel.\n  This amendment would permit the transfer of all or a portion of the \nfunds in the supplemental for Israel, to the ``Nonproliferation, Anti-\nTerrorism, Demining and Related Programs'' account (NADR), to be used \nfor ``defensive, non-lethal anti-terrorism assistance.'' It is my \nunderstanding that the purpose of this amendment is to provide the \nauthority to utilize these funds to purchase bomb detection equipment, \nx-ray machinery, body armor, and similar types of border security and \nother defensive equipment to prevent acts of terrorism. Am I correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor his question. Yes, he is correct. That is exactly what these funds \nwould be available for. The recent bombings in Israel--including one \nthis morning that killed 16 people--have only demonstrated the urgent \nneed for this type of assistance.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. I want to be certain that there is no \nambiguity about what these funds are for. We are all aware that there \nwas never any intention that these funds would be available for lethal \nassistance or for the expansion of settlements, but I think it is \nimportant to reaffirm that understanding. These NADR funds would not be \navailable for offensive purposes, or for any purpose unrelated to the \npurchase of defensive, non-lethal anti-terrorism equipment, and the \nSenator from Kentucky has confirmed that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me thank the chairman for including the assistance \nfor Israel in his mark.\n\n\n   WAIVER OF THE LOCAL MATCH FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS INTEROPERABILITY \n                                FUNDING\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Hollings, in a\n\n[[Page S5023]]\n\ncolloquy on the local match requirements for Federal grant funding. \nThis pressing concern was raised by the local elected officials we \nheard from during the Appropriations Committee homeland security \nhearings. One of them testified that in many of these grant programs, \nparticularly in the public safety area, our larger cities with the \ngreatest needs cannot afford to meet a local requirement, while \nwealthier area with relatively fewer needs are able to take full \nadvantage of these funds.\n  I hope the distinguished chairman will join me in this colloquy at \nthis time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would be happy to speak with my colleague from \nLouisiana on this important issue.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator. I believe that local match \nrequirements are an important shared investment in Federal grant \nmaking. So there is a need for it and I think my colleague would agree.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I certainly do agree. By giving the local jurisdiction \n``buy-in'' to a grant, the local match adds an incentive for \ncommunities to use Federal funding effectively. A wide variety of grant \nprograms have them. I also share in the Senator from Louisiana's \nconcern that many of our communities may not be able to afford that \nmatch. Many grant programs provide waivers of the match in certain \ncases.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like to talk to the Senator about the $80 \nmillion in interoperable communications funding in the Department of \nJustice title of the bill. In the District of Columbia Subcommittee we \nhave held hearings on the emergency preparedness needs for Washington, \nDC. During 9-11, District fire and police personnel had to have the \nability to communicate with multiple jurisdictions that responded to \nthe Pentagon. So interoperability is crucial for public safety \nofficials.\n  The funding in the bill would be administered by the COPS program at \nthe Department of Justice. You have been a leader in the Senate in your \nsupport of that program. COPS grants require a 25 percent local match \nfor its grants. The COPS program does allow for a full or partial \nwaiver of the local match for communities that are facing severe fiscal \ndistress. Communities can qualify for a waiver in a wide variety of \nways. Some qualify because they have been declared a FEMA disaster area \nor have been placed in receivership or bankruptcy. Communities can also \nget a waiver if they have had a recent large, one-time financial \nexpense, like replacing a water treatment facility. The COPS program \nwill also grant waivers to communities that had to make across-the-\nboard budget cuts as a result of difficult economic circumstances.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Congress designed the COPS program to meet the specific \nlaw enforcement needs of individual communities. This is true not only \nwith the waiver of the local match, but in how communities can use COPS \nfunding in general.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Is it your understanding that the COPS interoperable \ncommunications funding in the bill will be administered in the same \nmanner as the other COPS grant programs regarding the local match and \nthe waiver process?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes. These funds will be administered in the same \nmanner as other COPS grants funds regarding both the matching \nrequirements and the waiver process.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee. I look \nforward to working with you on this issue.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the funding for \nthe U.S. Coast Guard aviation programs in the pending supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  On February 20, I spent a day at Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater \nin St. Petersburg, Florida. I observed first hand some very impressive \nCoast Guard aviation operations, but also several helicopters that were \ninoperative due to problems associated with a shortage of spare parts. \nI am pleased that the pending supplemental will help restore adequate \nfunding for the Coast Guard aviation program, including spare parts, \nand get these aircraft flying and operational again soon.\n  The Coast Guard needs this assistance to cover their basic \noperational expenses. According to the Coast Guard, the first \nsupplemental this year provided funding to operate seven additional \naircraft (4 HU-25 Falcon jets and 3 HH-65 helicopters) and provided a \n15 percent increase in flight hours. The pending supplemental contains \napproximately $22 million to continue to operate the entire aviation \nfleet for the remainder of the fiscal year, with an adequate inventory \nlevels of repair parts. I am also pleased that the Coast Guard reports \nthat the President's fiscal year 2003 budget request contains the \nnecessary recurring funding to support the additional aircraft and \nflight hours brought on by fiscal year 2002 supplemental funding, as \nwell as continues to resolve the Service's aviation parts shortfalls.\n  I do recognize that some of the HH-60 helicopter problems that I saw \nin February are due to aging aircraft issues that affect the entire \nU.S. H-60 fleet, including those owned by the Department of Defense, \nand are not just the Coast Guard specific issues.\n  As one of the nation's first lines of defense in stemming the flow of \nillicit drugs and illegal immigration into the United States, it is \nimperative that the U.S. Coast Guard be appropriated the resources that \nthey require to carry out their critical missions on behalf of the \nAmerican people. And we must remain committed to ensuring that our \nCoast Guard has adequate resources not just now, but well into the \nfuture. The U.S. Coast Guard is important to Florida and important to \nthe nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support for the Coast Guard's \nsupplemental funding for fiscal year 2002 as well as for their annual \nappropriations in fiscal year 2003.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I very much enjoyed Thomas Friedman's \nop-ed in today's New York Times entitled ``Land of Denial.'' I could \nnot agree more with his assertion that Egypt can--and should--be doing \nmore to be a leader in the Arab world.\n  Egypt is a land of missed opportunities, and it has forfeited its \nhistorical place in Middle Eastern history as a progressive and \npluralistic country. Friedman points out that while other countries--\nJordan, Bahrain, Qatar, and even Tunisia--have forged ahead with \ndemocratic, free press, and economic reforms, Egypt ``has been \nstagnating.''\n  I could not agree more with Friedman's assertion that ``[t]he \nintellectual air has gone stale in Egypt from too many years of \ncontrolled press and authoritarian politics.''\n  In the past, I have taken issue with Egypt's cold peace with Israel, \nits jailing of democracy advocates, its suspicious involvement with \nNorth Korean missiles and weapons technicians, and its reckless and \nirresponsible government-controlled press that fuels extremism on the \nstreets of Cairo and throughout the Arab world.\n  It is not too late for President Hosni Mubarak to embark on a reform \npath that will ensure a stable and prosperous Egypt. It is in our \ninterests--as well as those of the Egyptian people--that Mubarak \ninvests in the development of functioning democratic institutions and \npolitical processes.\n  In the supplemental bill I carved out a portion of assistance \nprovided in the Economic Support Fund account for the professional \ntraining of Egyptian and other Middle Eastern journalists. I did so \nbecause I firmly believe that a free and independent media in Egypt \nwill contribute to our war against terrorism, peace in the region, and \nthe political, legal, and economic development of that country.\n  The abuses of the government-controlled Egyptian press are legendary, \nand include personal attacks against Secretary of State Colin Powell \nand National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. America has been \nrepeatedly tarred and feathered, Israel vilified, and Hitler criticized \nfor not killing all the Jews ``so that the world could sigh in relief \nwithout their evil and sins.''\n  Such inflammatory nonsense fuels ideological extremism that has \nrepercussions on our shores and throughout the world.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that in my capacity as ranking member of \nthe Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I will continue to examine the \nassistance America provides to Egypt. I have already suggested to \nSecretary Powell that we reassess our assistance to Egypt to ensure \nthat it effectively promotes critically needed reforms, and I look \nforward to working with the administration on this matter.\n\n[[Page S5024]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S4996-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4996-S5024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Massachusetts has requested \npermission to set aside the pending amendment to bring up his \namendment.

Mr. President, as I understand, we have an hour's time \nlimit to be divided equally. I will make some very brief opening \ncomments and then yield to my colleague and cosponsor, Senator Smith \nfrom Oregon.\n  I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mrs. \nBoxer, Senator Dodd, Senator Reid, Senator Murray, and Senator Durbin.\n  Very briefly, this amendment provides $150 million in emergency \nfunding for fiscal year 2002 to communities to provide students who \nhave fallen behind in their schoolwork the opportunity to catch up with \ntheir peers. The second area of education is to award emergency grants \nto communities that have unmet needs for the summer school programs. \nPriority in funding will be given to communities that have had to \neliminate or cut back their summer school programs due to local and \nState budget reductions and have high poverty rates. Funding is to be \nprovided on a one-time basis to ensure there are safe learning \nopportunities this summer for the neediest children.\n  The bill before us provides urgently needed resources to fight \nagainst terrorism, and this is vitally important to the Nation. But \njust as we must address needs on the war front, we must also turn to \nurgent priorities at home. There is no greater priority than ensuring a \ngood education for our children. Good schools are critical to the \nNation's future, and they are critical\n\n[[Page S4998]]\n\nto our national security and national defense.\n  We want our service men and women to be well trained, well led, and \nwith the latest in terms of technology. In order to be able to do that \nand perform to secure our Nation, they have to be able to have a good \neducation.\n  We have learned in recent days that schools across the country are \ncutting back on their summer school programs, creating an emergency for \nour schools, for our parents, and for schoolchildren. I know the \nSenator from Oregon has a schedule to keep, so I will yield to him and \nthen I will come back and give the Members an idea about what is \nhappening with the cuts in summer school programs and the value of the \nsummer school programs, reaching the conclusion of all who were \ninvolved in the No Child Left Behind Act, if we are going to ask our \nchildren to perform, we have to make sure they are given the kind of \nsupport they need.\n  The 300,000 children who are going to have their summer school \neliminated will not graduate from their schools without this kind of \nassistance because they are the ones who are involved in this program, \nand then we will be faced with what their futures will be without \ncompleting their education.\n  In our education program, we put a strong requirement on the students \nto perform, on schools to support those efforts, on teachers to be \nqualified, and also we have a part as well to make sure those children \nare not going to be left behind.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for \nyielding this time to me. I am pleased to join him in this amendment he \nhas offered in the spirit of no child being left behind. It is obvious \nto anyone that the effect of the recession in many of the States, my \nown included, is that education is suffering devastating cuts and these \nare manifest particularly as to programs such as summer school.\n  Specifically, in my State, Portland, has eliminated summer school \nentirely for elementary school. It has cut its middle and high school \nprograms in half, leaving more than 1,000 students unserved. Similar \ncuts are being made in Eugene, Beaverton, Salem, and in other schools \nacross my State. These cuts are being made in States across the country \nas well, and preliminary reports indicate that as many as 300,000 \nstudents nationwide will not benefit from summer school this year.\n  I emphasize that this amendment is for any school that has unmet \nsummer school needs. In Oregon, it means reversing summer school cuts, \nbut in other States it may mean expanding their limited programs to \nreach more low-income and underserved students. If we do not step in \nand help our schools now, thousands of students across Oregon and \nacross the country will not get the extra attention they need this \nsummer. Those are thousands of students who will suffer next year if we \ndo not act to help them today. Let's give our school districts the \nresources they need to help students who need it most. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this effort.\n  It is my experience as a father, that summer school is a very \nvaluable tool in the home to motivate better academic performance by \nthe children. Just the threat to one's children that if they do not \nbuckle down now, they will be going to summer school, I have observed \ndoes create some degree of terror and dread and better performance.\n  I hate to see this eliminated because my children have shared with me \nlater that it was a good experience and highly motivational to go to \nsummer school. As a Senator, I can, with great enthusiasm, support what \nSenator Kennedy has offered because we have, with the very best of \nintentions, tried to get our economy moving with the stimulus package, \nwith which we tried to backfill the impact of State budgets. That was \ntaken out in a conference committee, against my objections, but it was \ndone, and we passed it.\n  This has created shortfalls in States. This is being manifest not \nonly in health care programs and other cutbacks, but in education \nprograms. It seems to me we have a role because we helped create a \nshort-term deficit so we would have a long-term surplus, that we can, \nwith this package today, help in a critical area by restoring summer \nschool funding.\n  I have seen it work as a dad. I think we need it to work as Senators, \nand I urge my colleagues to join Senator Kennedy and myself in passing \nthis very needed amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 additional minutes.\n  Once again, I give this information to our colleagues about the value \nof the summer school programs and give some examples of the studies \nthat have been done and what the results have been. The most recent \nreview of educational research shows that summer school programs make a \ndifference for students. A recent review of 39 studies shows that the \nacademic test scores declined over summer school vacation. The 13 more \nrecent studies show summer school loss is equal to 1 month of learning \nat grade level. In addition, summer break was more detrimental to math \ncomputation and spelling, and the neediest students lost the most. \nMiddle-class students gained during the summer on grade level reading \ntests while high-poverty students lost ground.\n  Our efforts with the ESEA are to target the neediest students. \nResearch indicates quite clearly what happens to them without any \nsummer school, but listen to what happens to them with it. The Chicago \npublic schools initiated the summer school program in 1996 to help \nchildren who had fallen behind catch up. Eighty-three percent of the \n9,700 Chicago third graders required to attend summer school last year \nhad met their grade level criteria by the end of the summer. That is \nabsolutely extraordinary progress. Seventy-five percent of sixth \ngraders and 71 percent of eighth graders made the grade by the end of \nthe summer. Without summer school, these students would not have been \npromoted to the next grade.\n  Listen to what has happened in Ohio. Ohio test scores for fourth \ngraders show that children in summer school and afterschool programs \nexceeded the statewide percentages of students meeting proficiency \nstandards in every subject area tested: Writing, reading, mathematics, \ncitizenship, and science. Sixth graders exceeded the statewide \npercentages of students meeting proficiency standards in four of the \nfive areas: writing, reading, mathematics, and citizenship. School \nabsences and tardiness were reduced for participating students.\n\n  Look at Fulton County schools in Georgia, operating a summer \naccelerated learning experience that provides full-day summer school \nfor 1st through 12th grade, including the breakfast and lunch for all \nstudents in the community, as well as participating students. In 1999, \nthey provided half-day programs with only 3,000 student participants; \nin 2000, they expanded to full day and attracted twice as many \nstudents; in 2001, they had 10,000 students. This year, they predicted \n11,000 students. The district tested students at the beginning and end \nof the summer and found great improvement.\n  The value of the summer school programs has been defined for students \nacross this country.\n  Against that, we have the schools that are canceling the programs. I \nrefer to an excellent story in the Gannette News Service regarding what \nis happening to summer schools across the country. It points out that \nsummer schools have been a lifeline for students who struggle to meet \nhigher academic standards and face repeating grades. In No Child Left \nBehind, we have tried to eliminate social promotion. Children have to \nmeasure up. Great numbers of children now are required to take summer \nschool in order to be able to meet the academic challenges we have \nincluded in the program.\n  Now we see the canceling of the programs. This is very modest, \ncosting about $1,000. It varies in different parts of the country but \nis basically about $1,000 for the summer program per student. What is \nhappening is, 39 States have made midyear budget cuts during the fiscal \nyear. A May analysis by the National Association of State Budget \nOffices shows they are cutting students from kindergarten through high \nschool in the summer. Expectations are rising, but the funds are not. \nSomething has to break. The programs that could\n\n[[Page S4999]]\n\nbe singled out, such as summer school, are getting the ax, according to \nMichael Griffith, policy analyst with the Denver Education Commission.\n  Across the country, budget cuts imperil summer classes. In \nWashington, DC, educators slice student enrollment at the District 5-\nweek summer program by 50 percent--a reduction in Washington, DC, by 50 \npercent of summer school programs that children otherwise are required \nto take in order to try to meet the standards.\n  In Indiana, more than $470 million in budget cuts forced education to \ncut 15 percent of the money for the summer school programs. As a \nresult, some school districts are limiting class to key academic \nstudies such as reading and math.\n  In South Carolina, districts have trimmed or eliminated summer school \nprograms. ``You cannot cut textbooks; that money was spent the first \nday of school,'' said a spokesman for the South Carolina Department of \nEducation, Jim Foster. One of the few things left to cut--something not \ndone yet--is summer school.\n  I will mention some of the reductions. In Florida, in Dade County, \n19,000 students are cut out of summer school programs; in Hillsborough \nCounty, FL, 36,000 students have lost the summer school program; in \nBroward County, 40,000 students have lost summer programs; in my State, \nMassachusetts: Worcester County, MA, 6,000; more than 25,000 in the \nState of Michigan. Even in smaller communities, in South Carolina, in \nLaurens County, $100,000 for 280 students is eliminated. In Marion \nCounty, SC, $50,000 was eliminated, and 200 students, needy in terms of \neducation requirements, see their program eliminated.\n\n  In Wisconsin, $60,000 in Mequon; 1,200 students. This is over 300,000 \nstudents according to the latest information.\n  This is an emergency. We have in the program provided the Secretary \nobligate the funds within 4 weeks or sooner. If we are able to get it, \nthere is every expectation that the appropriators will move this \nconference rapidly. The differences are minimal. There are some \ndifferences with the House, not great. They will move it rapidly, I \nexpect in a matter of days, and we will get the final outcome with the \ninclusion of this amendment. All that has to happen, from our \nconversations with school superintendents, school boards across the \ncountry, if the Secretary obligates the money, they will have the \nresources and they can reinstate these summer programs.\n  The Department at the present time has on file $150 million in \nworthy, highly regarded 21st century summer school and afterschool \napplications--already ranked and already peer-reviewed, on the \nSecretary's desk. He could approve $150 million worth of those this \nafternoon. They have been peer-reviewed and ranked. All that needs to \nbe done is to give greater targeting to the needy students. We give \ndiscretion to the Secretary to be able to do that. That would be \nmanageable.\n  The Department can promise the funds to those districts placing a \npriority on those canceling the summer school programs or so the \ndistricts can borrow money to resume the summer programs, and the \nDepartment can then reimburse.\n  States contemplate more summer school cuts right now. My own State is \nconsidering a $40 million additional cut. This is a barebones amendment \nto deal with an emergency. If we do not do this, these summer school \nprograms are headed for the chop block. We made a commitment to the \nstudents that we would not leave them behind. The school districts now \nare saying to the students: Look, you have to make the grade in these \nschools, in terms of the tests, and you have to stay and do the work \nover the course of the summer and raise your grades because we are \neliminating social promotion from these States and these local \ncommunities. So the students are prepared to go. And now we are saying \nthe resources will not be there.\n  This is an emergency. It does relate to our security in a very \nimportant way in terms of the education of our children. It seems to me \nthe Senate should be willing to accept this amendment.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Twelve and a half minutes.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very grateful to have 6 minutes to \ntry to put into words my strongest support for this very important \namendment which has been put forward by our leader on education, \nSenator Kennedy, with the strong endorsement of Senator Gordon Smith, \nmaking it a very bipartisan amendment.\n  There is some confusion about what an emergency supplemental bill is. \nI have been in the Congress--hard to believe it--20 years, 10 in the \nHouse and 10 in the Senate, and we take up emergency supplementals all \nthe time because there are unmet needs and we need to act.\n  Senator Kennedy is pointing out a crucial unmet need. I was very \ndelighted when he asked me to speak because I have worked hard with \nhim, with the Presiding Officer, and others on afterschool programs for \nour children.\n  The funding will go into the afterschool programs. We all think of \nafterschool programs as occurring at the end of the day when kids could \ngo home to empty houses, and so on. That is the usual way to think of \nit. But Senator Kennedy is doing something interesting. What he is \nbasically saying is afterschool ends and for some kids there is no \nsummer school. That is afterschool in the broadest sense. So I support \nthese funds going through the 21st Century Learning Centers.\n  When President Bush speaks about education, he talks about leaving no \nchild behind. As a mother, as a grandmother, as a Senator from the \nlargest State in the Union, I know that when you leave a child home \nalone in the summertime, you are really giving a new meaning to ``left \nbehind.'' We know during the regular school year what happens. The FBI \nhas shown us the crime rate going dramatically upward after school \nhours. We know what happens when a child has all day to sit alone at \nhome, without having the chance to have activities funneled into \nsomething positive, without having the chance to hone their skills for \nthe rest of the year.\n  As Senator Kennedy has stated so eloquently many times, we are \nputting much more of a burden on our youngsters to step up to the plate \nand achieve high standards. I support that. But at the same time, to \ndeprive them of summer school this summer just as we are putting all \nthese standards in place is a cruel hypocrisy. If we do not support \nthis amendment, I think we are doing something very cruel indeed to \nthose children.\n  This amendment will benefit every single State in the Union. The way \nit is worded, it will go to States that have a shortfall, but it will \nalso go to areas where there is an unmet need. In my home State of \nCalifornia, summer school is a very high priority. But even with that, \nand even with the fact that in our State you cannot cut it back, in \nterms of State funds, we have a tremendous unmet need. Many of our \nchildren are left behind; 6,000 California students who are eligible \nfor summer school will go without.\n  So I say to Senator Kennedy: Thank you very much on behalf of those \n6,000 children. This is not some theoretical debate. This is a real \nemergency for many of our families who do not have the wherewithal, who \ndo not have the ability to ensure their children are protected from \nbeing alone after the school year is over. I believe with this \namendment we will be making a very strong statement.\n  Again, it is important for colleagues to recognize that this is an \nemergency supplemental. Yes, it has much in it that deals with homeland \nsecurity, and I support every dollar for that. But, again, as Senator \nKennedy has stated, and as former President Dwight Eisenhower stated--\nbecause he was the first one to call attention to this--if we do not \neducate our children, we are taking a national security risk.\n  It is not a stretch in my mind to say that for kids home alone who \nshould have an effective summer school program, that is, in fact, an \nemergency. That is, in fact, something we must address in this bill. It \nis an emergency.\n  Again, I believe the definition of afterschool certainly should apply \nto this situation. After school is over, what happens to our children? \nMany of them will be fortunate, they will have summer school; their \nenergies will be channeled; their talents will be invigorated. They \nwill do better in the\n\n[[Page S5000]]\n\nschool year following. But many of them are left behind.\n  If our President means what he says--and I know in his heart he means \nit--he ought to support this.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his leadership on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time now remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On the other side, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take 2 minutes. I mentioned \nearlier the impact on some of the counties. I want to point out this is \nnot just large communities or small communities, it is in all \ncommunities. I will use, for example, what some cuts mean to children. \nJust for the minute or two, I will use some of the counties in the \nState of Florida, but these are replicated in other communities.\n  In Hillsborough, around Tampa, a $6.2 million cut, which is the \nentire program canceled for 36,000 students not served; Lee County, \n$1.3 million cut, all summer school services have been cut, except for \nthose for the IDEA students. That is 2,500 high school students will \nnot be served.\n  In Leon County, they have $1 million for their summer school program. \nThey have now decided not to serve any of the 3,600 they intended to \nserve.\n  In Manatee County, $1.4 million was cut from their summer program \nleaving just $275,000, so that entire program is canceled, except for \nthe students who need only one credit to graduate.\n  This is being replicated in rural areas, urban areas, all across the \ncountry--300,000 children were depending upon summer school in order to \nmeet their obligations to try to meet the rigors of academic challenges \nin school. If we do not provide the resources here in this legislation \nin a timely way, those programs will be canceled and those children are \nin very serious risk of not being able to move to another grade or to \ngraduate. I think that falls into the definition of an emergency.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3608, As Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the modification that Senator Smith \nand I described be made at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the modification?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The modification of an emergency designation.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have no objection to the Senator being able to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3608), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. EMERGENCY SUMMER SCHOOL FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings; Purpose.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (A) Under the amendments made by the No Child Left Behind \n     Act of 2001, students and schools rightly are held \n     accountable for meeting challenging State academic content \n     and student academic achievement standards in mathematics, \n     reading or language arts, and science.\n       (B) Summer programs and activities supported under the 21st \n     Century Community Learning Centers program are critical to \n     providing supplemental academic services and academic \n     enrichment activities designed to help students meet local \n     and State academic standards.\n       (C) Summer programs and activities supported under the 21st \n     Century Community Learning Centers program help children and \n     the children's families in the areas of youth development, \n     drug and violence prevention, and character education.\n       (D) During the summer of 2002, school districts throughout \n     the Nation will confront more than $200,000,000 in cuts to \n     summer school programs, eliminating services and academic \n     support to more than 150,000 struggling children.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to provide \n     opportunities for communities to provide summertime \n     activities in community learning centers that--\n       (A) provide opportunities for academic enrichment, \n     including providing tutorial services to help students, \n     particularly students who attend low-performing schools, to \n     meet State and local student academic achievement standards \n     in core academic subjects, such as reading and mathematics; \n     and\n       (B) offer students an array of additional services, \n     programs, and activities, such as youth development \n     activities, drug and violence prevention programs, counseling \n     programs, art, music, and recreation programs, technology \n     education programs, and character education programs, that \n     are designed to reinforce and complement the regular academic \n     program of participating students.\n       (b) Funding for Summer School Programs.--\n       (1) In general.--Provided that, in addition to amounts \n     otherwise available to carry out section 4205(a) of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     7175(a)), $150,000,000 shall be available to carry out \n     activities described in section 4205(a) of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7175(a)) during \n     the 2002 summer recess period.\n       (2) Awarding of grants.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding section 4202 of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     7172), the Secretary of Education shall award grants with \n     funds made available under paragraph (1) on a competitive \n     basis to eligible entities serving communities whose local \n     educational agencies are not able to meet fully the \n     communities' need for summer school programs.\n       (B) Priority.--In awarding grants under subparagraph (A), \n     the Secretary of Education shall give priority to an eligible \n     entity that is a local educational agency or who serves a \n     community whose local educational agency--\n       (i) serves high concentrations or numbers of low-income \n     children;\n       (ii) before June 6, 2002, announced that the local \n     educational agency is canceling or reducing summer school \n     services in 2002; or\n       (iii) is located in a State whose State educational agency, \n     before June 6, 2002, announced that the State educational \n     agency is canceling or reducing summer school funding for \n     2002.\n       (3) Application and obligation.--\n       (A) Application.--Notwithstanding sections 4203 and 4204 of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     7173 and 7174), an eligible entity that desires a grant under \n     this section shall submit an application to the Secretary of \n     Education at such time and in such manner as the Secretary of \n     Education may require.\n       (B) Obligation.--Not later than 4 weeks after the date of \n     enactment of this section, the Secretary of Education shall \n     obligate funds made available under this section.\n       (4) Definition of eligible entity.--In this section, the \n     term ``eligible entity'' has the meaning given the term in \n     section 4201 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 7171).\n       (5) Emergency designation.--The entire amount necessary to \n     carry out this section is designated by Congress as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as \n     amended.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, regrettably, I must oppose the amendment \noffered by my friend from Massachusetts. I do not like to oppose this \namendment. I would be very supportive of this amendment were it under \ndifferent circumstances and not being offered to this bill. The \namendment would provide $150 million in emergency funding for fiscal \nyear 2002 to support community summer school programs.\n  Last December, Congress approved and the President signed the Labor-\nHHS Education Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002. That act \ncontains significant resources for the summer school program. \nCurrently, the Federal Government provides $1 billion in funding for \nthe 21st Century Afterschool Program. In fiscal year 2002, the funding \nincreased by $150 million.\n  Senator Kennedy makes a very strong case for this program, and I \ncertainly agree with him in the concept, but I cannot support this \namendment as it is being offered to this supplemental bill.\n  This supplemental appropriations bill is focused on providing the \nresources necessary to support the war on terrorism and to secure our \nhomeland.\n  In the supplemental bill, we funded the President's request for $14 \nbillion for the Department of Defense. We have provided $8.3 billion \nfor homeland defense programs.\n  I believe it is essential that the Senate move forward quickly in \napproving this bill so that Federal agencies and State and local \ngovernments have the resources they need now--not later--to prevent, to \ndetect, and to respond to potential terrorist attacks. Funding homeland \ndefense must be our highest priority.\n  Sadly, in the Statement of Administration Policy, delivered to the \nSenate yesterday, I believe it was, the President's senior advisers \nindicated they would recommend that he veto this\n\n[[Page S5001]]\n\nbill because it contains what the administration characterizes as \n``lower priority, nonemergency programs.''\n  It is not clear which of our homeland defense programs the \nadministration was referring to in their statement. Was it the funding \nto train and equip firefighters? Was it the funding to enhance law \nenforcement? Was it the funding to enhance port security? Was it the \nfunding for airport security? Was it the security funding that the \nDepartment of Energy believes is essential to prevent terrorists from \ngetting their hands on nuclear material but that OMB turned down?\n  Regardless, we are facing a veto threat because the advisers to the \nPresident at least, apparently, believe we have too much funding in the \nbill for homeland defense and other programs.\n  I believe the President and his advisers are fundamentally wrong when \nit comes to homeland defense.\n  The Vice President has said we can expect another terrorist attack--\nthat it is almost certain. When might that happen--tomorrow, or next \nweek, or next year? Yet the administration opposes critical homeland \ndefense programs that our recent Appropriations Committee hearings \ndemonstrated were necessary to fill in the cracks in the security of \nour homeland.\n  Having said all of this, I do not believe we should add fuel to the \nfire by adding funding to this bill for a program that was well funded \nin the Labor-HHS Education Act. Was it because the summer school \nprograms used more funds? Senator Kennedy and other Senators make a \ngood case that it could be. But it is not an emergency.\n  I regret having to oppose this amendment. I think I can say without \nany feeling that anyone can question my statement that I have been as \ngreat a supporter of education as any Senator in this Chamber. I have \nsupported education all through the years. I support summer school \nprograms. But I don't support adding $150 million to this bill when the \nthreats of veto downtown indicate we would simply be adding fuel to the \nfire.\n  This is a tough bill. It has been very difficult to bring it thus \nfar. We conducted hearings which were extremely substantive. We had \ngood witnesses. We had witnesses from all over the country--Governors, \nmayors, and people who are at the local level, firefighters, policemen, \nand health officials. We had former Senator Sam Nunn and former Senator \nWarren Rudman come before the committee. We had seven Federal \nDepartment heads. We went into matters very thoroughly on this \ncommittee. We were concerned about homeland defense. We wanted to \nprovide the moneys that could be used in a protective way and in a way \nthat would make our people safe. These moneys are for schoolchildren--\nfor the safety of schoolchildren, for safety in schools, and for the \nsafety of the children and their parents in their homes.\n\n  I just do not want to do anything that would give the administration \nany assistance in arguing that we are going beyond what we should do in \nthis particular bill. We are having a hard enough time with the \nadministration as it is. The Homeland Defense Director, Mr. Ridge, \nwould not come before the committee. The President would not let him \ncome before the committee. So we had to make do with what we could. We \nhad very good hearings even though he did not appear before the \ncommittee.\n  So we are doing the best we can to protect the people of this country \nin the face of imminent threats, if we are to pay any attention to what \nthe administration has said about threats.\n  I hope we will not add this amendment to this bill. It would be \ndifficult enough in conference to carry the bill as it is written.\n  We think what is in the bill, generally speaking, has been the \nproduct of our hearings. The hearings have been studied assiduously by \nthe staff of both sides. And Senator Stevens and I have labored hard to \nbring this bill thus far. I don't want to see this bill vetoed. I hope \nwe can convince the President not to veto it. But I think we ought to \nbe very careful not to be adding amendments on this floor that will \nmake it easier for the administration to make its case.\n  I shall yield the floor at this point. I yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of our \ncommittee.\n  I regret that I must take the position we have to take on this \namendment. It provides emergency funding for communities that have \nsummer school programs. But as we look at it, the priority is given to \ncommunities that have had to eliminate or cut back on programs due to \nState or local budget reductions.\n  We increased the money in the budget for 2002 by $150 million above \nthe 2001 budget in this area. Having increased it $150 million, the \nState and local governments reduced their effort. And now the Senator \nwishes us to make up the reduction brought about by local and State \nreductions which they took because we had provided Federal money to \nassist them in the area. It is a never ending cycle if we do that.\n  But beyond that, I call attention to the fact that we are already in \nJune. There is no way in God's heaven we are going to get this bill to \nthe President before July. The normal processes of releasing money \nwould not get the money to them before September, when the school year \nhas started. This is no way to treat our emergency bill that is before \nus now to deal with emergencies of homeland defense, emergencies in \ndefense, and other emergencies. There are emergencies. The Oklahoma \nbridge is an emergency. But this is not an emergency. They are not \nneeded on an emergency basis. They cannot be spent this summer.\n  I am compelled to oppose the amendment because of the circumstance we \nface.\n  I want to tell the Senate that this is the test. Everybody comes to \nus saying, you two big spenders are going to spend all the money around \nthe place.\n  The Senator from West Virginia and I have the job of trying to urge \nthe Senate to get this bill to conference. As I said yesterday, I would \nlike to see just a motion to go to third reading and take the bill we \nbrought out of committee to conference, and bring the bill back by \nTuesday so it might even get to the President before July 4. But under \nthe procedure we are now following, I seriously doubt this bill will be \non the President's desk before the July 4 recess, which is a travesty.\n\n  This amendment adds to that delay because, I can assure you, the \nHouse will not accept this amendment. It is going to be opposed by the \nPresident and add to the bundle of sticks already there that brought \nabout this threat of a veto.\n  So I want to ask the Senate to support the leadership of our \ncommittee and refuse to accept this amendment because it is not an \nemergency, to vote against this concept of waiving the point of order \nthat the Senator from West Virginia is compelled to make. He, as I do, \nbelieves very much in children. We believe in providing the money that \nis necessary.\n  I am alarmed at the process that is underway whereby as we increase \nFederal spending, the State and local entities decrease theirs, so \nthere is no net benefit to the beneficiaries we are trying to assist by \nbringing some additional Federal money into the areas previously \noccupied totally by State and local funds.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is an emergency. If we do not \nprovide the resources to these States, we are going to see an increased \nnumber of children who are not going to get the help they need.\n  I will point out, before we get all excited about this being an \nemergency, there are a number of items that are included as emergencies \nin this supplemental: National Park Service construction at $18 \nmillion; fire claims for New Mexico for $80 million. I am going to \nsupport that and vote for it. But let's not leave the impression this \nis only for homeland security. I will not go into the several hundred \nmillion dollars for additional items in the bill.\n  If we are going to take care of the fire claims in the Southwest and \nprovide funding for the National Park Service, I think we ought to \nprovide money for children to go to school in the summer. That is an \nemergency, too. I hope that we would do that.\n\n[[Page S5002]]\n\n  The principal money that was increased last year starts in July and \nis for the next fiscal year. These schools and many of the school \ndistricts did not understand the emergency. But the requirements we put \non the schools were not only for the poor children, they were for every \nchild in this country. We ought to be concerned about the emergency \nthat every child in this country is facing when they are being knocked \noff assistance to meet certain standards which our bill last year \nrequired them to meet. That is why this is an emergency and why I think \nit is important.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia controls 16\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time does the opposition have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I know it is easy to point to a bill that is \na $31 billion bill. We increased that bill yesterday by $393 million. \nSo it is $31,393,000,000.\n  Now, it is easy to look at that, easy to pick at little items--pick, \npick--but I think that if those items are considered and studied and \nall the facts are known, they are justified. They are justified.\n  We do the best we can with a big bill. I do not take a back seat to \nanybody in support for the people of this country: the education of our \nchildren, young people, and adults.\n  Last year, the President requested $44.5 billion for discretionary \neducation programs. This level was woefully inadequate. Through \nnegotiations with the White House, I was able to reach agreement on a \nceiling for discretionary spending that was high enough to provide a \n$4.4 billion increase for our Nation's education programs.\n  Following that agreement with the White House, I provided, as \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, an allocation to the Labor-\nHHS Education Subcommittee that was large enough for Chairman Harkin to \napprove a $4.4 billion increase over the President's request and $6.7 \nbillion, or 16 percent, above the prior fiscal year.\n  So if you are looking for ``Mr. Education'' around here, I will stay \nin the ring; I will fight for that as hard as anybody else. I got my \neducation the hard way. I started out in a two-room schoolhouse in \nsouthern West Virginia. I graduated in 1934 in a class of 28 persons. I \nwas the valedictorian. If there had been 29 persons, I might not have \nbeen valedictorian. But it was 16 years after I completed high school \nbefore I was able to start college.\n\n  So don't talk to me about education. You are looking at somebody who \ntypifies the effort to study and to learn and the effort to help others \nto learn.\n  I went to school 10 years at night in this city to get my law degree, \nnot that I ever expected to be a lawyer, but I wanted to learn. I am \nstill learning.\n  I chose this past Sunday to travel miles into the mountains of West \nVirginia to address a commencement. I had several commencement \ninvitations from West Virginia high schools and colleges. I chose one. \nI chose to address the commencement at a high school in Pickens, WV, \nnear Helvetia, a little town that was founded by Swiss immigrants in \nthe early 1800s.\n  How many students were in that whole school? Thirty-seven from \nkindergarten through the senior class. How many students were in the \nsenior class? Three--not 300; two young men and one young woman.\n  Why did I choose them? I wanted to go to that little school to let \nthose little people back there in the hills, who might feel that they \nare off the beaten path, that somebody was interested, somebody was \npaying attention to them.\n  That little school has won several of the Statewide academic awards. \nThey don't go in big for athletics--I don't, either--they concentrate \non academics, and they won several awards. A little school with one \nten-thousandths of the whole school population in West Virginia has won \n11 percent of the academic awards in that State.\n  So I am for education. I want to help our young people. Years ago, I \nfought for summer jobs for young people in this District of Columbia so \nthey could work and, hopefully, stay out of trouble.\n  So I can shout as loud as anybody, and I can believe what I am saying \nas conscientiously as can anybody else. I am doing what I can for \neducation. Education is one of my priorities; it always has been. But \nthis is a different bill. We are talking about the safety of young \npeople who attend schools at Pickens, Sophia, or here in Washington, \nDC. We are talking about the safety of people.\n  This administration tells us that we might see a repeat of what \nhappened on September 11; it is almost certain.\n  This bill needs to pass. We need to get it to conference. We need to \nget it to the President. And I hope that the President will not veto \nit. It is a worthwhile bill--not that the amendment that the \ndistinguished Senator is proposing is not worthwhile. I support that \namendment but not on this bill--not on this bill.\n  I have a job to do here, and it is to try to get the bill through.\n  How many minutes remain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes remain.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the chair, and I yield the floor for now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Gregg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the chairman of the committee. I rise in \nopposition to this amendment which is obviously well intentioned but \nunfortunately is not affordable at this time, and certainly not on this \nbill. It is inconsistent with some of what we have already done in the \narea of summer school education.\n  First, the reason it is inconsistent is that there is no way this \nbill is going to pass in time for this money to get out for the summer \nschool activities. As a practical matter, although it would be a nice \nvote and obviously would be politically attractive, its impact on \nsummer school will be negligible, if any at all, because the money \nsimply will not get there.\n  Secondly, it is important to remember that in the ESEA bill, we have \ngiven the authority to local school districts to spend title I money \nfor the purposes of summer school, which makes a great deal of sense, \nand the President has increased funding for title I by $1.6 billion \nlast year and asked for another $1 billion this year. Those are \nsignificant dollar increases.\n  If a local school district desires, it can use those moneys for the \npurpose of extending the school year or aggressively promoting summer \nschool. The money is in place, already appropriated. As a practical \nmatter, it is following a path which we set under ESEA, which was the \nbill we passed, No Child Left Behind, and is part of that entire \npackage.\n  Although this additional money is certainly well intentioned, I don't \nsee it having much effect because it is not going to get to the schools \nby this summer because the money will not be available in that \ntimeframe.\n  Secondly, we have already funded these programs through the dramatic \nincrease in title I which has come about as a result of the President's \nleadership.\n  For that reason, I oppose the amendment. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will yield the remaining time to \nmyself.\n  While taking care of the war front, we also must take care of the \nhome front. Summer school is an emergency for 300,000 schoolchildren \nwho may not graduate without this amendment. It is just as deserving as \nother emergency items in this bill. There are other emergency items: \nNational Park Service construction, $18 million; Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, department management, $7 million; Forest Service capital \nimprovements, $4 million; fire claims, $80 million. These are all under\n\n[[Page S5003]]\n\nthe emergency provisions. I believe $150 million for summer school \nprograms for children is as deserving as those programs.\n  In the end, this is about families, it is about children, it is about \nwho we are as a nation. Can we protect our interests abroad and also \nhelp our children here at home?\n  I know a point of order will be made. I hope we would add this as an \namendment to meeting emergency requirements such as those other items I \nindicated have been included. Children, summer school programs, ought \nto be included as well.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time, \nor I will withhold the time depending on the opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require.\n  Mr. President, the supplemental also contains $1 billion for the Pell \ngrant shortfall. That is a key education program. I want the record to \nshow that the bill is certainly not devoid of moneys that are to be \nspent in the interest of education.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts like some of my time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I think we have had a good \ndiscussion. I am prepared to yield back the time. I am very grateful to \nthe Senator. We are prepared to yield back the time and move ahead. I \nwould retain that time if others were going to speak, but I am prepared \nto move to the vote on what will probably be a point of order. If the \nSenator cares to, I will yield back my time, if those in opposition \nwill yield back their time.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time does the Senator from Massachusetts have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. That would be a good tradeoff.\n  I consider the Senator from Massachusetts to be not only a fine \nSenator, but he is my friend. He is very interested in fostering \neducation and providing good legislation and good funding. If he wants \nanother 3 minutes, I will be glad to yield him 3 minutes of my time. I \nam ready to make a point of order, but I don't want to do it without \ngiving the Senator or any other Senator who wishes to speak time on his \nbehalf.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I mentioned, we are prepared to move ahead with the \nresolution. I will yield back my 30 seconds. I understand when all time \nhas expired, then a point of order will be made. We will let the Senate \nmake a decision. I thank the Senator very much for extending me the \ntime. We have had other Senators who have spoken. I think we are \nprepared to move ahead.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. Mr. President, I am constrained to recall a \nlittle poem which I think the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nwill like. I like it very much. I think we are both interested in the \nsame cause, the education of our young people.\n  As a Senator who has great-grandchildren, I certainly hope for the \nbest for these great-grandchildren and the great-grandchildren of all \nother great-grandparents in the country.\n  I guess I will close my opposition to this amendment with this brief \nrecapitulation of verse:\n\n     I took a piece of plastic clay\n     And idly fashioned it one day--\n     And as my fingers pressed it, still\n     It moved and yielded to my will.\n\n     I came again when days were past\n     The bit of clay was hard at last.\n     The form I gave it, still it bore,\n     And I could change that form no more!\n\n     I took a piece of living clay,\n     And gently fashioned it day by day,\n     And molded with my power and art\n     A young child's soft and yielding heart.\n\n     I came again when years were gone:\n     It was a man I looked upon.\n     He still that early impress bore,\n     And I could fashion it never more.\n\n  I think that pretty well sums up my feeling toward our young people, \nour children, the education of our young people. Now is the time, the \nformative period in their youth when we can shape and mold them to our \nwill. Now is the best time for the learning process, while they are \nyoung and they don't have the other cares that they will have later.\n  I compliment the distinguished Senator for his offering of this \namendment. I oppose it with apologies. But I can't help it. This bill \nis not the bill on which we should attach this amendment, however \nworthy the amendment.\n  With those apologies, I will make the point of order. I yield back my \ntime.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if I may have 30 seconds, I thank my \nfriend from West Virginia. He can make a speech in favor of education, \nname every one of his elementary and secondary schoolteachers, give all \nof their background, and convince this body of the importance of \nfunding. I am looking forward to standing with him, hopefully shoulder \nto shoulder, as we move on into these appropriations to try to do what \nneeds to be done for the children of this country. I always enjoy the \nchance of working with him. My time has expired, I understand.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. I assure him we will be standing \nshoulder to shoulder in many instances.\n  Mr. President, section 205 of H. Con. Res 290, the fiscal year 2001 \nconcurrent resolution on the budget, created a point of order against \nan emergency designation on nondefense spending. The amendment contains \nnondefense spending with an emergency designation.\n  Pursuant to section 205 of H. Con. Res 290, the fiscal year 2001 \nconcurrent resolution on the budget, I make a point of order against \nthe emergency designation contained in the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I move to waive section 205 of H. Con. \nRes 290, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2001 \nfor purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: The ``yea'' vote \nwill be interpreted as waiving the Budget Act for the purpose of this \namendment, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A ``yea'' vote is in favor of waiving the \nBudget Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nTorricelli) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell).

Budget evasion point of order.''.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator \nFeingold, Senator Chafee, Senator Kerry, Senator Voinovich, and Senator \nMcCain.\n  Essentially, this amendment does two things. It reinstitutes the caps \nand it reinstitutes the pay-go language. It puts back in place \nbudgetary discipline as we move through this process of appropriations \nbills.\n  Recently, we have seen the budget discipline within the Congress has \neroded rather dramatically. We have seen the Agriculture bill and the \ntrade adjustment bill both adding massive new entitlement programs. We \nknow as we look down the road we will have very significant costs in \nthe area of fighting terrorism and in the area of natural defense. It \nis absolutely critical in this context that we start to put some budget \ndiscipline in place.\n  We are facing, regrettably, a deficit, something we hoped would not \nhappen, but it has happened as a result of the economic slowdown and as \na result of the effects of terrorism. The deficit is growing rather \nradically, unfortunately. Our job as legislators is to make sure we do \nnot aggravate that deficit by not being fiscally responsible as we \nbring forward appropriations bills and other bills which might have \nentitlement spending included.\n  Unfortunately, the disciplining mechanism which actually exists out \nthere, or has existed for the last 5 or 6 years, is about to lapse; \nthat is, the ability to have a fixed number beyond which if we are \ngoing to spend we have to have a supermajority to do that. That is \ncalled caps.\n  The second budget discipline, which is pay-go, essentially says if \nyou are going to add a new entitlement program or you are going to cut \ntaxes during a period, especially of deficits, you must offset that \nevent so that it becomes a budget-neutral event that also lapses.\n  This language which Senator Feingold and I have put together and \nwhich failed on a very close vote in the Budget Committee, a tie vote, \nin fact--it would have passed with one more vote--reinstitutes the same \ntraditional approach--so 5-year caps, 5-year pay-go, and, as a result, \nput in place some discipline.\n  There are some subtleties to our bill about which I want to be open. \nSome people have looked at them and said they are interested in them \nand some said they are concerned about them. One is the way we enforce \nthis mechanism by saying the bill which exceeds the caps allocated to \nit by the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the 302(b) \nallocation, that if a bill exceeds that cap, that bill is subject to a \npoint of order on specific parts of that bill, depending on what part \nof that bill is unable to be sustained with 60 votes. So it becomes a \ntargeted approach of trying to bring that bill back into proper \nperspective as far as appropriations and the budget are concerned.\n  Second, the basis for the cap is the Democratic budget proposal as it \npassed the committee. So the numbers are for the 5 years. Those were \nthe gross numbers. Those numbers are higher than those of the President \nthis year by $9 billion, but over the 5-year period they are actually \nabout the same as the President's number. In fact, I think they are \nwithin a couple of billion dollars of each other. As a practical \nmatter, there is a path toward maintaining fiscal responsibility.\n  If we do not do this, if we do not put back in place caps and pay-go \nmechanisms, we will have no budget discipline in this Congress, and, as \na result, we will dramatically aggravate the deficit which, of course, \nimpacts a lot of important issues, but especially impacts Social \nSecurity.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will support this effort. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I rise today to join with my colleague from New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg, as well as my colleagues Senators Chafee, \nKerry, Voinovich, and McCain to offer this amendment, which I believe \nis a commonsense budget process amendment, the Budget Enforcement Act \nof 2002.\n  Let me especially thank the Senator from New Hampshire, who has been \na terrific leader on this issue. As he said, we made a real effort in \nthe Budget Committee, had an excellent debate with the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and only lost on a 9-to-9 vote. We were hoping \nfor a good result today, but we are both devoted to returning some \nbudget rules because we both believe this is one of the main reasons we \nwere able to have some success in the 1990s in bringing the budget \nunder control and actually getting to the point where we had a surplus \nfor a brief period of time.\n  In the 1990s, we took fiscally responsible actions that led to \nbalancing the budget in 1999 and 2000, without using Social Security, \nwhich was a tremendous achievement. Last year, the Government returned \nto the bad habit of using the Social Security surplus to fund other \nGovernment activities. I believe we have to put an end to that \npractice. The Government will not have these Social Security surpluses \nto use forever. In the next decade, the baby boom generation will begin \nto retire in large numbers. Starting in 2016, Social Security will \nstart redeeming the bonds that it holds, and the non-Social Security \ngovernment will have to start paying for those bonds from non-Social \nSecurity surpluses.\n  The bottom line is that, starting in 2016, the Government will have \nto show restraint in the non-Social Security budget so we can pay the \nSocial Security benefits that Americans have already earned or will \nhave already earned by that time.\n  That is why we cannot continue to enact either tax cuts or spending \nmeasures that push the Government further into deficit. Before we enter \nnew obligations, we need to make sure we have the resources to make our \nNation's commitment to our seniors under Social Security. I believe we \nneed to return to the priority of protecting the Social Security trust \nfund. We should, as President Bush said in a March 2001 radio address, \n``keep the promise of Social Security and keep the Government from \nraiding the Social Security surplus.''\n  Yes, September 11 changes priorities and how the Government spends \nmoney, but September 11 does not change the oncoming requirements of \nSocial Security. As an economist has said: Demographics is destiny; we \ncan either prepare for that destiny or we can fail. To get the \nGovernment out of the business of using Social Security surpluses to \nfund other Government spending, we need to strengthen our budget \nprocess. That is what this amendment does and that is why we urge our \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The history of budget process changes teaches that realistic budget \nenforcement mechanisms work. The\n\n[[Page S5006]]\n\nBudget Enforcement Act of 1990, enacted with bipartisan support, with a \nDemocratic Congress and a Republican President, deserves much credit \nfor helping to keep the Government on that path to reduce and \neventually eliminate the deficit.\n  A central feature of the 1990 act was the creation of caps on \nappropriated spending. Of course, in recent years, Congress has blown \nthrough those caps, when those caps were at unrealistic levels, and \nwhen the Government was running surpluses. But in most years of their \nhistory, appropriations caps helped to constrain the politically \nunderstandable appetite to spend without limit.\n  Congress has repeatedly endorsed the idea of spending caps. Congress \nrenewed and extended the caps in the budget process laws of 1993 and \n1997. And six of the last eight budget resolutions have set enforceable \nspending caps. If budget numbers are to have any meaning--if they are \nnot to be just wishes and prayers--then we need to have enforcement.\n  Our amendment would reinstate and extend the caps on discretionary \nspending, and would do so at a realistic baseline. It would simply set \nthose levels at those in the budget resolution reported by the Budget \nCommittee on March 22. And our amendment maintains, without change, the \nseparate subcaps created in the Violent Crime Act of 1994 and the \nTransportation Equity Act of 1998.\n  Like the 1990 budget law that it extends, our amendment would apply \nbudget enforcement to entitlements and taxes. It would extend the pay-\nas-you-go enforcement mechanism. All parts of the budget would thus be \ntreated fairly.\n  Our amendment would also improve the points of order that enforce the \ncaps and pay-as-you-go enforcement. It would allow Senators to raise a \npoint of order against specific provisions that cause the caps or pay-\nas-you-go discipline to be violated. This part of the amendment will \nwork very much like the important Byrd rule that governs the \nreconciliation process, which is of course named after the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  Under our amendment, if a piece of legislation violates the caps or \npay-as-you-go discipline, any Senator could raise a point of order and \nforce a vote on any individual provision that contributes to the budget \nviolation. If the point of order is not waived, then the provision \nwould be stricken from the legislation.\n\n  The amendment would also shut back-door ways around the caps and pay-\nas-you-go enforcement, by requiring 60 votes to change the caps, alter \nthe balances of the pay-as-you-go scorecard, or direct scorekeeping.\n  Our amendment would limit the exceptions to the point of order \nagainst emergency designations in the fiscal year 2001 budget \nresolution, so that all emergencies would be treated alike. Our \namendment would thus treat emergencies as they were treated in the text \nof that budget resolution when the Senate passed it on April 7, 2000, \nrather than in the watered-down form it had when it came back from \nconference with the House of Representatives.\n  Finally, our amendment would extend for 5 years the requirement for \n60 votes to waive existing points of order that enforce the \nCongressional Budget Act. The 60-vote requirement that gives these \npoints of order teeth expires on September 30 this year under current \nlaw.\n  This is sensible budget process reform, in keeping with the best, \nmost effective budget process enforcement that we have enacted in the \npast. It would make a significant contribution toward ending the \npractice of using the Social Security surplus to fund other government \nactivities. That is something that we simply must do, for our seniors, \nand for those in coming generations who will otherwise be stuck with \nthe bill. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the \namendment be printed in the Record. \n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Gregg-Feingold-Chafee-Kerry Amendment--Budget Enforcement Act of 2002\n\n       Appropriations Caps--The amendment would reinstate and \n     extend for 5 years the caps on discretionary spending, keyed \n     to the levels in the budget resolution reported by the Budget \n     Committee. Points of order and the threat of across-the-board \n     cuts would continue to provide enforcement.\n       Pay-as-You-Go Entitlements and Taxes--The amendment would \n     reinstate and extend the pay-as-you-go discipline that \n     controls entitlement spending and tax law changes. Points of \n     order and the threat of across-the-board cuts would continue \n     to provide enforcement.\n       Point of Order Against Specific Provisions that Violate the \n     Caps or Pay-as-You-Go--If legislation violated the caps or \n     pay-as-you-go enforcement, the amendment would allow any \n     Senator to raise a point of order against (and thus force a \n     vote on) any individual provision that contributed to the \n     budget violation. If the Senate did not waive the point of \n     order, then the provision would be stricken from the \n     legislation. This point of order would work just like the \n     Byrd Rule against extraneous matter in reconciliation \n     legislation.\n       Guarding Against Budget Evasions--The amendment would shut \n     back-door ways around the caps and pay-as-you-go enforcement, \n     by requiring 60 votes to change the discretionary caps, alter \n     the balances of the pay-as-you-go scorecard, or direct \n     scorekeeping.\n       Extending Existing Points of Order--The amendment would \n     extend for 5 years the requirement for 60 votes to waive \n     existing points of order that enforce the Congressional \n     Budget Act. The 60-vote requirement that gives these points \n     of order teeth expires on September 30 this year under \n     current law.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, time \nwill be charged proportionately against the Senators who control time.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. \nChafee.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I rise today in support of the amendment \nsponsored by Senators Gregg, Feingold, Kerry, Voinovich, McCain, and \nmyself.\n  This is a commonsense amendment that extends existing appropriations \ncaps and pay-as-you-go rules for another 5 years. In addition, the \namendment strengthens some budget enforcement mechanisms.\n  The Senators that have spoken before me have done an admirable job of \nexplaining the provisions in the bill. I want to stress the necessity \nof fiscal discipline.\n  Every day constituents and experts talk to me about spending programs \nthat are vitally important to them, asking me to support increased \nspending. Just as often I hear from people who want to do away with \nsome tax, or lower a tax. They all have excellent arguments, and there \nis much merit to the initiatives they would like me to support. The \nproblem is that if I were to support each of them, I would be \nsupporting an agenda of cutting taxes and increasing spending. Such an \nagenda would directly result in deficit spending, which would increase \nthe already enormous Federal debt.\n  In good conscience, I cannot support such an agenda. Therefore, often \nI must tell visitors that I cannot be supportive of their cherished \ninitiative. As all in this body know, telling constituents that you do \nnot support their project is a difficult job, especially when the \nreason that I give them is that ``The money just isn't there.'' Because \nthey respond by saying, ``The money always seems to be there.''\n  The problem is that they are right. In a time of war, and deficits, \nwe have approved new tax cuts, which I opposed. We are contemplating \npermanently extending other tax cuts, which I will oppose. As if that \nwere not enough, we also have added a raft of new spending--including \nthe farm bill and the stimulus--which I opposed. There is no end in \nsight.\n  We have gone from record surpluses straight back to deficits. We \napproved a massive tax cut last year, which limits the amount of money \navailable. We know that the war on terrorism will be very costly. We \nknow we are facing unprecedented demographic changes that will result \nin staggering costs to sustain Social Security and Medicare. Added to \nall that, we have a $6 trillion debt, which costs $200 billion in \ninterest payments each year. And we practice no restraint. We continue \nto spend money, deepening the hole we are in.\n  This amendment is a step towards reestablishing fiscal discipline in \nthis body. It alone will not ensure the return of balanced budgets--but \nit is a step in the right direction. Therefore, I\n\n[[Page S5007]]\n\nurge all my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 8 minutes; \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, 9.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask the Chair to advise me when I have \nconsumed 10 minutes.\n  Madam President, the amendment offered by our colleagues is well \nintentioned. In fact, I share many of the goals they have enunciated \ntoday. We have an enormously serious problem with the fiscal condition \nof the country. This chart shows that we are now headed for a return to \nan era of deficits that is going to continue long into the future. This \nchart goes back to 1992, back to the time when we were deep in deficit. \nMany of us know the extraordinary efforts that were required to lift us \nout of deficit, back into surplus, which we enjoyed for just a few \nshort years.\n  Last year, a series of decisions were made on a massive tax cut. \nThen, of course, the attack on the country occurred that led to \nincreased spending for defense and homeland security. At the same time, \nthere was an economic slowdown. We experienced those three events--the \nmassive tax cut, the attack on this country that led to increased \nspending, and, of course, the economic slowdown. Those three, led by \nthe tax cut--the tax cut was the biggest contributor to returning to \ndeficit--has plunged us back into deficit by very large amounts that \nare going to continue the rest of the decade. That is the circumstance \nwe face.\n  The proposal by our colleagues has a very serious set of problems \nattached to it. They have gone to what is an enforcement mechanism that \nwe have seen in the past. If you liked Gramm-Rudman, you will love \nGregg-Feingold because they have returned to the notion of enforcement \nbased on projections; not what actually happens but based on \nprojections of what will happen.\n  This is a fatal flaw. In fact, it could undermine the very budget \ndiscipline they are seeking to support. Have we forgotten what happened \nunder Gramm-Rudman? Have we forgotten the endless game playing and \ngimmicks that resulted from Gramm-Rudman?\n  Have we forgotten the rosy scenario? Let us go back to 1990 and look \nat what could happen under the proposal of our colleagues to now again \nrely on forecasts and projections rather than real results.\n  Back in 1990, OMB told us at the beginning of the year that we were \ngoing to have a $100 billion deficit. They were right on track with the \ndeficit reduction plan that was in place. That is what they said.\n  What actually occurred? It wasn't a $100 billion deficit. It was a \n$221 billion deficit.\n  All projections, all false; all that lead to a circumstance under the \nproposal from the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from \nWisconsin that could lead a Congress to have more tax cuts, more \nspending, based on a projection that everything was OK. Later in the \nyear, when reality sets in, their answer is to only deal with half of \nthe equation that leads to budget deficits. Budget deficits are a \nresult of an imbalance between spending and revenue. Their only answer \nis on the spending side of the equation. That is, I think, a mistake.\n  Let us look at what it took to get us back into balance. Back in the \n1980s--here is the blue line, the revenue line, and the red line is the \nspending line. We can see for a very long period that spending exceeded \nrevenues, and by large amounts. The result was a quadrupling of the \ndebt of the United States.\n  What happened in 1993? We passed a plan to cut spending and to raise \nrevenue. It was that combination that led us back to fiscal \nresponsibility, that led us back to balance, that eliminated deficits, \nand that reduced debt.\n  Have we forgotten that worked?\n  I hope very much that we don't go down this slippery slope of a whole \nnew enforcement mechanism based on projections rather than real \nresults. That way leads to real trouble.\n  In addition to those problems, our friends who are coming before us \nwith this amendment--well intentioned as it is--I think do \nunderestimate the uncertainty of our time.\n  When this headline appeared on September 12, everything changed. This \nheadline says, ``U.S. Attacked.''\n  We all remember that somber day when there were two strikes at the \nWorld Trade Center and passenger airliners turned into flying bombs, \nand what happened shortly thereafter with the attack on the Pentagon. \nThat changed everything. We are now in a period of extraordinary \nuncertainty.\n  Here are recent headlines that talk about uncertainty. This is the \nVice President of the United States warning of future attacks:\n\n       Possibility of another al-Qaida strike ``almost certain,'' \n     the Vice President says.\n\n  In this circumstance, we should not be tying the hands of the \nCongress and the administration for the next 5 years. None of us are \nwise enough to know what demands may be made on this country. None of \nus can know what is in the next 24 hours, much less the next 5 years.\n  We ought to be ready to respond to any attack and any strike against \nthis country. We ought not to be in a fiscal straitjacket that makes a \nresponse more difficult.\n  It is not just the Vice President of the United States. This is the \nhead of the FBI: ``Warns of Suicide Bombs.''\n\n       Calls U.S. attacks akin to those on Israel inevitable.\n\n  Our friends who are sponsoring this amendment will say we have a way \naround that for defense spending. We only have a simple majority vote \nfor additional defense spending.\n  Those are not typical defense expenditures that are being used to \nrespond to terrorist attacks. Defense is part of it, but another part \nis called ``homeland security.'' Homeland security funding is not off \nin the defense budget. It is in the budget of the FBI, it is in the \nbudget of the INS, it is in the budget of the FAA, it is in the budget \nof the Transportation Department, and it is in the budget of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to respond to attacks and to \nbioterrorism. The money needed to defend this Nation is not just in the \ndefense budget.\n  Have we forgotten the response of this Congress to the attacks of \nSeptember 11? Was it just defense spending that we increased? \nAbsolutely not. We also responded with money for homeland security \nbecause we understood a terrorist threat to this country could not be \njust defended in the traditional way.\n  The uncertainty goes to other areas as well. This is a headline of \nTuesday of this week in USA Today:\n\n       Nuclear Clash Would Batter World Financial Markets.\n\n  They are talking about what would happen if a nuclear exchange \noccurred between India and Pakistan. They alert us to the fact that it \nwould batter world financial markets.\n\n       Nuclear war would spark a sell-off and send world stock \n     markets tumbling.\n\n  This is a period of uncertainty, and we ought not to be tying the \nhands of the Congress being able to respond.\n  The uncertainty is not just on the spending side of the equation. It \nis also on the revenue side of the equation.\n  This is a headline of April 26 in the Los Angeles Times:\n\n       Lower Tax Receipts Could Double the United States Budget \n     Deficit . . .\n\n  In this year alone.\n  I agree with that analysis. I think we are headed for a budget \ndeficit this year of perhaps $160 billion and next year an even larger \nbudget deficit.\n  That is why enforcement provisions are critically important. But they \nhave to be enforcement provisions that will actually work and not make \nthe situation worse.\n  I wish to announce my intention now to offer the budget enforcement \nprovisions that have worked, and to do so after the disposition of this \namendment.\n  Let me add one other observation about the amendment that is being \noffered.\n  The Gregg-Feingold proposal extends the statutory pay-as-you-go \nenforcement procedures for 5 years, but it substantially amends the \ncurrent pay-go\n\n[[Page S5008]]\n\nlaw to allow direct spending increases or tax cuts to be enacted \nwithout being paid for if the Office of Management and Budget projects \nthat there will be a surplus without Social Security.\n  That is the Achilles' heel of this amendment. It is based on \nprojections and not real results.\n  We have been down that road before. It was a disaster for fiscal \nresponsibility. Let us not repeat it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise in support of the Gregg-Feingold-\nKerry amendment. I believe there is no perfect solution. There is no \nperfect answer to the problem we face. Perhaps some may argue that the \ncaps for the first year are too high. Perhaps if I had written this \namendment I might have made them lower. The fact is, without this \namendment, there is no fiscal discipline. There is no fiscal discipline \nthat can be imposed on a process which has lurched out of control.\n\n  To state the obvious, we have gone from estimates of $50 or $60 \nbillion surpluses at the beginning of this year, to somewhere around \n$100 billion, $150 billion deficits, and we have not even passed the \nfirst appropriations bill. And if this emergency supplemental, which is \n$4 billion higher than the President's, is any indicator, we are going \nto be in a sea of red ink.\n  I think it is a bipartisan effort. It extends discretionary spending \ncaps and the pay-go requirement for entitlement expansions and tax \ncuts.\n  These mechanisms have helped to impose fiscal discipline since they \nwere first enacted in 1990, but they obviously expire this year. It \nwould be ironic and irresponsible to let the caps and the pay-go expire \njust when the budget is punching back into deficit.\n  There are a lot of organizations around the country. One that I \nrespect, and I know my colleague from New Hampshire respects, is the \nConcord Coalition.\n  The Concord Coalition is chaired by former U.S. Senators Warren \nRudman and Bob Kerrey. They serve as the Concord Coalition's cochairs. \nAnd former Secretary of Commerce Pete Peterson serves as president.\n  They issued some grades. They are a fiscal responsibility \norganization. And the Concord Coalition just released this report on \nfiscal responsibility:\n  Overall: Progress toward short, medium, and long-term fiscal \nresponsibility, D;\n  Short-Term: Enacting measures that maintain fiscal responsibility, \nC-;\n  Medium-Term: Enacting measures that are fiscally responsible over the \nnext 10 years, D-;\n  Long-Term: Enacting measures that deal with the entitlement financing \ngap and ensure fiscal sustainability, D-.\n  They begin their report by saying:\n\n       Crocodile tears are flowing over the return of budget \n     deficits--now likely to exceed $100 billion this year and \n     next. Nearly everyone says they want the dip back into red \n     ink to be brief. But almost no one is willing to give up \n     anything to ensure that result. Indeed, the attitude seems to \n     be: if deficits are back, let's make the most of them and \n     blame someone else for the result.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The bottom line--obscured but not altered by the events of \n     2001--is that our nation's greatest fiscal challenge remains \n     the need to finance the huge unfunded retirement benefits and \n     health care costs of a permanently older population.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this release be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Concord Coalition, June 2002]\n\n        The Concord Coalition's Report on Fiscal Responsibility\n\n\n     Deficits are back, and the budget bazaar is open for business\n\n       It is now clear that the appropriate loosening of fiscal \n     policy undertaken in response to the mild recession and \n     devastating terrorist attacks of 2001 is turning into a \n     headlong retreat from long-term fiscal responsibility. \n     Crocodile tears are flowing over the return of budget \n     deficits--now likely to exceed $100 billion this year and \n     next. Nearly everyone says they want the dip back into red \n     ink to be brief. But almost no one is willing to give up \n     anything to ensure that result. Indeed, the attitude seems to \n     be: if deficits are back, let's make the most of them and \n     blame someone else for the result.\n       Tax cut advocates, defense hawks, farmers, educators, \n     health care providers and beneficiaries, transportation \n     planners, and veterans groups all insist that deficits are no \n     reason to scale back their claims on a surplus that no longer \n     exists. Each interest group has a grassroots constituency and \n     an army of lobbyists. And each is prepared to threaten \n     political retribution if every dime of its wish list is not \n     funded. This may be an attractive short-term political \n     strategy, but it's a terrible long-term fiscal policy.\n       The bottom line--obscured but not altered by the events of \n     2001--is that our nation's greatest fiscal challenge remains \n     the need to finance the huge unfunded retirement benefits and \n     health care costs of a permanently older population. The Baby \n     Boomers' retirement costs will begin to impact the budget in \n     just six years, and there is no plan for dealing with them \n     other than to run up the debt. Surpluses would help by either \n     reducing the debt, which provides needed savings and fiscal \n     flexibility, or by providing resources to help pay the \n     transition costs of Social Security and Medicare reform. \n     Deficits can be acceptable as a short-term fiscal stimulus, \n     but returning to chronic deficit spending would make the \n     long-term challenge far more difficult.\n       Washington policymakers should focus on regaining budget \n     surpluses as soon as is practicable. Instead, the recent \n     breakdown in fiscal discipline, the refusal to acknowledge \n     many likely expenses, and the wavering commitment to any \n     particular goal--be it a unified balanced budget or balance \n     excluding Social Security--signal that a prolonged period of \n     deficits far in excess of official projections is probable. \n     The question now being tested is whether the political will \n     exist to reverse this trend. The preliminary answer is a \n     decided: no.\n\n\n                 The Fiscal Responsibility Report Care\n\n       The Concord Coalition has graded Washington's performance \n     on fiscal policy in three key time frames: the short-term \n     (next 1-2 years), the medium-term (next 10 years), and the \n     long-term (beyond the next 10 years). Each category is graded \n     on a scale of A to F, with A signifying great improvement, \n     and F signifying great harm. There is a necessary overlap in \n     the consequences of policy decisions throughout the time \n     frames.\n\n                           Category and Grade\n\n       Overall: Progress toward fiscal responsibility: D.\n       Short-Term: Enacting measures that maintain fiscal \n     responsibility over the next 1-2 years: C-.\n       Medium-Term: Enacting measures that are fiscally \n     responsible over the next 10 years: D.\n       Long-Term: Enacting measures that deal with the entitlement \n     financing gap and ensure fiscal sustainability: D-.\n\n\n                          SHORT-TERM GRADE: C-\n\n       For reasons largely beyond the control of policymakers, the \n     short-term outlook has gone from projected surpluses in \n     excess of $300 billion to probable deficits in excess of $100 \n     billion. (See table on Page 4.) Fiscal policy decisions in \n     the current environment are more difficult than usual because \n     actions to stimulate the economy and beef-up security, while \n     legitimate in the short-term, create the risk of higher \n     deficits in the long-term.\n       Given the circumstances, the test of fiscal responsibility \n     is not whether the budget falls into deficit for a year or \n     two but whether actions that subtract from the bottom line \n     are carefully designed to meet legitimate immediate needs \n     while minimizing costs in later years.\n       Even using this lenient standard, policymakers rate a \n     polite C minus for the short-term. The ``economic stimulus'' \n     bill enacted in March came to the rescue of an economy that \n     was already recovering on its own. And even if a stimulus was \n     justified as insurance, there was no need to extend the \n     bill's costly accelerated depreciation provision for three \n     years--well beyond any immediate need. Moreover, the \n     assumption that the depreciation break will be allowed to \n     ``sunset'' in September of 2004--two months before Election \n     Day--is absurd. This provision will likely become a permanent \n     new tax break at a cost of around $200 billion over the next \n     decade.\n       As for spending, President Bush acknowledged in his Budget \n     Message that the government ``will have new bills to pay.'' \n     Paying these bills is not fiscally irresponsible. What is \n     fiscally irresponsible is refusing to make trade-offs or \n     using the current crisis atmosphere as a smoke screen for a \n     generalized spending spree. Particularly susceptible to \n     unscrutinized growth are the defense budget and the new \n     loosely defined category of homeland security. Unfortunately, \n     the President's budget proposed very few trade-offs and \n     Congress has shown no inclination to accept any of them.\n       The appropriations process is just getting started so it \n     cannot be said that the short-term situation has turned into \n     a fiscal rout. But the signs are not promising. Congress has \n     failed to adopt a budget resolution, failed to agree on FY \n     2002 supplemental spending, failed to extend expiring budget \n     enforcement mechanisms, and failed to deal with the statutory \n     debt limit in a timely or straightforward manner. Finally, \n     the specter of ``rosy scenario'' is back, with the \n     Administration (OMB) and the House using baseline projections \n     that are more optimistic than CBO numbers by $35 billion in \n     2003 and $180 billion over the next five years. If these \n     issues are not resolved quickly the result\n\n[[Page S5009]]\n\n     could be a huge year-end omnibus appropriations bill--in \n     other words, fiscal chaos.\n\n\n                          MEDIUM-TERM GRADE: D\n\n       More harmful than the return of budget deficits in the \n     short-term is the fact that President Bush and Congress have \n     done very little to prevent deficits from extending well into \n     the decade. The rapid disappearance of the projected $3.1 \n     trillion 10-year non-Social Security surplus should be a \n     yellow light of caution for policymakers advocating further \n     tax cuts and new entitlements. But their response has been to \n     step on the gas. The Concord Coalition gives Washington \n     policymakers a medium-term grade of D.\n       The new farm bill, if graded alone, would surely warrant an \n     F. The bill increases spending by $86 billion over 10 years \n     and reverses the attempt under the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act \n     to get away from Depression-era farm subsidies that distort \n     markets, burden taxpayers, and harm the environment. Instead, \n     subsidies are extended for major crops while new ones are \n     created. The farm bill is a textbook case of an entitlement \n     that survives because it is politically attractive, not \n     because it is good policy.\n       Much more expensive than the farm bill are various \n     proposals to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and \n     delay or cancel scheduled reductions in provider payments. \n     Last year, Congress set aside $314 billion in a reserve fund \n     for Medicare expansion. This year, despite a drop of nearly \n     $4 trillion in projected surpluses, the House budget \n     resolution and the Senate Budget Committee plan (not yet \n     considered on the floor) increase Medicare set asides to $350 \n     billion and $500 billion respectively.\n       Adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, without \n     comprehensive cost-saving reform, would not only pressure the \n     budget in the medium-term but would make the program's long-\n     term funding gap even wider. None of the respective plans \n     conditions new money on such reform. Moreover, other \n     entitlement expansions have been proposed. Overall, the \n     Senate Budget Committee plan allows for an increase in \n     entitlement spending of nearly $670 billion.\n       The series of escalating tax cuts enacted last year is also \n     poised to drain the budget over the medium-term by $1.6 \n     trillion. The phased-in nature of these tax cuts, and the \n     ``sunset'' provision that cancels them all in 2010, give \n     policymakers a valuable opportunity to reprioritize in view \n     of new circumstances by permanently extending some of the tax \n     cuts and delaying the effect of others until a non-Social \n     Security surplus is achieved again. Unfortunately, the \n     Administration and the House leadership have been pushing to \n     lock in the entire package of tax cuts at a cost of nearly \n     $400 billion over 10 years. They have also proposed new tax \n     cuts even as they call for higher spending on defense, \n     homeland security, and Medicare. It is a recipe for sustained \n     deficits.\n       Such imprudence is compounded by attempts to obscure the \n     full budgetary effects of fiscal decisions. This year saw the \n     return to five-year budget plans by the Administration and \n     the House. By itself, this development is not problematic. \n     However, last year's tax plan was based on highly uncertain \n     10-year projections, and its huge costs come at the end of \n     the 10 years. The shift now to a shorter budget window seems \n     designed mainly to disguise those costs.\n       Finally, the medium-term outlook is threatened by the \n     absence of any mechanism, procedural or rhetorical, for \n     defining and enforcing a fiscal policy goal. Both parties' \n     pronouncements about the inviolability of the Social Security \n     surplus are long forgotten. While the respective budget plans \n     of the Administration, House, and Senate Budget Committee all \n     contemplate the return of surpluses no later than 2005, none \n     of them would produce a non-Social Security surplus before \n     2012. Meanwhile, the discretionary spending caps and the \n     PAYGO rules of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act expire this year. \n     Without any markers for discipline, politicians have little \n     incentive to scale back budget busting promises. Instead, \n     they have shown a troubling comfort with using the Social \n     Security surplus to either offset tax cuts or expand other \n     government programs--new entitlements have even popped up in \n     the trade and defense authorization bills.\n\n\n                          LONG-TERM GRADE: D -\n\n       Rampant denial is the best way to describe Washington's \n     response to the long-term fiscal challenge. While much has \n     changed in the past year, two things remain depressingly \n     consistent--the unsustainable path of long-term fiscal policy \n     and the unwillingness of most political leaders to do \n     anything about it. Concord's grade for the long-term is a D \n     minus.\n       While President Bush campaigned on the need for Social \n     Security reform, he has not followed through with a specific \n     proposal. At his request, the commission he appointed last \n     year did not produce a recommendation but instead came back \n     with three illustrative models for adding personal accounts \n     to the system. Two of the plans contained explicit provisions \n     to improve the fiscal sustainability of the program, which \n     personal accounts alone do not. Even though these provisions \n     were designed to avoid any impact on current beneficiaries, \n     political leaders of both parties reacted with horror, and \n     the Administration has kept the commission's report firmly \n     planted on the shelf.\n       Social Security has been reactivated as the third rail of \n     American politics--touch it and die. Without any plan of \n     their own, many Democrats have restored to scare tactics by \n     accusing Republicans of having a ``secret plan to privatize \n     Social Security.'' For their part, many Republicans \n     implausibly insist that personal accounts can be added to the \n     current system without costing anyone anything.\n       Neither party is discussing the tough choices that are \n     needed to make the program sustainable over the long-term. \n     Instead, they are jockeying for short-term political \n     advantage by offering free lunch solutions that rely on such \n     diversions as an imaginary ``lockbox'' or meaningless benefit \n     guarantee certificates. Regardless of the long-term \n     challenge, the House even voted 418-0 for a small benefit \n     expansion.\n       The demographic and fiscal challenges go well beyond Social \n     Security. Medicare poses an even more difficult challenge. \n     Together, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are expected \n     to double as a share of the economy by 2030.\n       It will take a combination of fiscal discipline and cost \n     saving reform to put Social Security and Medicare on a \n     sustainable path for all generations. Washington policymakers \n     are not pursuing either strategy. They are pursuing The Do \n     Nothing Plan, which ultimately leads to crushing debt, \n     burdensome taxes or broken promises.\n\n\n                            OVERALL GRADE: D\n\n       Good policy and political expediency are often at odds, but \n     so far in 2002, politics is trouncing policy. Surpluses ``as \n     far as the eye can see'' have vanished, yet policymakers \n     remain intent on delivering more government spending--\n     including entitlement expansions--and more tax cuts. With the \n     midterm elections looming, no particular fiscal goal in \n     place, and no procedural mechanisms to rein in spending, \n     Congress is reverting to its old ``spend and borrow'' habit. \n     Worse, the debate on how to finance the unfunded retirement \n     costs of the coming demographic transformation has \n     dramatically degenerated from an already low level.\n       Congress and the Administration can still re-establish \n     fiscal discipline this year. But they cannot do so unless \n     they confront the hard choices. Deficits are back and it is \n     time to close the budget bazaar.\n\n             THE MYSTERY OF THE DISAPPEARING FY 2002 SURPLUS\n                        [In billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJanuary 2001 CBO Baseline Unified Surplus Projection...........      313\nChanges:\n  Tax act w/interest...........................................      -42\n  New Spending w/interest......................................      -49\n  Economic and Technical w/interest............................     -242\n                                                                --------\n      Total Change.............................................     -333\n                                                                ========\nJanuary 2002 CBO Baseline Unified Deficit Projection...........      -21\n  Re-estimate in CBO Baseline since January 2002...............      +26\n  Economic Stimulus Package (P.L. 107-147).....................      -51\n  Farm Bill Outlays: (P.L. 107-171)............................       -2\n  Supplemental Outlays: (H.R. 4775)\\1\\.........................       -8\n  Lower Than Expected Tax Receipts.............................      -75\n  Debt Service.................................................       -2\n                                                                --------\n      Total Change.............................................     -112\n                                                                ========\nTentative FY 2002 Unified Deficit..............................     -133\nTentative On-Budget Deficit....................................     -290\nTentative Off-Budget Surplus...................................      157\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The Senate Appropriations Committee version of the bill, S. 2551, is\n  slightly higher.\n \nNote: Numbers may not add due to rounding.\n\n\n                              FISCAL FACTS\n                          [Dollars in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCBO March Baseline: Fiscal Years 2003-2012:\n  Projected Unified Surplus..................................     $2,380\n    On-Budget Deficit........................................       -102\n    Off-Budget Surplus.......................................     $2,483\n  Percentage of Surplus in First Five Years..................        21%\n  Percentage of Surplus in Last Five Years...................        79%\n  Percentage of Surplus in Last Two Years....................        47%\nDiscretionary Spending:\n  Average Annual Growth Rate Assumed in CBO Baseline.........       2.6%\n  Average Annual Growth Rate 1998-2002.......................       7.6%\n  Decrease in Surplus if Spending Continues to Grow at 7.6%..    -$2,719\n  Decrease in Surplus if Spending Grows at the Rate of GDP       -$1,442\n   (5.3%)....................................................\nChange in Projected Surplus Over the Next 10 Years Since\n January 2001:\n  Causes of Reduction in Surplus (As a Percentage of\n   Decrease):\n    Tax Cuts.................................................        42%\n    Economic and Technical Changes...........................        40%\n    Increased Spending.......................................        18%\nNational Debt:\\2\\\n  Gross Debt.................................................     $6,019\n  Increase over the past year................................       $363\n  Debt Held by Public........................................     $3,433\n  Increase over the past year................................       $157\n  Intergovernmental Debt.....................................     $2,585\n  Increase over the past year................................       $206\n  Net Interest on National Debt in FY 2001...................       $206\n  Net Interest as a Percentage of the Budget in FY 2001......        11%\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Includes costs of increased debt service.\n\\2\\ As of May 31, 2002: Note: The gross debt figure of $6.019 trillion\n  exceeds the statutory debt limit of $5.950 trillion because a small\n  portion of the gross debt is not subject to the debt limit.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. This amendment by Senator Gregg and Senator Feingold is \nan effort to at least pose some kind of fiscal brakes, caps, that have \nworked fairly well in the past--not perfectly. But I also worry that \nwithout the enactment of this amendment, we may find ourselves \ncontinuing this hemorrhaging of spending, which is really quite almost \nunprecedented in the time that I have had in Congress.\n  In the name of the war on terrorism, we are now endangering the \nfinancial future of this Nation, and every spending issue seems to be \nsomehow related to the war on terrorism. And clearly it is not.\n\n[[Page S5010]]\n\n  I congratulate the sponsors of this amendment. I look forward to \nvoting for it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. I am \ndelighted to have his support on this important amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield 4 minutes of my time to the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, who is a cosponsor of the amendment \nas well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Gregg-\nFeingold amendment.\n  I realize that some of my colleagues will say that this is not the \nright time or place to consider budget process reforms. I strongly \ndisagree. In fact, I wonder if my colleagues realize how bad the budget \nsituation has become.\n  According to the most recent calculations from the Senate Budget \nCommittee, the budget outlook has swung dramatically in the past year. \nLast year, CBO predicted a $313 billion surplus for fiscal year 2002. \nNow, instead of a surplus, we face a tremendous deficit. We will borrow \nand spend the entire $163 billion Social Security surplus and on top of \nthat we are going to have to borrow an additional $137 billion from the \nprivate markets. To sum it up, we are going to borrow $300 billion in \nthe 2002 budget.\n  This is new debt, on top of the staggering $6 trillion debt we \nalready owe. The budget outlook for fiscal year 2003 is just as bad. \nThe way things look now, we will borrow and spend the entire $179 \nbillion Social Security surplus projected for next year. And on top of \nthat we will have to borrow at least another $100 billion to fund the \nGovernment next year.\n  Some people might think a surge in economic growth is going to bail \nus out of our budget problems. It won't. These skyrocketing deficit \nfigures are based on CBO's assumption that the economy will grow by 5.4 \npercent next year. If that does not happen, the 2003 budget deficit is \neven going to be worse. My point is: these deficits will not go away on \ntheir own. We must prioritize. We must make hard choices. \nUnfortunately, our record on making hard choices is not encouraging. \nJust look at the farm bill. It speaks volumes about the lack of fiscal \ndiscipline in this body. We need to put our foot down and recognize the \nobvious. In order to be fiscally responsible we have to live within our \nmeans and we must rein in spending.\n  That is why I am cosponsoring this amendment. The amendment won't \nsolve all our budget problems. As everyone in this Chamber knows, we \nregularly circumvent budget rules, and I have no doubt that we will \npush in some instances to do the same thing this time. Nonetheless, we \nneed to do something. This amendment marks an important first step to \nregain control. I am working with my friend from Wisconsin and other \nSenators on other legislation to improve the budget process. And we \nhope to introduce that legislation soon. But in the mean time, this \namendment would help keep the national debt in check. We cannot wait. \nWe have to act now. We have a moral obligation to our children and \ngrandchildren. Remember, at the end of the day, it is their future we \nare mortgaging away.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this very important \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, momentarily I am going to yield time to \nmy colleague on the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Domenici. Before I \ndo that, I want to respond quickly to something the Senator from \nArizona said.\n  I am in agreement with virtually everything the Senator from Arizona \nsaid. I am going to be offering the budget disciplines that are \nexpiring at the end of September after this amendment. I think it is \nabsolutely critical, as the Senator from Arizona indicated, that we \ncontinue those budget disciplines. It would be a profound mistake in \nthis country to let those lapse.\n  But I say to my colleagues, the amendment being offered by the \nSenator from New Hampshire, the Senator from Wisconsin, and others, I \nbelieve, has enormous loopholes in it, such that would actually make \nour circumstance worse rather than make them better.\n  Madam President, I hope my colleagues are listening. Under the \ncurrent pay-go law, if mandatory spending or tax cuts would increase \nthe deficit, it triggers a sequester at the end of the year. Under this \namendment, it would allow projected surpluses--hear me; projected \nsurpluses--to be used to pay for additional spending and more tax cuts, \nwithout triggering a sequester.\n  Are colleagues listening? They are talking about fiscal discipline, \nand they are backing an amendment that would impose fiscal discipline \nbased on projections? We tried that before. It did not work because \nwhat we got were gimmicks and rosy projections.\n  My colleagues are well intended. I am absolutely on their side with \nrespect to the fundamental question of fiscal discipline. But this \namendment, I believe, opens a major loophole because it is based on \nprojections rather than real results.\n  How much time does the Senator from New Mexico want?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is the Senator short on time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico, and \nthen I would be happy to engage the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I hope I do not use that much time.\n  In the end, after I am through analyzing it, I am not going to vote \nwith the proponents. I am going to vote against the waiver that is \nbefore us and return us to the position we were in before this \namendment, if it had passed.\n  First, I want to, nonetheless, congratulate Senator Gregg and Senator \nFeingold on their amendment. I think I understand why they have offered \nthis amendment on this supplemental bill.\n  The amendment was offered in the Senate Budget Committee back in \nMarch, and it failed by a tie vote. But it probably would not have \nmattered if it had been added to the Senate Budget Committee reported \nresolution because, of course, the Senate has not yet considered a \nbudget resolution, and it certainly has not considered that one.\n  This brings us to my second point. The failure to adopt in the Senate \na budget resolution, let alone a conference on a budget with the House, \nhas put the Congress in a unique position of not having a budget for \nthe first time in 27 years. The one time we did not achieve a \nconference agreement between the House and Senate, in 1998, we \nnevertheless did add a so-called deeming resolution in the Senate so \nthat the process could proceed based on a Senate-passed budget \nresolution in that year. We are now seeing the problems of not having \nany blueprint. Whether it is good or medium or not so good, we are not \ngoing to have any blueprint, and I fear as we proceed through the \nsummer and the fall that the problems will only increase, not decrease.\n  I don't think I am overstating it when I say the budget process in \nCongress is hanging by a thread. There are some here who might say \n``good riddance,'' but with no budget resolution, no spending limits, \nno way to set priorities, not even some indication that we are \ninterested in fiscal discipline, those who would do away with the \nbudget process will live to regret the direction in which we seem to be \nheaded and what it will yield.\n  That is why, absent a good and agreed-upon budget for next year, \nparticularly as it relates to the level of appropriations I have been \npressing for, at a minimum, a fiscal year 2003 spending cap, extension \nof expiring Budget Act enforcement provisions, including certain points \nof order, and other provisions that will maintain some discipline \nthroughout the year, that is the way of supporting a major portion of \nthe amendment you plan to offer if this one does not pass. That does \nnot mean I approve of all of them, but they are among the provisions I \nthink we must have if we are going to have any kind of enforcement.\n  I have been working with the chairman of the Budget Committee, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, and our \nleadership to develop an amendment that would provide for this needed \ndiscipline. At this time, it is unclear that\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\nwe will be able to offer this amendment or if it would have the 60 \nvotes needed to waive the Budget Act in order that it be raised because \nit, too, would require a hearing before the Budget Committee and a \nreport to escape the 60-vote requirement.\n  This brings me to the Gregg-Feingold amendment. Absent an \nalternative, I support their amendment in order to lay down a marker to \nestablish some discipline absent a budget resolution in place. But at \nthis time I cannot support a waiver of the Budget Act.\n  There are parts of their amendment with which I disagree. I am not \nsure we need 5-year spending caps if we are not going to have a budget \nresolution. I don't agree with the procedure that is being recommended \nin the amendment to remove provisions from an appropriations bill in a \nrifleshot manner. But, in general, except for the 5-year spending caps \nand the individual appropriations procedures, their proposal captures \nthe major provisions of extending the pay-go provisions and the Budget \nAct points of order that expire this year.\n  Again, I prefer to continue to work on an alternative 1-year cap \nproposal, and that is why I will not vote in favor of the Budget Act \nwaiver that is required for this amendment. But if an alternative is \nnot found, then the problems and the chaos I portend for this summer \nare certain to prevail in this Chamber. Maybe we still have a little \ntime to correct it before it ends up as what I have just predicted.\n  I thank those who have spent a lot of time trying to figure out what \nto do. It is difficult. In conclusion, the reason I will not vote for \nthis is that there is $36.8 billion more in spending than the \nPresident's total appropriations, $26 billion less in Defense \nappropriations, and $63 billion more in other mandatory spending.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senator for graciously yielding me 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee. I agree with every word he said. We have a budget process \nthat is hanging by a thread. That is exactly right. We desperately need \nto put in place the budget disciplines that can allow us to keep the \nspending from spinning out of control as we go into the budget process.\n  The amendment by the Senators from Wisconsin and New Hampshire, which \nis completely well intended, will not accomplish the result they seek. \nI believe that is the case because it is dependent upon OMB projections \nof surpluses. We tried that. It didn't work. Why didn't it work? \nBecause what occurred was a rosy scenario.\n  I put up the chart for 1990. They said the deficit was right on \ntarget. It was going to be reduced to $100 billion. It wasn't reduced \nto $100 billion. It was $221 billion. Let's not have a massive loophole \nlike that put back into the budget law of the Congress.\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, the amendment before us, the Gregg-\nFeingold-Chafee-Kerry Budget Enforcement Act of 2002, is critical to \nrestoring a sense of fiscal responsibility to the congressional budget \nprocess. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The amendment reinstates and extends for 5 years the caps on \ndiscretionary spending, keyed to the levels in the Senate Budget \nCommittee-passed budget resolution. The caps are scheduled to expire at \nthe end of fiscal year 2002. The amendment also reinstates and extends \nfor 5 years the pay-as-you-go rules for tax cuts and entitlement \nchanges. The pay-as-you-go rule would apply to legislation which \nincreases the non-Social Security budget deficit. The rule would not \napply when the budget is running a surplus outside of Social Security. \nSixty-vote points of order and the threat of sequestration would \ncontinue to provide enforcement for both the discretionary caps and \npay-as-you-go violations.\n  To guard against budget evasions, the amendment would shut back-door \nways around the caps and pay-as-you-go enforcement by requiring 60 \nvotes to change the discretionary caps, alter the balances of the pay-\nas-you-go scorecard, or direct scorekeeping. All emergency designations \nwould require 60 votes.\n  I was one of the first cosponsors of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \ndeficit reduction legislation in the late 1980s. I understand the \nimportance of fiscal responsibility and budget discipline. The \ndiscretionary caps and PAYGO rules have helped impose a sense of fiscal \ndiscipline since they were first enacted in 1990. Budget enforcement \nmechanisms played a key role in stemming the tide of runaway deficit \nspending. As individuals such as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin have recognized, \nthe benefits of spending and fiscal restraint are enormous. The \nremarkable turn-around in the Federal budget during the 1990s \ncontributed to a virtuous cycle of lower inflation, lower interest \nrates, and higher economic growth.\n  Unfortunately, the budget enforcement mechanisms are scheduled to \nexpire this year. As the Concord Coalition has noted, it would be \nparticular ironic and careless to let the caps and PAYGO rules expire \njust when the budget is plunging back into deficit. Our bipartisan \namendment would prevent that from happening. It will also encourage a \ndiscussion of the tough choices that must be made, regardless of \nprocedural mechanisms, to restore fiscal responsibility.\n  As quickly as surpluses appeared, they have disappeared. We must not \nallow ourselves to return to the previous days of cutting taxes, \nincreasing spending, consuming the Social Security surplus, and running \nup debt. Beginning in 10 years when the Baby Boomers retire, Congress \nwill face huge unfunded retirement and health care costs. Congress and \nthe President lack a strategy for dealing with these liabilities or for \nreturning to budget balance. Our amendment represents a crucial step \nfor reversing a rapidly deteriorating budget outlook. Formal budgetary \nrestraints are needed to balance the competing claims on the Federal \nbudget.\n  Some opponents express concern that the amendment would place overly \nrestrictive limitations on appropriations. Others outright suggest that \nthe legislation will result in domestic appropriations cuts. In \nreality, the legislation fully funds the appropriations levels \nrequested in the Senate Budget Committee-passed budget resolution. The \namendment exceeds the spending levels requested by the President, allow \nfor more spending on education, health care and other priorities. For \nfiscal year 2003, the bill would allow $768 billion in discretionary \nspending. This is a figure commonly cited in current budget \nnegotiations, and considerably higher than the House budget level of \n$759 billion. If this should prove insufficient, Congress can either \nraise the caps or declare the spending as emergency spending to avoid \nenforcement consequences.\n  Finally, some opponents criticize the amendment's pay-as-you-go \nentitlements/tax rule because it allows spending or tax cuts when the \ngovernment is running a surplus outside of Social Security. This \nexception is important because it will facilitate the funding of \nnational priorities when the Federal Government is not facing major \nbudgetary deficits. In addition, it allows for a more flexible response \nto the budget situation. It recognizes that the will for strict pay-as-\nyou-go enforcement may not exist when government is running a \nsubstantial surplus.\n  Overall, the Gregg-Feingold-Chafee-Kerry Budget Enforcement Act of \n2002 is an important safeguard against run-away deficit spending. It \nwill provide an important super-majority obstacle against fiscally \nirresponsible tax cuts. It is flexible enough to allow spending on \ncritical national investments regardless of the budget situation, \nprovided there is sufficient support. Perhaps most importantly, it will \nforce a national dialogue on priorities and reestablish deficit \nreduction as a strategic goal. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I cannot support the Gregg amendment \nregarding caps on annual appropriations and modifying the so-called \n``pay-as-you-go'' provisions controlling entitlement spending and the \ncosts of tax cut legislation. The Gregg amendment, while well-\nintentioned, bases budget enforcement mechanisms on unreliable budget \nprojections by the Office of Management and Budget. If there were\n\n[[Page S5012]]\n\nan OMB projection upon which tax cuts were based, and then the \nprojections proved overly optimistic as is often the case, Medicare and \nother critically important program cuts would be automatically \ntriggered to pay for those tax cuts.\n  I will support an alternative budget enforcement mechanism amendment \nwhich will be offered by Senator Conrad, the Chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee which will extend rules controlling annual \nappropriations, entitlement spending, and the costs of tax cuts. The \nConrad amendment would extend procedures which proved successful since \ntheir adoption in 1990 in eliminating deficits.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise to offer support for the Gregg/\nFeingold amendment and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of that \namendment. Fundamentally, the amendment would make two changes. First, \nit would extend discretionary spending caps for five years, and second, \nit would make legislation that fails to pay for itself with appropriate \noffsets subject to points of order and mandatory enforcement \nmechanisms.\n  Although I appreciate the assurances that an alternative scheme for \nbudget enforcement will be offered if this amendment is defeated, I \nremain concerned that the vote on this amendment will provide the only \nopportunity to ensure real fiscal discipline after the current \nprotections expire later this year.\n  The spending levels provided for in this amendment are more than \ngenerous. In fact, I would prefer to see the caps keyed to the spending \nlevels in the President's budget, rather than to those set forth in the \nbudget resolution reported by the Senate Budget Committee in March. But \nthat is not the choice before us. The choice before us is whether there \nwill be any limits at all on spending and whether there will be any \nenforcement mechanisms to restrain spending.\n  If we head into this year's appropriations process without any such \ntools, we will set the stage for a monumental dereliction of duty. The \nsky will be the limit in terms of spending. Any notion of priorities in \nwartime will be cast aside. All of the rhetoric about ensuring that \nSocial Security Trust Fund surplus revenues be held sacrosanct will be \nrendered hollow. This amendment provides a means, however imperfect, of \nkeeping us focused on trade-offs and priorities. Accordingly, I urge \nthe waiver of the Budget Act and the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the present status of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire controls 4 \nminutes; the Senator from Wisconsin, 6 minutes; the Senator from North \nDakota, 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, let me respond quickly to the comments \nmade relative to the technical aspects of the amendment. First, I am \nimpressed that it has received such adulation but so little support. \nThe Senator from New Mexico, whom I immensely respect, said it is a \nwonderful idea except for a couple little points but he thinks it might \nbe a good marker. The Senator from North Dakota appears to be saying \nessentially the same thing with a little more intensity. I am glad we \nhave put something out here that appears to be pretty close to what we \nneed.\n  Why do we need it? We need it because without any budget disciplines \nin place, we will be in serious trouble as we move down the road, as \nwas highlighted by a number of speakers. We need to have something in \nplace that we can look to at least to give us some guidance, some \nsignposts.\n  On the issue of pay-go, obviously you don't need pay-go if you are in \nsurplus. It makes no sense to have pay-go if you are in surplus. In \nfact, we have shown that every time we have been in surplus, with the \nlast appropriations bill coming out across the floor, we have basically \nput a hold on or stopped the application of pay-go.\n  This bill makes it very clear. The language says:\n\n       There shall be no sequestration under this section for any \n     fiscal year in which a surplus exists.\n\n  It is very specific. There must be a surplus in order for pay-go to \nbe withdrawn. But if there is not a surplus, clearly pay-go exists, and \nit is available.\n  How do you find out if there is a surplus? You have to have \nscorekeeping, and that is the way we work around here. We have \nscorekeeping for lots of spending.\n  Rosy scenarios, I seriously doubt it. In fact, I suspect just the \nopposite is going to be the case for the next few years. That is a bit \nof a straw dog. Nobody is projecting any surpluses. I point to the \nchart of the Senator from North Dakota. He is not projecting any \nsurpluses out there. Nobody else is for the foreseeable future. It is \nimportant we have pay-go in place during this period of that red ink.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I would like to respond to some of the \narguments of the chairman of the Budget Committee as well.\n  The chairman argues that what Senator Gregg and I are proposing is \nnew and radical. In large part what we are doing is merely extending \nthe Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. Let me tell my colleagues what \nwould be radical: If we go through this process without any budget \nrules at all. Based on my 10 years here, that would be radical and \ndangerous and harmful to Social Security and to the future of our \nbudget. As far as I am concerned, we are on the precipice of going back \nto the bad old 1980s in terms of the budget process. This is a good-\nfaith, bipartisan effort to try to keep some rules in place.\n  The chairman speaks, fairly, of course, with great knowledge about \nthe new deficits and the new problems we face, especially in the last \ncouple of years, especially since 9-11.\n  Let me remind everyone that we used the chairman's numbers, not pre-\n9-11 numbers, but his post-9-11 numbers, with regard to his 5-year \nscenario. That is what this is based on. It is based on our knowledge \nabout the tragedy and difficulties that occurred.\n  I find it hard to understand when the chairman argues for flexibility \nthat somehow Senator Gregg and I don't recognize the need for \nflexibility. He, too, apparently, if we don't prevail, intends to offer \ncaps. He intends to offer limits. The fact is that the chairman \nacknowledges that even in difficult times such as these, there have to \nbe rules and there have to be limits.\n  There is nothing irresponsible about proposing limits even in \ndifficult times, such as a war against terrorism. In fact, I argue that \nthe worst that can happen, at a time when we are fighting terrorism and \nother crises in the world, is to have no rules at all. Then it is more \nlikely that legislation such as the farm bill will pass with unlimited \namounts of inappropriate action and provisions. Some of the provisions \nin the energy bill and some in this bill are more likely to happen with \nno rules at all.\n  For the sake of our national security, for the sake of the fiscal \nintegrity of our country, at this time it is more important than at any \nother time that we have some rules and procedures so the American \npublic can know we are wisely using their tax dollars to proceed with \nthis war against terrorism, and to protect them, and that we are not \nusing it for pork projects at home.\n  The chairman complains that our amendment would not have budget \nenforcement at times when we are running a surplus without counting \nSocial Security. Yet his idea guarantees us no discipline at all. I \nwish him well if we end up going with his amendment and considering \nthat, but, obviously, I hope ours prevails. There is no guarantee. \nDefeating this amendment would leave us with no enforcement at all if \nthese current rules expired in September, as they are expected to do. \nHe says we only have constraints on spending. We followed the same \nconstraints on taxes as they exist in current law. Taxes and \nentitlements are constrained in our amendment, as well as by the pay-\nas-you-go procedure.\n  He also seeks to argue that somehow we are doing something different \nor something radically inappropriate with regard to the OMB. The \namendment gives the OMB the job of calculating whether we have complied \nwith the caps or the pay-as-you-go discipline. But this is exactly as \nit has been since 1987. Nothing is new about this provision.\n  When Congress first enacted the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings bill in 1985, \nit\n\n[[Page S5013]]\n\ngave the job of calculating compliance to the Comptroller General, head \nof the General Accounting Office. But the Supreme Court ruled, in 1986 \nin the case of Bowsher v. Synar, that Congress could not \nconstitutionally give that power to anybody outside of the executive \nbranch of Government. That is why we do it. That is why Congress gave \nthe job of calculating compliance to the OMB in the rewriting of the \nbudget laws and continued that process in the 1990 Budget Enforcement \nAct. This argument doesn't hold water. Our amendment merely continues \nthe same rule for the OMB.\n  As to the chairman's argument that we erred by not requiring pay-as-\nyou-go enforcement in times of budget surplus, we disagree as a matter \nof policy. We believe that when the Government is taking in more tax \nrevenues than it needs to fund existing programs, even after putting \nall Social Security surpluses aside, then it is altogether appropriate \nfor Congress to consider fiscal choices, such as updating Medicare to \ninclude a prescription drug benefit. Do we want a 60-vote requirement \nin times of surplus to provide the American people with a prescription \ndrug benefit? I hope not. If you are listening to your constituents, \nthey desperately need this. So that doesn't seem to be appropriate.\n\n  Finally, I think this is a critical test on this vote. Are we serious \nabout protecting Social Security, even in these difficult times? Are we \ngoing to go forward with no rules and continue down the road we are \nheading in--the road of a $100 billion deficit already? Especially \nafter 9-11, the American people have a right to know that we are being \nespecially careful with their dollars, that we can track it, and that \nthey can follow the caps and the rules and enforcement procedures to \nsee if we are doing their bidding and if we are truly putting our \npriorities straight--with the war on terrorism at the top, but also \nguaranteeing the safety and security of Social Security, which is very \ndear to them.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, let me respond to the Senator from \nWisconsin. The alternative is not their proposal versus no rules. That \nis not the alternative. I will offer an amendment that will extend the \nsupermajority enforcement of budget points of order that extends the \nBudget Enforcement Act provisions--all of them--and that restores the \nSenate pay-go rules--in fact, toughens them. That is the alternative: \nserious budget discipline versus the proposal before us by Senators who \nare absolutely well intentioned. They have the diagnosis right, which \nis that we have deficit and debt problems, but their solution takes us \nback to a provision that did not work in the past and will not work in \nthe future.\n  Have we forgotten 1990? When you base budget discipline and \nenforcement on projections, you are basing your discipline on \nquicksand. What could be more evident? In 1990, the Office of \nManagement and Budget told us we were meeting our deficit projections, \nthat the deficit was only going to be $100 billion. It turned out to be \n$221 billion because the whole budget discipline process was based on \nprojections.\n  That is what this budget proposal does. It won't work. It didn't work \nthen; it won't work now. It is absolutely misleading and will take us \ndown a road not to budget deficits, through budget deficit elimination, \nnot to reduce debt, but to more gimmicks, more game playing, more rosy \nscenarios.\n  After this amendment I will offer an amendment that has real budget \ndiscipline.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, what is the status on the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 2 minutes. \nThe Senator from North Dakota has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator allow us to close since it is our \namendment? I will yield our last 2 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator has used his time, and I am going to use \nmine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield to the Senator from Washington 1 minute 45 \nseconds.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Gregg-\nFeingold amendment. The premise underlying this amendment--and its \nextension of the budget enforcement procedures--is that we as a body \nmust be fiscally responsible.\n  We have real responsibilities and real priorities on which we have to \nmake decisions, but we also must have fiscal discipline. In order to \naccomplish this it is important for us to have a framework by which \nthis body can make these fiscal decisions.\n  This amendment helps us at a time when we have seen a surplus of $5.6 \ntrillion over ten years disappear and turn into a $2.7 trillion \ndeficit. And we know that the current deficit is a result of last \nyear's tax cut, the recession, and the tragic events of September 11, \n2001.\n  Having spent time in the private sector, I can tell you this: No \nprivate sector organization thinks it can spend its way out of \nproblems; nor can we as a country.\n  I believe one of the most important actions we can take for the \nnation's future economic stability, is to pay down the national debt. \nAccording to Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, \npaying down the national debt lowers interest rates and keeps the \ncapital markets and investment going. In January, he told the Senate \nBudget Committee that one of the reasons long-term rates have not come \ndown is the sharp decrease in the surplus and the diminishing prospects \nfor paying down the debt.\n  Our total budget must be crafted within the need to maintain fiscal \ndiscipline, and stimulate economic growth through continued federal \ninvestment in education and job training, while also protecting the \nenvironment. Furthermore, we need to invest in our nation's economic \nfuture by making a commitment to public research and development in \nscience and technology--maintaining our status as a global leader.\n  It is a balance. We need to make these investments, but within a \nframework that ensures we don't spend beyond our means. If we want our \neconomy to be strong, if we want revenues, and if we want to make the \nright decisions, we need to keep paying down the debt.\n  We must have fiscal discipline in budget and appropriations process. \nWe cannot focus solely on the individual items and programs in our \nbudget, but must look at the whole picture. The budget enforcement \nprocedures help us do this, and help us keep a reign on our spending. \nThese procedures worked successfully as we struggled to get out of \ndeficit spending in the 1990s, and they will work as we struggle to get \nout of the current recession and deficit financing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used her time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I hope people are listening and paying \nvery close attention. There is a lot at stake in the series of votes \nthat are going to occur. The Senators have made the case that we are \nback in an era of budget deficits. I say to them, I warned our \ncolleagues that is where we were headed. I did not do it this year. I \ndid it last year. And I begged our colleagues not to go down the road \nthat was taken. I warned them that we would be back to raiding Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and every other trust fund in sight, but they cast \nall caution aside and went down that road.\n  Today there is a fundamental question of whether or not we are going \nto have budget disciplines in place as we go through this year's \nappropriations process. I will offer an amendment that extends those \nbudget disciplines. Every colleague is going to have a chance to be \nrecorded as to whether or not they want budget discipline.\n  The amendment before us has very serious defects. It is not the \nbudget disciplines that worked in the nineties that helped us get back \non track. It is not those. It is a new scheme, and it is a scheme that \nhas an enormous loophole. The loophole is that discipline is based on \nprojections of what is going to happen.\n  Have we learned nothing? Last year, we were told there was going to \nbe $5.6 trillion available in surplus over the next decade. That was a \nprojection. Do you know what it is now? Nothing. Zero. The money is all \ngone. Let's not base budget discipline on projections.\n\n[[Page S5014]]\n\n  Does the Senator from New Mexico seek time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, I would like 2 or 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I thank the Senator. I failed to call \nhim chairman. He has been chairman for 6 more months. In any event, we \nwish the Senator well next year in whatever capacity.\n  I wish to discuss not so much the amendment because I have explained \nwhy I do not think we should waive the Budget Act. We have to do better \nin trying to put discipline into what is currently a totally \nundisciplined situation with reference to goals and priorities.\n  Appropriations will have no responsibilities on the various bills. \nThere will be no total dollar number that flows. This amendment will \nnot help that.\n  I close my few remarks talking about, once again, the mistake we are \nmaking--and we are making it for whatever reason--in not passing a \nbudget resolution. I am not filled with acrimony, but I do believe that \nin the over 27 years of serving, I felt a responsibility to get a \nbudget, and actually we could have gotten a corner after an extremely \ntough year 3 years ago and said: Let's not do it. The Senator from New \nHampshire could have been with me trying to keep discipline in this \nprocess. We could have said: Let's not do a budget resolution. It did \nsome good. Some people are saying it did not.\n  I would personally look at the area of entitlements and how many had \ncaps which precluded passage of more than we spent. It is the same on \nappropriations. Obviously, there is friction against those two \ninstitutions, but we did some good.\n  We happened to budget based upon an extremely powerful American \neconomy which was with us for 10 years, and we got clipped in the 11th \nand 12th year when the economy did not stay strong. That is all that \nhappened.\n\n  If we could have kept the budget resolution, it would have forced it \nor would have done something better, and we would probably be right \nback to moving close to a balanced budget in the next 5 years. I am not \nsure we are going to get there without something like a budget \nresolution, something to shoot with each year.\n  That is why I am saying we ought to do better than the Gregg \namendment. He is on the right track. Maybe we can include him and his \ncosponsor with a group of us trying to do a little bit better.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, would you alert us as to the time \nsituation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 50 seconds. \nThe Senator from New Hampshire has 15 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, in conclusion, I agree absolutely with \nwhat motivates the sponsors of this amendment. We need budget \ndisciplines. I will offer those as a package, all of the budget \ndisciplines--every one; in fact, a strengthened pay-go provision--after \nwe dispose of the amendment that is before us.\n  Madam President, I say to my colleagues, I believe the amendment \nbefore us has a giant loophole, unintended I am sure, but it is based \non projections, not real results. We have seen what happens with that \nkind of budget approach.\n  I go back again to 1990 when we had a similar scheme in place based \non projections from the Office of Management and Budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from North Dakota has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, does the Senator from New Hampshire \nstill have time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen seconds.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin and \nmy other cosponsors for offering this amendment. This amendment is \ngoing to be our best opportunity to put in place long-term, effective \nbudget enforcement mechanisms. There are no significant loopholes in \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I raise a point of order that the \npending amendment violates section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable section of \nthat act for the consideration of the pending Gregg-Feingold amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I wonder if Senators will permit me to \nspeak for 30 seconds on another matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I am sending an amendment to the desk. \nIf I can have the attention of Senator Conrad, I am sending a copy of \nthe amendment he is going to propose following the disposition of this \namendment, if we defeat it, so Senators can look at it and we can get \nrid of some delays. They can study it during the next 30 minutes or so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is the Senator filing the amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am sending it to the desk so anybody who wants to may \nlook at it. If the Senator has concerns, I will not do it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be constrained to object because I am told Senator \nByrd would object if he were here. But I am very hopeful we can \naccomplish that same purpose momentarily.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not want to argue, but I am not sending an \namendment to be operative. I can put in a letter. If I want somebody to \nlook at a proposed bill, why would anyone object?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No one will object to that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am sure they cannot if they wanted to. It is not \nintended as anything other than for Senators to look at. If they are \ninterested in how we might fix this situation, they might look at what \nis being recommended by the chairman.\n  I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nTorricelli) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, this amendment is to provide the fiscal \ndiscipline that I think we all seek, at least the framework for it.\n  This amendment extends the supermajority enforcement of budget points \nof order. It extends the Senate's 60-vote Budget Act points of order \nfor 5 years. These points of order, including points of order that \nprotect Social Security----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield without losing the floor?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I would like to say--the Republican whip is on the floor \nand the Republican leader--when this amendment is completed, we will go \nback to the procedure we have always followed. If there appears to be \nno disagreement, we will have a Democratic amendment and Republican \namendment and go back and forth.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield, I appreciate that because \nthere is some angst on our side. People thought we were in line to do \nan amendment. I appreciate your accommodation with the recognition, and \nwe will have an amendment ready when we conclude this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. The last two amendments have been offered by both Democrats \nand Republicans, but this is offered by a Democrat, so we will go to a \nRepublican. The leaders have agreed on that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, when we debated the last amendment, the \npoint was made, and the point was made correctly, that the various \nbudget disciplines are going to expire on September 30 of this \nyear. That could allow budget discipline to go right out the window.\n\n  What I am offering today is a continuation of the budget disciplines \nthat have worked--the budget disciplines that allowed us to move from \ndeficit to surplus. It is critically important that those budget \ndisciplines be extended. I think there is strong support in this body \nfor that proposition.\n  As I have indicated, these points of order, including points of order \nthat protect Social Security, limit total spending and total tax cuts, \nenforce discretionary spending limits, and committee and subcommittee \nspending allocations are scheduled to expire on September 30.\n  The Senate has had Budget Act points of order that require 60 votes \nto waive since 1985. But unless action is taken starting October 1, it \nwill only take 51 votes to waive most Budget Act points of order. Only \n51 votes would be required to raid Social Security, or to exceed \ndiscretionary spending limits, or to increase total spending above \nagreed upon levels, or to cut taxes below agreed upon levels, or to \nexceed committee spending allocations.\n  Without the extension of these 60-vote points of order, it will \nbecome much more difficult to enforce budget discipline in the Senate. \nSenators who favor spending, or tax cuts, or exceed agreed upon budget \nlimits would not be deterred by the need to convince 60 of their \ncolleagues that the limits should not apply to their proposals.\n  In addition, the amendment I am offering extends Budget Enforcement \nAct provisions. The amendment extends for 5 years the Budget \nEnforcement Act procedures that limit discretionary spending and \nrequires increases in mandatory spending or tax cuts to be offset. The \ndiscretionary spending limits are scheduled to expire on September 30 \nof this year. The pay-as-you-go procedures that control mandatory \nspending and tax cuts will cease to apply to newly enacted legislation \nafter September 30, although pay-as-you-go sequestrations will continue \nto apply to legislation enacted before that date.\n  Under the amendment, the pay-as-you-go enforcement will expire \nearlier than scheduled if an actual non-Social Security surplus is \nreported before fiscal year 2007. Although it has not been evident for \nthe past several years, the discretionary cap and pay-as-you-go \nenforcement actions of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 have proved \nto be very effective tools for budget enforcement.\n\n[[Page S5016]]\n\n  Let us put up the chart that shows the long-term budget surplus \nstandards we face.\n  Here is the long-term relationship between spending and revenues. \nThis goes back to 1980. The red line is the spending of the Federal \nGovernment. The blue line is the revenue. We had this very significant \ngap between the two--spending exceeding revenue--back in the 1980s, and \nthat led to a quadrupling of the national debt.\n  In 1993, we passed historic legislation that cut spending and raised \nrevenue to eliminate this gap between spending and revenue--to \neliminate deficits and to begin to allow us to pay down debt. We did \nthat. The lines cross. Spending went below the revenue line. And in \n1997 we passed additional legislation that led to budget surpluses. The \nrevenue line was above the spending level.\n  That has all changed. Now we are back to deficits. After making all \nthat progress, after moving out of deficits into surplus, after the \nfiscal mistakes of last year, the President proposed a massive tax cut \nwith a major defense buildup and said we could have it all, said we \ncould have all of the spending and all of the tax cuts, and that we \nwould still have surpluses. He was wrong by a country mile. Instead of \nsurpluses as far as the eye can see, we have deficits as far as the eye \ncan see. The question is, Are we going to reinstitute the budget \ndiscipline to provide the framework for the appropriations process?\n\n  From the time the budget disciplines were enacted through 1998, they \nhelped to control spending, limit tax cuts, and played an important \nrole in the dramatic turnaround in our budget circumstance.\n  That is what this chart shows. We lifted this country out of deficits \nand put it in surplus. Then, unwisely, last year, a whole new fiscal \npolicy was put in place. That policy has plunged us back into deficits \nas far as the eye can see. We are going to be facing red ink throughout \nthe entire next decade.\n  Without these tools which expire on September 30, it is unlikely the \nbudget would have gone from a record total deficit of $290 billion in \n1992 to a surplus in 1998. After 1998, these enforcement tools fell \nvictim to the unrealistic, low discretionary caps that were set in the \n1997 Balanced Budget Act.\n  It is the reason I opposed the last amendment. It was going to repeat \nthe mistakes of the past, put in unrealistic numbers in light of the \nattack on this country, and base budget enforcement on projections \nrather than real results.\n  These budget enforcement provisions are based on actual results, not \nprojections, and don't leave us vulnerable to the office of Management \nand Budget going back to the rosy scenario days in which they told us \nthere were surpluses even when that was highly unlikely.\n  We are back in deficit now and for the foreseeable future. We should \nextend and enforce the Budget Enforcement Act procedures, not let them \nexpire and either give up on fiscal discipline or pretend there are \nsome other procedures that might work better than these proven \nprocedures.\n  In addition, my amendment extends the Senate pay-as-you-go rule. The \namendment extends through 2007 the Senate pay-as-you-go point of order \nthat prohibits surpluses from being used to pay for new mandatory \nspending or tax cuts.\n  Let me repeat that because I think it is critically important.\n  The pay-go provision will protect us from using Social Security money \nfor other tax cuts or other spending. We must have this discipline put \nin place or else we risk losing control of the entire spending process.\n  I hope my colleagues will think very carefully about the circumstance \nwe face. We have put in here the framework for budget caps. We have not \nput in the number for this year. We have negotiations going on right \nnow to determine whether or not we can agree now on a number for this \nyear. As you know, we are very close. After weeks of discussion, we \nwere very close yesterday to agreeing on a number. Perhaps this can \ngive us an opportunity to achieve an agreement. Even if we don't today \nreach agreement on what the budget numbers should be for this year, it \nis critically important that we put in place the budget enforcement \nframework. We cannot let that lapse. Even if we don't agree on a cap \nnumber for spending today, we can agree on the budget enforcement \nframework. We can then settle on a number if not today, sometime in the \nnear future so that these disciplines have something to apply to.\n\n  It is critically important that this budget enforcement mechanism not \nbe allowed to lapse. That would be a serious mistake given the fiscal \ncondition of the country. Literally, for weeks we have engaged in good-\nfaith negotiations with people on the other side of the aisle.\n  I thank Senator Domenici, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, \nand his staff. They have played a very constructive role in these \ndiscussions. That can be said of the chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee as well. Senator Byrd, the chairman, and \nSenator Stevens, the ranking member, have worked for many days to try \nto agree to a set of provisions that would allow us to provide a budget \nframework and to also provide for a continuation of these budget \ndisciplines.\n  Unfortunately, those talks hit a bump in the road yesterday. We have \na chance now to get back on track. We have an opportunity now to extend \nthese budget discipline provisions. We have an opportunity now to agree \non a budget limit, an appropriations limit for this year.\n  I do not know if we can agree on that in the next few hours, but \nperhaps we can. It would allow us, then, to go into the appropriations \nprocess with not only the budget disciplines intact but with an \nagreement on what total appropriations will be for this year. That \nwould be a very positive development. We would then have a budget for \nthe year, and we would have the budget disciplines so that we could, \nwith greater confidence, ensure we stay within the limits agreed to.\n  At the very least, we ought to put in place those budget disciplines. \nWe ought to put in place that framework. We ought to be ready for when \nthe negotiations achieve a result and we are able to agree on a number. \nWe can do that today, at a minimum. It would be even better if we could \nagree to an amount as well. But at the very least, let's send a signal \nthat we are not going to have chaos in the budget process.\n  Senator Domenici, the distinguished ranking member, has served on the \nBudget Committee for a long time. He has been chairman and ranking \nmember. He warned us: Look, we are in uncharted waters; this is \ndangerous ground; we should have a budget in place.\n  This is an opportunity to have a budget framework so that disciplines \nthat are set to expire on September 30 continue. This is also an \nopportunity to agree on a budget amount.\n  I very much hope that people who are discussing this issue at this \nmoment think very carefully about what is at stake. I hope they will \nthink very carefully about what we need to consider.\n  If we allow these budget disciplines to lapse, and we go into the \nappropriations process without an agreed-upon budget amount, it does \nnot take much imagination to think of what could occur. We could have \nspending spin out of control. I do not think anybody wants that to \nhappen. Think of the implications. Think of the signal that would send \nto the financial markets of this country. Think of what that could mean \nto the economy of this country.\n  We have already seen that the equity markets are extremely \nvulnerable. We have already seen the stock market go down 200 points in \na day. If the markets got the sense that we were not going to take \nserious action on the budget deficits that now confront the country, \nthat could further destabilize equity markets and put us in an even \nmore vulnerable position.\n\n  (Mr. CARPER assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  I don't often like to expose my ignorance of certain issues on the \nfloor of the Senate, but I preface my question with the assumption that \nI am not an expert on the budget, as is the Senator from North Dakota. \nI don't know the nuances and the ins and outs of the budget process, \nnor have I ever quite understood the different categories and what \nfalls in and what falls out of it.\n  Would the Senator explain to me, according to the amendment proposed \nby\n\n[[Page S5017]]\n\nthe Senator from North Dakota, as I read it, there is no budget number \nassociated with the Senator's amendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is absolutely correct. We are awaiting \nadditional discussions that are going on right now, that the Senator \nmay be aware of, to see if we could reach agreement on that critical \ncomponent. Obviously, that would be a very important part of this \npackage.\n  I say to the Senator, there are really two parts to this. One is the \nbudget number for this year. The other is the budget enforcement \nmechanisms. Both of them are necessary. Neither is sufficient. They are \nboth necessary.\n  Even though we do not have yet an agreed-upon number, the reason I am \noffering this amendment is that at least we would then have the \nframework and discipline when a number is agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield for a further question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do not quite understand. Since there is no number, then \nenforcement would basically be meaningless because you do not have a \nnumber to enforce.\n  Why wouldn't we wait until we had an agreed-upon number and then \npresent the amendment as such? Because it seems to me, if you pass \nthis, it may do more damage than good, because then the conferees, who \nare appropriators, well known for their sense of fiscal discipline, \nwould be the ones who would decide what the cap is.\n  My question to the Senator from North Dakota is, without an agreement \non what the cap would be, we are now putting in rules that are \nbasically unenforceable because there is nothing to enforce. Why \nwouldn't we wait and see if there was some agreement on the overall \nbudget number instead of proposing that at this time? That is my \nquestion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator asks a very good question. There are really \ntwo pieces to this puzzle. We need a number for this year. We also need \nthe budget disciplines reinstated because they expire on September 30. \nThis may be one of our best opportunities, I say to the Senator, to \nreinstate those budget disciplines.\n  We may also have an opportunity to have the number agreed to today. \nThat would be a full package. That would be a very desirable outcome, I \nsay to the Senator. But at the very least, I think we want to get the \nbudget disciplines put in place.\n  Let's say we do not agree. Let's say we are not able to reach \nagreement on a number for this year. Does that mean we have lost all \nopportunity? No. Because, I say to the Senator, then certain of the \nnumbers that were in last year's budget resolution serve as a basis for \nthe disciplines that we would now be extending. In other words, even if \nwe did not reach agreement, at least we would have the structure of \nbudget disciplines that could agree to certain spending levels that \ncome from the budget resolution of last year.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator for his courtesy in allowing me to \nquestion him and for his responses. I am still not quite clear why we \nwould pass an amendment without something to enforce. But I certainly \nappreciate the courtesy of the Senator from North Dakota, and again I \napplaud his knowledge of the intricacies of a very complicated process \nwhich I have been unable to master in the years I have been in \nCongress. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me say to the Senator, for example, even if we were \nnot able to agree on a discretionary spending amount for this year, if \nwe have these budget disciplines in place, they would apply to the \nmandatory numbers from last year's budget. As the Senator knows, we \nhave two pots of money. We have mandatory spending, and we have \ndiscretionary spending.\n  In the best of all worlds, what many of us would like to achieve is a \ndiscretionary limit agreed to for this year--in effect, a budget for \nthis year. But we also have mandatory spending, and, in fact, mandatory \nspending is a bigger part of Federal spending than is discretionary. \nEven if we are not able to agree on a discretionary limit, if we have \nthis budget discipline framework in place, we would have a way of \ndisciplining mandatory spending.\n  In the best of all worlds, we get a discretionary spending limit, and \nwe have these budget disciplines that apply on both sides of the \nequation, mandatory spending and discretionary spending. But at the \nvery least, if we passed these budget disciplines, if we extend them, \nwe have some way of disciplining mandatory spending. That is the \nbiggest part of Federal spending.\n  It would also be very useful and important and certainly my goal to \nhave a discretionary spending limit as well.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder, does the Senator still control the time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I still control the floor. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would ask for about 3 or 4 minutes, and I will yield \nback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wanted to have a few moments with the \nchairman and Senator Gramm and others who are interested, building off \nyour current amendment, which is pending--and I thank you for the \naccommodations that you have made to it--one which is very important to \nour side, very important to everyone, as we have come to know it, with \nthe understanding that you know these enforcement provisions are not, \nfor the most part, found in the Budget Act. These enforcement \nprovisions were designed principally by a huge conference that was \npresided over by former White House OMB Director Darman--remember him--\nand Senator Robert Byrd--you know him--and a few other people. We were \nabout 2 weeks out there at Andrews Air Force Base when we tried to \nnegotiate a budget.\n  It fell apart in terms of numbers, most interestingly. Some people \ndidn't get treated well politically, and others did. Those who know \nhave said the most important thing we did in 1990 or 1991 were the \nenforcement provisions. We were doing something rather significant. It \nturned out the tax part didn't work out as well for the President as it \nshould have, but these enforcement provisions survived.\n  The principal author of those was Senator Robert Byrd, because we \nwere giving, in a sense, many things he wanted, and in exchange he was \ntrying to make sure that if they didn't do their job, something could \nhappen to them, including his committee.\n  Today the distinguished Senator, on an appropriations bill, is trying \nto see if we can save some of those. I want to say, I have looked at \nthem. I think the language I have used for the last 2 or 3 minutes \nmeans that I like them. In particular, they have been changed a little \nbit. I like them. I think we would have changed them a little bit, \nwhether we were down here or not, from 1990 because a couple of the \nprovisions don't work too well.\n  I regret that I can't seem to get a consensus on what else ought to \nbelong in this. I think it is good, but it is half a measure because we \nought to have some numbers in it. We ought to have some numbers for \ndefense and some numbers for the rest of Government. Clearly, without \nany question, we don't need 5-year numbers at this point in the \nprocess.\n  The process is questionable mostly because of the number assumptions, \nnot these enforcement provisions, speaking in the past.\n  But adults are going to sit down and arrive at this total; if not \nhere, in a vote. If not tomorrow morning in a vote, they will go to a \nmeeting someplace, and they are going to vote on how much we are going \nto allow for expenditures. We could go back to the day I arrived in the \nSenate, with Senator Nunn, Senator Helms, and others. We never knew \nwhat we spent until all the bills were added up. Nobody bothered to \ngive you any interim reports on six committees that reported and six \nbills. We were new. We said: How can you run a government where nobody \nknows until you are finished and by then you have already spent it all?\n  About 6 months later, the Budget Act was born on a premise that \nSenators Johnson and Domenici, heads of the freshman class, sent out a \nletter saying: Next year we will vote against all the measures \ntogether, 13 of us, if we don't have some process that tells us the \npieces before we start. That was the beginning. So it has some pretty \ngood history.\n\n[[Page S5018]]\n\n  I have been there and enforced it a lot of times. You know about 35 \npercent of the votes of the Senate are points of order, and most of \nthose points of order are 60-vote points of order, which is the only \neffective means this Congress has found to make it difficult to spend \nmoney. That is the only one. Because when it is controversial and you \nare seeking something with a lot of money, it is not easy to get 60 \nvotes. So you ought to have that around here next year, too, and the \nyear after; right?\n\n  The question is, how are you going to have it if you don't adopt it? \nThen to what are you going to make it applicable? I would have hoped \nthat we could have gotten together beyond what is proposed and that we \nwould go ahead and put the numbers in and get it done and then take a \nlook, with our leadership, at where we go next. We still have a lot of \namendments, but at least we could conceivably be through with this \npart.\n  I am trying as best I can in my few comments to put a little life \ninto this debate; otherwise, who wants to talk about budgets. I do \nbecause when you live them, it is interesting to talk about them. How \ndid you get this thing done?\n  Even the issue raised here, if we don't get one, we will deem one. I \nkept wondering, if that is the case, why in the world didn't we deem \nthem when they were all so darned difficult? It is because when you \nfinally go to look and see, what is that, it ain't so. We deemed a \nbudget resolution that the Senate had adopted. That is what we deemed \ndone.\n  Incidentally, we deemed a budget resolution that had been done by the \nSenate but wasn't getting adopted, and so we said, rather than let this \nwhole year go with nothing, we will have a deeming resolution. And what \ndo we deem up against? A budget resolution. So even when we were in \nfoxholes shooting at each other because we couldn't agree on anything, \nclearly we chose to get something that said the Budget Act is being \nenforced.\n  As to the numbers I am giving you and others who want to be part of \nthis, if they do, I am more than willing to come back and talk about \nthem and see if we can put them together. Our leader will have them \nvery shortly, and we will see where we go.\n  I thank you very much for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me, first, thank the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, the ranking member of the Budget Committee. I \nthink he has done something very constructive because it kind of leads \nus to the point of all the decisions that need to be made. The Senator \nfrom New Mexico is saying, yes, we need the budget enforcement \nmechanism and framework. We also need a budget. We need a budget. The \nSenator from New Mexico has come forward with numbers that are very \nclose numbers that I could agree to, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I had them there because they are close to what the \nSenator has agreed to before.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is exactly right. The Senator basically has the \nPresident's number, which the President proposed for outlays--not the \nPresident's policy, I am quick to acknowledge. Really, the significant \ndifference--there is not a difference on the budget authority number. \nIt is the President's number. We have said all along that we could \nagree to the President's number for spending this year. We would not \nagree to this so-called accruals policy that would say that retirement \nfunding of Federal employees is somehow discretionary rather than \nmandatory spending. It doesn't seem to us that that is realistic. When \nyou have Federal employees, you have costs for their retirement. That \nhas always been mandatory spending because, obviously, it is required. \nIt is not discretionary. But the overall President's number is one to \nwhich I would agree. It is in the budget resolution that passed the \nSenate Budget Committee.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has provided a number for outlays that is \nvery close to a number to which I could agree. He has also provided a \ndefense firewall. Well, I think the realistic outcome in the Senate is \nthat if we had a vote, there would be a commitment to spend that amount \nof money for defense. I think that would probably be the overwhelming \nvote.\n  I say to my colleagues, the Senator from New Mexico has come forward \nwith the other part of the package. We have the budget discipline \nframework and he has now provided the numbers, provided a budget for \nthis year that is very close to the numbers we have discussed for days.\n  I hope my colleagues will think about the need to get a budget and \nbudget discipline in place for this year. We can do it now.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3765 to Amendment No. 3764\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. SANTORUM] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3765 to amendment No. 3764.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To adopt the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n   year 2003 reported by the Committee on the Budget for the Senate)\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       Sec.   . The provisions of S. Con. Res. 100 (107th \n     Congress) as reported by the Committee on the Budget and \n     placed on the calendar is adopted by the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives as the concurrent resolution on the budget \n     for fiscal year 2003 in accordance with section 301 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, what I have sent up is the Democrat \nbudget that was passed out of the Senate Budget Committee.\n  We heard the chairman lecture the Senate that we need to have budget \ndiscipline and we need a budget. Yet for the first time in the history \nof the Senate, since the Budget Enforcement Act was put in place in \n1974, we have no budget. We have not even been offered a budget.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee, whose responsibility it is to \nbring a budget to the floor, has not brought a budget to the floor. \nThis is the same chairman of the Budget Committee who, back in 1998, \nafter we passed a budget but it had not gotten a conference report, \nsaid:\n\n       The budget resolution was due by April 15--\n\n  He said this in October.\n\n       The President plays no role in the budget resolution. That \n     is the responsibility of this Senate and of the House of \n     Representatives. These bodies have failed in their \n     responsibilities.\n\n  He made that comment after we passed a budget here, but we were not \nable to agree between the House and Senate. In this case, the Senate \nhas not even brought up the issue. We are in a situation where we are \nnow, after a few years of surplus, heading into a deficit and we have \nno budget discipline in place. We have not even had a debate on the \nfloor of the Senate as to the future of the budget of the United States \nof America.\n  Every single family in America has to budget. It is our \nresponsibility--in fact, it is an obligation under the law that we pass \na budget. But the chairman and the majority party in the Senate have \nrefused to consider the budget, refused to bring this resolution to the \nfloor.\n  We have seen all these amendments back and forth about why we are \ngoing to create psuedobudgets and deeming resolutions and sort of \npsuedobudget enforcement, skimming around the issues of the budget, \nwithout being serious with the public as to what the budget really is. \nThat is disingenuous on the part of the Senate. We should have a full \nand fair debate on a budget and see whether we can get a compromise.\n  Last year we had a divided Senate. We did something historic, and I \ngive credit to the chairman and ranking member for putting together a \nbipartisan budget for the first time in a long\n\n[[Page S5019]]\n\ntime that actually passed the Senate. It was tough. I am sure if you \nask the Senator from New Mexico, he would say it was one of the hardest \nthings he ever did. He had a 50-50 Senate. It was not easy to craft a \nbudget that could get votes on both sides of the aisle. It is hard when \nit is divided. It was a difficult task, but it was one that the \nRepublican majority and Senator Domenici took on because we knew it was \nimportant for the future of the country to have fiscal discipline, to \nhave a budget in place, so enforcement mechanisms could be put into \nplace, so we could put some sort of caps on discretionary spending and \nhave enforcement mechanisms for taxes and mandatory programs. It is an \nimportant framework to governing this country. It is not even a \ndiscussion that we have had.\n  We are almost 2 months past the time we were supposed to have this \nbudget, and this is the first day I can remember we even have had this \ndiscussion, much less had the bill before us. So I thought it was \nimportant, since we are having this sort of kabuki dance here about \nbudgets, that we actually put a budget on the floor. So that is what is \non the floor now. We have on the floor the budget passed out of the \nSenate Budget Committee. If we adopt it, if the majority can get the \nvotes to adopt their budget, then we can have a budget resolution on \nthe floor and we can go through the process of amending the budget \nresolution, coming up with what is important for this country, which is \nsetting forth the framework of operating the Government of the United \nStates. It is our responsibility.\n\n  The President has sent a budget. He sent up a budget that was very \nspecific. The House has passed a budget. It was hard to do with the \nvery narrow majority over there, but they were able to pass a budget. \nThe fact that we had not even brought a budget up, almost 2 months \nafter the date which it was due to be here, is something we should not \nbe proud of. We set a precedent that is not a good one. It is a \nprecedent that says we are going to leave things to chance in the \nSenate at a time when the appetite for spending is always very high.\n  What does this budget do? Well, it does several things. The President \nlaid out in his budget three priorities: national security, increasing \ndefense spending so we can address not only the threats that we have \nhad for many years, which are sort of the conventional threats that we \nhave had to deal with--we were potentially going to be involved in some \nsort of conflict with a large deployment of our troops, which is what \nour military has been geared to fight. We have a lot of equipment and \ntrained men and women who are there to do that. But as you know from \nrecent events--and even before recent events--the military was going \nthrough a transformation process--now accelerated because of these \nasymmetric threats to America. Not only do we have to maintain the \nexisting force, but we have to deal with another security threat on \nAmericans here and in the world at large. So in this environment, in a \nwar against terrorism, faced with different threats, we need to \ndramatically increase defense spending. It is not really that dramatic; \nit is less than 10 percent in spending. They fund the President's \npriorities, as far as defense, for the next 2 years. After that, it \ndoes not. In fact, it reduces defense spending back basically to the \nrate of inflation, or below, but it dramatically increases and \ncontinues to allow the increase in domestic spending.\n  At the same time, it takes even more money that was due for tax \nreductions by making the President's tax cuts permanent and puts that \nmoney back and, of course, spends that money, too--not on defense \nspending but on domestic spending--in a time of war, a time of \nreshaping our military to protect this country. It reshapes the budget \ninto more porkbarrel projects for Members of Congress. That is what \nthis budget does. It takes money out of your pockets and puts it--\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator makes an assertion about the Senate Budget \nCommittee that is flatly untrue.\n  The budget I offered that passed the Senate Budget Committee fully \nfunded defense for 2003 and 2004. After that, it increased defense by \nthe rate of inflation and set all of the additional defense spending \naside that the President has requested in a defense reserve account. \nEvery penny of that money that is not needed for defense goes to debt \nreduction. The Senator has said it goes to porkbarrel projects. That is \nabsolutely false. Every penny of that money--every penny--either goes \nfor defense or it goes for debt reduction.\n  When the Senator makes statements, I hope the Senator will at least \nbe constrained by the facts.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reclaiming my time, I suggest that given the way this \nbody operates and the Congress has operated over the past several years \nsince I have been in Congress, we have not seen very many reserve \naccounts set aside for debt reduction that are not raided continually \nfor spending in Washington, DC.\n  The Senator can say that money is set aside, and that is a nice \nlittle accounting mechanism, but the fact is we will spend that money \nand then some increases--whether it is supplemental appropriations \nwithout caps, since we do not have caps now, we would be flying through \nthat money and we would be blowing through caps as we have in the past.\n  Second, I did say the tax dollars would not be given to the American \npublic. They would be back in the budget and, yes, they would be used \nto increase spending in Washington, DC.\n  The fact is, it does not fund the President's priorities or the \nNation's priorities with respect to national security, No. 1.\n  No. 2, it does take money that was targeted hopefully for the pockets \nof the American taxpayers and brings it back to Washington to be spent.\n  No. 3, and I quote the Washington Post headline, ``Senate Democrats \nTap Social Security in Budget Plan.'' I hear over and over how these \nhorrible Republicans want to raid Social Security and raid the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  The budget we have before us, in the words of those who use this \nlingo, ``raids the Social Security trust fund.'' It is horrible to \nsuggest that, but it does. It does not fund the Nation's priorities \nwith national security. It does increase spending in Washington, DC, \nfor more and more domestic spending programs. It does raise taxes vis-\na-vis the President's budget, and it does raid the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n  Given what this budget does, I can understand why it might be \ndifficult or why many Members, the leader, and the chairman of the \nBudget Committee did not want to bring this bill to the floor because \nsuch a budget would be very difficult to pass because it does not \nplease very many Members on either side of the aisle.\n  There was no attempt in the process to try to form a bipartisan \nbudget. Every effort by Senator Domenici and the budget Republicans was \nthwarted by the majority. So there was no attempt to build a bipartisan \nbudget. Faced with very difficult fiscal realities, including raiding \nthe Social Security trust fund, which this budget does, it is very \ndifficult to get votes on a bipartisan basis when we have a very \nclosely divided Senate.\n  I am not saying this would not be a very difficult political task--it \nwould be--but it is one the Senate is required to do. This is a debate \nthat we should have. This is a debate that has been denied to the \nSenate, has been denied to the American public, and, as a result we are \ngoing into waters very much uncharted, uncertain waters when it \ncomes to setting spending priorities over the next few months through \nthe appropriations process and whatever other bills that may be coming \nthrough that require expenditure of funds.\n\n  I understand there are attempts being made to create mechanisms to do \nother things that are sort of quasibudget in nature. That is all well \nand good. But the fact is, the chairman of the Budget Committee and the \nmajority leader had a responsibility and obligation under the act to \nbring a bill before the Senate and debate a budget, and they have \nabdicated their responsibility. They have abdicated their \nresponsibility to the Senate and to the American public.\n  I am going to give them an opportunity. We have waited 2 months. Many \non our side were suggesting: Why don't we offer this on April 15? \nBecause many of us thought: Let's see if we can work out something; \nlet's see if we can, in fact, get some bipartisan resolution; maybe the \nchairman of the Budget Committee will bring forth a budget\n\n[[Page S5020]]\n\nresolution. Senator Daschle continually in his dugout said: We will get \nto that budget resolution; we will get to it; we will get to it.\n  I was willing to hold off longer. Now there are all these phony \nbudget talks going on in this Chamber where we are going to do all \nthese machinations to look like we are doing a budget. I thought: I am \nwilling to put off while people have good-faith negotiations to get \nsomething done. But when we come out to the Chamber in the context of a \nsupplemental and start playing games like we are doing a budget, let's \ncall a spade a spade. Let's do a budget. You have not done a budget. \nLet's do a budget. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania must have \nmissed what has been going on. He has not been party to any of these \ndiscussions, any of these talks, but people on his side of the aisle \nhave been, including the ranking member of the Budget Committee and the \nRepublican leader. We have even involved the White House in an attempt \nto get a budget for this year.\n  The fact is, the Senate passed a budget resolution through the Budget \nCommittee, a budget that is a 10-year budget as required under the law. \nThe President presented a 10-year budget, and we will give our \ncolleagues a chance to vote on that budget as well, just as we did in \nthe Budget Committee.\n  Interestingly enough, some Republicans did not support that budget. \nWe will see if they want to support that budget on the floor.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania talks about raiding Social Security. \nThe President's budget really raids Social Security. We will give the \nSenator from Pennsylvania the opportunity to vote on that budget and \nsee if he wants to raid it by $500 billion more. That is what the \nPresident's budget does.\n  How are we in this deficit situation? Is it because we have not \nconsidered a budget resolution on the floor of the Senate? The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania knows the answer to that question. We are in deficit \nfor as far as the eye can see before a budget has been considered for \nfiscal year 2003, and I remind the Senator that the new fiscal year \ndoes not start until October 1. We have time to get a budget in place \nfor this year.\n  The Senator perhaps has forgotten that the Senate has been involved \nin the election reform bill, the energy bill, the trade bill--all of \nthese the administration requested us to take up. Now we are on the \nsupplemental bill which the President also asked us to take up and \ndispose of. So the budget kept getting pushed back.\n  On the fundamental question of how we got in this circumstance where \nwe see deficits as far as the eye can see, the facts are very clear. \nThe Senator from Pennsylvania and his colleagues bear substantial \nresponsibility. They are the ones who put a budget in place last year \nthat plunged us back into deficits. We opposed it.\n  It was the Senator from Pennsylvania and his colleagues who said we \ncan have it all, who said we can have a massive tax cut, we can have a \nmajor defense buildup, that we can have maximum paydown of the Federal \ndebt. That is what they told us last year. And now they are here, after \nsaying they were going to have maximum paydown of the Federal debt, \nasking for the second biggest increase in the debt in the history of \nthe country.\n  This is their fiscal policy that is in place. It is their fiscal \npolicy that has put us back into deficit. It is their fiscal policy \nthat has put this country back into accumulating debt at a record rate.\n  No budget has yet been acted upon for the year 2003. It is their \nbudget, the budget they passed last year, that they offered in both \nChambers of the Congress, that they passed that has put us in this deep \nditch. That is the fact.\n  Last year, we were told there would be nearly $6 trillion of \nsurpluses over the next decade.\n  In fact, the President's Office of Management and Budget told us \nthere was going to be $5.6 trillion of surpluses over the next 10 \nyears. Now we are told maybe $400 billion, and that is before the \nrevenue shortfall of this filing season.\n  The fact is the money is all gone. Where did it go? More than 40 \npercent went to the tax cut that the Senator from Pennsylvania and his \ncolleagues pushed through this Congress. Twenty percent of the \ndisappearance of the surplus went from increased expenditures as a \nresult of the attacks on this country, 20 percent, and every Republican \nsupported those expenditures.\n  Twenty percent of the disappearance of the surplus happened because \nof the economic slowdown. About 20 percent occurred as a result of \nunderestimations of the cost of Medicare and Medicaid. That is where \nthe money went.\n  So if the Senator from Pennsylvania is wondering how the money \ndisappeared and who is responsible, he can look in the mirror because \nit was his fiscal policy, his budget, his plan, his promises that put \nus back into deficit and back into debt. That is where we are.\n  I warned against that fiscal policy. I warned that it would put us in \ndanger of raiding Social Security and raiding Medicare and every other \ntrust fund in sight. But, oh, no, the Senator from Pennsylvania and his \ncolleagues said: We know better. There is going to be even more money \nthan has been projected. That is what they said then, and now we reap \nthe whirlwind and the devastation of deficits and debt as far as the \neye can see.\n  We have an opportunity to get a budget framework in place. We have an \nopportunity to put in place the budget disciplines that are necessary \nto prevent spending from spinning out of control, but this kind of ad \nhominem attack is not going to solve those problems.\n  We presented a 10-year budget. I am proud of that budget. The budget \nI presented, that passed through the Budget Committee, did the \nfollowing: No. 1, fully funded the President's defense request for 2003 \nand 2004, and for the years beyond put the money in a reserve account \nso that every penny would be available for the defense of this country \nif needed. But in those future years, where none of us can say with \ncertainty what might be required for defense, to the extent any of that \nmoney is not needed for that purpose, it goes to reducing the debt of \nAmerica. That is a good policy. It is one we ought to adopt.\n  In the budget I have offered our colleagues, we fully fund all of the \nmoney the President has requested for homeland security because we \nbelieve everybody in this Chamber understands our first obligation is \nto defend this Nation.\n  The budget I have offered also has greater debt reduction than the \nPresident has offered in his budget, $500 billion more in debt \nreduction than what the President proposed, if the defense reserve fund \nis not needed for defense. If it is all required for defense, we still \nare paying down the debt by $230 billion more than the President's \nproposal.\n  On the other key issues before us, the budget I offered my colleagues \nsaid there would be no additional tax cuts unless they are paid for \nbecause we are now in deficit. It contains no tax increases, and it \nalso has no delay of the scheduled tax cuts.\n  The budget I offered also attempts to address the priorities of the \nAmerican people because it rejects certain of the cuts the President \nproposed. The President proposed cutting the highway construction \nprogram in this country by 27 percent. The President's budget proposes \na $9 billion cut in highway and bridge construction funding. I do not \nthink that is the priority of the American people.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Since the Senator has presented the budget I offered, I \nwould like to complete the description of that and then I would be \nhappy to yield.\n  I do not think it is wise to reduce the highway and bridge \nconstruction budget of the United States by 27 percent. No. 1, it would \ncost over 350,000 jobs in America. No. 2, it would reduce the \nefficiency of the transportation system in our country. What sense \nwould that make?\n  It does not end there. The other major difference in the priorities \nof my budget from the President's budget is in education. Everybody \nsays education is their priority, but the President's budget actually \ncut his signature education proposal, No Child Left Behind. The \nPresident, with great fanfare, went across the country drawing\n\n[[Page S5021]]\n\nattention to the No Child Left Behind Act, but in the first budget he \nproposed, he cut the funding for No Child Left Behind.\n  I also, in my budget, kept the Federal promise that was made long ago \nto the States with Disabilities Act funding for education. Educators \nall across America told us this was the single highest priority. It is \nthe one thing that would help school districts across America the most, \nif the Federal Government would keep its commitment to fund 40 percent \nof the costs of the Disabilities Act. That is a promise we have not \nkept. Under the budget I have proposed, we would keep it.\n  We have some additional funding for education, some additional \nfunding for law enforcement as well. The President cut dramatically the \nfunding for the COPS Program. What sense does that make, when we face a \nterrorist threat, to cut cops on the street? This is a program that has \nput tens of thousands of policemen on the streets of America. So we \nrestored that cut.\n  We also dealt with some of the other priorities of the Nation. In \naddition to education, in addition to law enforcement, we dealt with \nthe health care needs of America.\n  The President had about $250 billion set aside for a prescription \ndrug benefit and to expand health care coverage. The House in their \nbudget resolution set aside $350 billion for a prescription drug \nbenefit and for adjustments to providers. They did not pick up the \nPresident's proposal for expanding health care coverage.\n  In the budget I have proposed, we have a $500 billion reserve fund \nfor health care, for prescription drugs, for the President's proposal \non expanding health care, and for the third category of adjusting for \nproviders, the Medicare cuts that are in place that endanger the health \ncare of the people of the country because there are additional cuts to \nhospitals, additional cuts to doctors that go beyond what was \nanticipated when the 1997 Deficit Reduction Act was put in place.\n  Some have asked, how can it be that there are fewer cuts than the \nPresident proposed but on the other hand there is more debt reduction? \nHow can that be? The way we achieved that result was not to adopt the \nPresident's proposal of additional tax reductions on top of the \nstimulus package that has already been put in place this year, and on \ntop of the massive tax cut that was put in place last year that extends \nover the next 10 years. We say, yes, there can be additional tax cuts, \nabsolutely, but they have to be paid for.\n  I think that is a pretty reasonable budget. Those are principles that \nought to be adopted. Those are things that make sense.\n  I want to review how we got in the circumstance we are in today. It \nwas not the fact that we have not yet adopted a budget for 2003 that \nput us into deficit.\n\n  I conclude by saying we got in this soup because of the fiscal policy \nput in place last year by the Senator from Pennsylvania and his \ncolleagues. They are the ones who told the American people: You can \nhave it all; it all adds up, massive tax cut, major increases in \nspending. They will have maximum paydown of the Federal debt, they will \ndo all these things based on a 10-year forecast that even the people \nwho made the forecast warned was uncertain. But they bought it hook, \nline, and sinker, and they sold it to the American people.\n  What is the result? Before we have a budget for fiscal year 2003, \nmassive deficit is the result, deficit not just for this year but next \nyear and the next year and the next year and the next year, because \nthat party that claims to be the party of fiscal responsibility put us \nright back into the soup of deficits, debt, and decline. Their plan did \nnot add up. Now we have an opportunity and an obligation to try to \nagree on a budget for this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to make sure everyone understands \nwhat it is we are debating on the Senate floor.\n  The President made a request of the Senate to pass an emergency \nappropriation that would directly respond to the terrorist attacks in \nthe United States. He asked for more money for defense. He asked for \nmore money for homeland security. He asked for more money for New York. \nThat is the pending legislation.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said this bill is \non a slow train to nowhere. Mr. President, it is disconcerting, at \nbest, that on an issue of this import--dealing with troops overseas \nwhile the nation is on high alert after being told repeatedly in the \nlast 3 weeks about the inevitability of a further attack--somebody has \nunconscionably come to the floor and slow-trained this important bill, \nslow-walked it, stopped it, brought it to a grinding halt. But that is \nexactly what is happening.\n  We need to get this legislation passed. There ought to be a good \ndebate about budget. We have been trying to do that. We will have one. \nBut to offer a budget resolution on the amendment that is currently \npending is inexcusable. It is politics. It has everything to do with \nslowing this bill down to a screeching halt and ignoring the plea of \nthe President of the United States to enact this legislation as quickly \nas we can. That is what we are doing.\n  Members of his party have said: We don't care what the President is \nrequesting, we are going to slow-walk this, we are going to put this on \na slow train, and we are not going to pass this legislation this week. \nWe will vote against cloture tomorrow. We are actually going to \ncontinue to filibuster a bill the President has requested to deal with \nhomeland defense, to deal with aid to New York, and to deal with the \ndefense needs of this country. That is inexcusable.\n  I move to table the second-degree amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman), \nthe Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller), and the Senator from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Torricelli) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 96, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 134 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--96\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Bingaman\n     Helms\n     Rockefeller\n     Torricelli\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to reflect for a moment on the \nevents of today and say to my colleagues, we\n\n[[Page S5022]]\n\nhave to find a way to break the gridlock. The bill that is before us is \nfor defense, for homeland security, for dealing with the tragedy of the \nattack on New York, and to deal with some other urgent needs, including \nthe shortfall in Pell grants and VA medical care.\n  The bill before us is a $31 billion bill. Fourteen billion dollars is \nfor defense, money requested by the President to respond to the \ncontinuing terrorist threat to this country; $8.3 billion is for \nhomeland security, again funds requested by the President to respond to \nthe continuing threat against our Nation; $5.5 billion is to respond to \nthe needs of New York after the attack of September 11; $1.9 billion is \nfor foreign security assistance to strengthen our embassies against \nterrorist attacks; $1 billion to deal with the shortfall in Pell \ngrants; $400 million for VA medical care. That is the bill that is \nbefore us. Those are requests of the President of the United States.\n  I want to make clear that what is at stake is spending items \nrequested by the President of the United States to respond to the \nthreats against our country and the devastation that occurred as a \nresult of those attacks. I think it also must be said that we need to \nhave a budget put in place for this year. It is needed. Now we are \nbeing told by some on the other side, they will block any attempt to \nhave a vote on a budget framework for this year.\n  There are others on both sides who want to work together to achieve \nthat result. There are others on both sides who believe it is important \nto have a budget put in place for this year, to have the budget \ndisciplines extended for this year. I hoped we could do that before we \nconclude work on this supplemental. This is one of the best \nalternatives, one of the best options we will have to put in place a \nbudget framework for this year.\n  I might say that people on both sides of the aisle have worked very \nhard to do that, are very close to an agreement to do that, but we have \nto have an opportunity to vote before cloture is invoked or that effort \nwill fall.\n  That is the hard reality. We have an opportunity to put in place a \nbudget for this year, to extend the budget disciplines for this year, \nand to provide some order to this process. That is in the interest of \nall of us. That is in the interest of the Nation. I would hope very \nmuch that tomorrow we would have the opportunity to vote on that on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask the Senator, who is the chair of our Budget \nCommittee, about issues that are in that budget which I think are so \ncritical for all of us, and I share with the Senator his frustration \nabout the lack of willingness or ability to move ahead in order to pass \nthis supplemental and to be able to pass the budget. One of the \nimportant provisions that we have worked on together relates to the \nquestion of prescription drugs and putting forward a comprehensive \nMedicare prescription drug benefit that I know the Presiding Officer \nhas been deeply involved in leading and advocating as well.\n  Would the Senator not agree that it is critically important that we \nbe able to move ahead with this budget so we can address the issue of \nMedicare prescription drugs and be able to address the spiraling costs \nof medications, affecting every part of our economy and that our budget \nresolution, in fact, puts in place the ability to do that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like nothing better than to have the opportunity \nto have a full plan. At this moment, what is at stake is having any \nplan just for this year. That is clearly in the Nation's interests. It \nis in the interest of an orderly appropriations process to have a \nbudget for this year and to have the various budget disciplines put in \nplace for this year. That is now what is at risk, much less having a \nlonger term plan. What is at risk at this moment is having any plan. \nThat is what is at risk.\n  There are some Members who do not want any plan, some Members who \nwant chaos. They think somehow they benefit by not having a discipline \nin this entire process. That is regrettable, I say to my colleague, who \nis a very valuable member of the Senate Budget Committee. We voted out \na resolution, a blueprint on how to proceed, one that was fiscally \nresponsible, that had substantially more debt paydown than the \nPresident proposed, one that has no tax increases, one that has no \ndelay of the scheduled tax cuts, one that provides everything the \nPresident requested for the defense of this Nation, both in terms of \nthe defense budget and the budget for homeland security. We did that.\n  We are asking for at least the opportunity to vote on one year of \nthat plan so we meet the defense needs, so we meet the needs for \nhomeland security, so we get this supplemental budget in place that the \nPresident has requested, so that, yes, we have the budget disciplines \ncontinue past September 30 when they expire. We do not want to see a \ncircumstance where spending spins out of control. Just be here in \nOctober with no budget disciplines available and see what real chaos \ncan be.\n  I say to my colleagues, I know there are people who have strong \nfeelings on all of these issues. I do, as well. We ought to let the \nSenate work its will. We ought to have a chance to vote. That is how we \ndetermine outcomes here.\n  I have been told there are some who have the idea of preventing the \nSenate from voting. They do not want a chance to vote because they \nthink they would lose, although there is a 60-vote requirement. They \nare right. They would lose. We would then have the opportunity to have \nnot only a budget for this year and also the budget disciplines \ncontinue, that is very much in the public interest.\n  I hope some of my colleagues overnight will think about the \nconsequences of the failure to act. I thank the Senator from Michigan \nfor her contributions on the Budget Committee.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I commend the Senator from North Dakota for his ongoing \nleadership on the Budget Committee. These are challenging times. He has \nforecast for over a year great concerns about an evaporating surplus \nand what could happen with a downturn and other pressures on the \nbudget. He has continued to advocate fiscal discipline. I join the \nSenator in that and in setting the right priorities for the country, \nthe right priorities for our families.\n\n\n                         assistance for israel\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to discuss the \namendment of the Senator from Kentucky, the ranking minority member of \nthe Foreign Operations Subcommittee, Senator McConnell, concerning \nassistance for Israel.\n  This amendment would permit the transfer of all or a portion of the \nfunds in the supplemental for Israel, to the ``Nonproliferation, Anti-\nTerrorism, Demining and Related Programs'' account (NADR), to be used \nfor ``defensive, non-lethal anti-terrorism assistance.'' It is my \nunderstanding that the purpose of this amendment is to provide the \nauthority to utilize these funds to purchase bomb detection equipment, \nx-ray machinery, body armor, and similar types of border security and \nother defensive equipment to prevent acts of terrorism. Am I correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor his question. Yes, he is correct. That is exactly what these funds \nwould be available for. The recent bombings in Israel--including one \nthis morning that killed 16 people--have only demonstrated the urgent \nneed for this type of assistance.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. I want to be certain that there is no \nambiguity about what these funds are for. We are all aware that there \nwas never any intention that these funds would be available for lethal \nassistance or for the expansion of settlements, but I think it is \nimportant to reaffirm that understanding. These NADR funds would not be \navailable for offensive purposes, or for any purpose unrelated to the \npurchase of defensive, non-lethal anti-terrorism equipment, and the \nSenator from Kentucky has confirmed that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me thank the chairman for including the assistance \nfor Israel in his mark.\n\n\n   WAIVER OF THE LOCAL MATCH FOR THE COMMUNICATIONS INTEROPERABILITY \n                                FUNDING\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Hollings, in a\n\n[[Page S5023]]\n\ncolloquy on the local match requirements for Federal grant funding. \nThis pressing concern was raised by the local elected officials we \nheard from during the Appropriations Committee homeland security \nhearings. One of them testified that in many of these grant programs, \nparticularly in the public safety area, our larger cities with the \ngreatest needs cannot afford to meet a local requirement, while \nwealthier area with relatively fewer needs are able to take full \nadvantage of these funds.\n  I hope the distinguished chairman will join me in this colloquy at \nthis time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would be happy to speak with my colleague from \nLouisiana on this important issue.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator. I believe that local match \nrequirements are an important shared investment in Federal grant \nmaking. So there is a need for it and I think my colleague would agree.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I certainly do agree. By giving the local jurisdiction \n``buy-in'' to a grant, the local match adds an incentive for \ncommunities to use Federal funding effectively. A wide variety of grant \nprograms have them. I also share in the Senator from Louisiana's \nconcern that many of our communities may not be able to afford that \nmatch. Many grant programs provide waivers of the match in certain \ncases.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would like to talk to the Senator about the $80 \nmillion in interoperable communications funding in the Department of \nJustice title of the bill. In the District of Columbia Subcommittee we \nhave held hearings on the emergency preparedness needs for Washington, \nDC. During 9-11, District fire and police personnel had to have the \nability to communicate with multiple jurisdictions that responded to \nthe Pentagon. So interoperability is crucial for public safety \nofficials.\n  The funding in the bill would be administered by the COPS program at \nthe Department of Justice. You have been a leader in the Senate in your \nsupport of that program. COPS grants require a 25 percent local match \nfor its grants. The COPS program does allow for a full or partial \nwaiver of the local match for communities that are facing severe fiscal \ndistress. Communities can qualify for a waiver in a wide variety of \nways. Some qualify because they have been declared a FEMA disaster area \nor have been placed in receivership or bankruptcy. Communities can also \nget a waiver if they have had a recent large, one-time financial \nexpense, like replacing a water treatment facility. The COPS program \nwill also grant waivers to communities that had to make across-the-\nboard budget cuts as a result of difficult economic circumstances.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Congress designed the COPS program to meet the specific \nlaw enforcement needs of individual communities. This is true not only \nwith the waiver of the local match, but in how communities can use COPS \nfunding in general.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Is it your understanding that the COPS interoperable \ncommunications funding in the bill will be administered in the same \nmanner as the other COPS grant programs regarding the local match and \nthe waiver process?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes. These funds will be administered in the same \nmanner as other COPS grants funds regarding both the matching \nrequirements and the waiver process.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee. I look \nforward to working with you on this issue.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the funding for \nthe U.S. Coast Guard aviation programs in the pending supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  On February 20, I spent a day at Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater \nin St. Petersburg, Florida. I observed first hand some very impressive \nCoast Guard aviation operations, but also several helicopters that were \ninoperative due to problems associated with a shortage of spare parts. \nI am pleased that the pending supplemental will help restore adequate \nfunding for the Coast Guard aviation program, including spare parts, \nand get these aircraft flying and operational again soon.\n  The Coast Guard needs this assistance to cover their basic \noperational expenses. According to the Coast Guard, the first \nsupplemental this year provided funding to operate seven additional \naircraft (4 HU-25 Falcon jets and 3 HH-65 helicopters) and provided a \n15 percent increase in flight hours. The pending supplemental contains \napproximately $22 million to continue to operate the entire aviation \nfleet for the remainder of the fiscal year, with an adequate inventory \nlevels of repair parts. I am also pleased that the Coast Guard reports \nthat the President's fiscal year 2003 budget request contains the \nnecessary recurring funding to support the additional aircraft and \nflight hours brought on by fiscal year 2002 supplemental funding, as \nwell as continues to resolve the Service's aviation parts shortfalls.\n  I do recognize that some of the HH-60 helicopter problems that I saw \nin February are due to aging aircraft issues that affect the entire \nU.S. H-60 fleet, including those owned by the Department of Defense, \nand are not just the Coast Guard specific issues.\n  As one of the nation's first lines of defense in stemming the flow of \nillicit drugs and illegal immigration into the United States, it is \nimperative that the U.S. Coast Guard be appropriated the resources that \nthey require to carry out their critical missions on behalf of the \nAmerican people. And we must remain committed to ensuring that our \nCoast Guard has adequate resources not just now, but well into the \nfuture. The U.S. Coast Guard is important to Florida and important to \nthe nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support for the Coast Guard's \nsupplemental funding for fiscal year 2002 as well as for their annual \nappropriations in fiscal year 2003.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I very much enjoyed Thomas Friedman's \nop-ed in today's New York Times entitled ``Land of Denial.'' I could \nnot agree more with his assertion that Egypt can--and should--be doing \nmore to be a leader in the Arab world.\n  Egypt is a land of missed opportunities, and it has forfeited its \nhistorical place in Middle Eastern history as a progressive and \npluralistic country. Friedman points out that while other countries--\nJordan, Bahrain, Qatar, and even Tunisia--have forged ahead with \ndemocratic, free press, and economic reforms, Egypt ``has been \nstagnating.''\n  I could not agree more with Friedman's assertion that ``[t]he \nintellectual air has gone stale in Egypt from too many years of \ncontrolled press and authoritarian politics.''\n  In the past, I have taken issue with Egypt's cold peace with Israel, \nits jailing of democracy advocates, its suspicious involvement with \nNorth Korean missiles and weapons technicians, and its reckless and \nirresponsible government-controlled press that fuels extremism on the \nstreets of Cairo and throughout the Arab world.\n  It is not too late for President Hosni Mubarak to embark on a reform \npath that will ensure a stable and prosperous Egypt. It is in our \ninterests--as well as those of the Egyptian people--that Mubarak \ninvests in the development of functioning democratic institutions and \npolitical processes.\n  In the supplemental bill I carved out a portion of assistance \nprovided in the Economic Support Fund account for the professional \ntraining of Egyptian and other Middle Eastern journalists. I did so \nbecause I firmly believe that a free and independent media in Egypt \nwill contribute to our war against terrorism, peace in the region, and \nthe political, legal, and economic development of that country.\n  The abuses of the government-controlled Egyptian press are legendary, \nand include personal attacks against Secretary of State Colin Powell \nand National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice. America has been \nrepeatedly tarred and feathered, Israel vilified, and Hitler criticized \nfor not killing all the Jews ``so that the world could sigh in relief \nwithout their evil and sins.''\n  Such inflammatory nonsense fuels ideological extremism that has \nrepercussions on our shores and throughout the world.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that in my capacity as ranking member of \nthe Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I will continue to examine the \nassistance America provides to Egypt. I have already suggested to \nSecretary Powell that we reassess our assistance to Egypt to ensure \nthat it effectively promotes critically needed reforms, and I look \nforward to working with the administration on this matter.\n\n[[Page S5024]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5024-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise to ask our colleagues to move \nbeyond the obstructionist position, to work together to get the \nsupplemental passed so we can move on to other critical issues that \naffect our families. This is one. It is important. There are important \npieces in this bill that deal with our issues of homeland security and \ncertainly, representing the great State of Michigan, issues of border \nsecurity are critical. We are very concerned about making sure we have \nthe resources in place. There are other important resources in this \nsupplemental bill.\n  However, I am equally concerned about the ability to move beyond \nthis, to get this completed on a bipartisan basis and move beyond this \nto the rest of the agenda that has to happen.\n  The Presiding Officer has spoken eloquently about the sense of \nurgency families feel about medicine and the inability to afford \ncritical lifesaving medicine, whether you have cancer, a heart \ncondition, high blood pressure, or a disabled child and you need to be \nable to provide that child with medicine that is needed.\n  We have the ability and, within our budget resolution, the capacity \nto pass a Medicare prescription drug benefit that will update Medicare \nand make sure there is a voluntary universal plan in place for those \nwho need it, to be able to afford their prescription drugs.\n  We also have the ability to lower prices across the board. Our side \nof the aisle has put forward a strategy to provide a way to lower \nprices for our business community, large and small. I have seen the \nbusiness communities come forward, small businesses that are losing the \nability to provide health care for their employees because premiums are \ngoing up 30 and 40 percent this year.\n  The big three automakers shared some statistics with me. I came from \na weekend-long event on Mackinaw Island, which I invite the Presiding \nOfficer and my colleagues to come and enjoy during the beautiful summer \nmonths. There is a wonderful gathering of business and political \nleaders and university educators who come together once a year to \ndiscuss challenges facing the economy in southeastern Michigan and \nacross Michigan and the business concerns. High on their list, if not \nat the very top, was the rising costs of health care, predominantly due \nto the explosion of the prices on prescription drugs.\n  We heard a presentation from DaimlerChrysler that indicated on a SUV \ntoday priced at $18,600 the cost of employee health care is $1,300, and \nthat the fastest growing part of that is prescription drug costs. We \nnot only need to be providing Medicare prescription drug coverage for \nseniors and for the disabled, but we need to close the loopholes which \nallow the companies to stop compensation through generics that go on to \nmarket or are supposed to go on to market once the patents run out \nwhere the formula is available to other countries to use and to produce \nprescription drugs at a lower cost.\n  We also need to open our borders to Canada. Two weeks ago, we passed \nfast-track trade authority, but the only thing we could not trade \nbetween the United States and Canada is prescription drugs, which makes \nabsolutely no sense. We know, and we will be demonstrating next week in \nbus trips from a number of States across to Canada, that you can lower \nyour prices at least in half.\n  I am pleased to have joined with Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, \nSenator Jeffords from Vermont, Senator Wellstone from Minnesota, and \nmany others, in an effort to open the border so we can have that \ncompetition, and our pharmacists, our hospitals, our businesses can \nhave business relationships with the Canadians, bringing back American \nmade drugs sold to them at lower prices. We have that bill. If we had \nthe opportunity, we could complete the supplemental and bring up that \nbill and lower prices immediately.\n  We have been able to put forward a bill that caps the amount the \ntaxpayers subsidize in excessive advertising costs. The drug companies \nare spending 2.5 times more to advertise a drug than to create a new \nlifesaving drug, and we have a bill--and the Presiding Officer has \njoined in the effort--to cap the amount that can be written off on \nadvertising and marketing costs to the same level that research costs \nare rip-offs on taxes, so taxpayers are subsidizing no more for \nadvertising and marketing sales than we do for research. That would cut \ncosts immediately.\n  We also have a bill to allow more flexibility for States using \ninnovative techniques as in Maine and Vermont, where they are being \nsued by the drug companies for coming up with creative ways to lower \nprices.\n  We have an agenda to lower prices. We have an agenda that includes a \ncomprehensive, voluntary, Medicare prescription drug benefit. If we can \nget beyond the current stalemate, we will have the time and opportunity \nto bring forward these issues that directly affect every single \nAmerican--every business, every farmer, every worker, every family, \nevery senior. It is an issue whose time has come.\n\n  People in our States are saying it is time to act. It is past time to \nact. We have been talking about this. You would think, given all the \ntime we spent talking about it, on both sides of the aisle, we could \nhave funded a prescription drug benefit.\n  The reality is we need to act. We need to do it now. I am deeply \nconcerned that we are seeing, day after day, stalemate on moving \nforward on critical issues such as the supplemental that are so \nimportant to us and that are blocking us.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Michigan how much I appreciate \nher leadership on this issue. Yesterday the Presiding Officer gave a \nspeech, right close to where the Senator was standing. It was one of \nthe most significant speeches I have heard since I have been here. He \nillustrated, in the mind of anyone who was listening, why we cannot \nwait.\n  I say to my friend from Michigan, I was on an elected board of \ntrustees from a hospital district in 1966 when Medicare came into \nbeing. Prior to Medicare coming into being, 40 percent of the seniors \nwho came into our hospital--it was a county hospital--had no health \ninsurance. We were brutal. That is just the way it was all over \nAmerica. We would go after whoever brought their mother or father, son \nor daughter in the hospital. We would go after them for their wages; we \nwould attach their homes. That was the way it was all over America.\n  Medicare is imperfect, but now virtually every senior citizen who \ncomes into a hospital has some health insurance.\n  In 1966, I think the Senator would agree, there really was not a \nparamount need for a health insurance plan that covered seniors for \nprescription drugs. That was not really a part of the\n\n[[Page S5025]]\n\ntherapy at the time. But now the Senator would also acknowledge the \naverage senior citizen has 18 prescriptions filled every year. They are \nlifesaving. They make people more comfortable. They prevent disease. \nHow can we, the only superpower in the world, not have a prescription \ndrug benefit for the program we call Medicare to take care of seniors? \nWould the Senator respond to that?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator very much for those comments. I \ncould not agree more. When Medicare came into being, as the Senator \nfrom Nevada knows, it provided coverage for the way health care was \nprovided at the time. You went into the hospital, you had an operation, \nand it covered the medications in the hospital. But we all know that \nhealth care has dramatically changed, and we are proud of that. We are \nproud that we have these new lifesaving drugs that stop someone from \nhaving to have the operation. We know most health care now involves \nprescriptions.\n  The problem we have is that this great American success story called \nMedicare that was put into place does not cover prescriptions. So \neffectively, now, we are not providing the health care that we promised \nour seniors and the disabled.\n  So for me and I know for the Presiding Officer and for our leader \nfrom Nevada, it is common sense. It is past time to update Medicare. I \nknow we are urgently trying to make that happen.\n  I thank my friend for raising that. I know we have a tremendous \namount of support all across this country for getting this done. I \noften think, in the debate on health care and this debate on \nprescription drugs, if we only had the same sense of urgency on this \nissue from a policy standpoint that we have when someone in our family \ngets sick or we get sick. When you find you are diagnosed with cancer \nand you have to have cancer medication, you can't say, ``This is too \ntough. We will do it next year. You can have your medicine next year.'' \nOr when your child gets sick, you can't say, ``You can't get sick this \nyear. You can get sick next year.''\n\n  Yet we put off this issue year after year after year. We need this \nkind of urgency that our families feel. I know our leader from Nevada \nfeels that. Certainly the majority leader of the Senate and the \nPresiding Officer from Georgia have eloquently stated this. We are \ngoing to keep coming to the floor, day after day after day, creating \nthis sense of urgency, urging people to get involved with us to create \nthe sense of urgency that we need to get this done.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senator from Michigan has a schedule to meet. \nBut will she yield for one more question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would be honored, yes.\n  Mr. REID. Having listened to the Senator and having listened to the \nPresiding Officer yesterday, I am--I can't say depressed; maybe in a \nlegislative sense I am, but I am terribly concerned that we are wasting \nso much time. Everyone knows this bill that is being slow-walked here \nis going to pass. It has to pass.\n  This bill making supplemental appropriations for further recovery \nfrom the response to terrorist attacks on the United States--we know it \nis going to pass.\n  There are things in it that people may not like. But rather than \nwaste 2 days' time here, why don't they file motions to strike what \nthey don't like. It is a shame we have to invoke cloture.\n  We have spent Monday, we have spent Tuesday, we have spent Wednesday \ndoing basically not much, when we could have been working on this \nlegislation about which the Senator is speaking now, about which the \nSenator from Georgia spoke yesterday. We are wasting time.\n  I can be as partisan as a lot of people, but the State of Nevada is \nequally divided between Democrats and Republicans. I represent the \nRepublicans of the State of Nevada just as I represent the Democrats. \nWe in the Senate have to respond, in my opinion, in that same manner. \nThe people about whom you speak are not Democrats; there are just as \nmany Republicans as Democrats who need Medicare. We have to approach \nthis in that manner. Would the Senator agree?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I could not agree more. I was thinking as the Senator \nwas speaking, we have seniors who got up this morning and literally sat \nat the kitchen table and said: Do I eat today or do I get my medicine? \nDo I pay my utility bill or do I get my medicine? They didn't check to \nsee if their registration card was Democrat or Republican. That is not \nwhat this is about. This is about real people's concerns.\n  People expect us to work together. They expect us to rise above those \nkinds of partisan efforts and work together to get things done for them \nin a meaningful way.\n  So I share the same concern. Every day this week that we are not able \nto address this is another day where thousands, probably millions of \npeople across this country, are trying to decide how to put their \npennies together to be able to afford the medicine that they or their \nfamily need. I would say enough is enough. It is time to get on with \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5025-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5025-S5027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the statement of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and certainly \nthe statement just made by my friend, the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan, Ms. Stabenow.\n  I spend a lot of time in the Chamber, and I really enjoy it. That is \nmy job. I appreciate my ability to do that, that other Senators give me \nthat responsibility. But there are days such as today and yesterday and \nMonday that I am concerned we are not doing enough in this body. I \ndon't know why this is being slow-walked, as has been described in \ntoday's press. I am not making this up. It is right here in the \nCongressional Quarterly:\n\n       Senate Republicans say they will not hesitate to slow walk \n     legislation important to Democrats.\n\n  But as the Senator from Michigan stated, if we passed a prescription \ndrug benefit for seniors--it would be great if we could do it for \neveryone, but let's say we do it for seniors on Medicare--they wouldn't \nknow to whom to give credit, whether it be Democrats or Republicans, \nbut they would be happy they got something. Conversely, our doing \nnothing, the blame goes to both parties. There is no advantage that \nanyone gets by not moving forward on legislation.\n  Pick up the newspaper anytime you want--today. I don't have a clip \nfrom today's paper, but it is easy to find one. Here is one, May 23. It \nwas in my desk. I was cleaning out my desk as the Senator was speaking:\n\n       The Department of Transportation has issued a warning about \n     attacks on rail and transit systems across the country, law \n     enforcement officials said on Thursday. The Department's \n     warning, sent out Wednesday, was consulted by the Department \n     of Transportation.\n\n  The reason that is important is this bill that we are now working on \nhas a provision in it for security. We have almost $1 billion for port \nsecurity. We have $200 million for security at nuclear weapons \nfacilities. We have $154 million for cyber-security, and border \nsecurity.\n  I am a member of the Appropriations Committee. I voted for the bill \nthat came out of committee. But as with all Senators, you don't have an \nopportunity to read everything in a bill. The bill that came out is not \na very big bill. It is 117 pages. I could read the bill easily in a \nhalf hour and really understand everything in it. If there is something \nthat people do not like in the bill, they should try to get rid of it.\n  I think we are doing a disservice to the people of my State of Nevada \nand the country by not moving forward on this. There is no political \nadvantage. I don't know if we can get cloture tomorrow. If we don't get \ncloture tomorrow, we will go again and try it some other time.\n  I don't know what benefit there is of the big stall that is taking \nplace. I think it is a disservice to the country. I have tried on \nvarious occasions during the last several days, I have offered \nunanimous consent requests that we limit the number of amendments. I \nhave offered unanimous consent requests that we have a finite list of \namendments. It doesn't matter how many, but let us know how many so the \nmanagers can work to cut this down.\n\n[[Page S5026]]\n\n  I am very disillusioned with what is happening. I say to the American \npeople that they should send a message to their Senators to move \nforward on this legislation. This legislation is for further recovery \nin response to the terrorist attacks on the United States.\n  I will bet the State of Georgia is hurting for money as a result of \nsome of the spending on antiterrorism, and the State of Nevada. There \nwere a lot of things we were spending money on prior to September 11. \nWe did it to make it a safer place. But for our ports, highways, \nschools, and other things, we are doing more. Nevada and Georgia and \nother States are eating those costs themselves.\n  There is money in this bill to help States, as there should be. We \nare spending lots of money in Nevada training first responders. There \nis $1 billion in this bill, including funds for firefighting grants, \nState and local law enforcement grants, grants to help State and local \npolice to better coordinate their operations, fire and medical \npersonnel, emergency planning grants, and search and rescue training. \nThere is much that will help my State.\n  Frankly, time is of the essence. We would be much better off if this \nbill had passed last week. We would be better off if it had passed \nbefore we took our break for the Memorial Day recess. With each day \nthat goes by, the hard-earned money of the taxpayers of Nevada is being \nspent. They need help on programs. What is another day? Another day \nmeans one more firefighter who is not trained. It means one more police \nofficer who needs additional training. This is not done in a vacuum.\n  On September 11, the actions of evil people killed about 3,000 men, \nwomen, and children--women who were pregnant.\n  What has happened here is a clear illustration of: Do we really care \nabout those people who are dead? I can't in my mind's eye understand \nthe terror that went through the minds of those innocent people on this \nairplane who died in an awful way.\n  That is what this legislation is all about. Can we stop some of that? \nOf course we can.\n\n  There is $125 million for border security. There is $100 million so \nthe Environmental Protection Agency can check the vulnerability and \nassessment of water systems. We have water in Nevada, as we have \neveryplace. You just pull it out of the lake. We have reservoirs. We \ncan pull the water out of the reservoir. If these evil people would fly \nan airplane into a building killing not only the people on the airplane \nbut the people in the building, certainly they wouldn't hesitate in a \nsecond to poison water and sicken and kill people.\n  We need to move forward. I am terribly disappointed that we are not \nmoving forward.\n  I don't know why the President isn't involved. They came down here \nyesterday with a Statement of Administration Policy. The Statement of \nAdministration Policy indicates that there are five or six provisions \nthey don't like in the bill. I have no problem with that. The President \nof the United States has a right to tell us what he doesn't like. But \nwhat I don't like is people coming in saying the President is going to \nveto this bill. There is nothing to veto. If we pass this bill at 6 \no'clock tonight, there will be nothing to veto. There is no bill. There \nis no legislation. We want to get to the House of Representatives so \nthat we can meet and come up with a bill that he can then veto, if he \nwants to. But as Senator Stevens said yesterday, it doesn't happen.\n  We are going to work something out to make the President happy. That \nis the way it works. We are not going to send him an appropriations \nbill--especially an emergency supplemental bill--that he doesn't like. \nHe can't use this as an excuse.\n  My friend from Minnesota is in the Chamber. I am grateful that he \ncame here tonight. I hope tomorrow cloture will be invoked and that we \ncan move forward on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada.\n  First of all, I assume tomorrow there will be time to talk about the \nsupplemental bill. I will not use a lot of time, but we want to finish \nthis work. I am anxious to make a statement on Colombia. Tonight, I \nwould like to talk about this delay. Am I correct there will probably \nbe time to talk about this bill tomorrow?\n  Mr. REID. If cloture is invoked, there will be 30 hours, of which you \nwill have an hour of your own.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I hope we will not have to do that.\n  The only thing I would like to say about this supplemental and where \nwe are is I will refer to an article that the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Miller, wrote in the New York Times. There is a lot of work to \ndo here. I think people are becoming increasingly impatient because we \nare supposed to be here to advocate people, and help and work for \npeople. I think the supplemental bill is a really good bill.\n  I was here the other day talking about one of the most important \nfeatures that Senator Reid was talking about--homeland defense and \nbumping up veteran health care to the tune of about $240-plus million. \nThere are gaping holes in this VA health care. It is serious. It is \nvery serious. We have very long waiting lines right now for primary \ncare and for specialty care. We have a moratorium on any additional \ncommunity clinics. Everybody says they are for the veterans.\n  Frankly, if you get beyond the Fourth of July and Memorial Day and \nVeterans Day, the way to speak for veterans is to live up to our \ncommitment to make sure they get good health care coverage which they \nand their families deserve and expect. That is just one feature in this \nbill. It is important.\n  What bothers me the most is this strategy of delay. It is 10 to 6. We \nare not going to have any more votes. Our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle have pretty much blocked everything for now. We should be \nhaving debate and votes, and we should be moving forward. We should \npass this bill. People can vote up or down. We have a lot of other \npriorities.\n  Again, the Presiding Officer has talked about prescription drugs. In \nMinnesota, about as important an issue as I can think of is affordable \nprescription drugs.\n\n  Frankly, I also like the proposal, and I am part of this work of \nreimportation from Canada because there, by strict FDA safety \nguidelines, you are helping seniors and other working families who \ncannot afford the price.\n  But let's get on with the work. Let's have the debate relevant to \npeople's lives, vote up or down, be held accountable--representative \ndemocracy at its very best, not at its worst.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are just delaying and \ndelaying, slowing the Senate. The Senate machinery is geared to grind \nslowly, but what is going on is just an effort to make the Senate a \nnondecisionmaking body. I do not think we do well for people when we \nare not a decisionmaking body.\n  There are those--I am a big advocate--who want to raise the minimum \nwage. I understand we are going to be dealing with hate crimes \nlegislation, which I think we should.\n  For my own part, I would put right up there with affordable \nprescription drugs wanting to get back to funding education because my \nState of Minnesota believes they have been cheated out of $2 billion \nthey should have had for the next 10 years. We did it in the Senate; it \ngot blocked in conference committee. The House Republican leaders and \nthe White House opposed it. That would have been a glidepath, full \nfunding for the special education program over the next 5 years, then \nmaintaining that for the next 5 years past that. It would have been $2 \nbillion more for Minnesota.\n  Since a lot of our school districts have had to take money from other \nprograms to fund special education because they have not gotten Federal \nmoney, 50 percent of it would have been fungible for special education, \nafterschool, more teaching assistants to help kids who are not doing as \nwell in reading or math, being better able to recruit teachers, being \nbetter able to keep teachers, there is important work to do here.\n  We are not the main player in K-12, but this is a place where we \ncould really make a commitment, and should.\n  I am anxious to get on with the appropriations process. I am anxious \nto get funding for education. I am anxious to talk about education and \nkids.\n\n[[Page S5027]]\n\nFrankly, I am anxious to talk about education, prekindergarten all the \nway through age 65, because I think that is the way we should define \neducation. A lot of our students in Minnesota are 55 and going back to \nschool. They have lost their jobs. They worked for the taconite \nindustry on the range. LTV shut down, and they are going back to school \nso they can get different sets of skills for different employment \nopportunities to support their families.\n  So I would put it to you this way: As I see it, the early years, \nstarting with the little ones, who are all under 4 feet tall and \nbeautiful--we should be nice to them. That is prekindergarten and the \nearly elementary school years. We want to make sure every kid in our \ncountry has an equal opportunity. Education is so important.\n  Then, when people get older, out of school, it is the jobs, decent \nwages, health care coverage. Then, when people get older than that, it \nis Medicare, it is Social Security, it is not losing your pension. \nThere is the whole issue of pension reform so we do not see more people \ncheated and some of them financially destroyed with more Enron kinds of \nsituations.\n  All of this is before us: pension reform legislation, getting it \nright for health care, reimbursement, Medicare. A lot of our hospitals \nin rural Minnesota are being killed right now from inadequate Medicare \nreimbursement. Hospital people have been here talking about what is \ngoing to happen to our ability to deliver care. Children's Hospital \nhere--what is going to happen with cuts in medical education?\n\n  Other people are talking about more funding, expanding health care \ncoverage, prescription drugs, education, raising the minimum wage, \ngoing after hate crimes, ending the discrimination.\n  I will finish this way. Tomorrow, we are going to have close to 2,000 \npeople here from around the country; families who have struggled with \nmental illness. By the way, I do not know that there is a person in the \nSenate who does not know someone in their own family or a friend who \nhas to struggle with this illness, saying: Treat it like any other \nillness. End the discrimination in this coverage. Don't tell us that if \nour daughter is struggling with depression, and we are scared to death \nshe might take her life, that the health insurance plan will cover a \ncouple of days in the hospital and that is it; a couple visits to the \ndoctor and that is it. Treat this illness as any other illness. End the \ndiscrimination.\n  We want to bring this bill to the floor of the Senate. It is \nbipartisan. Senator Domenici has been the leader. I have been fortunate \nenough to join him. We have 66 Senators. We have the majority of the \nHouse on board.\n  There is a lot of important legislation we can pass that will lead to \nthe improvement of the lives of people we represent.\n  I come to the floor tonight just to express some indignation at this \ndelay, delay, delay strategy, slowing the Senate up, making it a \nnondecisionmaking body, because I think we are not at our best when we \noperate that way.\n  I just as soon have at it, have the debate, have the amendments, \nbring the legislation up for votes; vote yes, vote no. If you want to \nfilibuster, filibuster; have the votes or don't have the votes. But \nwhat colleagues are doing now, at 6 o'clock at night--all gone, and \nwill not let us vote on anything else--is making the Senate a \nnondecisionmaking body.\n  Frankly, there is a whole lot we could do to help people. The reason \nwe are here is to help people. We might have different definitions of \nwhat it means to help people, so then let's have a debate about that. \nBut, for God's sake, let's deal with the relevant legislation that \naffects people's lives. And let's do it now. Let's not just continue to \ngrind away and slow everything down and block everything and make it \nimpossible for us to move forward.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator would agree, would he not, that doing nothing \ndoes not meet the needs of the people of Minnesota, the people of \nNevada, or anyplace in this country?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Nevada, only if you believe \nthat we are here to do nothing is doing nothing defensible in any way, \nshape, or form. And that is what we are doing right now. Because if you \nwant to gum up the works here in the Senate and block everything and \nbasically make it impossible for us to move forward--which is what our \nRepublican colleagues have done--you can do that. But I will tell you, \nthe people we represent will not be pleased with us if we operate this \nway.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator know that in this morning's Daily Monitor \nthere is a quote from a Republican--in fact, that is not true. It says: \n``Senate Republicans say they will not hesitate to slow-walk \nlegislation important to Democrats.''\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am sorry. They will not----\n  Mr. REID. `` . . . they will not hesitate to slow-walk legislation \nimportant to Democrats.'' Is the Senator aware of that statement that \nwas made?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Well, see, I would say to my colleague--and he might \ndisagree about this--there are two different issues here. Listen, if \nyou think a piece of legislation is egregious, and you know the rules, \nhave at it, slow it up. Fine. I have done that. I do not want to be \ninconsistent.\n  But when you have a statement like this, which says: We will not be \nreluctant to slow up legislation that is important to Democrats, then \nyou are playing a different kind of game. Then it is straight \npartisanship. It has nothing to do with whether you feel strongly about \nit. It has more to do with a strategy of basically being able to say: \nAha, a majority in a Democrat-run Senate can't get the job done because \nwe will make sure they can't get the job done.\n  That is not acceptable. Do you know what that is? That is inside \nparty strategy, total reelection stuff, which then means we do not pass \naffordable prescription drug legislation, we do not get it right for \neducation, we do not get it right on a whole bunch of other issues that \nare important to people.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, would the Senator agree that this legislation now \nbefore the Senate that is being slow-walked, as the distinguished \nSenator from Texas said yesterday, and he reminded me he said it today, \nhe felt it was important to ``slow the train down''--would the Senator \nagree that it is not good for the country to slow-walk or ``slow the \ntrain down,'' the Supplemental Appropriations Act for further recovery \nfrom and response to terrorist attacks on the United States?\n  This is an emergency supplemental bill. Does the Senator believe this \nis something we should be moving expeditiously?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will just say this to my colleague from Nevada. \nThere are two sets of issues people have, and both of them deal with \nsecurity. There is an uneasiness about economic security, about the \nfuture, about jobs, pensions, good education for kids, health care. It \nis all there.\n  The other thing is that people--and with considerable justification--\nare really worried about physical security. Look what we have been \nthrough. People want to make sure that we are going to be able to do \neverything possible to best defend ourselves, everything possible to \nhead off any kind of attack, everything possible to protect them, to \nprotect their children.\n  So all of the money for Minnesota and all the other States in the \ncountry, for homeland defense, I do not think the people view as a \nwaste. I do not know what the problem is in moving this matter forward. \nI think people in Minnesota and the people in the country--if they \nknow; and we will make sure they know--disapprove, and for good reason.\n  I came to the floor to call on my colleagues to get going. Let's do \nthe work. Let's get involved in the work of democracy. Let's not just \ndo delay, delay, delay, all for the sake of some party strategy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5027-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5027-S5030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRANSPORTATION SECURITY\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Transportation, I rise this evening in strong support \nof the Senate amendment to H.R. 4775, the supplemental appropriations \nbill for 2002.\n  During our debate, I have heard complaints from some colleagues that \nthis\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n\nbill is beyond the President's request. Members are asking why this \nbill is larger than the administration's request and why it is larger \nthan the House-passed bill. Our bill is larger because it makes the \ncritical investments we need to make in transportation security.\n  We have spent months listening to the experts and finding out what \ninvestments we need to make. We did that in my own subcommittee, and \nthrough Senator Byrd's leadership we discovered the needs through full \ncommittee hearings on homeland defense. The President's budget and the \nHouse budget do not make the necessary investments in transportation \nsecurity. Our bill does. That is why it is larger than the President's \nrequest.\n  I want to spend a few minutes explaining what is in our bill because \nit will prove that these are critical investments that the President \nand the House have not been willing to make.\n  For example, our bill funds the Transportation Security \nAdministration. It will improve cargo security. It will enhance the \nsecurity in and around our Nation's airports. It will improve security \non inner-city buses. It will allow the Coast Guard to assess the \nvulnerability of our seaports. It will ensure that the FAA can meet the \nstaffing needs at our Nation's control towers this summer without \nstealing from the budget for modernization and safety improvements. It \nwill better reimburse our Nation's airports for the considerable \nexpenses they have incurred due to our new security requirements. \nOverall, it will address the security challenges we all know are out \nthere.\n\n  Before I talk about some of the specifics of the bill, I want to \ncorrect the record on one point. I have heard some claim that our bill \nis $2.2 billion larger than the House-passed bill. That is simply not \naccurate. While some in the House claim their bill is $28.8 billion, it \nis actually $30.1 billion when we use traditional, customary \nCongressional Budget Office scorekeeping. Instead of using that method, \nthey have used accounting gimmicks. For some items in their bill they \nhave actually chosen to use OMB scorekeeping; for example, concerning \nthe delays in the availability of airline loan guarantees.\n  That point aside, the Senate bill is larger than the President's \nrequest and the House request, and one of the largest differences is in \nthe area of transportation security. In this area, the funding level in \nour bill is $928 million or 20 percent higher than the administration's \nrequest.\n  It is important to point out that the House of Representatives \nactually cut the President's request for transportation security. That \nis why the Senate bill is $1.244 billion or 29 percent higher than the \nHouse-passed bill.\n  The centerpiece of the transportation chapter of this bill is the \n$4.7 billion the committee has included for the new Transportation \nSecurity Administration, or TSA. That amount is more than $300 million \nhigher than the level requested by the administration and more than \n$850 million more than what is provided in the House bill.\n  First and foremost, the funding provided for the TSA will fully cover \nthe administration's request to implement the recently enacted Aviation \nand Transportation Security Act that the President signed into law.\n  The House version of the bill imposes several cuts to the \nadministration's request just at the time that the administration is \naggressively seeking to meet the deadlines imposed by the \nTransportation Security Act. The most daunting of these deadlines is \nthe requirement to screen all checked baggage for explosives by the end \nof this calendar year.\n  As many of our colleagues, I have been frustrated with the \nperformance of the Transportation Security Administration in \nimplementing those requirements. There has not been sufficient \nconsultation with the Nation's airports or with Congress, and there has \nnot been a sufficient amount of hiring at the TSA of individuals with \ntransportation backgrounds. But still I don't think the solution to \nthese problems is to impose significant cuts on the resources the \nadministration itself has requested.\n  As with most of my colleagues, I do a lot of flying. I have witnessed \nthe long lines of passengers seeking to get through airport security \ncheckpoints. I have shared the frustration of clearing the security \ncheckpoint only to be screened at the gate again. Our aviation industry \nis already suffering due to the fact that the high revenue business \ntravelers who provide 40 percent of the airline's revenues are not \nreturning to the skies.\n  If the Transportation Security Administration does not succeed at its \nstated goal of providing high-quality customer service and a short wait \nto clear airport security, our aviation industry is going to suffer a \ngreat deal further.\n  Secretary Mineta and Transportation Under Secretary Magaw have \ncommitted themselves to a national standard where no passenger will \nwait longer than 10 minutes to clear airport security. Frankly, many of \nus question whether they will ever achieve that goal. That is why the \nbill before us contains a requirement that the TSA publish on a monthly \nbasis the actual wait times at each airport. I intend to monitor the \nTSA's performance in this area on a regular basis.\n\n  Another area of great concern to me is that air passengers are \ntreated with dignity as they pass through our Nation's airports. If \npassengers can be expected to be treated as criminals from the moment \nthey walk into the airport, they are not going to fly. Treating air \npassengers as criminals is not a formula for helping our airlines get \nback on their feet.\n  The administration's TSA budget has gone through a very torturous \npath. A full month passed from the time the Bush administration \nsubmitted its $4.4 billion supplemental budget request for TSA to the \ntime Secretary Mineta could sit down with members of our committee and \ndiscuss what funds could be used for.\n  That was not necessarily Secretary Mineta's fault. He was spending \nthat month arguing with the President's Office of Management and Budget \non how much money we needed to implement the requirement to screen all \nchecked baggage for explosives. When the noise finally quieted down \nbetween the DOT and OMB, the results were, frankly, very disappointing. \nRather than deploy a significant number of explosive detection system, \nEDS, machines that can be easily integrated at the airports' luggage \ndistribution system, the administration has chosen to take a cheaper \nroute. They want to deploy only trace detection machines at three-\nquarters of our Nation's airports. These trace detection machines are \neffective at detecting explosives, but they were never designed or \nintended to be primary explosive detection mechanisms at our airports.\n  What I find most troubling is the TSA's plan to require more than \nhalf of passengers' bags to be opened by Federal enforcement personnel \nat three-quarters of our Nation's airports. I don't believe the flying \npublic is going to be very warm to the idea that more than half of \ntheir luggage will be checked by Federal personnel who will rifle \nthrough their baggage in the airports.\n  As such, the committee has included directives to the TSA to ensure \nthat this regime is implemented with dignity and privacy in mind so \npassengers will not have to open their baggage in full view of all the \nother passengers with whom they are traveling.\n  The committee appropriation for the TSA includes a $35 million \ninitiative in the area of aviation safety and security that was not \nrequested by the administration. Those funds are to be used exclusively \nfor enhanced perimeter security and terminal security. Unfortunately, \nit is not necessary to get through the security checkpoints to attack \nour Nation's aviation system.\n  A terrorist can do a great deal of damage to our aviation system \nmerely by performing a terrorist act within a crowded airport terminal.\n  I believe we need a stronger surveillance regime in our airport \nterminals, and the funding entered by this committee will be used for \nthat purpose.\n  Also, the record indicates that more needs to be done to ensure that \nonly those individuals who are properly credentialed and qualified are \ngranted access to the secure areas of our airports.\n  Over the last few months there has been a spate of indictments and \narrests of individuals who used falsified documents to gain access to \nsecure areas of our airports. The additional funding provided by our \ncommittee will ensure better protection of those areas.\n\n[[Page S5029]]\n\n  Now, perhaps these are improvements that the OMB considers to be \nunnecessary security add-ons, but I recommend that Director Daniels \nreview the testimony of both Secretary Mineta and Under Secretary Magaw \nbefore making these complaints. Both of those gentlemen identified \nperimeter security as an area of significant need. That is not \nadequately funded under the President's proposal.\n  In the area of port and maritime security, the committee has included \nseveral new funding initiatives over and above those requested by the \nadministration.\n  In the last supplemental appropriations bill, the committee included \n$93 million for a new advanced program to beef up security in our \nNation's seaports. That $93 million appropriation elicited almost $700 \nmillion in applications.\n  In order to better meet that demand, the Senate bill includes an \nadditional $200 million in the bill and also includes a $28 million \ninitiative to deploy Operation Safe Commerce.\n  During our full committee's hearings on homeland defense in April and \nMay, we heard testimony from ADM Richard Larrabee. Admiral Larrabee \nrecently retired from the Coast Guard and became the director of \ncommerce for the ports in New York and New Jersey. He was sitting in \nhis office in the World Trade Center when the terrorists attacked and \nhe lost dozens of his colleagues on that day.\n  Admiral Larrabee, along with CDR Stephen E. Flynn, Coast Guard, \nRetired, testified before our Appropriations Committee about the \nurgency of establishing a security regime to security cargo containers \nfrom the point of origin to their domestic destination.\n  In addition to the work of the full committee on this issue, the \nsubcommittee has held 2 hearings on this issue, hearing from the \nadministration, labor, industry, port authorities, and others in the \nfield. It is difficult to overstate the importance of beginning to deal \nwith this set of issues now.\n  Over 30 million intermodal containers enter our Nation's seaports \neach year and, frankly, we know very little about what is in them.\n  Between the Coast Guard and Customs Service, fewer than 2 percent of \nthose containers are ever physically inspected. The Customs Service has \nonly recently begun to beef up the reporting requirements regarding the \ncontent of those containers.\n  The Operation Safe Commerce initiative in our bill will be deployed \nat the three largest container load centers in our country. Together, \nthose port areas take in more than 50 percent of the containers that \nenter our country every year.\n\n  It is impossible to exaggerate the damage that could be done to our \neconomy if we are suddenly required to slow down the trade lanes into \nand out of our country because of security concerns.\n  This initiative will demonstrate the art of the possible when it \ncomes to improving security of container shipping.\n  Also, within the amount provided for the TSA, the committee provided \n$20 million for improved security for over-the-road bus operators.\n  I wish to particularly commend the leadership of my colleague from \nGeorgia, Senator Max Cleland, on this issue. As he notes, intercity bus \ntransportation is part of our country's vital infrastructure. The \nNation's intercity bus operators are just beginning to use the most \nrudimentary methods to better ensure security of bus passengers. Given \nthe frequency with which we see terrorists overseas use buses as a \nvenue for horrific acts of terrorism, this is the minimal investment we \nshould be making in this area.\n  The Senate bill provides slightly more than $666 million for the U.S. \nCoast Guard. Those funds will be used to accelerate the Coast Guard's \nplanned vulnerability assessments of our Nation's seaports.\n  Funds will also be used to expedite procurement of critical surface \nand aviation assets and to launch a new maritime domain awareness \nprogram to dramatically improve the Coast Guard's readiness to deal \nwith domestic terrorist threats.\n  During our committee's hearing with Admiral Larrabee, we were \ndisappointed to hear that the Coast Guard doesn't plan to conduct its \nvulnerability assessment of the second largest shipping port in the \nUnited States for 2 years. The committee did not consider that to be a \nsatisfactory plan. So our bill grants the Coast Guard funds to expedite \nthese port vulnerability assessments across the country so we can \nbetter secure these gateways of the globe.\n  The bill also includes $115 million that was not requested by the \nadministration for the emergency funding needs of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. Since September 11, the FAA has had to spend at least \n$100 million to dramatically enhance security around its own critical \nair traffic control towers.\n  As a result, the FAA now finds itself $100 million short of the \namount it needs to provide critical overtime expenses for air traffic \ncontrollers as we enter the busy summertime travel season.\n  Senators will remember, as I do, that during the two summers prior to \nSeptember 11, air transportation in our country was rife with delays. \nIf we don't adequately fund the shortfall in overtime at the FAA, we \ncan expect to experience those delays again.\n  The administration's budget proposed to meet this $100 million \nshortfall by transferring funds already appropriated to improve air \ntraffic control equipment, safety, and capacity. To me, that is not a \nresponsible solution. We are years, if not decades, behind where we \nneed to be in modernizing our air traffic control system, and we have \nhuge, unmet needs at our airports.\n  That is why our bill provides the $100 million needed to pay for the \nair traffic controllers without stealing from those other accounts.\n  The Senate bill also includes an additional $100 million to better \ncompensate the Nation's airports for the security costs they have \nincurred since September 11. Last year, the committee appropriated $175 \nmillion for that purpose.\n\n  But the airports committed almost $500 million in costs to the FAA \nfor this funding. This additional $100 million will better reimburse \nthe Nation's small, medium, and large hub airports for the costs \nassociated with the security directives issued by the FAA since \nSeptember 11.\n  Finally, separate from the issue of homeland defense, the bill \nincludes a provision drafted by Senator Harry Reid and myself \nauthorizing a higher obligation ceiling for the Federal Aid Highway \nProgram for fiscal year 2003.\n  As Members should be aware, the administration's budget proposes that \noverall highway funding to the States be drastically slashed by $8.6 \nbillion next year. That represents a cut of more than 27 percent.\n  Senator Reid serves as the chairman of the authorizing subcommittee \nfor highways, and the provision he and I drafted will ensure that, as \npart of the appropriations process for 2003, the Appropriations \nCommittee will restore at least $4.5 billion of the President's cut and \nperhaps as much as $5.7 billion.\n  I believe my colleagues will agree that during this uncertain time in \nour economy, we must do our best to avoid the President's proposal to \nslash thousands of jobs and cut our investment in our Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  The provision included in this bill--authorized by Senator Reid and \nmyself--will go a long way toward that goal.\n  I also thank my colleague from Alabama, Senator Shelby, the ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, for his \nassistance in developing the transportation chapter of this bill.\n  I also thank Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens for the bipartisan \nleadership of the Appropriations Committee and for their receptive \napproach to the views of our subcommittee. Both leaders demonstrated \nneeded vision and commitment to exploring and understanding these \nissues of critical importance to our Nation's security and prosperity.\n  I believe the transportation chapter of this bill represents a \nstrong, comprehensive approach to our homeland security needs, and I \nlook forward to arguing for every dollar of this funding when we go to \nconference with the House of Representatives.\n  Each item was developed with thought and care. Each item represents \nan investment that needs to be made.\n\n[[Page S5030]]\n\nEach item will help build a more secure America.\n  The critics of this bill, and those who are impeding progress, put \nthose investments at risk. I ask: What investment in airport security \ndon't you want to make? What investment in seaport security don't you \nwant to make? What will you say to the American people--our soldiers \nand sailors who are defending the Nation--when we don't make these \nneeded investments?\n  This is a reasonable bill. It takes a reasonable approach to \ninvesting in America's security needs.\n  It was reported unanimously by our committee, and I hope the Senate \ncan dispense with the delays and get on with passing this very \nimportant bill. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I wish to briefly speak about the \nlegislation before us and to lend my support to the supplemental \nappropriations bill. I commend Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens for a \njob well done. They took extensive testimony in many hearings to \ndetermine the needs for homeland security, as well as many other needs, \nand they have incorporated those provisions in this bill.\n  I also salute and commend my colleague from Washington State, Senator \nMurray, for giving an excellent discussion of the transportation \naspects of this bill. She indicated the detailed and the careful \ndeliberation that went into the crafting of this legislation and \nsuggested also the reality that was confronted by the committee in \nhearing testimony from witnesses who indicated it might take up to 2 \nyears to do a survey of a port when, in fact, the American people are \ndemanding action immediately, not 2 years from now--when the threat is \nimmediate, not hypothetical or 2 years removed.\n  As a result, I find it ironic, to say the least, that opponents of \nthis bill would simply say we will sacrifice all the needed expenses \nbecause the total that we recommend is higher than that recommended by \nthe President of the United States.\n  Frankly, if you asked most Americans, they would say we are not \nspending enough on homeland security. If you asked them how much they \nwould want us to spend, it would be: Spend as much as you need to \nensure not just one port or one airfield but every port and every \nairfield, and to ensure every community in America is protected. That \nis what this bill attempts to do.\n  This is a downpayment on a much larger bill because the issues and \nthreats we confront will not be banished within a few weeks or a few \nmonths. It is long term, ongoing, requiring a tremendous commitment of \nresources. This is a good downpayment and one that I support \nwholeheartedly.\n  The legislation includes within its provisions $14 billion for the \ncost of our operations in Afghanistan. To delay this bill any longer \nbecause of some objections or some overall objection and compromise for \ndelaying funds for Afghanistan, to me, is inconceivable. We have those \nresources which we must commit and we must spend immediately.\n  The bill also includes $5.5 billion for the recovery of New York \nCity--again, expenses that we cannot ignore, cannot defer. We have to \nrespond.\n  There is $4.4 billion for aviation security, once again, a critical \naspect of our response to the very real threats we face today because \nof terrorist attacks on the United States.\n  The bill contains $1.95 billion for international programs to aid the \nwar on terrorism. These are important complements to our military \noperations. The administration speaks often, and correctly, about \ndraining the swamp where the terrorists reside. That cannot be done by \nwishing it away. We have to have resources to deal with profound \nproblems across the globe--inadequate education systems, the overall \nthreat of poverty, lack of economic development--all of those factors \nthat contribute directly sometimes, but certainly indirectly, to the \natmosphere that encourages terrorism, encourages those who attack us.\n  I just returned, with some of my colleagues, from a conference of \ndefense ministers in Singapore. If we look across the globe, this \nthreat is very real and very sobering. We need resources to mount a \ncounteroffensive. Those resources are not just military, they also \ninvolve assistance to local governments that are assisting us by \nintelligence operations, by using their military forces and their \nintelligence apparatus to help us in this war on terror. For all these \nreasons, we need to pass this bill and do it promptly.\n  One of the major provisions of the bill is $3 billion for homeland \ndefense, and that incorporates many issues--first responders, police \nand fire--to make sure these very brave men and women have the \nmaterials and the know-how to confront a wholly different threat. I do \nnot think anyone conceived even a year ago that our police and fire \ndepartments would be at the front lines of sophisticated attacks by \nterrorists against the United States, involving mass casualty \noperations and massive destruction, yet they are. We have to give them \nthe tools to do the job, to protect themselves, and to protect the \ncommunities they serve so well. Those provisions are within this bill \nalso.\n  We have to protect our nuclear facilities. It was shocking to me--and \nagain this goes to the credibility of the administration saying they \noppose this bill because we are spending too much. It was reported \nrecently in the press that the authorities responsible for protecting \nour nuclear facilities asked for considerably more money and were told \nby OMB: No, we cannot afford it.\n  We are not going to accept that answer. We want those facilities \nprotected. Where there are nuclear powerplants, where there are nuclear \nfacilities of the Department of Energy throughout this country, we want \nthose facilities guarded, protected to prevent a catastrophic terrorist \nattack. That is one aspect of this bill which is important also.\n  We also have to recognize the issue of biological terror. We \nwitnessed firsthand in this Senate a biological attack. It is \nexpensive, and we simply cannot wait for the next attack. We have to \nanticipate and, through our wise preventive actions, we hope preclude \nany type of attack. But that is not the result of wishful thinking and \nhoping it will not happen. That is putting real resources into \nprevention, into response, into those things that will prepare us for \nany type of mass casualty attack--biological, nuclear, or even a \nconventional weapon that is deployed against our people.\n  I believe the chairman, the ranking member, and the subcommittee \nchairmen and women and their counterparts, the ranking members, have \ndone a very good job responding to the concerns.\n  In the Appropriations Committee when I sat and listened to this \ntestimony from the people who are responsible in the Federal \nGovernment, at the State level, and in the local communities, I did not \nhear: You are spending too much. I heard: We need more help; we have to \nbe responsive. Their position is not sitting here in Washington, it is \nliterally on the front lines of this war on terror.\n  If we listened to the men and women who are directly responsible for \nprotecting the American people from terrorist threats, I think they \nwould say in a very strong and uniform chorus: Pass this bill now. It \nis not too expensive. In fact, it is simply a downpayment on \nsignificant costs we will face in the foreseeable future.\n  Our enemies are implacable. They are determined. They are \nreorganizing to strike again, and if we do not seize the moment and put \nthe resources into a concerted, deliberate, expeditious effort to \nprotect the American people, we will regret it and the American people \nwill suffer the consequences. I urge we pass this legislation as \nquickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5030-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5030-S5031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SENATOR AND MRS. BYRD'S 65TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, a week ago today, on the 29th of May, I was \nfortunate to celebrate 65 years of marriage, 65 years of wedded bliss--\nin this day and age, a somewhat uncommon occurrence. I am sorry this is \nso, for I wish that more people could know the joy I have had in \nfinding one's soulmate early in life and then sharing that deep \ncompanionship over many happy years.\n  In the 16th century, John Ford wrote:\n\n     The joys of marriage are the heaven on earth,\n\n[[Page S5031]]\n\n     Life's paradise, great princess, the soul's quiet,\n     Sinews of Concord, earthly immortality,\n     Eternity of pleasures; no restoratives\n     Like to a constant woman.\n\n  Mr. President, my strength, my comfort, was born Erma Ora James, the \ndaughter of a West Virginia coal miner. She was my childhood \nsweetheart. We married in 1937, in a time of great hardship and trial. \nTogether, we have seen great changes in the world--a world war and \nnumerous other conflagrations around the globe, the dawn of the nuclear \nage, the advent of space exploration, the collapse of communism, \nbreathtaking medical advances, astounding technological growth, rapid \nsocial changes, and resurgent terrors. We have known the highs of life \nand we have known the lows of family life--the delight of two fine \ndaughters growing up, marrying, and having children of their own; the \ntragedy of the loss of a grandson; the indescribable love of holding \nnewborn great granddaughters in our arms. For two hillbillies--that is \nwhat we are, two hillbillies--from West Virginia, it has been an \nexciting and wild ride, and I am glad I have had Erma to share it.\n  In my mind's eye, Erma Byrd will always be that sweet, young girl who \nallowed me to woo her with candy and chewing gum that were given to me \nby another schoolmate. She is a strong woman, but she is a quiet \nwoman--even somewhat shy. I know she would rather that I were not \nspeaking right now, and that is just the way she is--never seeking the \nlimelight, keeping her focus on her family and her home. Being the wife \nof a Senator has never impressed her. She never developed any airs of \nself-importance, and she has never let me develop any airs either--\nalthough some people may think otherwise. She keeps me grounded, or, as \nmy old mom used to say, she never lets me ``get above my raising.'' \nWhen I start to get a bit too proud, puffed up with my own \naccomplishments, she doesn't pop my balloon but, rather, knows how to \ngently deflate it before it swells too large. But she has always been \nthere for me, helping me to campaign, always making herself available \nto the people of West Virginia. She is my biggest cheerleader and she \nis my kindest critic.\n  Erma has always been an equal partner in our marriage. Her domain is \nthe home, where she rules as a benevolent dictator. There I am not \nSenator, just Robert. I mop the kitchen floor for her each Saturday \nmorning--or I used to up until about a month ago. She will admit that I \ndon't do the windows. When the duties of the Senate filled all my \nwaking hours, and when I was going to school at night to earn my law \ndegree, Erma kept the home fires burning. She took the lead in bringing \nup our two daughters, teaching them to be the fine women, mothers, and \ngrandmothers they are. Without her help and her support, I could not \nhave put the level of effort into my work that the people of West \nVirginia deserve and have come to expect; I would not have a law \ndegree. Erma proves the old adage that ``behind every successful man is \na successful woman.'' Perhaps Alfred Lord Tennyson put it better when \nhe wrote in ``The Princess'' as follows:\n\n       The woman's cause is the man's: they rise or sink together.\n\n  Mr. President, together, Erma and I are complete and whole, a total \nthat is more than the sum of its parts.\n  The 65th wedding anniversary is, by tradition, a diamond anniversary. \nIn my life, Erma Ora Byrd is the diamond. She is my strength in times \nof fear, my comfort in times of sorrow, my perfect complement. She is a \npriceless treasure, a multifaceted woman of great insight and wisdom, \nof quiet humor and common sense. She is the reservoir of serenity at \nwhich one can slake the thirst of a stressful day.\n  I can only thank her and thank the Creator that she has put up with \nme for 65 years and now 1 week.\n  Mr. President, I would like to close with the words of Charles \nJeffreys in a poem he titled ``We Have Lived and Loved Together.'' I \ndedicate it to my wife Erma and to all the lucky, happy couples who \nhave, like us, been fortunate to spend a lifetime together. To the \nyoung married people who work for me, to all who are starting on their \nmarried lives together, I wish them well, and I hope that someday this \npoem will speak for them as well.\n\n     We have lived and loved together\n     Through many changing years;\n     We have shared each other's gladness\n     And wept each other's tears;\n     I have known ne'er a sorrow\n     That was long unsoothed by thee;\n     For thy smiles can make a summer\n     Where darkness else would be.\n\n     Like the leaves that fall around us\n     In autumn's fading hours,\n     Are the traitor's smiles, that darken\n     When the cloud of sorrow lowers;\n     And though many such we've known, love,\n     Too prone, alas, to range,\n     We both can speak of one love\n     Which time can never change.\n\n     We have lived and loved together\n     Through many changing years,\n     We have shared each other's gladness\n     And wept each other's tears.\n     And let us hope the future,\n     As the past has been will be:\n     I will share with thee my sorrows,\n     And thou thy joys with me.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5031-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JUDGE EUGENE SULLIVAN\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Judge \nEugene R. Sullivan of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.\n  Since his graduation from West Point, Judge Sullivan has worked \ndiligently to ensure the betterment of our National being. He first \nproved himself as an Airborne Ranger in Vietnam. His gallantry earned \nhim the Bronze Star and the Air Medal, to name just a few of his \ndecorations.\n  Upon leaving the Army, Judge Sullivan has led a most amazing life. He \nfirst graduated from the Georgetown University Law Center. Following \nhis time at Georgetown, Judge Sullivan went on to work for the law firm \nof Patton-Boggs. During his tenure there, he had the privilege of \nserving on the Defense Team for President Richard Nixon.\n  In the years following, Judge Sullivan returned to public service as \nan attorney for the Justice Department and as the General Counsel for \nthe United States Air Force. In addition to his duties as General \nCounsel, the Judge also served as the Chief Legal Advisor to the \nNational Reconnaissance Office and eventually as the Governor of Wake \nIsland. His service was most exemplary.\n  Since 1986, Judge Sullivan has served as a member of the Federal \nbench. Many of us had the privilege of presiding over his appointment \nand his subsequent confirmation as the chief judge of the Court of \nAppeals for the Armed Forces.\n  In closing, I want to publicly thank Judge Eugene Sullivan for his \nservice and dedication to our Nation. Moreover, I thank him for being \nmy friend and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5031-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5031-S5032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ENERGY BILL CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, about 2 weeks ago I urged that the \nHouse leadership go ahead and appoint conferees for the energy bill on \nwhich we should be in conference at this point.\n  As Senators will remember, we passed the energy bill in the Senate on \nApril 25. The respective leaders of the two parties appointed conferees \non May 1. Since then, we have not seen any action on the House side to \nappoint conferees so we could begin a conference with the House of \nRepresentatives on this very important bill.\n  The House bill is in excess of 500 pages. The bill we passed in the \nSenate after 6 weeks of floor debate is nearly 1,000 pages in length. \nIt will take several weeks to come to agreement on a joint proposal we \ncan take back to the two Houses and, hopefully, to the President.\n  The sooner we can get started, the better for everyone's point of \nview. It is in the country's interests that we try to resolve the \ndifferences between the House and the Senate and try to enact an energy \nbill this year. As long as we do not have conferees named on the House \nside, that makes it extremely difficult. I, again, urge the leadership \non the House side to appoint their conferees.\n  When I raised this issue last month, one of my colleagues announced \nhe had heard that the House of Representatives was going to appoint its \nconferees on the first day back after the recess. Well, that would have \nbeen yesterday, and we still don't have any forward\n\n[[Page S5032]]\n\nmotion. I am getting ready to borrow Senator Lott's bloodhounds to go \nlooking for the House conferees.\n  We have an immense undertaking before us in terms of getting a \nbalanced and comprehensive energy bill to the President's desk. The \nHouse bill is over 500 pages and the Senate bill is nearly 1000 pages. \nThere are some similarities between the bills, but some very important \ndifferences, as well.\n  Conferences on authorizing legislation are never easy. The \nbioterrorism bill, for example, took months to conference. The \nbankruptcy bill has been in conference for over a year. To have a \nsuccessful conference on the energy bill will take a lot of careful \nplanning on the part of the leadership on both sides in both Houses of \nCongress. As I mentioned before the recess, even the most elementary \nquestions, such as who should chair the conference, seem to be in \ndispute, although I think that the precedents are clearly in the \nSenate's favor.\n  We need to get going, and the actual naming of conferees by the House \nof Representatives, whenever it happens, will only be a start to a \nprocess of figuring out how the conference will be structured, whether \nthere will be subconferences, and which issues to address first. I am \nanxious to start to work with whomever the House of Representatives \ndecides will be my counterpart to initiate the organizational \ndiscussions.\n  To be most effective with the use of our time, we may have to think \nabout taking on the big issues first to see if there is an overall \nenergy bill that can achieve a critical mass of support on both sides \nof both House and Senate. If we adopt an incremental approach of \nworking on minor issues first, and leaving all the hard issues to the \nend, we may be still working on clearing the legislative underbrush in \nDecember.\n  I hope that we can see some progress soon on starting the energy \nconference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5032-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SUPPLEMENT TO RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, on May 22, I was joined by my colleague, \nSenator Dorgan, in introducing the Professional Boxing Amendments Act \nof 2002. This legislation would strengthen existing Federal boxing laws \nby making uniform certain health and safety standards, establish a \ncentralized medical registry to be used by local commissions to protect \nboxers, reduce arbitrary practices of sanctioning organizations, and \nprovide uniformity in ranking criteria and contractual guidelines. This \nlegislation would also establish a Federal regulatory entity to oversee \nprofessional boxing and set uniform standards for certain aspects of \nthe sport.\n  Since 1996, Congress has acted to improve the sport of boxing by \npassing two laws, the Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996, and the \nMuhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act of 2000. These laws were intended to \nestablish uniform standards to improve the health and safety of boxers, \nand to better protect them from the sometimes coercive, exploitative, \nand unethical business practices of promoters, managers, and \nsanctioning organizations.\n  While the Professional Boxing Safety Act, as amended by the Muhammad \nAli Act, has had some positive effects on the sport, I am concerned by \nthe repeated failure of some State and tribal boxing commissions to \ncomply with the law, and the lack of enforcement of the law by both \nFederal and State law enforcement officials. Corruption remains endemic \nin professional boxing, and the sport continues to be beset with a \nvariety of problems, some beyond the scope of the current system of \nlocal regulation.\n  Therefore, the bill we are introducing today would further strengthen \nFederal boxing laws, and also create a Federal regulatory entity, the \n``United States Boxing Administration'', USBA, to oversee the sport. \nThe USBA would be headed by an Administrator, appointed by the \nPresident, with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n  The primary functions of the USBA would be to protect the health, \nsafety, and general interests of boxers. More specifically, the USBA \nwould, among other things: administer Federal boxing laws and \ncoordinate with other Federal regulatory agencies to ensure that these \nlaws are enforced; oversee all professional boxing matches in the \nUnited States; and work with the boxing industry and local commissions \nto improve the status and standards of the sport. The USBA would \nlicense boxers, promoters, managers, and sanctioning organizations, and \nrevoke or suspend such licenses if the USBA believes that such action \nis in the public interest. No longer would a boxer like Mike Tyson be \nable to forum-shop for a State with a weak commission if he is \nundeserving of a license.\n  The fines collected and licensing fees imposed by the USBA would be \nused to fund a percentage of its activities. The USBA would also \nmaintain a centralized database of medical and statistical information \npertaining to boxers in the\n\n[[Page S5033]]\n\nUnited States that would be used confidentially by local commissions in \nmaking licensing decisions.\n  Let me be clear. The USBA would not be intended to micro-manage \nboxing by interfering with the daily operations of local boxing \ncommissions. Instead, the USBA would work in consultation with local \ncommissions, and the Administrator would only exercise his/her \nauthority should reasonable grounds exist for intervention.\n  The problems that plague the sport of professional boxing compromise \nthe safety of boxers and undermine the credibility of the sport in the \neyes of the public. I believe this bill provides a realistic approach \nto curbing these problems, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nproposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5033-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TUNA PROVISION IN THE ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCES ACT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nwith the tuna provision in the Andean Trade Preferences Expansion Act \n(ATPEA) portion of the Trade Act of 2002. The purpose of ATPEA is to \nencourage economic opportunities other than drug production and trade \nin Andean nations. Previously, canned tuna has not been included in the \nlist of items given preferential tariff treatment. The provision \nincluded in the Trade Act would authorize the President to extend duty-\nfree treatment to a specified level of imports of canned tuna from \nAndean nations.\n  The Philippines, an important ally in the war on terrorism, is likely \nto be harmed economically by the unintended consequences of this \naction. The canneries and most of the tuna fishing fleet of the \nPhilippines are based on the island of Mindanao. The tuna industry \ndirectly accounts for 45,000 jobs on Mindanao and approximately 105,000 \npeople are employed in supporting industries. These jobs are being \nrisked by the Andean Trade Preferences Act.\n  It is also important to note that the Abu Sayyaf, which is believed \nto be linked to the al-Qaida terrorist network, operates in the \nMindanao region. The Abu Sayyaf organization has been responsible for \nkidnappings, executions, and bombings. U.S. Armed Forces are assisting \nthe Philippines in combating the terrorist group. Providing \npreferential tariff treatment to tuna from Andean nations has the \npossibility of destabilizing a region in which we have U.S. troops \ninvolved in anti-terrorism operations.\n  It is my hope that the conferees can effectively address this \nimportant national security issue and prevent economic disruption in a \nregion where a war on terrorism is being fought.\n  The tuna tariffs reveal a need for enhanced coordination of trade \npreferences. A thoughtful strategy of balancing trade preferences must \nbe developed to prevent future policy inconsistencies in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5033-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 7, 1993 \nin Azusa, CA. A gay man was beaten to death. The attackers, Joshua \nSwindell, 21, and Steven Matus, 17, were charged with murder and \ncommitting a hate crime in connection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5033-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INITIAL SCOPE OF JOINT INQUIRY\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

and to lay a basis for assessing the \n     accountability of institutions and officials of government.\n\nThe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and House Permanent Select \n  Committee on Intelligence Adopt This Initial Scope of Joint Inquiry\n\n       Pursuant to section 5(a)(1) of Senate Resolution 400, 94th \n     Congress, Rule 6 of the Rules of Procedure of the Senate \n     Select Committee on Intelligence, Rule XI(1)(b) of the Rules \n     of the House of Representatives, and Rule 9 of the Rules of \n     Procedure of the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, the two Committees have authorized an \n     investigation, to be conducted as a Joint Inquiry, into the \n     Intelligence Community's activities before and after the \n     September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. \n     The Committees have undertaken this Joint Inquiry pursuant to \n     their responsibility to oversee and make continuing studies \n     of the intelligence activities and programs of the United \n     States Government and all other authority vested in the \n     Committees.\n       The purpose of this Joint Inquiry is--\n       (a) to conduct an investigation into, and study of, all \n     matters that may have any tendency to reveal the full facts \n     about--\n       (1) the evolution of the international terrorist threat to \n     the United States, the response of the United States \n     Government including that of the Intelligence Community to \n     international terrorism, from the creation of the Director of \n     Central Intelligence's Counterterrorist Center in 1986 to the \n     present, and what the Intelligence Community had, has, or \n     should have learned from all sources of information, \n     including any terrorist attacks, or attempted ones, about the \n     international terrorist threat to the United States;\n       (2) what the Intelligence Community knew prior to September \n     11 about the scope and nature of any possible attacks against \n     the United States or United States interests by international \n     terrorists, including by any of the hijackers or their \n     associates, and what was done with that information;\n       (3) what the Intelligence Community has learned since the \n     events of September 11 about the persons associated with \n     those events, and whether any of that information suggests \n     actions that could or should have been taken to learn of, or \n     prevent, those events;\n       (4) whether any information developed before or after \n     September 11 indicates systemic problems that may have \n     impeded the Intelligence Community from learning of or \n     preventing the attacks in advance, or that, if remedied, \n     could help the Community identify and prevent such attacks in \n     the future;\n       (5) how and to what degree the elements of the Intelligence \n     Community have interacted with each other, as well as other \n     parts of federal, state, and local governments with respect \n     to identifying, tracking, assessing, and coping with \n     international terrorist threats; as well as biological, \n     chemical, radiological, or nuclear threats, whatever their \n     source (such as the Anthrax attack of 2001)\n       (6) the ways in which the Intelligence Community's \n     responses to past intelligence problems and challenges, \n     whether or not related to international terrorism, have \n     affected its counterterrorism efforts; and\n       (7) any other information that would enable the Joint \n     Inquiry, and the Committees in the performance of their \n     continuing responsibilities, to make such recommendations, \n     including recommendations for new or amended legislation and \n     any administrative or structural changes, or other actions, \n     as they determine to be necessary or desirable to improve the \n     ability of the Intelligence Community to learn of, and \n     prevent, future international terrorist attacks; and\n       (b) to fulfill the Constitutional oversight and informing \n     functions of the Congress with regard to the matters examined \n     in the Joint Inquiry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5033-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5033-S5034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BROWNBACK-CORZINE AMENDMENT TO THE ENERGY BILL\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

This is clearly stated in Sections 1103(b)(2) and \n1106(a)(2)(D) of the bill. Within the Department of Commerce, it is my \nintent that these functions would primarily be carried out by the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST. Is this also \nthe intent of the Senator from Kansas?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I concur with my colleague that NIST is the intended \norganization within the Department of Commerce that would primarily be \nresponsible for carrying out the Department's role in implementing \nTitle XI of the energy bill.

Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the great \ntown of Dublin, New Hampshire. This year, as our Nation observes the \n226th anniversary of our independence, Dublin will celebrate the 250th \nanniversary of its founding. It is therefore timely and appropriate \nthat we recognize this unique New Hampshire community.\n  Dublin's rich history is closely entwined with that of our country's. \nIts first settler was William Thornton whose brother, Matthew Thornton, \nwas a delegate to the Continental Congress and one of the signers of \nthe Declaration of Independence. In fact, Matthew Thornton, although he \nnever lived there, was one of the original proprietors of what was then \ncalled Monadnock No. 3 but soon became known as Dublin after the Irish \ncity. Although the ``winds are often strong.'' as described in the \nofficial history of Dublin, the air ``is pure and bracing'' and the \nlocation proved to be ideal. By the year 1775, the town's population \nhad rapidly increased to 305 people. Many came from the Colony of \nMassachusetts seeking greater economic opportunities and were \nundoubtably drawn by the area's natural beauty, dominated most notably \nby Mount Monadnock.\n  As our country strived to build a government free of British control, \nso too did Dublin. In a tradition that continues to this day, the \ncitizens elected Thomas Morse, Henry Strongman and Benjamin Mason to \nthe Town's first Board of Selectmen. Of course, New Englanders, and New \nHampshirites in particular, are known for their fierce independence. It \nis no surprise then that twenty-six Dublin residents fought in the \nAmerican Revolution. At least four town residents were at the Battle of \nBunker Hill--Jonathan Morse, Richard Gilchrist, Thomas Green and John \nSwan. Richard Gilchrist vividly demonstrated the ideals of courage and \nhonor by carrying upon his back from the field of battle Thomas Green, \nwho had been severely wounded in that fight. Jonathan Morse later \nserved at the battles of Bennington, Ticonderoga and Monmouth. He was \nlater described by a friend as being ``so humane and honest, so rough \nand ready that, had he lived to this time, he might have been President \nof the United States.'' I am sure that such a sentiment could describe \nmany other past and present citizens of Dublin.\n  To this day, Dublin continues to be a vibrant community with a \npopulation of over 1400 people. Dublin is home to Yankee Magazine, \nwhich wonderfully chronicles New England's culture, and the Old Farmers \nAlmanac. As a side note, I would point out that since it was first \npublished in 1792, the Almanac has never given an incorrect weather \nforecast. Because of how this town perfectly embodies this way of life, \nit became a well-known summer resort for artists and families from \naround the country. One of the most famous visitors was Mark Twain who \nspent the summers of 1905 and 1906 here. His love of the town was \nclearly evident. His response to a reporter's question that ``Dublin is \nthe one place I have always longed for, but never knew existed in fact \ntill now'' best captures the special feeling Dublin has on those who \nlive there and those who simply pass through its borders.\n  So, on this the 250th anniversary of Dublin, we salute its citizens \nand honor their accomplishments, their love of country and their \noverwhelming spirit of independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5034-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WE THE PEOPLE\n\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, on May 4-6, 2002, students from \nTahoma High School in Washington State joined more than 1,200 students \nfrom across the United States in Washington, D.C. to compete in the \nnational finals of the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution \n2002 National Competition.\n  As a result of their hard work and preparation, the team from Tahoma \nHigh won an honorable mention award in the national finals, becoming \none of just 22 schools from all across America to come away from the \nnational finals with an award. I congratulate all the students who \nparticipated: Heather Aldrich, Laura Baily, Andy Bauer, Travis Beckett, \nLance Bishop, Jonathan Bongard, Sheena Clark, Aimee Craig, Mike \nDeSisto, Casey Dillon, Kiran Garcha, Tyler Hawks, Katie Kennedy, \nRebecca Kennedy, David Knotts, Alissa Loudiana, Julia Lowe, Ryan Marsh, \nJamaica Morris, Michaela Soldano, Kellie Stendal, Stefanie Waldron, \nEmily Walters, Ryan Wells, and Jessica Woodell.\n  This competition marks the eighth consecutive year that students from \nTahoma High School have represented the State of Washington at the \nnational finals. I recognize the dedication of the Tahoma High School \nfaculty, particularly Stephanie Davis, the team's advisor, as well as \nthe hard work and commitment of the students who have made this \ntremendous accomplishment possible.\n  Successful participation in the We the People program requires \nstudents to achieve a high caliber of constitutional knowledge. During \nthe three-day national competition, the students presented oral \narguments on constitutional topics before a panel of judges. Their \ntestimony was followed by a period of questioning by the judges, who \nprobed the depth of their understanding and ability to apply their \nconstitutional knowledge.\n  Again, I applaud the accomplishments of the Tahoma High School team. \nI am confident that their success in the national competition will \nprove to be a useful tool later in their lives as they continue to \nparticipate in the governance of our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5034-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5034-S5035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WOMAN OF MONTANA ESSAY WINNERS\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the \nwinners of the American Association of University Women ``Woman of \nMontana'' essay contest, Gina Young. Her essay is entitled ``Rehbein.'' \nI also congratulate Maureen Sullivan. Her essay is entitled ``Effie \nDockstander Holmes: A Woman for All Seasons.''\n  The essays follow:\n\n                                Rehbein\n\n       When I think of a woman who has dedicated most of her life \n     helping Montana citizens, I think of my grandmother, Mary \n     Alice Rehbein. For fifty years, she has served the state of \n     Montana in the field of public health. During her years of \n     work and dedication, she has earned the respect of people \n     allover Montana, including myself. From her I have learned \n     how to set goals, to accept the differences of others, and to \n     be responsible for myself.\n       R represents responsibility. Mary Alice Rehbein was born in \n     Jamestown, North Dakota, July 20, 1918, to Ed and Mary Louise \n     Barnhart. She had only nine short years to learn the \n     responsibilities and lessons of life from her mother. At the \n     age of nine, Mary Alice lost her mother to breast cancer. \n     After that tragic death, her father could not stand the loss \n     and moved away from Jamestown leaving Mary Alice to be raised \n     by very strict, practical, but loving grandparents. Her \n     grandparents felt that an education was an absolute must. \n     Mary Alice knew that an education was the only way she would \n     be able to survive in the future.\n       E stands for her life-long education. Mary Alice Rehbein \n     graduated from high school in 1937. She attended business \n     college for two years while selling insurance. Mary Alice \n     realized that she was not going to be very successful at this \n     career because she was a woman. This was the time in Mary \n     Alice's life that she needed to re-evaluate her career choice \n     and money situation. She finally withdrew the last seventy-\n     five dollars remaining of her mother's life insurance policy. \n     Mary Alice found that she could enroll in nursing school for \n     exactly that amount, so she jumped at the chance of a \n     lifetime and\n\n[[Page S5035]]\n\n     invested her last penny in her education. Mary Alice's \n     lifetime of nursing and honors began upon the completion of \n     her nursing degree in 1943.\n       H symbolizes Mary Alice Rehbein's various honors. She has \n     been recognized and received numerous awards throughout her \n     years of service. Some of her honors include Sidney's ``Woman \n     of the Year'' award; the Montana State Department of Health's \n     Public Health Nursing Award for Outstanding and Meritorious \n     Work; an award from the Montana State Mental Health \n     Association; an award from the National League of Nursing \n     Board; and the Dr. Mary Souls Nursing Award, which is the \n     highest honor bestowed on a nurse in Montana and North \n     Dakota. Mary Alice has also held many prestigious offices. \n     She served as a representative to the National League of \n     Nursing Advisory Board for the Western Region of the United \n     States; held the position of the vice-president for the State \n     Nurses Association; and is currently the President of the \n     Montana Nursing League and a member of the Governor's \n     Advisory Board for Aging. Each honor and position has \n     recognized her leadership and the services she has given to \n     public health for the state of Montana. Mary Alice Rehbein is \n     proud of her honors and offices, but she feels the greatest \n     reward has been to provide beneficial health care to the \n     citizens of the community.\n       B portrays how beneficial Mary Alice has been to people of \n     Montana. She was the Richland County Health Nurse for forty-\n     five years. During her years of working she saved lives, \n     helped deliver babies, gave shots to patients for illness and \n     immunizations, checked children's posture and teeth, \n     administered medical attention to the rural areas with orders \n     from the doctors, provided nursing care to schools, monitored \n     blood pressures, and provided home health care for those in \n     need. She has traveled to every state, with the exception of \n     Maine and Alaska, as well as to hospitals in Australia, New \n     Zealand, and Russia. In each of her expeditions she studied, \n     shared information, and acquired knowledge about the \n     availability and kinds of community health. Mary Alice \n     Rehbein has enjoyed her nursing career.\n       E denotes all of her efforts and enjoyment. Mary Alice has \n     spent a lifetime providing nursing service and teaching \n     people about health care. Nothing has been more fulfilling \n     than to see the joy of people, at any age, caring about \n     their health, says Mary Alice, and to employ new nursing \n     ideas.\n       I exemplifies the innovative nursing ideas Mary Alice has \n     brought to Eastern Montana. Besides the general health \n     program that Mary Alice Rehbein ran, she was responsible for \n     the Alcohol and Drug Abuse program until it had funding of \n     its own. She ran the monthly, blood pressure clinics for \n     Richland County and was active in finding ways to provide \n     immunization clinics to isolated residents. In the 1950's, \n     she began encouraging the Mental Health professionals of \n     Montana to provide services to people in out-lying areas of \n     Eastern Montana. She has been instrumental in providing home \n     health care to many people who could not get or afford health \n     care. In addition, she provided hospice care. Mary Alice says \n     that nursing is one profession that will not be replaced with \n     total technology, since people will always need ``hands on'' \n     nursing care.\n       N depicts the profession of nursing. Mary Alice Rehbein is \n     the oldest, insured, and licensed nurse in the state of \n     Montana. After her numerous years devoted to helping the \n     residents of Montana, she has retired as Richland County \n     Public Health Nurse. In her free time she visits lonely \n     people who do not have families to talk to, she looks in on \n     people who need nursing care, she continues to stay up-to-\n     date on the latest nursing trends, and she still makes time \n     to take blood pressures in her small community.\n       Out of all of the women who have helped the state of \n     Montana, Mary Alice Rehbein has been one of the most \n     remarkable. She has dedicated her life to helping the people \n     of Montana and has instilled in me the belief that the true \n     treasure of life is a person's health. Therefore, I believe \n     Mary Alice REHBEIN is one of the Great Montana Women.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n            Effie Dockstader Holmes, A Woman for All Seasons\n\n       The door flew open after a sharp knock and a young man \n     burst in. ``Effie, come quick! There's been a terrible \n     accident.'' My grandmother, Effie Clark Dockstader Holmes, \n     quickly gathered up her medical bag and some clean sheets and \n     set out on a run with the young man. My grandma was a \n     registered nurse, the original one woman QRU for Bigfork. \n     Townsfolk came to Effie with all sorts of medical problems, \n     especially for emergencies or accidents. Over the years Effie \n     dispensed comfort, consolation and healing, saving lives and \n     improving the quality of life for many Bigfork residents. \n     Effie never failed to respond.\n       One tragic incident is still very much alive in her memory. \n     ``The little girl just lay there. It didn't look good; it was \n     very serious.'' The child had been accidentally run over by a \n     family friend. My grandma could see that there was little she \n     could do herself for the child's massive injuries. But it \n     would be too late when an ambulance got to Bigfork. So Effie \n     started to Kalispell with the little girl in her car. However \n     the journey was short when the child died on the way to the \n     hospital. My grandmother delivered the devastating news to \n     the family. ``It was very hard, and I shouldn't have been the \n     one to do it, but no one else wanted to . . . .'' My grandma \n     received the Bigfork Citizen of the Year Award in recognition \n     of her contributions to her community.\n       In 1917, my grandmother and her family left Kansas for \n     their new home in Montana. The long, arduous trek in a Model-\n     T Ford took almost a year. The Clarks homesteaded a parcel of \n     land on the east shore of Flathead Lake. After attending \n     grade school in Bigfork, Effie had to live with a family in \n     Kalispell during the week while going to Flathead High School \n     since the trip from Bigfork was too long to make each day.\n       My grandma went on to college at Sacred Heart School of \n     Nursing in Spokane, Washington after high school. Bigfork \n     held a dance at the Town Hall to celebrate the momentous \n     event of Effie's departure for college. She was a trailblazer \n     for her time. After graduation, she took a nursing position \n     in Missoula, returning to her beloved Montana. When her Aunt \n     Effie became seriously ill, my grandma quit her job to care \n     for her aunt in Bigfork, staying on with her uncle after her \n     aunt's death. Amazingly, my grandmother still lives in that \n     same house on Electric Avenue where she took care of her Aunt \n     Effie.\n       My grandmother was introduced to James Dockstader at a \n     dance. When Effie taught Jim to dance, she had no idea this \n     would be the man who would teach her the many lessons of \n     love. My grandparents settled into a farming life, close to \n     the earth and raised three children in Bigfork, each of whom \n     still lives in the area with their families. My grandfather \n     died from cancer on November 20, 1988 at home.\n       Few people get the chance to revisit their past and to \n     choose the ``road not taken,'' but my grandma did. It all \n     began when the day of Bigfork's Whitewater Festival in 1995 \n     proved to be filled with shock, memories of a past romance, \n     and the promise of true love rekindled.\n       My grandma recalls the day when Ernest Holmes swept her off \n     her feet for the second time in amazingly vivid detail. Effie \n     was standing outside her house in downtown Bigfork when a \n     stranger asked if she knew Effie Clark. My grandmother \n     replied, ``I'm Effie.'' ``I'm Prunie,'' Ernest responded, \n     using his old high school nickname. Without hesitation, \n     the two embraced repeatedly and began joyously reminiscing \n     right on Electric Avenue. Their reunion continued over \n     lunch.\n       From that day my grandma was a different person, happier \n     and more full of life than I had ever seen her. This man had \n     long before left a mark on my grandmother's life and heart. \n     Prunie and Effie had been sweethearts when she attended high \n     school in Missoula for one year while her father was working \n     there. Effie returned to Bigfork when her father's job ended \n     the next June. Effie and Prunie were pinned, going steady, \n     and promised to remain true to one another despite the \n     distance. However, an unfortunate misunderstanding broke the \n     two apart, seemingly forever. Ernie was determined to mend \n     the situation and get Effie back, making the long, difficult \n     trip from Missoula to Bigfork in his Model T. However, my \n     grandmother's mind was set and she refused even to come to \n     the door and hear his explanation and apology. Her resolve \n     led to a separation of sixty-six years that was finally \n     bridged that Whitewater Day.\n       After years of raising their own families, Effie and Prunie \n     were finally together again. A whirlwind romance rekindled \n     their love and passion. My grandmother married Ernest Holmes \n     on August 4, 1995, her 85th birthday, and I was the maid of \n     honor! The day was beautiful, the church was filled to \n     overflowing with friends, family and townsfolk, my \n     grandmother was stunning, and it was one of the happiest days \n     of both of our lives. My new grandfather spent five wonderful \n     years with us before he died in April of 2000.\n       Sitting in her chair among the many dolls she has made and \n     collected over the years, with antiques younger than she, my \n     grandmother smiles and laughs with the ease of a child and \n     the wisdom of experience. She has lived through much and seen \n     great changes, learning from it all. Effie Dockstader Holmes \n     is a treasure of Montana, a woman to be remembered always. An \n     intelligent, independent woman who fought against the odds at \n     a time when females usually stayed home, my grandmother is \n     truly a modern pioneer woman. She melded the life of \n     homemaker with the career of caretaker of the sick and \n     injured, her only rewards the thanks of those she helped and \n     the knowledge that she had made a difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5035-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5035-S5036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HEROES AMONG US\n\n Mr. KENNEDY.

It is the oldest black-owned and operated funeral business in \nLouisville. The founder was a man by the name of James H. Hathaway. Mr. \nHathaway officially opened the Hathaway mortuary on Burnett Avenue in \nthe Fort Hill area in 1901. After Hathaway's death, his daughter and \nson-in-law, Columbia and Chester Clark, took over the business, adding \nClark to the name.\n  In 1964, Hathaway & Clark built a new facility in the west end area \nat 2718 Virginia Avenue. In doing so, they became the first black \nLouisville funeral home to erect its own building.\n  Currently, Hathaway & Clark is operated by husband and wife duo, \nLawrence and Violet Montgomery. Lawrence Montgomery, who currently \nserves as the company's president, has worked on and off at Hathaway \nfor about fifty years. His wife Violet has been a full-time employee \nand secretary-treasurer since 1992. They both have worked extremely \nhard to build upon the foundation of service and professionalism that \nHathaway & Clark was built on. During times of grief and sorrow, \nfamilies can feel more secure knowing that Hathaway & Clark will be \nthere to take care of all of their immediate needs. Many of their \ncustomers have been noted as saying how much they like and appreciate \nthe warm feeling and atmosphere created by the staff and management of \nHathaway & Clark.\n  We have all heard the old saying, ``nothing is inevitable except \ndeath and taxes.'' While, I am quite certain that no individual or \ngroup will ever make us feel good about paying our taxes, I do know \nthat families in Louisville can put their loved ones peacefully to rest \nwith the help of Hathaway & Clark.

This was Lansing's third straight \ntrip to the World Series, and their first win.\n  The Stars' season was nothing short of stellar. The Lady Stars broke \ntheir 2001 team record for home runs by sending 83 out of the stadium \nthis year. They also batted a .368 team batting average, the highest in \nthe nation. Finishing the season ranked number two in the nation, the \nLady Stars finished the season with 49 wins and just seven losses. In \nthe three years of the Lansing Community College program, the team \nboasts an overall record of 142 wins and just 25 losses.\n  These statistics don't win a championship on their own, though. The \nLady Stars had to battle through 100 degree temperatures and formidable \nopposition to win three games and the championship on the final day of \nthe series. Great defense, solid pitching, and timely hitting coupled \nwith an experienced ball club made third time the charm for Lansing.\n  This Championship win is a great accomplishment, and I trust that my \nSenate colleagues will join me in congratulating the Lansing Community \nCollege Lady Stars softball team on this commendable triumph.

Dr. Taylor (or \nLaurie as he likes to be called) is one of the major contributors to \nour knowledge of radiation safety, not only in the United States but \nworldwide as well.\n\n[[Page S5037]]\n\n  Laurie published his first paper in 1922 while a student at Cornell \nand has contributed to radiation safety over a span of 80 years, \npublishing over 150 papers, and has written or contributed to over 16 \nbooks.\n  Laurie served as Chairman of the National Committee on Radiation \nProtection (NCRP), the organization he helped establish and led for \nnearly 50 years and the organization now Chartered by the U.S. Congress \nas the National Council of Radiation Protection and Measurements.\n  In addition, his accomplishments include serving as: President of the \nHealth Physics Society, Chairman of the International Commission on \nRadiation Units and Measurements, President of the International \nConference on Medical Physics, Chairman of the Civil Service \nCommission, and Special Assistant to the President of the National \nAcademy of Sciences.\n  A few of the many awards bestowed upon Laurie include: The \nPresidential Bronze Star and the Medal of Freedom from the United \nStates Air Force, The Gold Medal from the Royal Swedish Academy of \nSciences, and The Janeway Medal from the American Radium Society.\n  It is with pleasure that I note that Dr. Taylor's decades of \ncontributions to improving radiation safety throughout the World have \nbeen documented by the Health Physics Society in an edition of their \ninternational journal Health Physics, and their Newsletter.\n  Laurie is, indeed, a person for all seasons: teacher, mentor, \nscholar, leader and visionary.\n  I deeply appreciate all that Laurie Taylor has contributed to this \nNation and the world.

Mr. President, today I recognize a very special \nwoman from the State of Montana who has recently retired from the Burns \nTelecommunications Center. Jacqueline Bean has made a tremendous \ndifference at the Burns Telecommunications Center during her tenure. \nHer level of influence in the telecommunications industry and Montana \nhas been instrumental in promoting, maintaining and establishing a base \nto expand upon the Center and extend its longevity. I cannot tell you \nhow many times Jacqueline stressed the need to ensure the center's \nlong-term impact.\n  Jacqueline's commitment and loyalty to the Burns Telecommunications \nCenter and to the goals I established have helped lead to the success \nof the Center. Jacqueline never lost sight of the vision I had in mind, \nto promote opportunities in education, healthcare, and business \nespecially in rural States like Montana, to work for increased \nindividual opportunity through telecommunications and support Montana \ntelecommunications projects, involving cutting edge technology for \neducation based distance learning programs, telemedicine initiatives, \nand e-commerce across secure computer networks in the global economy. \nJacqueline put forth a whole-hearted effort to increase these \nopportunities for students, teachers, administrators, individuals, and \nemployees across Montana by advancing the Burns Telecommunications \nCenter and its mission.\n  Jacqueline has always gone above and beyond the call of duty. She is \nnot only a woman I admire and respect, she is a close, personal friend \nand I want to extend my personal thanks for all of her support and \neffort on behalf of the Burns Telecommunications Center. I truly \nappreciate Jacqueline's loyalty, dedication and commitment and all that \nshe has accomplished on behalf of the Burns Telecommunications Center. \nWe bid farewell, but not good-bye, to a woman that has brought so much \nintegrity to the Burns Telecommunications Center.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5037-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HARLEM GLOBETROTTERS\n\n Mr. KYL.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to limit access to off-\nsite consequences analysis information in order to reduce the risk of \ncriminal release from stationary sources, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, today I am introducing a bill to help \nprotect communities in Missouri and across the Nation from terrorist \nattack. Chemical plants in communities across America are perfect \nterrorist targets. Right now, the U.S. Government provides a virtual \nblueprint for attacks on these facilities to any member of the public \nwho requests the information--on any terrorists frankly. The Community \nProtection From Chemical Terrorism Act will help protect communities \nfrom terrorists who would use sensitive information made public to \ndestroy those communities.\n  There are 15,000 chemical facilities across the country. Facilities \nstore and use potentially dangerous chemicals to make consumer products \nand keep us healthy. Chlorine, for example, is used by every family to \nwhiten and brighten our clothes. Every child, every senior person, \nevery family across America is able to drink clean water and avoid \ngetting sick because of chlorine treatment.\n  However, we know that chlorine is a dangerous chemical if misused or \nabused. According to EPA, at least 123 plants each keep amounts of \nchemicals that if released, could form deadly vapor clouds that would \nput more than one million people in danger. A plant outside of Detroit \nprojects that a rupture of one of its 90-ton rail cars of chlorine \ncould endanger three million people. Even worse, an accident at a New \nJersey plant in suburban New York City could cover a 14 mile radius \naffecting 12 million people.\n  Missouri is not spared from these dangers. In the Kansas City \nmetropolitan area alone, there are over 100 plants filing reports to \nEPA on their potential chemical accidents.\n  I am holding back on the names and addresses of these facilities, but \ntheir identity and location is no secret to those who want to look. In \nfact, the law currently requires EPA to make this information available \nto the public. You do not even have to look, because the newspapers are \npublishing this information. Here is the front page of the Kansas City \nStar with a story ``Chemical Plants Ordered to Prepare for the Worst.'' \nThe story describes how information on worst-case scenario accidents is \npublicly available to anyone who bothers to look.\n  The San Francisco Chronicle published a story entitled ``If All Hell \nBroke Loose.'' Here you see the newspaper not only describes the \nchemical facilities in Northern California, but provides a map of the \nlocation of the facilities and the radius of potential damage from a \ntoxic release. This newspaper published not only the names and \naddresses of the facilities, but drew a map with their location and\n\n[[Page S5044]]\n\nthe radius of destruction from a release. It helps the terrorists by \nshowing just what radius of death and destruction would occur. This is \nthe front page of a newspaper that is out there for anybody who wants \nto make a terrorist strike in San Francisco. This is published in May \nof 1999. I wonder, after September 11, they would still be so helpful.\n  The reason this is a problem is that this is exactly the type of \ninformation terrorists would use to plan and carry-out an attack. \nFamilies in suburban San Francisco and across the country have a bulls \neye on their communities because terrorists can use this publicly \navailable information to target their attacks.\n\n  By law, the government requires chemical facilities to report to the \ngovernment the hazardous chemicals they have on site and then predict \nthe worst-case scenario for an accident with those chemicals. These \nOffsite Consequence Analysis or OCA reports include the type of \nchemical, the conditions under which a worst-case accident would occur, \nthe distance a toxic cloud of chemicals might travel, the environmental \nor public receptors such as hospitals, schools or national parks in \ndanger's way, and the number of people who would be harmed by an \nattack.\n  According to the FBI, this publicly available chemical facility \ninformation provides a ``blueprint for potential terrorist attack.'' A \nDOJ report analyzing the threat from terrorists abusing OCA information \nsays:\n\n       The distance that a toxic cloud might travel, the numbers \n     of people who might be harmed, and the environmental or \n     public receptors that could be affected are precisely the \n     types of factors that a terrorist weighs when planning an \n     attack.\n\n  Chemical facilities are exactly the type of target terrorists would \nattack to create mayhem and destruction. According to DOJ:\n\n       Certain types of facilities that are required to submit OCA \n     information are preferred terrorist targets. Many such \n     facilities exist in well-populated areas, where a chemical \n     release could result in mass casualties and would result in \n     widespread destruction.\n\n  In a chilling confirmation of this, copies of U.S. chemical trade \npublications were found in one of the cave holes where Osama bin Laden \nhad hidden. They found it with the other rat infestations in December.\n  Terrorists would have little problem searching through government \ncollected OCA. According to DOJ, this data provides ``one-stop shopping \nfor refined targeting information, allowing terrorists or other \ncriminals to select the best targets from among the 15,000 chemical \nfacilities that have submitted OCA data.'' Indeed, accessing this \npublicly available information is easy. In a single afternoon, my staff \nwas able to search and find the top ten facilities across my home state \nof Missouri where terrorist attacks would produce the greatest number \nof casualties. By the end of the day, my staff had the names of the \nfacilities, their street address, the name of the vulnerable chemicals, \nthe conditions under which a worst-case scenario release would occur, \nthe radius of harm caused by the attack, any safety or mitigation \nmeasures plants might use to control the release, and the number of \npeople in the affected area who could be hurt.\n  It was shocking to me that Federal law makes information which \nterrorists could use to destroy communities available to any member of \nthe public.\n  The argument goes that communities want to know about dangerous \nchemicals used and stored in their neighborhoods. That is a legitimate \ndesire. The law further intends that members of the public use this \ninformation to pressure chemical facilities to remove dangerous \nchemicals or change their ways so that neighboring communities are not \nin danger from an accidental release. That also is a very legitimate \nconcern.\n  Unfortunately, the terrorist attacks of September 11th show us that \ntimes are not so simple anymore. The threat from terrorist attack now \noutweighs the benefits of making this information public. We should be \nconcerned about chemical facilities in our communities. However, our \ngreatest concern must be protecting those communities from terrorist \nattack.\n  In a different time, the environmental policy concerns of making \nworst-case scenario chemical accidental data available to the public \nmight have outweighed the security threats to our communities. Sadly, \nthose times have passed. According to the Department of Justice, OCA \nworst-case scenario data continues to present a security threat. The \nthreat from terrorists using OCA worst-case scenario data is even \ngreater after the September 11th terrorist attacks. DOJ believes that \nlegislation is necessary to further limit public access to dangerous \nOCA information.\n  Unfortunately, the current law does not protect our communities from \nterrorist attack. Congress amended the law concerning OCA information \nin 1999. That legislation, entitled the Chemical Safety Information and \nSite Security Act reversed EPA plans to post OCA information on the \nInternet. However, the law left the task of establishing specific \nregulations for publicizing OCA information to EPA and DOJ. Admittedly, \nthe last administration did its work before the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11th. It was a different time then. A legitimate argument was \nmade that environmental policy concerns outweighed the need to protect \ncommunities from terrorist attacks.\n  However, even the restrictions EPA and DOJ devised to limit access to \nsensitive OCA information were quickly overcome by advocacy groups. \nThis story in the New York Times describes how environmental advocates \nput OCA disaster data on the Internet. The caption here is, ``Getting \naround a law intended to avoid helping terrorists.'' My staff used one \nof these sites to help them determine the communities in Missouri most \nat risk from a terrorist attack. This is not fair to the communities \nthat wish to avoid terrorist attacks. Further restrictions are \nnecessary to protect our communities from terrorist attack.\n\n  The legislation I propose today strikes the best balance between \nallowing the public to monitor the actions of the chemical industry and \nprotecting individual communities from terrorist attack. Official users \nengaged in official protection activities will have unrestricted access \nto OCA information. However, my bill will allow members of the public \nto view OCA data on chemical facilities without knowing their specific \nname and location. This will allow advocates to continue watching and \npressuring the chemical industry at-large to make safety improvements \nwithout placing specific communities at risk of terrorist attack. For \nthose environmental advocates that wish to play a role in a given \ncommunity, this legislation specifically expands local emergency \nplanning committees to include members of local and national \nenvironmental organizations. I recognize that these groups have a role \nto play in making our communities safer and hope they will accept this \ninvitation to join in formal community protection activities.\n  Communities have much to fear from terrorist attack. According to \nDOJ, the risk of terrorists attempting in the foreseeable future to \ncause an industrial chemical release is both real and credible. We must \nnot help those terrorists who want to destroy our communities. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Community Protection From Terrorism Act \nand look forward to working with you on its passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be appropriately referred.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 2580. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to require the \nNational Transportation Safety Board to investigate all fatal railroad \ngrade crossing accidents; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fatal \nGrade Crossing Accident Investigations Act. The bill would require the \nNational Transportation Safety Board, NTSB, to investigate the facts, \ncircumstances and causes of all accidents at railroad grade crossings \nin which there is a fatality or substantial property damage.\n  With this bill, we can correct an important gap in our efforts to \nreduce such accidents. Under current law, NTSB investigations of grade \ncrossing accidents are undertaken only in select cases, as highway \naccident investigations. The bill would consider grade\n\n[[Page S5045]]\n\ncrossing accidents instead to be railroad accidents, which under \ncurrent law already must be investigated if there is a fatality or \nsubstantial property damage.\n  We need better information on fatal grade crossing accidents so we \ncan do more to prevent unnecessary loss of life. According to National \nRailroad Administration Safety Statistics, more than 4,000 accidents \nper year occur at grade crossings. In 2000, 425 of these resulted in \nfatalities. Most fatalities occur at what are called passive grade \ncrossings, those offering no warning or signal to a motorist of an \noncoming train. Of Minnesota's more than 8,000 railroad grade \ncrossings, three-fourths are passive crossings. The safety of such \npassive crossings is substantially dependent on such factors as \nphysical layout and the adequacy of the view for drivers of approaching \ntrains. To make good safety choices, communities, transportation \nagencies and departments at the local, state and federal levels need \nbetter information. That is one reason site-specific accident \ninformation is so necessary.\n  NTSB investigations are essential not only to prevent future \naccidents, through recommendations on operating rules such as speed \nlimits, warning or separation devices, improved signaling, signage, \nimprovements for driver visibility and increased enforcement of stop \nsigns at passive crossings. But their investigations often are also the \nonly means of addressing the role of railroads and their personnel in \naccidents.\n  This important issue has been brought to my attention by two \npassionate rail safety advocates in Minnesota, Lillian and Gerry Nybo. \nI have worked closely with the Nybos, who have been at the forefront of \na national movement, ``Citizens Against Railroad Tragedies.'' Their 18-\nyear-old son, Gerry, Jr., was killed three years ago this week at an \nunguarded rail grade crossing in Audubon Township in Becker County, \nMinnesota. He has just graduated from high school, and his life was \nfull of promise. He friend Ryan Nelson was killed in the same accident. \nThis legislation is needed to give families such as the Nybos, who have \nlost family members, the results of investigation into the facts and \ncauses of these accidents. It is in memory of Gerry Nybo, Jr. that I \nintroduce this legislation today.\n  My hope in introducing this bill is to give communities the \ninformation they need to improve safety at dangerous intersections. I \nurge my colleagues to support the bill, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2580\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require a report to Congress on a national \nstrategy for the deployment of high speed broadband Internet \ntelecommunications services, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in 1943, the chairman of a famous \nAmerican electronics company said, ``I think there is a world market \nfor maybe five computers.'' Good guess. Industry has repeatedly \nexceeded expectations like that one, and helped the American economy as \na whole exceed expectations\n  New questions are now reverberating from Silicon Valley to \nPennsylvania Avenue. How do we catch the next great wave of innovation \nand ingenuity to unleash the next great boom of productivity and \nopportunity? How do we find new ways to translate our enormous \ntechnological prowess into real economic progress for the American \npeople?\n  I rise today to introduce what I believe will be a roadmap to \nrevitalization. It's premised on the extraordinary promise of high-\nspeed Internet to help us return to high-intensity growth; by \nrevolutionizing the way we communicate and live our lives. Its goal is \nto highlight the challenges we face in tapping the transformative \npotential of broadband technology, to spur agreement on a national \nstrategy for accelerating its development and deployment, and \nultimately to help bring on what we all hope will be the broadband \nboom.\n  Our country's last big boom was fueled by the most reliable, \nresilient, and renewable source of energy around: America's creative \ngenius. Government paved the road, first with R funding, then in the \n1990s with sound budget policies, but it was our innovation industries \nthat made it happen. In fact, the information technology sector, which \nmade up only 4 percent of GDP, was responsible for a remarkable 30 \npercent of all economic growth between 1995 and 2000.\n  Today, America's high-tech industries, which have survived the big \nbust that followed the big bang of the 1990s, haven't lost their edge. \nInformation technology and the innovation economy, for example, are \nstill among our greatest national resources. But as we've emerged from \nrecession, many businesses across the country have been increasingly \nconcerned about our recovery. How strong will it be? How long will it \nlast?\n  Many in Washington have recognized that broadband can and must be a \nbig part of the solution. But most policymakers have been focusing on \nshort-term obstacles to the next small jump in speed. I think we need a \nlarger and longer vision here. We need to look over the horizon and ask \nwhat it will take to usher in advanced broadband that will make speeds \nof 10 to 100 megabits per second available all across the country, so \nthat we can truly unleash the tremendous economic potential of this \ntechnology.\n  The science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke once said, ``Any \nsufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.'' \nWell, the next generation Internet passes that test. It has the ability \nto levitate productivity, make millions of jobs appear, and transport \nour economy into the future. And there won't be any sleight of hand \ninvolved. Sometimes, there won't even be wires attached.\n  In education, for example, universities, school districts, and \nprivate companies have already started rolling out impressive \napplications of advanced broadband. We're not just talking about \nstreaming video with questions sent through instant messenger. \nBroadband can transform the very nature of instruction, right at the \ntime when schools need more flexible and more powerful learning tools \nto meet higher standards.\n  In healthcare, the possibilities are equally exciting: hospitals \nwithout walls, instantaneous remote monitoring of patient vitals, \ncomprehensive informatics databases that are available to professionals \neverywhere. We even saw the first remote surgery pioneered last fall, \nwhen two surgeons in New York operated on a patient in Strasbourg, \nFrance.\n  Indeed, advanced broadband's ability to both increase economic \nopportunities and improve society in so many fields, from law to \nfinance, from entertainment to agriculture, and from homeland defense \nto international defense, are just astounding.\n  These days, computing power is expanding at an incredible rate. But \nnetworking speed is way behind computing speed. Industry can't make the \nbest use of the computing potential that's available without the pipes \nthat bring it home to consumers and businesses--including and \nespecially small businesses. While we have some good arteries, we don't \nhave the capillaries to carry data all the way.\n  I stand here today to say that we in government can't let this \npotentially fertile field of technology lie fallow. We need to make the \nmost of this moment, in which the high-speed Internet is on the cusp of \ncatalyzing a quantum leap in our economy. Which is to say, we need to \nlead, and seed.\n  Unfortunately, the case for making broadband deployment a priority of \na\n\n[[Page S5046]]\n\nnational economic strategy has yet to be understood adequately by \ngovernment. The broadband buck is still stuck on the government's desk, \nand with it, thousands of new opportunities and millions of new jobs. \nDecisions are piling up: on spectrum, competition, rights management, \nspam, privacy, child protection, and more. These are important issues \nthat need to be resolved, and they need to be resolved comprehensively, \nwith an overarching vision.\n  Last week I released a white paper entitled Broadband: A 21st Century \nTechnology and Productivity Strategy and today I introduce the National \nBroadband Strategy Act of 2002. The white paper analyzes the \nchallenges. The legislation will compel us to meet them, requiring the \nAdministration to develop a national broadband strategy within six \nmonths of passage.\n  Taken together, and working in conjunction with insightful leaders \nand groups in the tech community, I am confident these measures can \nspark the development and implementation of a coherent, cross-agency \nstrategy to eliminate obstacles, create incentives, and encourage \nindustry innovation.\n  In the upcoming months, I'll follow up this report and legislation \nwith proposals on how to reach truly advanced broadband, the speed I \nmentioned before, upwards of 10 megabits per second. There is no focus \non this need now, and that's where government particularly needs to \nlead and seed.\n  The follow-up legislation I'll propose in the coming months will call \non the FCC to develop a regulatory framework to meet the challenges of \nthe next generation Net: propose tax credits for the deployment of \nadvanced broadband, encourage research and development on advanced \nbroadband infrastructure that will enable this technology to reach into \nall the corners and crevices of the country, and present a program to \nincentivize research and development on major applications in areas \nwhere government plays a central role, including education, healthcare, \nand e-government.\n  The public sector cannot and should not manage this effort. Our \nfuture will fortunately be in the hands of thousands of individual \ninnovators. Nor should the government be choosing winners and losers. \nTo benefit consumers, government must be pro-broadband, but technology \nneutral about how business gets there, by encouraging innovation and \nmaximizing competition. Government must clear the path so that business \ninnovators can march forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of \nlegislation. I request unanimous consent that the introductory \nmaterials to my whitepaper and the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord. I note to my colleagues that the full text of the whitepaper is \navailable on my web site, http://lieberman.senate.gov.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2582\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Broadband Strategy \n     Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States needs to develop a long-term \n     investment and growth strategy that will restore the \n     unprecedented gains in structural economic productivity with \n     high employment growth experienced by the United States in \n     the late 1990s.\n       (2) The gains in structural productivity with high \n     employment growth in the late 1990s resulted from \n     unprecedented investments in information and communication \n     technology.\n       (3) It was the precipitous decline in these investments \n     that took the United States economy into recession before \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (4) The United States needs to focus on stimulating \n     resurgence in these investments to regain vibrant growth in \n     structural productivity and high employment growth.\n       (5) If productivity increases at the rate of 1.5 percent \n     per year, the standard of living will double about every 46 \n     years, or about every two generations. On the other hand, if \n     productivity increases at the rate of 3 percent per year, the \n     standard of living will double about every 23 years, or about \n     every generation. This difference results from the so-called \n     miracle of compounding. To take advantage of compounding, a \n     long-term economic strategy for the United States must focus \n     on structural productivity growth.\n       (6) Productivity growth has enabled American workers to \n     produce 30 times as much in goods and services in 1999 as \n     they produced in 1899, with only 5 times as many workers. \n     This growth in productivity has increased the standard of \n     living in the United States from $4,200 in 1899 to $33,740 in \n     1999 (expressed in 1999 dollars). Growth in structural \n     productivity will bring about growth in wages and salaries, \n     profits, and government tax receipts.\n       (7) The productivity gains of the United States in the late \n     1990s broke a 25-year trend. From the early 1970s to the mid-\n     1990s, United States productivity grew sluggishly, at an \n     annual rate of about 1.5 percent. During the final 5 years of \n     the 20th Century, it grew at nearly double that rate.\n       (8) The high cyclical productivity growth the United States \n     has experienced in 2001 and 2002 results for the most part \n     from a reduction in employment and increased utilization of \n     existing capacity.\n       (9) The United States needs a strategy to generate \n     structural productivity growth arising from the development \n     and deployment of new technology that enhances both \n     efficiency and employment.\n       (10) The United States needs to prepare now for the \n     retirement of the Baby Boom generation. If the United States \n     does nothing regarding Social Security, it is estimated that \n     by 2030 the annual shortfall between amounts in the Social \n     Security Trust Fund and the amount required to meet \n     obligations of the Fund will reach $814,000,000,000 (in 1999 \n     dollars). The United States has approximately \n     $7,4000,000,000,000 in obligations coming due, and it \n     advisable to have our fiscal house in order, hopefully with \n     no national debt, when these obligations must be paid. \n     Restoring structural productivity and high employment growth \n     is essential to ensure that the United States can honor these \n     obligations.\n       (11) Making affordable, high speed broadband Internet \n     connections of 10 Mbps-100 Mbps available to all American \n     homes and small businesses has the potential to restore \n     structural productivity and employment growth.\n       (12) High speed broadband Internet applications for voice, \n     data, graphics, and video will revolutionize many aspects of \n     life at home, school, and work. High speed broadband Internet \n     will transform health care, commerce, government, and \n     education. The benefits of a successful high speed broadband \n     Internet deployment strategy to the quality of life and \n     economy of the United States will be immeasurable.\n       (13) Traditionally, the United States is considered the \n     world leader in the development and commercialization of new \n     innovations and technologies. However, the United States lags \n     far behind other countries in broadband deployment, including \n     South Korea, Canada, and Sweden. By 2005, the United States \n     is projected to fall to ninth place in broadband deployment, \n     surpassed by Asian markets in Hong Kong and Singapore, the \n     Scandinavian countries Denmark and Norway, and the \n     Netherlands.\n       (14) The United States will need high speed broadband \n     Internet for public health, education, and economic welfare, \n     just as the United States now needs universal telephone \n     service. High speed broadband Internet applications are \n     capable of revitalizing the economy and solving countless \n     problems for average Americans. The applications fall into \n     the areas of e-education, e-health, e-commerce, e-government, \n     and e-entertainment.\n       (15) The benefits that will arise from development and \n     implementation of a national high speed broadband Internet \n     strategy amply justify a priority for such a strategy. The \n     Federal Government will act one way or another on many of the \n     key policy issues affecting broadband deployment. The only \n     question is whether it acts in accordance with a strategy, or \n     piecemeal.\n       (15) Adopting a national strategy for broadband deployment \n     is consistent with the strategies the United States has \n     adopted to speed deployment of other essential \n     infrastructure, including railroads, electric power, \n     telephone service, and radio and television. Each of those \n     technologies has been the focus of a national economic \n     strategy. There is a consensus that the Northwest Ordinance, \n     Morrill Land-Grant Act, and GI bill, and laws for \n     transcontinental railroads, rural electrification, and the \n     interstate highway system, embodied useful and successful \n     strategies for the future of the United States.\n       (16) In facilitating high speed broadband Internet \n     deployment, the United States should rely on markets and \n     entrepreneurs and minimize the intrusion of government. \n     Americans need to be creative and innovative when government \n     acts to make sure that it provides value added.\n       (17) In crafting a comprehensive strategy to advance \n     deployment of high speed broadband Internet, a broad range of \n     policy options should be addressed, and the Administration \n     needs to provide leadership in developing these options and \n     establishing a priority among them.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL STRATEGY FOR HIGH SPEED BROADBAND INTERNET \n                   DEPLOYMENT.\n\n       (a) Strategy for Increasing Structural Productivity and \n     Employment Growth.--Not later than six months after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to \n     Congress a report setting\n\n[[Page S5047]]\n\n     forth a strategy for the nation-wide deployment of high speed \n     broadband Internet telecommunications services.\n       (b) Elements.--The report under subsection (a) shall \n     include the following:\n       (1) A goal for the deployment of broadband \n     telecommunications services nationwide, including a goal \n     regarding the speeds necessary to facilitate applications \n     needed to stimulate structural productivity and employment \n     growth.\n       (2) A proposal for policies to foster and maintain \n     competition among firms offering broadband telecommunications \n     service, including competition to deploy high speed broadband \n     Internet of 10 Mbps-100 Mbps.\n       (3) A proposal for incentives to enhance demand for high \n     speed broadband Internet telecommunications service, \n     including demand for purposes of serving Federal mission \n     areas such as homeland security, distance learning, health, \n     scientific collaboration, and electronic commerce.\n       (4) A proposal for incentives to facilitate and enhance the \n     supply of high speed broadband Internet telecommunications \n     service.\n       (5) A proposal to enhance global electronic commerce.\n       (6) A proposal for the optimal allocation of Federal \n     Government resources on research and development regarding \n     high speed broadband Internet telecommunications service, \n     including recommendations for the allocation and \n     prioritization of Federal funds.\n       (7) A proposal for the optimal allocation of spectrum in \n     furtherance of the deployment of high speed broadband \n     Internet telecommunications service.\n       (8) An assessment of various limitations to the deployment \n     of high speed broadband Internet telecommunications service, \n     including matters relating to taxation, privacy, security, \n     spamming, content, intellectual property, and rights-of-way, \n     and proposals for eliminating or alleviating such \n     limitations.\n       (9) An assessment of the impact of the proposals under this \n     subsection on structural productivity and employment growth \n     in the United States and on the international economic \n     competitiveness of the United States.\n       (10) Any other proposals or matters on the deployment of \n     high speed broadband Internet telecommunications services \n     that the President considers appropriate.\n       (c) Form.--The report under subsection (a) shall include a \n     draft proposal of any legislation required to implement the \n     goal described in paragraph (1) of subsection (b), and of any \n     of the proposals set forth under paragraphs (2) through (8) \n     and (10) of that subsection (b).\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Broadband: A 21st Century Technology and Productivity Strategy\n\n       (From the Office of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, May 2002)\n\n       Over one hundred and fifty years ago, a new technology \n     emerged that grabbed the imaginations of the public and the \n     purse strings of investors. It was a technology that promised \n     to bring people closer together and to greatly stimulate the \n     economy of that time. In order to succeed, that new \n     technology required that the land be crisscrossed with a \n     network upon which news could be carried and goods could be \n     traded.\n       Bankers funded hundreds of startup companies that were \n     built to take advantage of the new network. Investors \n     clamored to purchase shares at rapidly rising prices. And \n     then, after little more than a decade of overbuilding the \n     infrastructure, it all fell apart as shares plunged 85% and \n     hundreds of businesses and banks went under.\n       The technology was steam-driven railroad and this is the \n     story told in the May 13th issue of Business Week. The \n     analogies to the Information Technology boom of the 1990s are \n     unmistakable and the lessons are invaluable. But the most \n     important part of the story is what happened after the \n     railroad bubble burst.\n       Within two decades, railroads were carrying four times as \n     many people as they had at the height of the boom. The tracks \n     were cleared, leaving the most solid companies and the best \n     of the rail technologies to survive. According to W. Brian \n     Arthur, an economist at the Santa Fe Institute, the survivors \n     then developed new strategies that resulted in the industry's \n     greatest growth and had the greatest impact on business and \n     society of that time.\n       We now find ourselves in the same situation that the \n     railroads were in as they developed their new strategies, \n     except the technology is now broadband. It is clear that \n     broadband will revolutionize business and society in our \n     time, just as the railroads did in theirs. But it is also a \n     confusing time, as many different interests emerge with many \n     different agendas. The issues to be faced are many and they \n     are complex. For some, there will be no easy answers. But it \n     is time for us to have a national strategy that addresses \n     these issues in a coherent and comprehensive manner.\n       My staff has assembled this report over the past ten months \n     with extensive input from industry, academia, and government. \n     It was no small undertaking and I particularly thank Skip \n     Watts and Chuck Ludlam of my office. While there have been \n     numerous bills offered in Congress dealing with isolated \n     components of broadband policy, this report is the first to \n     identify the full range of issues that must be considered as \n     part of a national broadband strategy designed to stimulate \n     economic expansion.\n       As the first in a series of legislative initiatives, I will \n     introduce the National Broadband Strategy Act of 2002 next \n     week. This bill highlights the need for a carefully planned \n     national strategy to provide universal availability of \n     broadband and to motivate research and advances in broadband \n     applications and content. It calls upon the Administration to \n     recommend a coherent, cross-agency national broadband \n     strategy in a series of key government policy areas, to \n     Congress.\n       I want to emphasize that while there is an ongoing \n     competitive scramble to reach the lower broadband speeds, we \n     need to also pay real attention to advanced broadband and to \n     attaining those much higher speeds. The report's Executive \n     Summary identifies four key elements that will be integral to \n     advanced broadband deployment. The elements include an FCC \n     regulatory plan, tax incentives, research on advanced \n     infrastructure technology, and deployment of applications.\n       As with the railroads of the mid-1800s, broadband is now \n     poised to whistle in a new period of economic growth. We must \n     do all that we can to nurture this emerging technology and to \n     stimulate the development of new killer applications in the \n     fields of education, medicine, government, and science. \n     Commerce and entertainment will not trail far behind. The \n     tracks of rail are now the ``pipes'' of broadband.\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       Broadband deployment must become a national priority. Major \n     economic growth and productivity gains can be realized by \n     making affordable high-speed broadband Internet connections--\n     which are already enjoyed by many universities and large \n     businesses--widely available to American homes, schools, and \n     small businesses.\n       In a soft economic climate with limited prospects for near-\n     term recovery, broadband deployment is a necessary condition \n     for the restoration of capital spending in the information \n     technology sector. Such investments were the critical drivers \n     of the non-inflationary growth that characterized the late \n     1990s. Broadband, which can play a pivotal role in \n     encouraging investments in information technology, has the \n     potential to transform education, health care, government, \n     entertainment, and commerce.\n       Of course, embracing broadband as a vehicle for economic \n     growth raises the question, ``How fast is fast enough for \n     truly advanced emerging applications?'' The telecom, cable, \n     and satellite industries are now providing Internet access at \n     speeds typically less than 1.5 megabits per second (Mbps). A \n     review of existing and likely technologies, however, suggests \n     that we have only achieved the first level of broadband \n     speeds. On the foreseeable horizon are technologies that \n     offer advanced broadband speeds of 10 Mbps in the near-term, \n     and 100 Mbps in the medium-term. A national strategy needs to \n     focus on this advanced broadband opportunity. Arguably, it \n     will be at these advanced speed ranges that the greatest \n     benefits from broadband will come.\n       A successful strategy to accelerate the deployment of \n     broadband will lead to immeasurable benefits to the quality \n     of life and economy of the American people. But a successful \n     strategy must encompass various issues in a comprehensive and \n     coherent manner, and the debate must not become mired in any \n     one debate. What we need is a sensible, intelligent approach \n     that addresses the full range of issues within the context of \n     an interrelated framework, not the piecemeal process that has \n     brought us to the present confusion and controversies.\n       This strategy must recognize a truth that sometimes becomes \n     lost in the multiplicity of debates over such issues as the \n     regulation of telephone and cable companies. What is \n     overlooked--and must be recognized--is that demand will drive \n     the next phase of broadband expansion. Strong demand from \n     consumers, smaller businesses, and even big businesses that \n     currently have high-speed Internet connectivity, will produce \n     a cycle of innovation and growth. But demand, in turn, \n     requires that applications of real value be developed. It \n     requires, in other words, ``killer applications'' that \n     justify, in the minds of consumers, the price of \n     progressively faster broadband connections.\n       The private sector will need to invest hundreds of billions \n     of dollars before widespread broadband access becomes a \n     reality. Government nevertheless has an important role to \n     play as broadband suppliers face novel challenges in the \n     areas of Internet privacy, security, spam, copyright \n     protection, spectrum allocation, and rights-of-way. It is \n     vital that, in these and other areas, government remain \n     ``technology-neutral'' and that competition between the \n     delivery technologies exist alongside competition within \n     the technologies. This will allow the best and most cost-\n     effective delivery systems to emerge, meeting the varied \n     needs of different people and different regions across \n     this diverse country.\n       There are, however, many ways that government, through a \n     national strategy, can accelerate the life cycle of \n     development and competition for emerging broadband \n     technologies. It can do so by stimulating both the demand and \n     supply side of broadband deployment. On the demand side, \n     government should lead the way in generating demand by \n     expanding e-government services to the public and to \n     businesses, and by supporting the development of broadband \n     tools for e-education and e-healthcare. E-entertainment\n\n[[Page S5048]]\n\n     and e-commerce will be quick to take advantage of the \n     expanded services, and renewed economic growth will surely \n     follow. On the supply side, government can consider such \n     tools as tax credits, loans, and grants for a wide variety of \n     research, deployment, and broadband utilization activities.\n       As the first in a series of legislative initiatives, \n     Senator Lieberman will introduce the National Broadband \n     Strategy Act of 2002. This bill highlights the need for a \n     coherent and comprehensive national strategy for providing \n     widespread availability of broadband and for motivating \n     research and advances in broadband applications and content. \n     Because broadband implementation has been piecemeal, and \n     stalled in significant part because numerous government \n     agencies have failed to act quickly in deciding a wide range \n     of broadband issues now pending before them, the bill calls \n     upon the Administration to recommend a coherent, cross-agency \n     national broadband strategy in a series of key government \n     policy areas.\n       Parallel to that, and focusing on how we will get to truly \n     advanced broadband speeds (in the range of 10 Mbps and 100 \n     Mbps), Senator Lieberman will introduce over the next few \n     months a series of substantive pieces of legislation \n     addressing four key elements integral to a national strategy \n     for advanced broadband deployment. The key elements are:\n       (1) FCC Regulatory Framework: Direct the FCC to explore all \n     of the broadband deployment and delivery technology options \n     to enable us to reach advanced broadband speeds. Retaining \n     technological neutrality, the FCC will be asked to develop \n     the regulatory framework to enable and implement a plan to \n     deploy this advanced Internet capability.\n       (2) Tax Credits: Establish tax credits and incentives for a \n     range of advanced broadband deployment and broadband \n     utilization efforts. These could include credits for \n     infrastructure deployment, equipment implementation, employee \n     utilization, installation in atypical settings, and \n     innovative applications.\n       (3) Advanced Infrastructure R: Ensure that fundamental \n     R issues are tackled in a coordinated manner to overcome \n     the scientific and technological barriers to advanced \n     widespread broadband deployment. The U.S. has already \n     established successful interagency and interdisciplinary \n     initiatives under the National Information Technology \n     Research & Development Program to advance critical IT \n     technologies. We must leverage our existing expertise in \n     these programs to resolve fundamental obstacles to effective \n     broadband deployment and hasten the next generation of \n     technologies. A cooperative R program, including \n     government, industry and universities, will be critical to \n     advanced broadband.\n       (4) Application R and Deployment: Require federal \n     agencies to undertake R and promote the development and \n     availability of major applications in areas where government \n     plays a central role, including e-education, e-medicine, e-\n     government, e-science and homeland security. This could \n     stimulate demand for broadband and promote bridging of the \n     digital divide consistent with the missions of government \n     agencies. And the government should lead by example in moving \n     to expand opportunities for broadband-based e-commerce in \n     federal procurement, bidding, and contracting.\n       While time and technology will not stop, and our nation's \n     eventual transformation into a broadband society will occur \n     regardless of what steps are taken today, it is ours to \n     choose whether we will be dragged into the next digital age \n     resisting change, or whether we lead others into a new era of \n     economic promise. If we are to take control of our future, we \n     must begin by harnessing the power of broadband as a \n     necessary tool for navigating a world increasingly defined by \n     the speed with which information changes and grows.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2583. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to require the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs in the management of health care services \nfor veterans to place certain low-income veterans in a higher health-\ncare priority category; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Hillary \nRodham Clinton to change the way the Veteran's Administration defines \nlow-income veterans by taking into account variations in the cost of \nliving in different parts of the country. The Corzine-Clinton \nlegislation would make the Veteran's Equitable Resource Allocation just \nthat: Equitable.\n  More specifically, this bill would replace the national income \nthreshold for consideration in Priority Group 5, currently $24,000 for \nall parts of the country, with regional thresholds defined by the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development. This simple but far-\nreaching proposal would help low income veterans across the country \nafford quality health care and ensure that Veterans Integrated Service \nNetworks or VISNs receive adequate funding to care for their distinct \nveterans populations.\n  Our Nation's veterans have made great sacrifices in defense of \nAmerican freedom and values, and we owe them a tremendous debt of \ngratitude. The United States Congress must ensure that all American \nveterans, veterans who have sweated in the trenches to defend liberty, \nhave access to quality health care.\n  In 1997, Congress implemented the Veterans Equitable Resource \nAllocation system, or VERA, to distribute medical care funding provided \nby the VA. The funding formula was established to better take into \naccount the costs associated with various veteran populations. \nUnfortunately, the VERA formula that was created fails to take into \naccount regional differences in the cost of living, a significant \nmetric in determining veteran healthcare costs. This oversight in the \nVERA formula dangerously shortchanges veterans living in regions with \nhigh costs of living and elevated health expenses.\n  To allocate money to the Veterans' Integrated Service Networks, \nVISNs, VERA divides veterans into seven priority groups. Veterans who \nhave no service-connected disability and whose incomes fall below \n$24,000 are considered low income and placed in Priority Group 5, while \nveterans whose incomes exceed this national threshold and qualify for \nno other special priorities are placed in Priority Group 7c.\n  Using a national threshold for determining eligibility as a low-\nincome veteran puts veterans living in high cost areas at a decided \ndisadvantage. In New Jersey, HUD's fiscal year 2002 standards for \nclassification as ``low-income'' exceed $24,000 per year in every \nsingle county. And some areas exceed the VA baseline by more than 50 \npercent. Similarly, HUD's ``low-income'' classification for New York \nCity is set at $35,150 and for Nassau and Suffolk Counties, at $40,150.\n  As a result, regions that have a high cost of living, like VISN 3, \nwhich encompasses substantial portions of New Jersey and New York, tend \nto have a reduced population of Priority Group 5 veterans and an \ninflated population of Priority Group 7c veterans.\n  The fundamental inequity of the VERA formula is apparent when you \nconsider that VERA allocations do not take into account the number of \nveterans classified in Priority Group 7c. With the costs associated \nwith veterans in Priority Group 7c not considered as part of the VERA \nallocation, and with high cost of living areas possessing inflated \npopulations of Priority Group 7c vets, high cost regions must provide \ncare to thousands of veterans without adequate funding.\n  This additional financial burden on VISNs with large populations of \nveterans in Priority Group 7c has had a tremendous impact on VISN 3. \nSince FY 1996, VISN 3 has experienced a decline in revenue of 10 \npercent. As a result of the tremendous shortfall in the VISN 3 budget, \nthe VA cannot move forward with plans to open clinics in various \nlocations, including prospective clinics in Monmouth and Passaic \nCounties. Consequently, veterans in VISN 3 are forced to wait for \nunreasonably long periods to receive medical care and travel long \ndistances to existing clinics.\n  Furthermore, miscategorizing which vets qualify as Priority Group 5 \nunjustifiably reduces access to medical care for thousands of veterans. \nUnder existing rules, veterans placed in Priority Group 7c must provide \na copayment to receive medical care at a VA medical facility; Veterans \nplaced in Priority Group 5 receive medical care free of charge. Under \nthe existing framework, low-income vets in high cost areas are often \ninappropriately placed in Priority Group 7c, and are forced to provide \na copayment.\n  Recent studies by both the Rand Institute and the General Accounting \nOffice identify this flaw in the VERA formula and recommend a \ngeographic means test like the one provided in our legislation to \nimprove the allocation of resources under VERA. Such a test would \nensure that the VERA formula allocation better reflects the true costs \nof VA healthcare in the various VISNs in the United States.\n  Our legislation would make a simple adjustment to the VERA formula to \naccount for variations in the cost of living in different regions. The \nbill would help veterans in high cost areas afford VA health care and \nguarantee that VISNs across the country receive\n\n[[Page S5049]]\n\nadequate compensation for the care they provide.\n  I hope my colleagues will join Senator Clinton and me in supporting \nthis important bill, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2583\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator \nCorzine, to introduce legislation to remedy the gross disparity in the \ndistribution of Federal dollars to provide health care services to our \nnation's veterans around the country.\n  The source of the gap is a formula that does not sufficiently take \ninto account the needs of all facilities, effectively unfairly \npenalizing states in the Northeast and Midwest. And New York has lost \ntens of millions of dollars as a result. The bill we're introducing \ntoday would provide increased funding for networks in high-cost of \nliving areas, like New York and New Jersey, and help low-income \nveterans afford quality health care.\n  In 1997, to repair geographic inequities in the distribution of VA \nallocations, the Federal government put in place the Veterans Equitable \nResource Allocation, VERA, system. As I noted in a letter I sent to VA \nSecretary Anthony Principi on this issue in March, the VERA formula was \nintended to better meet the needs of the large number of veterans who \nflocked to the South. As a General Accounting Office, GAO, report \nreleased in February 2002 makes clear, however, the 6-year-old formula \nhas resulted in disparities and cutbacks in health services for \nveterans in the Northeast and Midwest. Veterans' hospitals in these \nregions lost a staggering $921 million.\n  The VERA formula is flawed for a number of reasons. First, the \nformula, which is based on the number of veterans, does not take into \naccount the differences in various patient health care needs within \ndifferent networks. As the GAO report states, the formula ``excludes \nabout one-fifth of VA's workload in determining each network's \nallocation.'' These are veterans who do not have service-related \ndisabilities and whose incomes fall within a low-priority range, called \n``Priority 7''.\n  Although this group is considered a low-priority, these individuals \nrepresent a growing percentage of the veteran population who seek care \nat VA facilities. From fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2001, the \nnumber of veterans with incomes within this range increased from 4 \npercent to 22 percent of the total caseload. However, the formula has \nnot been adjusted to reflect the dramatic increase in these ``Priority \n7'' cases, leaving many networks without the resources to meet the \ngrowing demand.\n  Further, the formula does not accurately reflect the higher cost of \nmedical care in the Northeast. Because VA hospitals in New York City, \nand Nassau and Suffolk counties are situated in a high cost of living \narea, they tend to have an inflated number of Priority Group 7 \nveterans. VA health networks in high cost regions provide care to \nthousands of veterans without sufficient funding to do so. \nAdditionally, taking into account the regional cost of living would \nrelieve many Priority 7 veterans of the burden of making a copayment.\n  Finally, the number of veterans treated nationally over the last \nseveral years rose 47 percent, with all VA networks contributing to \nthat increase. As I noted to Secretary Principi, a rise in patient \ncaseloads spread across the health network should dictate an equitable \ndistribution of funding. The GAO's recommendations can be reduced to \none simple goal: ``comparable resources for comparable workloads.'' Any \ndelay in fixing this formula, the GAO stated, means that approximately \n$200 million in veterans' health funding annually would be allocated \nunjustly.\n  One of my State's newspapers, the Poughkeepsie Journal, reported that \nSecretary Principi agreed with the GAO's assessment of the formula but \nwanted to conduct another study of hospital workloads and patient needs \nbefore taking action. I strongly believe sufficient time has already \nbeen devoted to studying this issue. I urge Secretary Principi to take \nspecific actions now to carry out the recommendations outlined in the \nGAO's report.\n  The courageous service and sacrifice of our Nation's veterans in \ndefense of our nation and our democratic values should never be \nforgotten. Fulfilling our promise to provide for their health care \nneeds is an important part of the enduring bond that we share. I urge \nmy colleagues to support our legislation to remedy this unfair formula \nso that all of our nation's veterans have access to the health services \nthey deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. Miller, and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 2584. A bill to support certain housing proposals in the fiscal \nyear 2003 budget for the Federal Government, including the downpayment \nassistance initiative under the HOME Investment Partnerships Act, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the American Dream \nDownpayment Act, which will help thousands of families achieve the \nAmerican Dream of homeownership. The rate of homeownership in the \nUnited States has risen steadily over the past few years. However, for \nmany working families, low-income families, women-headed households, \nminorities, urban dwellers and young families the dream of \nhomeownership remains elusive.\n  While Americans enjoy the world's greatest opportunities for becoming \nhomeowners, only 46 percent of African-American and Hispanic families \nown their homes as compared to 74 percent of non-Hispanic whites who \nown their homes. For many of these families, the biggest barrier to \nhomeownership is their inability to afford downpayment requirements and \nclosing costs.\n  To help eliminate the gaps in homeownership achievement, I am \nintroducing the American Dream Downpayment Act. This legislation will \nhelp 40,000 families annually, focusing on low-income families who are \nfirst-time homebuyers. The American Dream Downpayment Fund will provide \ncommunities across America with $200 million in grants to help \nhomebuyers with the downpayment and closing costs.\n  The American Dream Downpayment Fund, which will be administered as a \npart of HUD's existing HOME Investment Partnerships Program, HOME, will \nmake more than 400 State and local governments eligible to receive the \n$200 million in grant funding to help more families achieve the \nAmerican Dream of homeownership.\n  The positive effects of homeownership exist on many levels: \nhomeownership has public benefits in the form of neighborhood \nstability, individual benefits in the form of the financial rewards \nthat come from the appreciation of equity in a home over time, and \npersonal benefits that stem from the satisfaction of attaining a goal, \nthe pride of ownership, and a greater sense of security. In addition to \nthese affirmative impacts of homeownership, the Homeownership Alliance \nreleased findings of a study revealing that children living in owned \nhomes had nine percent higher achievement in mathematics and\n\n[[Page S5050]]\n\nseven percent higher achievement in reading.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on the \nAmerican Dream Downpayment Act. I believe this legislation will be \ncritical in helping more families achieve the American Dream of \nhomeownership.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2584\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to disclaim \nany Federal interest in lands adjacent to Spirit Lake and Twin Lakes in \nthe State of Idaho resulting from possible omission of lands from an \n1880 survey; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I introduce this bill, Spirit Lake \nand Twin Lakes Omitted Lands Act of 2002 to help resolve a land \nownership problem that affects over 400 private property owners and \nhomeowners located around Spirit Lake and Twin Lakes in Kootenai \nCounty, ID.\n  In 1880, a public land survey prepared under contract with the \nGeneral Land Office, grossly misrepresented portions of the actual \nlakeshore of the two lakes. The surveys show the meander lines along \nthe lakes up to one-half mile away from their actual location. The \nerrors were not discovered until recently. Over the years, the \nshorelines of these popular lakes have become heavily developed and \nproperty owners have purchased their property and held it in good faith \nownership. Most of the property owners affected by this situation have \na chain of title that goes back over 100 years. Due to the inaccuracy \nof the original government survey, county officials have expressed \nconcern regarding their inability to approve and regulate new \ndevelopments, surveys, permits, etc. The Bureau of Land Management, the \nresponsible Federal agency, has determined that it has no interest in \nthe affected land and wishes only to remove the cloud on the titles.\n  Under current federal law the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) would \nbe required to conduct a resurvey to properly describe the land. Much \nof this land would then become ``omitted land'' and would revert to \nfederal ownership. Landowners who already paid fair market value for \nthe land would then have to re-purchase it, along with paying a $50 \napplication fee, and paying for the appraisal, survey, and conveyance \ncosts.\n  Obviously, this is not an acceptable solution and does not provide \nthe most equitable benefit to the public, so Senator Crapo and I are \nintroducing this legislation. A companion bill is being offered in the \nHouse of Representatives by Mr. Otter. This legislation will authorize \nfunds for the BLM to resurvey the land and direct the BLM to issue \ndisclaimers of interest to all of the affected property owners. This is \nthe only acceptable solution and one that keeps the landowners whole.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2585\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The meander lines in the original surveys by John B. \n     David, deputy surveyor, of two lakes in the State of Idaho, \n     Spirit Lake, formerly known as Lake Tesemini, located in T. \n     53 N., R. 4 W., Boise Meridian, and Twin Lakes, formerly \n     known as Fish Lake, located in T. 52 N. and T. 53 N., R. 4 \n     W., Boise Meridian, do not reflect the current line of \n     ordinary high water conditions.\n       (2) All lands adjacent to the original meander lines have \n     been patented.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to direct the \n     Secretary of the Interior to issue a recordable disclaimer of \n     interest by the\n\n[[Page S5051]]\n\n     United States to any omitted lands or lands lying outside the \n     record meander lines in the vicinity of the lakes referred to \n     in subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Recordable disclaimer of interest.--The term \n     ``recordable disclaimer of interest'' means a document \n     recorded in the county clerk's office or other such local \n     office where real property documents are recorded, in which \n     the United States disclaims any right, title, or interest to \n     those lands found lying outside the recorded meander lines of \n     the lakes referred to in section 1(a)(1), including omitted \n     lands, if any.\n       (2) Omitted lands.--The term ``omitted lands'' means those \n     lands that were in place on the date of the original surveys \n     referred to in section 1(a)(1) but were not included in the \n     survey of the township and the meander lines of the water \n     body due to gross error or fraud by the original surveyor.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 3. SURVEYS.\n\n       The Secretary shall--\n       (1) conduct a survey investigation of the conditions along \n     the lakeshores of Spirit Lake and Twin Lakes in the townships \n     referenced in section 1(a); and\n       (2) after the completion of the survey investigation, \n     resurvey the original meander lines along the lakeshores, \n     using the results of the survey investigation.\n\n      SEC. 4. DISCLAIMER OF INTEREST IN LANDS ADJACENT TO SPIRIT \n                   LAKE AND TWIN LAKES, IDAHO.\n\n       Upon acceptance and approval of the surveys under section 3 \n     by the Secretary, the Secretary shall--\n       (1) prepare a recordable disclaimer of interest with land \n     descriptions, using the lot or tract numbers of the omitted \n     lands, if any, and lands lying outside the record meander \n     lines, as shown on the survey plats; and\n       (2) record such recordable disclaimer of interest \n     simultaneously with the filing of the surveys.\n\n      SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary \n     $400,000 to carry out this Act. Funds appropriated to carry \n     out the purposes of this Act may be available without fiscal \n     year limitation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 2587. A bill to establish the Joint Federal and State Navigable \nWaters Commission of Alaska; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill help rectify a long-standing problem that adversely affects an \narray of citizens, landowners, and government entities in Alaska. The \nAlaska Navigable Waters Commission legislation will create a joint \nFederal-State commission to establish a process to facilitate \ndeterminations of the navigable status of lakes, rivers, and streams in \nAlaska. This is a vital step in determining the ownership of the \nriverbanks and submerged lands.\n  Under the Equal Footing Doctrine and the Submerged Lands Act, every \nstate gains title to the submerged lands that underlie navigable \nwaterways within its borders upon entering the Union. Or, I should say, \nis supposed to gain title. For decades now, the State of Alaska has \nbeen in the unique position of having unresolved navigability \ndeterminations for tens of thousands of waterways around the state. \nThis leaves not only the ownership status in limbo but causes \nunnecessary jurisdictional problems and headaches. This is an \nintolerable position for Alaskans.\n  In fact, since Alaska became a State in 1959, only 13 of its more \nthan 22,000 rivers have been determined to be navigable, and the status \nof well over one million lakes has been left in question. The only \nrecourse available to the State has been to pursue litigation against \nthe United States, a time-consuming, expensive, and unwarranted \nrequirement.\n  To date, the Federal Government has been unwilling to sit down with \nthe State and make these determinations, even though for the vast \nmajority of these waterways, no reasonable person could disagree as to \nthe navigability of the waters under well-established legal standards.\n  I want to stress to my colleagues that this bill does not change in \nany way the legal criteria for navigability determinations. Those have \nbeen well settled in a body of Federal case law, led by the Gulkana \ndecision, that stands undisturbed by this legislation. What the bill \ndoes is create a joint, Federal-State body to engage in dialogue that \nwill help to resolve these long-standing disputes, and bring Alaska the \nsame legal rights enjoyed by its 49 sister States.\n  Creating a joint commission to resolve thorny Federal-State issues is \nnot a novel concept. In 1971, the Congress and the State of Alaska \ncreated a joint commission to assist in the land-use planning process \ncreated under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. This process \nstreamlines communication between the State and Federal governments, \nand creates an infrastructure for ongoing negotiation over difficult \nissues. It also obviates the need for litigation over the status of \nthose waterways where agreement can be reached. I think we all can \nagree that anything that reduces the need for litigation is a good \nthing.\n  The Alaska legislature has considered companion legislation, \nintroduced by the Senate President, Rick Halford, and the Speaker of \nthe Alaska House, Brian Porter. That legislation has now been approved \nby both houses of the legislature. We should enact Federal legislation \nso that we may join the State of Alaska in seeking to rectify the \nproblem.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. Under the Equal \nFooting Doctrine, Alaska is supposed to enjoy the same rights and \nprivileges as all other states. This bill is another important step in \nmaking that national principle a reality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2588. A bill to prohibit the exportation of natural gas from the \nUnited States to Mexico for use in electric energy generation units \nnear the United States border that do not comply with air quality \ncontrol requirements that provide air quality protection that is at \nleast equivalent to the protection provided by requirements applicable \nin the United States; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto protect those living along the California-Mexican border from \nharmful power plant emissions.\n  This bill, which Congressman Duncan Hunter is also introducing today \nin the House of Representatives, will prevent power plants built in \nMexico from using natural gas from the United States, unless firms \noperating these plants agree to comply with California's air pollution \nstandards.\n  Currently there are two new power plants planned for Mexicali, \nMexico, a city right across the border from Imperial County, \nCalifornia. Imperial County is the region in Southern California \nimpacted most by pollution in Mexico. And since the county has some of \nthe worst air quality in the United States and one of the highest \nchildhood asthma rates in the State, I believe these new plants must \nmeet California emission standards.\n  One of the Mexicali plants, which is being built by Sempra Energy, \nwill have pollution mitigation technology to minimize the impact of air \npollution on the residents of the Imperial Valley. However, the other \nplant, to be built by InterGen, will not.\n  I am introducing this legislation today to make sure any plant that \ncomes online along the California-Mexican border meets the same air \nquality standards as plants in California.\n  The residents of Imperial County and the entire Southern California \nregion deserve nothing less.\n  I have heard from many constituents in Southern California concerned \nabout the InterGen plant and local officials in Imperial County are \nadamantly opposed to the InterGen plant because the company has refused \nto install pollution control devices on all four operating units.\n  This legislation will ensure energy plants along the border employ \nthe best technology available to control pollution and protect the \npublic health for residents of Southern California and other border \nregions in a similar situation.\n  The bill will prohibit energy companies from exporting natural gas \nfrom the United States for use in Mexico unless the natural gas fired \ngenerators south of the border meet the air standards prevalent in the \nUnited States. This will effectively cut power plants off from their \nnatural gas supply if they do not meet higher emissions standards.\n  This legislation will not constrain power plants that were put online \nprior\n\n[[Page S5052]]\n\nto January 1, 2002. It will apply to plants built after the new year \nand projects that come online in the future.\n  This bill will only apply to power plants within 50 miles of the \nU.S.-Mexican border.\n  And the legislation will only apply to power plants that generate \nmore than 50 megawatts of power. We do not want to block any moves to \nreplace dirty diesel back-up generators with cleaner natural-gas fired \nsmall power sources.\n  The bill calls for collaboration between the Secretary of Commerce \nand the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to \ndetermine if a power plant is in compliance with relevant emission \nstandards.\n  I support the development of new energy projects for California \nbecause I believe we need to bring more power online. However, I do not \nbelieve the fact that we need more power in California should allow \ncompanies to take advantage of this need and use it as an excuse to \ndevote less attention to clean air and public health.\n  It is not unreasonable to ensure that companies making money in the \nCalifornia energy market meet strict environmental standards. This \nlegislation is meant to strike a balance between promoting new sources \nof energy south of the border and protecting the environment throughout \nthe border region. It is not a final resolution of these cross-border \nissues, but I believe it is a good first step.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 2589. A bill to provide for the prohibition of snow machines \nwithin the boundaries of the ``Old Park'' within the boundaries of \nDenali National Park and Preserve, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nresolve the issue of snowmobile access in Denali National Park in my \nhome State of Alaska.\n  Denali National Park and Preserve encompasses just under 5 million \nacres in the interior of Alaska, including North America's highest \nmountain, 20,320-foot Mount McKinley. Large glaciers of the Alaska \nRange, caribou, Dall sheep, moose, grizzly bears and timber wolves live \nwithin this great landscape.\n  The original Mt. McKinley National Park was created on February 26, \n1917 and additional acreage was added in 1922 and 1932, bringing the \npark size to 1.9 million acres. In September of 1978 a separate Denali \nNational Monument was proclaimed. In 1980, Congress enacted the Alaska \nNational Interest Lands Conservation Act, ANILCA. ANILCA incorporated \nMt. McKinley National Park and the National Monument to create the 4.7, \nplus million acre Denali National Park and Preserve.\n  Section 1110(a) of ANILCA, mandates motorized vehicle access for the \npurpose of engaging in traditional activities in specific conservation \nsystem units. However, the National Park Service recently redefined \n``traditional use,'' and instead ordered the ``old Mt. McKinley \nNational Park closed to snowmobiles, which common sense dictates are \nmotorized vehicles.\n  For the past two years,this closure has been before the Federal \nCourts in Alaska in litigation filed by the International Snowmobile \nManufactures Association and the Alaska State Snowmobilers Association \nagainst the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service.\n  A few months ago, the plaintiffs dismissed their suit against the \nGovernment, and, with the approval of the Department of Justice, both \nparties are seeking a more reasoned legislative solution to address the \naccess issue once and for all.\n  This legislation provides such a solution, it addresses snowmobile \naccess in the 1.9 million acre ``Old Park'' by permanently excluding \napproximately 1.5 million acres north of the Alaska Range from snow \nmachine access while reaffirming the applicability to Section 1110(a) \naccess for this actibviey in approximately 400,000 acres south of the \nAlaska Range. In short, this solution eliminates conflict between the \nvarious user groups, and the many issues relating to wildlife and \nnatural resource protection.\n  I thank the Alaska State Snowmobile Association, Inc. and the \nInternational Snowmobile Manufactures Association, for their actions to \ndismiss the legal challenge involving the used of snow machines in \nDenali National Park and Preserve. I look forward to working with the \nAssociations; the Department of the Interior; the National Park \nService; my colleagues on both sides of the Capitol; as well as other \ninterested parties, for their assistance in developing environmentally \nand scientifically sound decisions and solution that will achieve both \nreasonable access and protection for the wildlife and valuable natural \nresources found in this outstanding unit of the National Park System.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2589\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SNOWMOBILE CLOSURE.\n\n       (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, those \n     portions of Denali National Park and Preserve depicted as \n     ``Area A'', within the exterior boundaries of the former Mt. \n     McKinley National Park, on map numbered 222 and entitled \n     Denali National Park and Preserve, dated ``revised 1999'', \n     shall not be considered a conservation system unit for the \n     purposes of access by snowmachines pursuant to Section \n     1110(a) of Public Law 96-487 nor subject to the Departmental \n     regulations implementing that subsection.\n       (b) The Statement of Finding, dated June 2000; the \n     Environmental Assessment, revised June 6, 2000; the Finding \n     of No Significant Impact, dated June 6, 2000; and the \n     regulations promulgated by the National Park Service on June \n     19, 2000 that are codified at 36 Code of Federal Regulations \n     13.63(h)(1)-(3), all relating to the closure of portions of \n     Denali National Park and Preserve to snowmobile use, are \n     hereby revoked, and the use of snow machines shall be \n     permitted within ``Area B'' as depicted on the map referenced \n     in subsection (a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. \n        Gregg):\n  S. 2590. A bill to amend title IX of the Public Heath Service Act to \nprovide for the improvement of patient safety and to reduce the \nincidence of events that adversely effect patient safety; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my \ncolleagues Senators Jeffords, Breaux, and Gregg in introducing crucial \nlegislation, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act.\n  Each year, as many as 98,000 people in the United States die as a \nresult of medical errors. More Americans die each year from medical \nerrors than from breast cancer, AIDS, or motor vehicle accidents. As a \nphysician who has taken the Hippocratic oath ``To do no harm,'' the \nstatus quo is simply unacceptable. As the Institute of Medicine wrote \nin its landmark 1999 report, To Err is Human: ``[I]t is simply not \nacceptable for patients to be harmed by the same health care system \nthat is supposed to offer healing and comfort.''\n  The legislation we are introducing today will go a long way toward \npreventing many of these tragedies. Although a variety of patient \nsafety initiatives are underway in the private sector as well as within \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, and in the states, \nCongress has an important role to play in reinforcing, encouraging, and \nenhancing these efforts.\n  The major contribution of this legislation is to foster an open, \ncollaborative environment where doctors, nurses, and other health \nprofessionals can share information freely and analyze it thoroughly. \nHealth care providers should not be punished for trying to learn from \ntheir mistakes, reduce medical errors, and improve the quality of care \nthey deliver to patients.\n  As a physician and a scientist, I know first hand about the enormous \ncomplexities of medicine today and the intricate system in which \nproviders deliver care. I also recognize the need to examine medical \nerrors closely in order to determine where the system has failed \npatients, and how it can be improved. Yet, adequate protections do not \nexist today to foster this type of learning and improvement \nenvironment. For example, hospitals currently rely upon Mortality and \nMorbidity Conference to share information about medical errors that \noccur with respect to individual patients. Unfortunately, because these \nconferences are focused\n\n[[Page S5053]]\n\non events involving individual patients within a single hospital, it is \nimpossible to address system-wide quality and safety problems that may \nexist across hospital systems and within broader communities. Fear of \nlitigation is the primary barrier to sharing and analyzing information \nthat could save lives and improve treatment within the broader health \ncare community.\n  We have seen this type of non-punitive reporting model work to vastly \nimprove safety in other situations. In 1975, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration established the Aviation Safety Reporting System, ASRS, \nto encourage pilots, controllers, flight attendants, mechanics, and the \npublic to voluntarily report actual or potential discrepancies and \ndeficiencies involving the safety of aviation operations. Because this \ninformation was widely shared and analyzed, the ASRS helped to \nsignificantly improve aviation safety in the United States. The risk of \ndying in a domestic jet flight decreased from one in two million in \n1967 to 1976 to only one in eight million in the 1990s.\n  The Institute of Medicine, as well as many experts who have testified \nbefore Congress during the past few years, have strongly recommended \nthat Congress provide the same type of legal protections for \ninformation gathered and reported to improve health care quality and \nincrease patient safety. Without these protections, patient safety \nimprovements will continue to be hampered by fears of retribution and \nrecrimination. If we are to change the health care culture from ``name, \nshame, and blame'' to a culture of safety and continuous quality \nimprovement, we must provide these basic protections.\n  In extending these protections, we have tried to encourage widespread \nvoluntary error reporting while continuing to allow access to medical \nrecords and other information that should be available to patients for \nlitigation or other purposes. Protecting data reported to a certified \npatient safety reporting system does not mean that such information \ncannot be obtained through other avenues if it is important to securing \nredress for harm. At the same time, information generated by this new \nreporting system designed specifically to reduce errors and broadly \nbenefit patients should not become fodder for increased litigation. \nMoreover, the legislation expressly allows for patient safety \ninformation to be disclosed in the context of a disciplinary proceeding \nor criminal case where it is 1. material to the proceeding; 2. within \nthe public interest; and 3. not available from any other source.\n  I want to thank Senators Jeffords, Breaux, and Gregg for their \nsupport, and input into this legislation. I look forward to working \nwith them, Senator Kennedy, and my other colleagues in both the House \nand Senate, to pass legislation that will advance patient safety \nefforts.\n  I also value the leadership of the Bush Administration on this \ncritical issue. The Administration's efforts to improve patient safety \nare underscored by the commitment, support and direct involvement of \nboth Secretary Thompson of the Department of Health and Human Services \nand Secretary O'Neill of the Department of Treasury in helping to shape \nthis legislation.\n  Americans take pride in offering the most advanced medical care in \nthe world. A bounty of new devices, new treatments, and new techniques \noffer the hope of living longer and healthier than ever before. Yet, \nmedical mistakes continue to take thousands of lives and cost billions \nof dollars each year. We must not let the miracle of modern medicine be \nextinguished by medical errors. This bill will make the changes in \nculture and communications that are needed to increase the safety of \nAmerica's health care system, and improve the quality of care delivered \nto America's patients.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am happy to have the opportunity today \nto speak on the vital issue of patient safety and medical errors, and \nto introduce legislation that will ensure better health care for all \nAmericans. In 1999, the Institute of Medicine published a classic \nreference book titled To Err is Human, which reported that hospital \nmedical errors contribute to approximately 100,000 deaths a year.\n  This troubling statistic has been verified by research done by the \nCommonwealth Foundation and reviewed by articles in the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association, the Annals of Internal Medicine, and the \nNew England Journal of Medicine. This statistic shows that medical \nerrors are a more common cause of death than motor vehicle accidents or \nbreast cancer, and it puts medical errors as the eighth leading cause \nof death in the United States.\n  This is totally unacceptable and it need not be occuring at all. \nToday, I am pleased to introduce legislation with my colleagues \nSenators Frist, Breaux, and Gregg, the ``Patient Safety and Quality \nImprovement Act,'' that will put us on the path to correcting these \nmedical errors.\n  The ``Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act'' lays the \ngroundwork for preventing these unnecessary deaths and injuries. Only \nby providing a framework through which medical errors can be reported \nand analyzed will we be able to make changes, strengthen and improve \nour health-care system and reduce morbidity and mortality.\n  Since the 106th Congress, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee has held five hearings on this important issue. The \ntestimony given during these hearings reflected an overwelling \nagreement with the IOM report and the ``Patient Safety and Quality \nImprovement Act,'' acts upon the IOM's findings and recommendations\n  Key elements of To Err is Human call for improvements in patient \nsafety by developing a learning, rather than a punitive environment; \nlegal protections of privacy and privilege that would foster care \nsystems to be reviewed and appropriate collaborations to occur in \ndeveloping and implementing patient safety improvement strategies.\n  Our legislation addresses all of these concerns. Currently, adequate \nlegal protections and a non-punitive environment do not exist to foster \nthe exchange of information and the analysis that is needed to deal \nwith the complex issues of improving patient safety. Our measure \ncreates opportunities for higher standards of continuous safety \nimprovement, and encourages a new culture of patient safety dialogue to \ninsure that safety information will be shared voluntarily and that \nappropriate collaboration and analysis will occur. It can not be overly \nstress that an environment where information, data, process, and \nrecommendations enjoy legal protection and privilege it is essential to \nany safety organization.\n  These are the key elements of what the ``Patient Safety and Quality \nImprovement Act'' will do. It promotes a ``culture of safety'' in our \nhealth care system by providing for the legal protection of information \nreported voluntarily for the purposes of quality improvement and \npatient safety. It creates incentives for creating voluntary reporting \nsystems that are non-punitive and promote learning. It recognizes that \nto be effective, these systems must have the buy-in, trust, and \ncooperation of the health care providers. It recognizes the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) as the leader in patient; safety \nfor funding research and for dissemination of information learned about \nimproving patient safety; and finally, it complements many ongoing \npatient safety initiatives in the public and private sector.\n  Finally, I want to point out what the bill does not do: It does not \nchange existing remedies available to injured patients or limit a \npatient's access to their medical record; it does not ``shield'' or put \npatient information that is otherwise available beyond the reach for \nthe purposes of disciplinary, civil or criminal proceedings; it does \nnot change current regulatory processes or add new regulatory \nrequirements; and it does not create mandatory, punitive reporting \nsystems.\n  Our bill enjoys widespread endorsement by over 40 hospital, patient, \ndoctor, and consumer advocacy organizations, and this degree of support \nunderscores the broad appeal and essential nature of this proposed \nlegislation. It is my strong desire that this bill receive the prompt \nattention that the issue clearly deserves.\n  All of us are justifiably proud of our hospital system and the \nwonders of medicine and technology. But we can no longer ignore the \nwell documented incidence of medical errors, which waste needed medical \nresources and\n\n[[Page S5054]]\n\ncause excessive medical complications and unacceptable loss of life. \nWithout attention to this matter, it is reasonable to expect that \nthousands of innocents will suffer unnecessarily in our hospitals. We \nsimply must not allow this to happen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Gregg, \n        Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Hutchison, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Clinton, and \n        Mrs. Carnahan):\n  S. 2591. A bill to reauthorize the Mammography Quality Standards Act, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMammography Quality Standards Reauthorization Act of 2002. This \nimportant bipartisan bill will continue a valuable program that helps \nsave women's lives. I am proud that my good friend, Senator Snowe, and \nother colleagues have joined on a bipartisan basis to introduce this \nlegislation.\n  Mammography is not perfect, but it is the best screening tool we have \nnow. Mammograms must be as safe and accurate as possible. A mammogram \nis worse than useless if it produces a poor-quality image or is \nmisinterpreted. That's why I have fought over the last 10 years to make \nthem even better.\n  The Mammography Quality Standards Act, MQSA, that I authored has \nimproved the quality of mammograms in this country over the last 10 \nyears. MQSA has brought facilities nationwide into compliance with \nFederal quality standards. Before MQSA, tests were misread, women were \nmisdiagnosed, and people died as a result of sloppy work. This year \nCongress must reauthorize the Mammography Quality Standards Act, \nbecause women must continue to have safe, quality mammograms. Until \nthere are more effective screening tools, mammography is still the \nfront line against breast cancer.\n  Ten years ago before the Mammography Quality Standards Act, MQSA, \nfirst became law, there was an uneven patchwork of standards for \nmammography in this country. Image quality of mammograms varied widely. \nThe first rule of all medical treatment is: Above all things, do no \nharm. And a bad mammogram can do real harm by leading a woman and her \ndoctor to believe that nothing is wrong when something is. The result \ncan be unnecessary suffering or even a death that could have been \nprevented. That is why this legislation is so important.\n  What MQSA does is require that all facilities that provide mammograms \nmeet key safety and quality-assurance standards in the area of \npersonnel, equipment, and operating procedures. Before the law passed, \ntests were misread, women were misdiagnosed, and people died as a \nresult of sloppy work. Since 1992, MQSA has been successful in raising \nthe quality of mammography services that women receive.\n  What are these national, uniform quality standards for mammography? \nWell, facilities are required to use equipment designed specifically \nfor mammography. Only radiological technologists can perform \nmammography. Only qualified doctors can interpret the results of \nmammography. Facilities must establish a quality assurance and control \nprogram to ensure reliability, clarity and accurate interpretation of \nmammograms. Facilities must be inspected annually by qualified \ninspectors. Finally, facilities must be accredited by an accrediting \nbody approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  MQSA also ensures that women receive direct written notification of \ntheir mammogram results. Women will not assume that ``no news is good \nnews'' when this is not always the case. They know what their results \nare, so that they can get any follow up care they need.\n  The bill that I am introducing today extends the successful MQSA \nprogram for another five years. It also allows the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to issue a temporary certificate to a mammography \nfacility if certain conditions have prevented the facility from \ncompleting the reaccreditation process before its certificate expires. \nWhat does this mean? If a facility acquires new mammography equipment \nand this prevents the facility from meeting reaccreditation time \nframes, the facility could get a temporary certificate that would allow \nit to continue to perform mammograms for up to 45 days. The temporary \ncertificate can only be issued if the facility's accreditation body has \nissued a 45-day accreditation extension. This will provide protection \nin the law, so that in certain circumstances a mammography facility \nwill not have to close its doors when its certificate expires before it \nis reaccredited.\n  This bill also brings to bear the expertise of the Institute of \nMedicine and the General Accounting Office to further improve MQSA and \nprovide Congress with expert recommendations to consider during the \nnext reauthorization of MQSA.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to reauthorize this \nimportant program this year. Last year, an estimated 192,200 women were \ndiagnosed with breast cancer in this country and about 39,600 women \ndied from breast cancer. Early detection and treatment are essential to \nreducing breast cancer deaths. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this \nimportant bill, and I look forward to its enactment this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. DeWine, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 2592. A bill to provide affordable housing opportunities that are \nheaded by grandparents and other relatives of children, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am sure that each and every member of \nthe United States Senate, if asked, could share fond memories of times \nthey spent with their grandparents. I know that for me many of my most \nmemorable childhood memories were spent with my grandmother and \ngrandfather. Summer vacations, Christmas dinners and school recitals \nwere all the more special because Grandma or Grandpa were there. \nGrandparents are always there to share words of wisdom and windows to \nthe past with their grandchildren. They provide unconditional love and \nsupport to parents and their children as they prepare to become our \nNation's next generation.\n  Today, over 4 million grandparents in America are doing more than \nattending birthday parties and buying their grandchild's first bicycle. \nThe US Census bureau reports that over 4 million grandparents are \nserving as a full time parent to their grandchildren. In my own State, \nLouisiana, over 150,000 grandparents are filling these roles. Many of \nthese children have parents who have died, are in prison, or are \nsuffering from substance abuse or mental illness. Others have been \ntaken out of abusive homes. These ``grandfamilies'' come in all shapes \nand sizes. Some live in rural areas, some live in cities, others in \nsuburbs. They come from all races, ethnicities and social status and \nthey live in every single State in the Nation.\n  Grandparents raising children face many barriers, especially if they \ndo not have legal custody of the children, as is the case with a large \nportion of these caregivers. Most of these grandparents were at a point \nin their life when the major decisions faced by their peers are \nsurrounding prescription drug coverage and retirement plans. Instead, \nthese seniors are faced with questions about homework, the cost of baby \nformula and diapers, and where to find safe and affordable housing big \nenough for the whole family. While this bill does not address all of \nthese barriers, it does attempt to address the critical need for \naffordable housing.\n  These families often live in small apartments, assisted living \ncommunities or houses that are not suitable for the children they care \nfor. If the grandparent is living in public senior housing, where \nchildren are disallowed, they are often subject to eviction if the \nchildren are discovered. Furthermore, if a housing development is \nconstructed for seniors, these apartments are often not ``child \nproofed'' and there are often no places for the children to play \nsafely. If these grandparents can afford to move to housing that is \nmore suitable for the children, they are often forced to give up some \nof the amenities\n\n[[Page S5055]]\n\nthat improve an elderly person's quality of life, such as ramps and \nbathroom rails.\n  Many programs throughout the Nation have tried to address the need to \nprovide safe and affordable housing for these families. One program, \nGrandfamilies House, in Massachusetts provides 26, two, three and four \nbedroom apartments that come equipped with the safety features needed \nby the older and younger residents it hopes to serve. In addition, they \nprovide on site services to residents, including support groups, \nexercise programs and a before and after school program. This program \nis serving as a model to other communities that are hoping to create \nsuch an environment for their intergenerational families. There are \nmany localities that have begun the process of implementing programs \nlike the Grandfamilies House in: Baltimore, MD; Buffalo, NY; Chicago, \nIL, Detroit, MI, Nashville, TN; New York City, NY; Cleveland, OH and \nPhiladelphia, PA.\n  This bill would allow these programs to grow and prosper as well as \nencouraging other public and private partners to engage in developing \nthese types of programs. Specifically, this bill authorizes the \nSecretary of the Housing and Urban Development to provide grants under \na demonstration program that would be targeted toward meeting the \nhousing and service needs of grandparent headed households. \nFurthermore, it clarifies key sections of federal housing law to ensure \nthat grandparents raising grandchildren are able to access the federal \nassistance provided under federal housing programs. Finally, it directs \nthe Secretary of HUD to provide specialized training to HUD personnel \nfocused on grandparent-headed and relative-headed families.\n  With 4 million children living solely with grandparents or other \nrelatives, safe and affordable housing for these families is a concern \nthat must be addressed. This is a simple and cost efficient way to \nbegin to address this important question. I would like to thank my \ncolleagues, Senator DeWine and Senator Stabenow, for their support of \nthis legislation. I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this \nbill and hope that it will become law this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5055-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5055-S5056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 281--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING AUGUST 25, 2002, \n      AS ``NATIONAL FRAUD AGAINST SENIOR CITIZENS AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \nBayh, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Specter, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Inouye, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \nHagel, Mr. Craig, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Campbell) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 281\n\n       Whereas perpetrators of mail, telemarketing, and Internet \n     fraud frequently target their schemes at senior citizens \n     because seniors are often vulnerable and trusting people;\n       Whereas, as victims of such schemes, many senior citizens \n     have been robbed of their hard-earned life savings and \n     frequently pay an emotional cost, losing not only their \n     money, but also their self-respect and dignity;\n       Whereas perpetrators of fraudulent schemes against American \n     seniors often operate outside the United States, reaching \n     their victims through the mail, telephone lines, and the \n     Internet;\n       Whereas the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act \n     increased the power of the United States Postal Service to \n     protect consumers against those who use deceptive mailings \n     featuring games of chance, sweepstakes, skill contests, and \n     facsimile checks;\n       Whereas the Postal Inspection Service responded to 66,000 \n     mail fraud complaints, arrested 1,691 mail fraud offenders, \n     convicted 1,477 such offenders, and initiated 642 civil or \n     administrative actions in fiscal year 2001;\n       Whereas mail fraud investigations by the Postal Inspection \n     Service in fiscal year 2001 resulted in over $1,200,000,000 \n     in court-ordered and voluntary restitution payments;\n       Whereas the Postal Inspection Service, in an effort to curb \n     cross-border fraud, is involved in 3 major fraud task forces \n     with law enforcement officials in Canada, namely, Project \n     Colt in Montreal, The Strategic Partnership in Toronto, and \n     Project Emptor in Vancouver;\n       Whereas consumer awareness is the best protection from \n     fraudulent schemes; and\n       Whereas it is vital to increase public awareness of the \n     enormous impact that fraud has on senior citizens in the \n     United States, and to educate the public, senior citizens, \n     their families, and their caregivers about the signs of \n     fraudulent activities and how to report suspected fraudulent \n     activities to the appropriate authorities: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning August 25, 2002, as \n     ``National Fraud Against Senior Citizens Awareness Week''; \n     and\n       (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the United States to observe the week with \n     appropriate activities and programs to--\n       (A) prevent the purveyors of fraud from victimizing senior \n     citizens in the United States; and\n       (B) educate and inform the public, senior citizens, their \n     families, and their caregivers about fraud perpetrated \n     through mail, telemarketing, and the Internet.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ndesignating the week beginning August 25, 2002, as ``National Fraud \nAgainst Senior Citizens Awareness Week.'' This legislation will bring \nincreased awareness to mail, Internet and telemarketing schemes that \nfrequently target elderly Americans. These schemes rob America's \nseniors not only of their hard-earned savings, but also of their self \nrespect and dignity. Recognizing that increased awareness, especially \non the part of seniors, their families and caregivers, is the best \ndefense, this resolution highlights the efforts being made to protect \nour nation's elderly.\n  Last June, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held two days \nof hearings that focused on the growing problem of Internet, mail and \ntelemarketing fraud. The Subcommittee found that in this age of \ninternational communications, foreign countries have unfortunately \nbecome a major point of origin for lottery, sweepstakes, and advance-\nfee-for-loan scams that prey upon Americans through telemarketing. \nWorse yet, the Subcommittee found that such schemes often specifically \ntarget the elderly, who are often the most vulnerable and least able to \nafford being defrauded.\n  Last year, alone, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, USPIS, \nresponded to 66,000 mail fraud complaints, arrested nearly 1700 mail \nfraud offenders, and convicted nearly 1500 such offenders. Moreover, \nmail fraud investigations resulted in over $1.2 billion in court-\nordered restitution and voluntary restitution payments.\n  The USPIS has joined with the Senior Action Coalition, a grassroots \nmulti-agency organization, to develop a national multi-media fraud \nprevention campaign. The campaign will include public service \nannouncements as well as newspaper advertisements, mailing inserts and \nposter displays. Designating National Fraud Against Senior Citizen \nAwareness Week will highlight these efforts and help reach a wide \nsegment of the elderly population and those who care for them.\n  I would like to thank Senator Susan Collins for cosponsoring this \nlegislation as well as all of the other original cosponsors. I hope the \nrest of my colleagues will consider cosponsoring this resolution and \nthat we can enact it well before the August recess so we can \ncommemorate the week for the first time this year.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I join Senator Levin in submitting a \nresolution that will designate the week of August 25, 2002, as National \nFraud Against Senior Citizens Awareness Week. This designation of this \nweek will increase public awareness of mail, Internet and telemarketing \nschemes that target elderly Americans. It is through increased \nawareness on the part of seniors, their families, and their caregivers \nthat such schemes, which rob seniors not only of their hard-earned \nsavings but of their dignity and self respect, can best be prevented.\n  This kind of fraud, unfortunately, is pervasive. Last year alone, the \nU.S. Postal Inspection Service responded to 66,000 mail fraud \ncomplaints, arrested nearly 1,700 mail fraud offenders, and secured \nnearly 1,500 convictions.\n  The elderly are often especially vulnerable, and they are frequently \namong the least able to afford being defrauded. The AARP, the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, and the Federal Trade Commission have \nestimated that 85 percent of the victims of telemarketing fraud are age \n65 or older.\n\n[[Page S5056]]\n\nDuring hearings of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that I \nchaired last June on mail, Internet and telemarketing fraud, several \nelderly witnesses testified about how they had been defrauded of \nthousands of dollars and the resulting hardships caused by the loss of \ntheir life savings.\n  Mrs. Ann Hersom of Acton, for example, testified that her 80-year-old \nhusband, formerly a successful businessman, had fallen prey to devious \ntelemarketers and clever mail solicitations. She estimated that he lost \n$20,000 to these schemes, and described how devastating these losses \nhad been to their family.\n  The telemarketing fraud industry is a highly mobile, sophisticated \nracket that very often involves ``boiler rooms'' in which hundreds of \npeople make high pressure calls, sometimes 16 hours a day, seven days a \nweek. These fraudulent telemarketers often gear their pitches to \nelderly citizens living alone and fearful of not having sufficient \nfunds for their remaining years. In fact, it appears that some \nunscrupulous telemarketers may select their elderly victims by using \nlists to target those who have recently placed a spouse in a nursing \nhome. Thus, the friendship and compassion these telemarketers appear to \noffer come when the elderly are particularly vulnerable to such \nenticements.\n  Foreign countries have unfortunately become a source of entry for \nlottery, sweepstakes and advance-fee-for-loan scams that prey upon \nAmericans through direct mail and telemarketing. According to Federal \nTrade Commission figures, U.S. consumers filed nearly 13,000 complaints \nagainst foreign companies during calendar year 2001. Similarly, the \ndollar value of losses reported by consumers against these companies is \nnearly $25 million. In the first quarter of 2002, U.S. consumers have \nfiled nearly 7,000 complaints against foreign companies.\n  How do we fight such fraud? The first line of defense against mail, \nInternet and telemarketing fraud is to promote public awareness of the \ndangers of such crimes, the types of schemes in which criminals are \nlikely to engage, and what consumers can do to report fraudulent \novertures and help law enforcement officials catch up with the con \nartists.\n  National Fraud Against Senior Citizens Week is designed to do just \nthat. During the week of August 25, 2002, the U.S. Postal Inspection \nService, together with the Senior Action Coalition, a grassroots multi-\nagency organization based in Pittsburgh, will launch a national multi-\nmedia fraud prevention campaign. The campaign will be kicked off with \nevents in Washington, DC, Maine, and elsewhere.\n  The campaign will include radio and television public service \nannouncements by national spokesperson Betty White. On Sunday, August \n25, announcements in newspapers will run in the 13 states that recorded \nthe most complaints of fraud by seniors, including Maine. Poster \ndisplays highlighting the problem and what seniors and their caregivers \ncan do to protect themselves and report fraud will be displayed in post \noffice lobbies and other public areas, and mailers are planned to be \nsent to seniors. Designating National Fraud Against Senior Citizens \nAwareness Week will help reach a wide segment of America's elderly and \nthose who care for them with the time-honored advice of: ``If it sounds \ntoo good to be true, it probably is too good to be true.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/05/senate-section/article/S5056-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5056-S5059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3580.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``American Servicemembers' \n     Protection Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 3002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 17, 1998, the United Nations Diplomatic \n     Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an \n     International Criminal Court, meeting in Rome, Italy, adopted \n     the ``Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court''. The \n     vote on whether to proceed with the statute was 120 in favor \n     to 7 against, with 21 countries abstaining. The United States \n     voted against final adoption of the Rome Statute.\n       (2) As of April 30, 2001, 139 countries had signed the Rome \n     Statute and 30 had ratified it. Pursuant to Article 126 of \n     the Rome Statute, the statute will enter into force on the \n     first day of the month after the 60th day following the date \n     on which the 60th country deposits an instrument ratifying \n     the statute.\n\n[[Page S5066]]\n\n       (3) Since adoption of the Rome Statute, a Preparatory \n     Commission for the International Criminal Court has met \n     regularly to draft documents to implement the Rome Statute, \n     including Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Elements of \n     Crimes, and a definition of the Crime of Aggression.\n       (4) During testimony before the Congress following the \n     adoption of the Rome Statute, the lead United States \n     negotiator, Ambassador David Scheffer stated that the United \n     States could not sign the Rome Statute because certain \n     critical negotiating objectives of the United States had not \n     been achieved. As a result, he stated: ``We are left with \n     consequences that do not serve the cause of international \n     justice.''\n       (5) Ambassador Scheffer went on to tell the Congress that: \n     ``Multinational peacekeeping forces operating in a country \n     that has joined the treaty can be exposed to the Court's \n     jurisdiction even if the country of the individual \n     peacekeeper has not joined the treaty. Thus, the treaty \n     purports to establish an arrangement whereby United States \n     armed forces operating overseas could be conceivably \n     prosecuted by the international court even if the United \n     States has not agreed to be bound by the treaty. Not only is \n     this contrary to the most fundamental principles of treaty \n     law, it could inhibit the ability of the United States to use \n     its military to meet alliance obligations and participate in \n     multinational operations, including humanitarian \n     interventions to save civilian lives. Other contributors to \n     peacekeeping operations will be similarly exposed.''.\n       (6) Notwithstanding these concerns, President Clinton \n     directed that the United States sign the Rome Statute on \n     December 31, 2000. In a statement issued that day, he stated \n     that in view of the unremedied deficiencies of the Rome \n     Statute, ``I will not, and do not recommend that my successor \n     submit the Treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until \n     our fundamental concerns are satisfied''.\n       (7) Any American prosecuted by the International Criminal \n     Court will, under the Rome Statute, be denied procedural \n     protections to which all Americans are entitled under the \n     Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution, such as the \n     right to trial by jury.\n       (8) Members of the Armed Forces of the United States should \n     be free from the risk of prosecution by the International \n     Criminal Court, especially when they are stationed or \n     deployed around the world to protect the vital national \n     interests of the United States. The United States Government \n     has an obligation to protect the members of its Armed Forces, \n     to the maximum extent possible, against criminal prosecutions \n     carried out by the International Criminal Court.\n       (9) In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States to the risk of international criminal \n     prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the \n     President and other senior elected and appointed officials of \n     the United States Government may be prosecuted by the \n     International Criminal Court. Particularly if the Preparatory \n     Commission agrees on a definition of the Crime of Aggression \n     over United States objections, senior United States officials \n     may be at risk of criminal prosecution for national security \n     decisions involving such matters as responding to acts of \n     terrorism, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, and deterring aggression. No less than members \n     of the Armed Forces of the United States, senior officials of \n     the United States Government should be free from the risk of \n     prosecution by the International Criminal Court, especially \n     with respect to official actions taken by them to protect the \n     national interests of the United States.\n       (10) Any agreement within the Preparatory Commission on a \n     definition of the Crime of Aggression that usurps the \n     prerogative of the United Nations Security Council under \n     Article 39 of the charter of the United Nations to \n     ``determine the existence of any . . . . act of aggression'' \n     would contravene the charter of the United Nations and \n     undermine deterrence.\n       (11) It is a fundamental principle of international law \n     that a treaty is binding upon its parties only and that it \n     does not create obligations for nonparties without their \n     consent to be bound. The United States is not a party to the \n     Rome Statute and will not be bound by any of its terms. The \n     United States will not recognize the jurisdiction of the \n     International Criminal Court over United States nationals.\n\n     SEC. 3003.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ESTIMATES OF THE COST \n                   OF SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Small businesses play a critical role in our Nation and \n     our economy, and the Federal Government assists that role by \n     providing small businesses with loans and loan guarantees.\n       (2) Since the enactment of the Federal Credit Reform Act of \n     1990, the Small Business Administration and Office of \n     Management and Budget have repeatedly reestimated downward \n     the subsidy cost for the Small Business Administration's 7(a) \n     and 504 credit programs. For the 7(a) program alone, SBA and \n     OMB have reestimated more than $1,000,000,000 in subsidy \n     costs.\n       (3) These overestimates have resulted in borrowers and \n     lenders in both programs having to pay higher than necessary \n     fees to participate in the programs.\n       (4) In addition, these overestimates have diverted more \n     than $1,000,000,000 in resources from other discretionary \n     programs.\n       (5) In its 2003 budget, the Administration expects to \n     further revise downward in fiscal year 2002 the estimated \n     cost of small business loan programs.\n       (6) The Administration has begun working on substantially \n     revising its model for the section 7(a) program, but was \n     unable to complete its work in time for the 2003 budget.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the performance of the SBA and OMB in administering the \n     Federal Credit Reform Act for small business credit programs \n     has been unsatisfactory;\n       (2) the Administration should expeditiously complete its \n     work on the new model for the section 7(a) program and share \n     the results of that work with the Budget and Small Business \n     Committees by no later than this August;\n       (3) the Administration should immediately begin work on \n     similarly improving its subsidy model for the section 504 \n     program; and\n       (4) the Administration should work with Congress to ensure \n     that adequate funding is provided in fiscal year 2003 for \n     small business credit programs.\n\n     SEC. 302. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FEDERAL EMPLOYEE PAY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Members of the uniformed services and civilian \n     employees of the United States make significant contributions \n     to the general welfare of the Nation.\n       (2) Increases in the pay of members of the uniformed \n     services and of civilian employees of the United States have \n     not kept pace with increases in the overall pay levels of \n     workers in the private sector, so that there now exists--\n       (A) a 32 percent gap between compensation levels of Federal \n     civilian employees and compensation levels of private sector \n     workers; and\n       (B) an estimated 10 percent gap between compensation levels \n     of members of the uniformed services and compensation levels \n     of private sector workers.\n       (3) The President's budget proposal for fiscal year 2003 \n     includes a 4.1 percent pay raise for military personnel.\n       (4) The Office of Management and Budget has requested that \n     Federal agencies plan their fiscal year 2003 budgets with a \n     2.6 percent pay raise for civilian Federal employees.\n       (5) In almost every year during the past 2 decades, there \n     have been equal adjustments in the compensation of members of \n     the uniformed services and the compensation of civilian \n     employees of the United States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that there should continue to be parity between the \n     adjustments in the compensation of members of the uniformed \n     services and the adjustments in the compensation of civilian \n     employees of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 303. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MENTAL HEALTH PARITY.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that in providing for mental \n     health parity--\n       (1) nothing in this budget resolution shall be construed to \n     alter or amend title II of the Social Security Act (or any \n     regulation promulgated under that Act);\n       (2) the Secretary of the Treasury will annually estimate \n     the impact of enactment of such a policy on the income and \n     balances of the trust funds established under section 201 of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401); and\n       (3) that if the Secretary of the Treasury estimates that \n     the enactment of mental health parity has a negative impact \n     on the income and balances of the trust funds established \n     under section 201 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401), \n     the Secretary shall transfer, not less frequently than \n     quarterly, from the general revenues of the Federal \n     Government an amount sufficient so as to ensure that the \n     income and balances of such trust funds are not reduced as a \n     result of this policy.\n\n     SEC. 304. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MEDICAID COMMISSION.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that Congress should \n     establish a National Commission on Medicaid and State-Based \n     Health Care Reform to study and make recommendations to \n     Congress, the President, and the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services with respect to the program under title XIX of \n     the Social Security Act.\n\n     SEC. 305. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PILT FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) if certain Federal lands are not to become part of the \n     local tax base, then compensation should be offered to local \n     governments to make up for the presence of non-taxable land \n     within their jurisdictions;\n       (2) PILT funds are critical to the budget of local \n     governments, which supply many valuable local social \n     services, such as law enforcement, road maintenance and \n     firefighting, as well as services for adjacent Federal lands \n     such as search and rescue operations;\n       (3) the Administration has proposed funding PILT at \n     $165,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, which is 22 percent less \n     than the current funding level--of $325,000,000; and\n       (4) many counties with high percentages of Federal land \n     ownership that rely on PILT payments have higher than average \n     unemployment and poverty.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that within the discretionary allocation provided to the \n     Committee on Appropriations that the Payment in Lieu of Taxes \n     program should be fully funded.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 3685.

A committee \n     to which an implementation bill is referred under this \n     paragraph may report such bill to the respective House \n     without amendment.\n       (3) Report or discharge.--If a committee to which an \n     implementation bill is referred has not reported such bill by \n     the end of the 15th calendar day after the date of the \n     introduction of such bill, such committee shall be \n     immediately discharged from further consideration of such \n     bill, and upon being reported or discharged from the \n     committee, such bill shall be placed on the appropriate \n     calendar.\n       (c) Floor Consideration.--\n       (1) In general.--When the committee to which an \n     implementation bill is referred has reported, or has been \n     discharged under subsection (b)(3), it is at any time \n     thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the \n     same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the \n     respective House to move to proceed to the consideration of \n     the implementation bill, and all points of order against the \n     implementation bill (and against consideration of the \n     implementation bill) are waived. The motion is highly \n     privileged in the House of Representatives and is privileged \n     in the Senate and is not debatable. The motion is not subject \n     to amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to \n     proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to \n     reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or \n     disagreed to shall not be in order.

A motion further to limit debate is in order and \n     not debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or a \n     motion to proceed to the consideration of other business, or \n     a motion to recommit the implementation bill is not in order. \n     A motion to reconsider the vote by which the implementation \n     bill is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order.\n       (4) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on an implementation bill, and a \n     single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if \n     requested in accordance with the rules of the appropriate \n     House, the vote on final passage of the implementation bill \n     shall occur.\n       (5) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the \n     decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the \n     rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the \n     case may be, to the procedure relating to an implementation \n     bill shall be decided without debate.\n       (d) Coordination With Action by Other House.--If, before \n     the passage by 1 House of an implementation bill of that \n     House, that House receives from the other House an \n     implementation bill, then the following procedures shall \n     apply:\n       (1) Nonreferral.--The implementation bill of the other \n     House shall not be referred to a committee.\n       (2) Vote on bill of other house.--With respect to an \n     implementation bill of the House receiving the implementation \n     bill--\n       (A) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     implementation bill had been received from the other House; \n     but\n       (B) the vote on final passage shall be on the \n     implementation bill of the other House.\n       (e) Rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives.--\n     This section is enacted by Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is \n     deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of an implementation bill described \n     in subsection (a), and it supersedes other rules only to the\n\n[[Page S5093]]\n\n     extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n\n     SEC. ____08.

EDUCATION FIRST.\n\n       (a) Statement of Purpose; Findings.--\n       (1) Statement of purpose.--It is the purpose of this \n     section to dedicate a portion of unexpected, additional \n     Federal resources to--\n       (A) assist disadvantaged children, teachers, and schools in \n     meeting the additional academic challenges posed in the No \n     Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-110);\n       (B) provide for full funding of Federal financial \n     commitment to children with disabilities and local \n     communities as identified in the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.);\n       (C) ensure that every student with the talent, desire, and \n     drive to pursue postsecondary training at a school of their \n     choice is not inhibited by family financial need; and\n       (D) grow to 10 percent over time, the share of the Federal \n     discretionary budget dedicated toward education.\n       (2) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (A) In fiscal year 2003, funding for the No Child Left \n     Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-110) is authorized at \n     $31,100,000,000. In fiscal year 2002, the No Child Left \n     Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-110) was funded at \n     $22,200,000,000. The Budget of the United States Government \n     for Fiscal Year 2003, as submitted to Congress, proposes to \n     fund the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-\n     110) at $22,100,000,000.\n       (B) In 1975, the Federal Government promised to contribute \n     to local communities 40 percent of the additional costs \n     necessary to ensure that each child with a disability \n     receives the free and appropriate public education to which \n     they are entitled. The Budget of the United States Government \n     for Fiscal Year 2003, as submitted to Congress, proposes that \n     the Federal Government contribute only 17 percent of the \n     additional costs associated with educating each child with a \n     disability.\n       (C) The size of the maximum Federal Pell Grant is \n     authorized to be $5,800, but because\n\n[[Page S5097]]\n\n     of insufficient funding, in fiscal year 2002, the maximum \n     Federal Pell Grant was only $4,000.\n       (D) In fiscal year 1946, the share of the Federal budget \n     dedicated to education was 10.4 percent. In fiscal year 2002, \n     the share of the Federal budget dedicated to education was \n     2.5 percent.

Ms. SNOWE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nher to the bill H.R. 4775, making supplemental appropriations for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and for other purposes; which \nwas ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       On page 69, after line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 605. ____________.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Despite the removal of the Taliban from power, Afghan \n     women continue to experience a violation of their human \n     rights, generally outside of Kabul where warlords are \n     reexerting control.\n       (2) Strong and continued United States support can ensure \n     that the advances made by Afghan women since the fall of the \n     Taliban will continue and grow, rather than recede.\n       (3) The United States has made a substantial contribution \n     to the emergency relief and humanitarian efforts for \n     Afghanistan. Completing the United States mission in \n     Afghanistan will also require significant and long-term \n     investments in development and reconstruction assistance.\n       (4) The maternal mortality rate in Afghanistan is one of \n     the highest in the world, with recent reports estimating that \n     every 30 minutes an Afghan woman dies (about 15,000 women \n     every year) of pregnancy-related causes. The estimated \n     maternal mortality rate of 1,700 deaths per 100,000 live \n     births can be significantly and rapidly reduced through \n     access to primary health care services, including safe \n     birthing supplies, emergency obstetric care, prenatal and \n     postnatal care, contraception, and prevention and treatment \n     for the effects of sexual coercion and rape.\n       (5) Women make up 75 percent or more of the refugees and \n     internally displaced in camps, urban areas, and villages.\n       (6) Eighty-five percent of Afghanistan's population lives \n     in rural areas. The women in rural areas perform vital roles \n     in food production, processing, and preparation. Successful \n     reconstruction and development assistance must target rural \n     women as part of any agricultural intervention.\n       (7) Within Afghanistan and outside of Afghanistan, local \n     women's organizations are delivering critical services and \n     have the knowledge and experience to assist the United States \n     in delivering effective relief aid.\n       (8) The Afghan Ministry for Women's Affairs is an important \n     new ministry that is essential for reestablishing women's \n     human rights, ensuring that women are included in all \n     development efforts, and delivering critical legal, health, \n     education, and economic services to women throughout \n     Afghanistan's 30 provinces.\n       (9) Afghan women are taking the initiative to reach across \n     the conflict divide and foster peace. Women's perspectives \n     and experiences in seeking solutions to conflicts are \n     necessary to ensure lasting peace.\n       (10) Adequate security in both urban and rural areas is \n     essential if women and girls are to exercise their human \n     rights, work, attend school, and otherwise participate in and \n     benefit from humanitarian and development programs sponsored \n     by the United States.\n       (b) Allocation of Funds.--Of the amounts appropriated by \n     this chapter under the heading ``Bilateral Economic \n     Assistance'', funds should be used for, but not limited to, \n     the following:\n       (1) Financial and programmatic support of Afghan women's \n     organizations operating in the United States, Pakistan, and \n     Afghanistan to deliver services to women, lead reconstruction \n     efforts, and build the capacities of nascent nongovernmental \n     organizations.\n       (2) An increase in women's access to and ownership of \n     productive assets such as land, water, agricultural inputs, \n     microfinance, and property.\n       (3) A provision of financial assistance to build health \n     infrastructure and to deliver women-centered health programs, \n     particularly maternal, reproductive, and mental health care;\n       (4) The maintenance of a strong financial commitment to \n     developing the education and training systems of Afghanistan.\n       (5) The ensurance that female refugees and internally \n     displaced persons can return to their homes voluntarily, \n     safely, and with the protection for their human rights.\n       (6) Combating and preventing trafficking in persons and \n     assisting victims.\n       (7) Emphasizing the importance of upholding human rights \n     and women's rights in particular, in training for the Afghan \n     army and police force.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 3737.
